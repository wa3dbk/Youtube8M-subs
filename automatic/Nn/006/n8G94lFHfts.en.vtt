00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
yellow but yeah I honestly don't think

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.580 
yellow but yeah I honestly don't think
it<00:00:51.360> makes<00:00:51.510> sense<00:00:51.600> for<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.079> few<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.350> them<00:00:52.469> to

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
it makes sense for just a few of them to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.319 
it makes sense for just a few of them to
get<00:00:52.710> mega<00:00:52.860> evolutions<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.000> want<00:00:54.180> all<00:00:54.300> of

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
get mega evolutions so I want all of

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.150 
get mega evolutions so I want all of
them<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:54.960> including<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.559> generation

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
them to get one including the generation

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.010 
them to get one including the generation
6<00:00:56.399> orders<00:00:56.699> final<00:00:56.940> evolution<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.420> well<00:00:57.449> which

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
6 orders final evolution as well which

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.660 
6 orders final evolution as well which
haven't<00:00:58.320> been<00:00:58.379> revealed<00:00:58.770> yet<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.190> think<00:00:59.550> it's

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
haven't been revealed yet I think it's

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.760 
haven't been revealed yet I think it's
just<00:00:59.730> my<00:00:59.879> OCD<00:01:00.180> talking<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.530> wouldn't

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
just my OCD talking here but I wouldn't

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.229 
just my OCD talking here but I wouldn't
be<00:01:01.829> too<00:01:01.980> upset<00:01:02.010> didn't<00:01:02.609> get<00:01:02.789> one<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.000> course

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
be too upset didn't get one of course

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.329 
be too upset didn't get one of course
that's<00:01:04.199> why<00:01:04.320> they're<00:01:04.500> last<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> list

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
that's why they're last in the list

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.640 
that's why they're last in the list
I<00:01:05.430> honestly<00:01:05.820> can't<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> happening<00:01:09.650> number

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
I honestly can't see it happening number

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.109 
I honestly can't see it happening number
four<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.920> my<00:01:11.040> list<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.430> far-fetched

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
evolution but if Aizen gonna be possible

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.880 
evolution but if Aizen gonna be possible
I<00:01:15.600> would<00:01:15.750> definitely<00:01:15.990> sell<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> mega

actually good but when you take a look

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.130 
actually good but when you take a look
at<00:01:31.619> his<00:01:31.740> stats<00:01:32.009> they're<00:01:32.909> horrible<00:01:33.420> that's<00:01:33.930> all

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
at his stats they're horrible that's all

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.910 
at his stats they're horrible that's all
of<00:01:34.170> those<00:01:34.380> stats

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
of those stats

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.109 
of those stats
I<00:01:35.009> think<00:01:35.220> his<00:01:35.310> design<00:01:35.640> has<00:01:35.820> room<00:01:36.090> for

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
I think his design has room for

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.359 
I think his design has room for
improvement<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.930> use<00:01:37.530> an<00:01:37.740> example<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
improvement to use an example of a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.340 
improvement to use an example of a
well-designed<00:01:38.820> Farfetch'd<00:01:39.509> mega<00:01:39.750> evolution

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
well-designed Farfetch'd mega evolution

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.440 
well-designed Farfetch'd mega evolution
hasn't<00:01:40.860> changed<00:01:41.280> much<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.640> definitely<00:01:42.210> use

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
hasn't changed much but I definitely use

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.969 
hasn't changed much but I definitely use
that<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.810> my<00:01:42.930> team<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.439> looks<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.770> lot<00:01:43.920> more

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
that on my team it looks a lot more

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.410 
that on my team it looks a lot more
powerful<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.850> that's<00:01:45.030> what<00:01:45.149> I've<00:01:45.240> always

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
powerful and that's what I've always

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.120 
powerful and that's what I've always
wanted<00:01:45.689> for<00:01:46.049> far-fetched

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.530 

number<00:01:51.130> three<00:01:51.340> on<00:01:51.370> my<00:01:51.430> list<00:01:51.550> is<00:01:51.820> kecleon<00:01:52.240> I

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
number three on my list is kecleon I

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.700 
number three on my list is kecleon I
always<00:01:52.840> thought<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.080> was<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.200> really<00:01:53.440> cool

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
always thought it was a really cool

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.500 
always thought it was a really cool
Pokemon<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:54.430> honestly<00:01:54.880> feel<00:01:55.120> as<00:01:55.180> if<00:01:55.360> he's

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
Pokemon I honestly feel as if he's

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.300 
Pokemon I honestly feel as if he's
forgotten<00:01:55.900> about<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.170> lot<00:01:56.380> of<00:01:56.410> people<00:01:56.800> I<00:01:57.010> mean

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
forgotten about a lot of people I mean

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.770 
forgotten about a lot of people I mean
he's<00:01:57.430> obviously<00:01:57.580> something<00:01:58.180> special<00:01:58.570> if<00:01:58.660> he

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
he's obviously something special if he

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.540 
he's obviously something special if he
has<00:01:58.900> his<00:01:59.080> very<00:01:59.290> own<00:01:59.380> ability<00:01:59.950> made<00:02:00.160> for<00:02:00.400> him

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
has his very own ability made for him

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.430 
has his very own ability made for him
and<00:02:00.730> no<00:02:00.880> other<00:02:01.030> Pokemon<00:02:01.630> but<00:02:02.080> that<00:02:02.290> of<00:02:02.380> course

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
and no other Pokemon but that of course

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.560 
and no other Pokemon but that of course
is<00:02:02.800> ruined<00:02:03.070> by<00:02:03.160> his<00:02:03.280> stats<00:02:03.550> they<00:02:04.180> are<00:02:04.330> pretty

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
is ruined by his stats they are pretty

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.360 
is ruined by his stats they are pretty
bad<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.080> I<00:02:05.230> feel<00:02:05.410> as<00:02:05.500> if<00:02:05.620> he'd<00:02:05.770> be<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:05.920> lot<00:02:06.190> more

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
bad and I feel as if he'd be a lot more

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.650 
bad and I feel as if he'd be a lot more
interesting<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:06.940> use<00:02:07.090> if<00:02:07.210> you<00:02:07.270> had<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.420> mega

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
interesting to use if you had a mega

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.420 
interesting to use if you had a mega
evolution<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.410> they<00:02:08.830> would<00:02:08.920> also<00:02:09.070> give

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
evolution and they would also give

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.190 
evolution and they would also give
Pokemon<00:02:09.850> a<00:02:09.880> chance<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.330> revamp<00:02:10.660> his<00:02:10.869> design

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.310 
love this fan out of a cat gun evolution
it<00:02:15.760> does<00:02:15.970> look<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.240> bit<00:02:16.270> more<00:02:16.540> buff<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:16.960> bulkier

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
it does look a bit more buff and bulkier

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.410 
it does look a bit more buff and bulkier

evolve number two in my list is
Dunsparce<00:02:25.960> I<00:02:26.500> wanted<00:02:27.040> him<00:02:27.220> like<00:02:27.490> far<00:02:27.760> fetched

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
Dunsparce I wanted him like far fetched

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.180 
Dunsparce I wanted him like far fetched
to<00:02:28.240> get<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.450> regular<00:02:28.900> evolution<00:02:29.560> but<00:02:29.950> that's

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
to get a regular evolution but that's

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.810 
to get a regular evolution but that's
impossible

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
impossible

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.060 
impossible

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
again I would gladly sell for a mega

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.770 
again I would gladly sell for a mega
evolution<00:02:33.160> even<00:02:33.820> though<00:02:34.210> I'm<00:02:34.480> not<00:02:34.720> the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
evolution even though I'm not the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.420 
evolution even though I'm not the
biggest<00:02:35.080> fan<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.500> them<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.890> reason<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.220> want

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
biggest fan of them the reason I want

this<00:02:36.520> thing<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.880> mega<00:02:37.150> evolve<00:02:37.270> is<00:02:37.870> because<00:02:38.230> it

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
this thing to mega evolve is because it

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.050 
this thing to mega evolve is because it
has<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:38.740> much<00:02:38.830> potential<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.430> be<00:02:39.640> this<00:02:39.820> really

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
has so much potential to be this really

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.150 
has so much potential to be this really
cool-looking<00:02:40.420> Pokemon<00:02:41.200> plus<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:41.860> fact<00:02:42.070> that

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
cool-looking Pokemon plus the fact that

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.310 
cool-looking Pokemon plus the fact that
it<00:02:42.310> starts<00:02:42.670> on<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.820> world's<00:02:43.180> greatest<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:44.020> just

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
it starts on the world's greatest I just

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.470 
it starts on the world's greatest I just
really<00:02:44.530> want<00:02:44.710> something<00:02:45.070> like<00:02:45.250> this<00:02:45.490> honestly

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
really want something like this honestly

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.240 
really want something like this honestly
I<00:02:46.690> don't<00:02:46.840> think<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.560> would<00:02:47.650> see<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:47.980> from<00:02:48.190> a

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
I don't think you would see that from a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.130 
I don't think you would see that from a
mega<00:02:48.430> evolution<00:02:48.550> maybe<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.450> more<00:02:49.660> of<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.810> normal

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
mega evolution maybe a more of a normal

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.350 
mega evolution maybe a more of a normal
evolution<00:02:50.440> but<00:02:51.040> not<00:02:51.490> mega<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:52.150> it<00:02:52.239> probably

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
evolution but not mega so it probably

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.729 
evolution but not mega so it probably
gets<00:02:52.570> something<00:02:52.810> more<00:02:53.080> along<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.410> lines<00:02:53.620> of

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
gets something more along the lines of

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.310 
gets something more along the lines of
this<00:02:54.040> which<00:02:54.580> is<00:02:54.610> fine<00:02:54.760> as<00:02:55.239> long<00:02:55.570> as<00:02:55.810> it's<00:02:56.230> made

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
this which is fine as long as it's made

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.170 
this which is fine as long as it's made
stronger<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:57.100> maybe<00:02:57.310> giving<00:02:57.520> a<00:02:57.670> new<00:02:57.790> typing

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
cafeterias I only really want him to

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.660 
cafeterias I only really want him to
have<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.290> mega<00:03:08.470> evolution<00:03:09.010> because<00:03:09.370> of<00:03:09.550> this

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
have a mega evolution because of this

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.970 
have a mega evolution because of this
image<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.090> saw<00:03:10.270> in<00:03:10.390> deviantART<00:03:10.989> it's<00:03:11.590> an<00:03:11.739> image

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
image I saw in deviantART it's an image

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.590 
image I saw in deviantART it's an image
of<00:03:12.160> what<00:03:12.310> Mega<00:03:12.489> Cab<00:03:12.730> Franc<00:03:12.850> niggas<00:03:13.209> could<00:03:13.450> look

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
of what Mega Cab Franc niggas could look

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.420 
of what Mega Cab Franc niggas could look
like<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:14.140> honestly<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:14.890> thought<00:03:15.160> it<00:03:15.250> was<00:03:15.340> the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
like and honestly I thought it was the

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.040 
like and honestly I thought it was the
best<00:03:15.610> idea<00:03:16.030> in<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.180> world<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.630> Frog<00:03:16.810> again

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
best idea in the world the Frog again

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.540 
best idea in the world the Frog again
says<00:03:17.230> mega<00:03:17.380> evolution<00:03:17.950> is<00:03:18.070> pretty<00:03:18.250> much<00:03:18.340> just

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
says mega evolution is pretty much just

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.310 
says mega evolution is pretty much just
him<00:03:18.730> coming<00:03:19.030> up<00:03:19.150> his<00:03:19.269> coughing<00:03:19.690> it<00:03:19.870> reminded

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
him coming up his coughing it reminded

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.140 
him coming up his coughing it reminded
me<00:03:20.380> of<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.620> baby<00:03:20.800> Kangaskhan<00:03:21.400> thing<00:03:21.730> where

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
me of the baby Kangaskhan thing where

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.030 
me of the baby Kangaskhan thing where
the<00:03:22.269> baby<00:03:22.510> comes<00:03:22.720> out<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:22.989> its<00:03:23.110> pouch<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.680> I

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
the baby comes out of its pouch and I

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.199 
the baby comes out of its pouch and I
know<00:03:24.100> a<00:03:24.190> lot<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.459> people<00:03:24.700> aren't<00:03:24.820> really<00:03:24.970> too

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
know a lot of people aren't really too

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.000 
know a lot of people aren't really too
satisfied<00:03:25.450> with<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:25.930> mega<00:03:26.110> evolution<00:03:26.650> but

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
satisfied with that mega evolution but

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.830 
satisfied with that mega evolution but
just<00:03:27.220> think<00:03:27.400> about<00:03:27.519> what<00:03:27.760> Pokemon<00:03:28.180> could<00:03:28.360> do<00:03:28.570> I

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
just think about what Pokemon could do I

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.540 
just think about what Pokemon could do I
could<00:03:28.870> make<00:03:29.230> parts<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.739> Pokemon<00:03:30.130> usable

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
could make parts of the Pokemon usable

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.310 
could make parts of the Pokemon usable
that<00:03:30.670> weren't<00:03:30.880> usable<00:03:31.239> before<00:03:31.570> take<00:03:31.959> crystal

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
that weren't usable before take crystal

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.080 
that weren't usable before take crystal
for<00:03:32.440> example<00:03:32.890> crustle<00:03:33.670> could<00:03:33.820> mega<00:03:33.940> evolve

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
for example crustle could mega evolve

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.790 
for example crustle could mega evolve
and<00:03:34.600> Lucy's<00:03:34.930> shell<00:03:35.170> making<00:03:35.470> him<00:03:35.590> less

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
and Lucy's shell making him less

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.470 
and Lucy's shell making him less
defensive<00:03:36.310> but<00:03:36.459> more<00:03:36.580> offensive<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:37.209> maybe<00:03:37.390> a

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
defensive but more offensive and maybe a

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.330 
defensive but more offensive and maybe a
bit<00:03:37.660> faster<00:03:38.080> well<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.650> best<00:03:38.860> idea<00:03:39.160> in<00:03:39.280> the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
bit faster well the best idea in the

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.979 
bit faster well the best idea in the
world<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.790> know<00:03:39.850> but<00:03:40.570> it's<00:03:40.690> just<00:03:40.750> an<00:03:40.930> example

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
world I know but it's just an example

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.960 
world I know but it's just an example
instead<00:03:41.560> of<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.010> pokemon<00:03:42.400> being<00:03:42.580> all<00:03:42.670> pimped

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
instead of the pokemon being all pimped

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.150 
instead of the pokemon being all pimped
out<00:03:43.030> like<00:03:43.239> Lucario<00:03:43.780> or<00:03:43.959> Blaziken<00:03:44.530> or<00:03:44.950> or

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
out like Lucario or Blaziken or or

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.670 
out like Lucario or Blaziken or or
Ampharos<00:03:45.870> anyways<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.200> Taiping<00:03:47.530> that

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
Ampharos anyways the Taiping that

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.710 
Ampharos anyways the Taiping that
probably<00:03:47.980> suit<00:03:48.190> this<00:03:48.310> Pokemon<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.790> best<00:03:49.030> we'd

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
probably suit this Pokemon the best we'd

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.660 
probably suit this Pokemon the best we'd
definitely<00:03:49.900> be<00:03:50.200> ghosts<00:03:50.530> slash<00:03:51.040> fighting<00:03:51.430> type

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
definitely be ghosts slash fighting type

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.759 
definitely be ghosts slash fighting type
I<00:03:51.940> think<00:03:52.090> that<00:03:52.480> typing<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:52.959> cool<00:03:53.170> as<00:03:53.320> heck<00:03:53.560> and

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
I think that typing is cool as heck and

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.199 
I think that typing is cool as heck and
it's<00:03:53.980> ability<00:03:54.400> we<00:03:54.489> most<00:03:54.670> likely<00:03:54.760> stay<00:03:55.090> the

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
it's ability we most likely stay the

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.790 
it's ability we most likely stay the
same<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:55.959> it<00:03:56.110> would<00:03:56.200> probably<00:03:56.319> be<00:03:56.530> more<00:03:56.650> of<00:03:56.740> a

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
same and it would probably be more of a

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.200 
same and it would probably be more of a
physical<00:03:56.950> attacker<00:03:57.400> than<00:03:57.610> anything<00:03:57.790> else<00:03:57.940> and

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
physical attacker than anything else and

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.130 
physical attacker than anything else and
lose<00:03:58.360> a<00:03:58.390> lot<00:03:58.510> of<00:03:58.720> its<00:03:58.960> defensive<00:03:59.530> alamin

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
lose a lot of its defensive alamin

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.480 
lose a lot of its defensive alamin
and<00:04:00.350> of<00:04:00.650> course<00:04:00.920> it<00:04:01.040> would<00:04:01.130> have<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.280> have<00:04:01.430> a

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
and of course it would have to have a

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:09.850 
and of course it would have to have a
few<00:04:01.700> fighting-type<00:04:02.030> moves<00:04:08.320> but<00:04:09.320> yeah<00:04:09.500> I'm

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
few fighting-type moves but yeah I'm

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.620 
few fighting-type moves but yeah I'm
pretty<00:04:10.130> much<00:04:10.220> wraps<00:04:10.490> up<00:04:10.700> my<00:04:10.790> list<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.390> once

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
pretty much wraps up my list and once
