purple lipsticks and I think that this

then<00:03:23.569> the<00:03:23.600> last<00:03:23.840> one<00:03:24.079> is<00:03:24.140> guess<00:03:24.650> which<00:03:25.010> is<00:03:25.160> a

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
then the last one is guess which is a

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.059 
then the last one is guess which is a
deep<00:03:25.730> black<00:03:26.239> purple<00:03:26.840> this<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.709> perfect

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
deep black purple this is the perfect

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.030 
deep black purple this is the perfect
vampy<00:03:28.940> lip<00:03:29.180> for<00:03:29.450> fall<00:03:29.690> it's<00:03:29.989> super<00:03:30.530> super<00:03:30.859> dark
