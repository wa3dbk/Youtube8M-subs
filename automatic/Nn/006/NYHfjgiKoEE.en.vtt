00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:14.500
 Takeuchi is the feeling of total immersion is today 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:20.580
 Do you not feel that you have not worked well even if you practice swimming hard 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.580
 This time, we will explain the measures and the reasons why you can not progress 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:30.990
 There are two keys for swimming to improve 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:35.970
 The first one is that there is a need to wear technology 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:42.630
 It is the contents of the brain to tell the body and technology 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:44.190
 To acquire the technology means that each part of the body can properly execute the instructions given by the brain. 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:50.240
 I will 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:54.410
 The second is that it is necessary to decide the direction of what to do 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:58.510
 Progress is to reach the top and 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:08.040
 I can not improve without knowing the direction 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:08.040
 And this direction is determined by the goal and the process leading to it 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:18.540
 Let's explain how to acquire the technology first 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:23.420
 The first step in acquiring technology is to know the required technology 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:27.510
 In the case of adults, the body does not move unless the brain is convinced 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.350
 So why do you need that technology? 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:37.720
 What kind of effect can be obtained 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.720
 You need to know in detail how and when to move your hands, feet, etc. 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:47.270
 Next you will learn how to acquire that technology 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:51.580
 For example, in crawling, the fixed timing when both hands and feet are moving separately 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:58.090
 It is difficult to focus only on the behavior of 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:02:00.870
 So in terms of better to practice only certain behavior is repeated in the form of a drill to wear the technology 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.870
 It is effective 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:12.470
 Once you get the skills you will never forget 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:16.910
 The rest is easier, longer and more beautiful and faster 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:22.220
 We will polish the technology and raise the satisfaction level of swimming 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:25.370
 Here we will fine-tune the movement based on the sense 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.420
 Balanced technology as an example of technology 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.670
 Technology to reduce resistance 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.410
 Technology to increase the impetus 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.410
 It will be like a technique for breathing 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.120
 First of all in crawling technology to balance 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.810
 Technology to reduce resistance by movement and posture next 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.550
 And technology to increase the impetus 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.340
 In addition there is technology to breathe 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:12.950
 Next, let's look at how to determine the direction 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:16.690
 The first step in determining your direction is to determine your specific goals 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.710
 The most specific thing is to use numbers 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:24.490
 Today's numbers used for swimming 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:28.050
 There are stores with a number of time strokes 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:32.670
 The appearance can also aim at the sense 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:36.020
 At this time, what percentage should it be improved from its current state? 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.020
 It would be better to incorporate the numbers 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:44.400
 Next we decide the way to achieve the goal 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:48.770
 For example, if you want to reduce the time, do you want to speed up the tempo? 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:55.080
 There is an approach to reduce the number of strokes 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:57.490
 The design of this journey is very important to ensure improvement 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.890
 And decide the milestone 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:07.490
 It would also be better to Synopsis of numbers 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:09.510
 The interval can also be set to increase for example 30% 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.920
 I will 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:19.880
 ti Swim balances for efficient swimming 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:23.300
 Polish the technology in the order of low resistance attitude propulsion 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.110
 In addition, about balance from the front and back 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:32.740
 And so on operate from less attitude of resistance 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.740
 The order to step up is decided in each technology 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.710
 ti swim drill first improves balance before and after 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.270
 Next, create a posture with less resistance and connect it to motion 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:53.020
 Also connect the movement of the foot to further promote force that holding hands and body trunk 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:08.310
 As I explained above, if you gradually acquire the technology, you can definitely improve 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.720
 I can do it 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.720
 This is ti swim 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:18.540
 In the ti swim, the skill is repeatedly practiced with pinpointing, so the speed of improvement is improved 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.750
 I will 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:26.060
 When I do not go well again I change my mind 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:33.340
 You can go back and solve the previous drill 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:33.340
 In addition, you can aim for higher goals by increasing the degree of completion of each technology 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:41.639
 Practice with the ti swim and enjoy your progress 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.639
 Thank you very much
