figure out a way to get a floor in there
that's<00:01:13.659> fairly<00:01:14.049> lightweight<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.939> looking

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
that's fairly lightweight like looking

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.480 
that's fairly lightweight like looking
at<00:01:16.389> the<00:01:16.479> game<00:01:16.659> build<00:01:16.959> like<00:01:17.109> shangri-la<00:01:17.679> the

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
at the game build like shangri-la the

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.639 
at the game build like shangri-la the
floor<00:01:18.759> it<00:01:19.149> weighs<00:01:19.299> about<00:01:19.479> nine<00:01:19.810> ounces<00:01:20.289> and

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
floor it weighs about nine ounces and

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.789 
floor it weighs about nine ounces and
then<00:01:21.009> when<00:01:21.159> you<00:01:21.249> add<00:01:21.369> that<00:01:21.399> to<00:01:21.609> the<00:01:21.880> already

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
then when you add that to the already

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.719 
then when you add that to the already
almost<00:01:23.799> pound<00:01:24.219> and<00:01:24.429> a<00:01:24.459> half

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
almost pound and a half

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.889 
almost pound and a half
I<00:01:25.029> think<00:01:25.270> pound<00:01:25.509> and<00:01:25.749> five<00:01:26.229> ounces<00:01:27.359> shelter<00:01:28.359> it

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
I think pound and five ounces shelter it

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.349 
I think pound and five ounces shelter it
kind<00:01:29.200> of<00:01:29.259> gets<00:01:29.469> up<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.759> kind<00:01:30.969> of<00:01:30.999> gets<00:01:31.149> up<00:01:31.270> a

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
kind of gets up it kind of gets up a

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:32.699

sitting there and the reason I want
something<00:01:51.939> that<00:01:52.209> has<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.389> bathtub<00:01:52.659> floor<00:01:53.079> it's

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
something that has a bathtub floor it's

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:54.629 
something that has a bathtub floor it's
just<00:01:53.439> to<00:01:53.529> kind<00:01:53.740> of<00:01:53.799> keep<00:01:53.979> if<00:01:54.219> there's<00:01:54.429> water

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:54.639 
just to kind of keep if there's water

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:56.609 
just to kind of keep if there's water
runoff<00:01:55.029> or<00:01:55.179> anything<00:01:55.389> just<00:01:56.079> so<00:01:56.259> it<00:01:56.409> won't

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
runoff or anything just so it won't

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.709 
runoff or anything just so it won't
actually<00:01:56.889> run<00:01:57.099> up<00:01:57.429> on<00:01:57.549> top<00:01:57.819> of<00:01:58.029> the<00:01:58.209> ground

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
actually run up on top of the ground

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.629 
actually run up on top of the ground
sheet<00:01:59.020> that<00:01:59.139> I'm<00:01:59.289> using<00:01:59.499> so<00:01:59.799> I<00:02:00.189> was<00:02:00.369> trying<00:02:00.549> to

I decided to try and sew it in the shape

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.429 
I decided to try and sew it in the shape
of<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:17.110> bathtub<00:02:17.849> floor<00:02:18.870> basically<00:02:19.870> all<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.319> did

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
honestly I wouldn't mind having it just

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.530 
honestly I wouldn't mind having it just
a<00:02:33.579> little<00:02:33.790> bit<00:02:33.909> wider<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.299> I'll<00:02:34.390> show<00:02:34.510> you

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
a little bit wider and I'll show you

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.539 
a little bit wider and I'll show you
wanting<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.930> little<00:02:35.140> bit<00:02:35.260> but<00:02:36.159> what<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.340> did

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.190 
wanting a little bit but what I did
after<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.849> did<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.269> I<00:02:37.359> just<00:02:37.390> cut<00:02:37.720> corners

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
after I did that is I just cut corners

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.960 
after I did that is I just cut corners
out<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:38.709> I've<00:02:38.829> got<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.040> picture<00:02:39.280> I'll<00:02:39.700> show<00:02:39.760> you

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
out and I've got a picture I'll show you

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.530 
out and I've got a picture I'll show you
about<00:02:40.120> right<00:02:40.420> here

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.770 

okay<00:02:47.540> now<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:49.220> cut<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.760> corners<00:02:50.150> out<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:50.630> then

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
okay now I cut the corners out and then

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.180 
okay now I cut the corners out and then
basically<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.320> just<00:02:51.590> pulled<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:51.890> corners

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
basically I just pulled the corners

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.070 
basically I just pulled the corners
together<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.820> sewed<00:02:53.060> them<00:02:53.240> after<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.900> did

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
together and I sewed them after I did

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.720 
together and I sewed them after I did
that<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:54.290> saw<00:02:54.620> some<00:02:54.830> little<00:02:54.890> loops<00:02:55.310> in<00:02:55.580> the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
that I saw some little loops in the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.080 
that I saw some little loops in the
edges<00:02:56.530> now<00:02:57.530> obviously<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:58.250> one<00:02:58.460> here<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.880> God

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
edges now obviously this one here of God

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.540 
edges now obviously this one here of God
is<00:02:59.330> just<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.630> little<00:02:59.870> trial<00:03:00.140> thing<00:03:00.410> if<00:03:00.620> it's<00:03:01.160> if

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
is just a little trial thing if it's if

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.680 
is just a little trial thing if it's if
it<00:03:01.700> looks<00:03:01.880> like<00:03:02.030> it's<00:03:02.210> going<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.390> work<00:03:02.540> out

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
it looks like it's going to work out

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.570 
it looks like it's going to work out
pretty<00:03:02.870> good<00:03:03.110> I'll<00:03:03.320> probably<00:03:03.590> decide<00:03:04.160> to<00:03:04.340> use

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
pretty good I'll probably decide to use

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.300 
pretty good I'll probably decide to use
something<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.630> little<00:03:06.200> bit<00:03:06.320> better<00:03:06.470> anyway

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
something a little bit better anyway

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.380 
something a little bit better anyway
I'll<00:03:07.490> just<00:03:07.520> kind<00:03:07.820> of<00:03:07.850> show<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.060> what<00:03:08.150> I've<00:03:08.360> got

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
I'll just kind of show you what I've got

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.100 
I'll just kind of show you what I've got
like<00:03:08.780> I<00:03:09.050> say<00:03:09.590> this<00:03:09.800> is<00:03:10.010> my<00:03:10.420> OAS<00:03:11.420> eight<00:03:11.720> by<00:03:11.870> ten

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
like I say this is my OAS eight by ten

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.560 
like I say this is my OAS eight by ten
steel<00:03:12.380> nylon<00:03:12.770> flat<00:03:13.070> tart<00:03:13.340> with<00:03:14.300> guidelines

steel nylon flat tart with guidelines

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.200 
steel nylon flat tart with guidelines
and<00:03:15.020> everything<00:03:15.970> this<00:03:16.970> thing<00:03:17.210> weighs<00:03:17.450> about

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
and everything this thing weighs about

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.550 
and everything this thing weighs about
it<00:03:20.210> weighs<00:03:20.420> about<00:03:22.870> 1820<00:03:23.870> ounces<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.230> came<00:03:24.410> here

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
it weighs about 1820 ounces I came here

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.580 
it weighs about 1820 ounces I came here
from<00:03:27.310> anyway<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:29.390> what<00:03:29.540> I'm<00:03:29.660> doing<00:03:29.690> is<00:03:30.140> on<00:03:30.500> the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
from anyway so what I'm doing is on the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.510 
from anyway so what I'm doing is on the
inside<00:03:30.980> here<00:03:31.310> this<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.240> what<00:03:32.420> I've<00:03:32.540> made<00:03:32.720> here

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
inside here this is what I've made here

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.640 
inside here this is what I've made here
it's<00:03:34.520> kind<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.760> hard<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.030> see<00:03:35.300> this<00:03:36.170> kind<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.560> a

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
it's kind of hard to see this kind of a

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
it's kind of hard to see this kind of a
bathtub<00:03:37.130> floor<00:03:38.200> basically<00:03:39.460> here<00:03:40.460> are<00:03:40.580> the

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
bathtub floor basically here are the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.300 
bathtub floor basically here are the
loops<00:03:40.880> that<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.600> have<00:03:41.810> I've<00:03:42.740> kind<00:03:42.980> of<00:03:43.040> sewed

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
loops that I have I've kind of sewed

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.330 
loops that I have I've kind of sewed
some<00:03:43.340> loops<00:03:43.730> on<00:03:44.000> here<00:03:44.210> after<00:03:44.570> I<00:03:44.600> sewed<00:03:44.930> the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
some loops on here after I sewed the

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.890 
some loops on here after I sewed the
insides<00:03:46.340> together<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:47.240> kind<00:03:47.390> of<00:03:47.540> make<00:03:47.690> it<00:03:47.720> a

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
insides together to kind of make it a

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.370 
insides together to kind of make it a
bathtub<00:03:48.410> for<00:03:48.710> and<00:03:49.250> kind<00:03:49.460> of<00:03:49.550> see<00:03:49.760> that<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.380> now

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
bathtub for and kind of see that and now

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.510 
bathtub for and kind of see that and now
I<00:03:51.410> saw<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.680> loop<00:03:51.890> on<00:03:52.070> there<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.280> then<00:03:52.400> I've

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
I saw the loop on there and then I've

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.310 
I saw the loop on there and then I've
just<00:03:52.550> got<00:03:52.820> some<00:03:52.970> string<00:03:53.330> here<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:53.840> what<00:03:54.230> I've

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
just got some string here and what I've

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.690 
just got some string here and what I've
done<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:54.590> I<00:03:54.680> pull<00:03:54.830> that<00:03:54.980> string<00:03:55.250> out<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.580> each

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
done is I pull that string out to each

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.870 
done is I pull that string out to each
corner<00:03:56.090> on<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.840> target<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:58.070> what<00:03:58.670> that's

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
corner on the target and what that's

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.050 
corner on the target and what that's
allowing<00:03:59.180> me<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.390> do<00:03:59.630> is<00:04:00.020> kind<00:04:00.320> of<00:04:00.380> pull<00:04:00.620> up<00:04:01.060> so

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
allowing me to do is kind of pull up so

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.150 
allowing me to do is kind of pull up so
that<00:04:02.270> and<00:04:02.780> I'm<00:04:03.050> not<00:04:03.200> just<00:04:03.350> pulling<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:03.800> down

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
that and I'm not just pulling it down

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.010 
that and I'm not just pulling it down
towards<00:04:04.520> the<00:04:04.610> ground<00:04:04.640> I'm<00:04:05.420> actually<00:04:05.630> pulling

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
towards the ground I'm actually pulling

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.510 
towards the ground I'm actually pulling
it<00:04:06.230> up<00:04:06.380> a<00:04:06.500> little<00:04:06.650> bit<00:04:06.800> to<00:04:06.980> kind<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.220> give<00:04:07.400> it

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
it up a little bit to kind of give it

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.810 
it up a little bit to kind of give it
that<00:04:07.550> shape<00:04:07.910> now<00:04:08.980> this<00:04:09.980> this<00:04:10.340> that<00:04:10.550> I've<00:04:10.640> got

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
that shape now this this that I've got

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.940

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
here I can't tell you it's probably

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.820 
here I can't tell you it's probably
about<00:04:13.250> 25<00:04:13.760> inches<00:04:14.120> wide<00:04:14.180> 26<00:04:14.990> inches<00:04:15.290> wide<00:04:15.500> and

to be a four now piece um once I
perfected<00:04:28.130> I'm<00:04:28.400> gonna<00:04:28.550> order<00:04:28.700> some<00:04:28.970> more

perfected I'm gonna order some more
stuff<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.390> I'm<00:04:29.480> gonna<00:04:29.570> try<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:29.780> do<00:04:29.900> it<00:04:29.990> a

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
stuff and I'm gonna try to do it a

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.610 
stuff and I'm gonna try to do it a
little<00:04:30.140> better

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
little better

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.350 
little better
one<00:04:31.250> thing<00:04:31.490> that<00:04:31.670> I<00:04:31.700> think<00:04:31.790> I'm<00:04:32.030> going<00:04:32.180> to<00:04:32.270> do

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
one thing that I think I'm going to do

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.790 
one thing that I think I'm going to do
is<00:04:32.570> instead<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:32.900> sewing<00:04:33.170> these<00:04:33.380> little<00:04:33.680> loops

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
is instead of sewing these little loops

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.150 
is instead of sewing these little loops
on<00:04:34.100> like<00:04:34.310> this<00:04:34.520> I'm<00:04:35.450> gonna<00:04:35.720> if<00:04:36.620> you<00:04:36.800> can<00:04:36.980> see

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
on like this I'm gonna if you can see

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.660 
on like this I'm gonna if you can see
here

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
here

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.210 
here
I<00:04:37.700> didn't<00:04:38.180> hem<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.510> edges<00:04:38.540> of<00:04:38.960> this<00:04:39.100> what<00:04:40.100> I'll

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
I didn't hem the edges of this what I'll

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.710 
I didn't hem the edges of this what I'll
do<00:04:40.400> is<00:04:40.580> when<00:04:40.730> I<00:04:40.760> actually<00:04:40.940> decided<00:04:41.360> to<00:04:41.420> do<00:04:41.570> the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
do is when I actually decided to do the

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.470 
do is when I actually decided to do the
real<00:04:42.290> one<00:04:42.500> I'll<00:04:42.650> actually<00:04:42.860> hem<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.340> edges<00:04:43.480> now

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
real one I'll actually hem the edges now

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.280 
real one I'll actually hem the edges now
what<00:04:44.660> I'll<00:04:44.780> do<00:04:44.990> is<00:04:45.290> on<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:45.950> sides<00:04:46.250> here<00:04:47.260> when<00:04:48.260> I

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
what I'll do is on the sides here when I

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.820 
what I'll do is on the sides here when I
him<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:48.830> I'm<00:04:49.130> going<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.460> leave<00:04:49.640> a<00:04:50.830> section

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
him it I'm going to leave a section

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.170 
him it I'm going to leave a section
inside<00:04:52.130> so<00:04:52.430> that<00:04:52.520> I<00:04:52.610> can<00:04:52.760> run<00:04:52.880> a<00:04:52.940> piece<00:04:53.150> of

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
inside so that I can run a piece of

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.180 
inside so that I can run a piece of
string<00:04:53.510> through<00:04:53.810> I'm<00:04:54.680> gonna<00:04:54.890> have<00:04:54.979> to<00:04:55.070> get

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
string through I'm gonna have to get

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.450 
string through I'm gonna have to get
some<00:04:55.400> real<00:04:55.850> thin<00:04:56.270> or<00:04:56.660> a<00:04:56.720> real<00:04:56.990> small<00:04:57.460> strings

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
some real thin or a real small strings

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.740 
some real thin or a real small strings
probably<00:04:59.000> some<00:04:59.150> white

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
probably some white

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.480 
probably some white
or<00:04:59.960> something<00:05:00.230> like<00:05:00.350> that<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:01.040> what<00:05:01.220> I'll<00:05:01.340> do

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
or something like that and what I'll do

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.910 
or something like that and what I'll do
is<00:05:01.520> I'll<00:05:01.790> just<00:05:01.940> run<00:05:02.210> a<00:05:02.450> string<00:05:02.900> all<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.800> way

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
is I'll just run a string all the way

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.310 
is I'll just run a string all the way
down<00:05:04.160> it<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:04.580> then<00:05:05.330> it<00:05:05.630> will<00:05:05.720> come<00:05:05.870> out<00:05:05.900> and

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
down it and then it will come out and

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.870 
down it and then it will come out and
the<00:05:06.680> string<00:05:07.070> will<00:05:07.160> be<00:05:07.250> long<00:05:07.430> enough<00:05:07.640> to<00:05:07.760> where

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
the string will be long enough to where

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.430 
the string will be long enough to where
I<00:05:07.940> can<00:05:07.970> bring<00:05:08.300> it<00:05:08.450> out<00:05:08.570> and<00:05:08.690> I<00:05:08.750> can<00:05:08.780> tie<00:05:09.140> it<00:05:09.200> to

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
I can bring it out and I can tie it to

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.010 
I can bring it out and I can tie it to
whatever<00:05:09.590> I<00:05:09.830> need<00:05:10.010> to<00:05:10.130> tie<00:05:10.310> it<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.580> my<00:05:11.570> idea

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
whatever I need to tie it to my idea

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.750 
whatever I need to tie it to my idea
behind<00:05:12.200> that<00:05:12.620> is<00:05:12.860> whenever<00:05:13.070> I<00:05:13.310> pull<00:05:13.610> the

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
behind that is whenever I pull the

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.210 
behind that is whenever I pull the
string<00:05:14.060> it'll<00:05:14.960> actually<00:05:15.230> put<00:05:15.560> tension<00:05:15.860> all

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
string it'll actually put tension all

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.610 
string it'll actually put tension all
the<00:05:16.340> way<00:05:16.460> along<00:05:16.730> this<00:05:16.940> Ridge<00:05:17.300> here<00:05:17.450> or<00:05:17.930> along

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
the way along this Ridge here or along

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.880 
the way along this Ridge here or along

the edge of the of the floor and
whenever<00:05:22.490> it<00:05:22.580> puts<00:05:22.790> tension<00:05:23.060> it's<00:05:23.420> going<00:05:23.600> to

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
whenever it puts tension it's going to

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.090 
whenever it puts tension it's going to
kind<00:05:23.840> of<00:05:23.930> pull<00:05:24.140> it<00:05:24.290> all<00:05:24.410> the<00:05:24.440> way<00:05:24.590> up<00:05:24.800> all<00:05:25.010> the

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
kind of pull it all the way up all the

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.490 
kind of pull it all the way up all the
way<00:05:25.190> around<00:05:25.520> but<00:05:26.390> the<00:05:26.480> only<00:05:26.630> thing<00:05:26.930> is<00:05:27.170> is<00:05:27.380> I

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
way around but the only thing is is I

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.720 
way around but the only thing is is I
want<00:05:27.680> to<00:05:27.740> make<00:05:27.860> sure<00:05:27.920> it<00:05:28.130> doesn't<00:05:28.280> pull<00:05:28.490> it<00:05:28.610> too

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
want to make sure it doesn't pull it too

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.280 
want to make sure it doesn't pull it too
tight<00:05:28.760> or<00:05:29.120> whatever<00:05:29.390> I've<00:05:29.570> got<00:05:29.600> it<00:05:29.870> tied<00:05:30.050> to

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
tight or whatever I've got it tied to

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.510 
tight or whatever I've got it tied to
it's<00:05:30.470> going<00:05:30.590> to<00:05:30.650> affect<00:05:31.040> that<00:05:31.220> because<00:05:31.460> I

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
it's going to affect that because I

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.490 
it's going to affect that because I
don't<00:05:31.670> want<00:05:31.850> it<00:05:31.910> pulling<00:05:32.240> pulling<00:05:33.110> real<00:05:33.380> bad

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
don't want it pulling pulling real bad

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.740 
don't want it pulling pulling real bad
and<00:05:33.710> I<00:05:33.740> don't<00:05:33.800> want<00:05:34.010> it<00:05:34.070> to<00:05:34.160> tear<00:05:34.370> up<00:05:34.490> anything

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
and I don't want it to tear up anything

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.120 
and I don't want it to tear up anything
but<00:05:35.750> I<00:05:35.870> think<00:05:35.930> that<00:05:36.290> if<00:05:36.380> I<00:05:36.500> do<00:05:36.560> that<00:05:36.680> I<00:05:36.890> don't

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
but I think that if I do that I don't

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.620 
but I think that if I do that I don't
think<00:05:37.280> it's<00:05:37.550> going<00:05:37.640> to<00:05:37.730> be<00:05:37.850> too<00:05:38.030> bad<00:05:38.210> it'll

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
think it's going to be too bad it'll

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.570 
think it's going to be too bad it'll
just<00:05:38.870> keep<00:05:38.960> enough<00:05:39.260> tension<00:05:39.470> to<00:05:39.710> keep<00:05:39.890> it<00:05:40.070> up

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
just keep enough tension to keep it up

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.090 
just keep enough tension to keep it up
at<00:05:40.880> all<00:05:41.030> times<00:05:41.330> and<00:05:41.630> but<00:05:42.110> if<00:05:42.200> I<00:05:42.320> ever<00:05:42.440> sit<00:05:42.950> down

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
at all times and but if I ever sit down

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.680 
at all times and but if I ever sit down
on<00:05:43.310> it<00:05:43.430> or<00:05:43.550> something<00:05:43.820> I<00:05:44.000> really<00:05:44.480> don't<00:05:44.630> think

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
on it or something I really don't think

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.180 
on it or something I really don't think
it'll<00:05:45.080> cause<00:05:45.530> any<00:05:45.770> damage<00:05:46.180> but<00:05:47.180> anyway<00:05:48.190> this

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
it'll cause any damage but anyway this

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.280
