00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
a similar situation there there was a

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.400 
a similar situation there there was a
kind<00:05:12.639> of<00:05:12.669> a<00:05:12.760> legend<00:05:13.090> if<00:05:13.180> you<00:05:13.270> like<00:05:13.450> Bruno<00:05:14.229> Conti

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
kind of a legend if you like Bruno Conti

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.920 
kind of a legend if you like Bruno Conti
and<00:05:14.830> I<00:05:15.190> wore<00:05:15.370> his<00:05:15.520> number<00:05:15.550> 7<00:05:16.030> shirt<00:05:16.060> so<00:05:16.630> you

and I wore his number 7 shirt so you

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.330 
and I wore his number 7 shirt so you
know<00:05:17.080> things<00:05:17.410> turned<00:05:17.650> out<00:05:17.800> quite<00:05:17.979> nicely

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
know things turned out quite nicely

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.060 
know things turned out quite nicely
there<00:05:18.610> let's<00:05:18.790> hope<00:05:18.910> they<00:05:19.030> turn<00:05:19.180> out<00:05:19.360> as<00:05:19.510> as

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
there let's hope they turn out as as

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.930 
there let's hope they turn out as as
positively<00:05:21.070> here<00:05:21.430> as<00:05:21.580> well

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
positively here as well

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.590 
positively here as well
I<00:05:21.970> knew<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:22.930> first<00:05:23.310> person<00:05:24.310> from<00:05:24.570> Chile<00:05:25.570> to

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
I knew the first person from Chile to

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.140 
I knew the first person from Chile to
play<00:05:26.020> for<00:05:26.500> a<00:05:26.530> city<00:05:26.770> as<00:05:26.950> well<00:05:27.100> so<00:05:27.790> do<00:05:27.880> you<00:05:27.970> feel

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
play for a city as well so do you feel

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.060 
play for a city as well so do you feel
your<00:05:28.330> represents<00:05:28.840> in<00:05:28.990> your<00:05:29.229> country<00:05:29.680> by

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
your represents in your country by

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.750 
your represents in your country by
signing<00:05:30.460> for<00:05:30.700> city<00:05:31.830> now<00:05:32.830> I<00:05:32.860> think<00:05:32.950> it's

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
signing for city now I think it's

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.800 
signing for city now I think it's
important<00:05:34.180> that<00:05:34.210> you<00:05:34.300> mentioned<00:05:34.690> that

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
important that you mentioned that

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.779 
important that you mentioned that
because<00:05:34.960> there's<00:05:35.380> a<00:05:35.410> small<00:05:35.740> fairly<00:05:36.550> small

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
because there's a small fairly small

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.120 
because there's a small fairly small
country<00:05:37.180> with<00:05:37.300> only<00:05:37.479> 7<00:05:38.169> million<00:05:38.380> population

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
country with only 7 million population

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.540 
country with only 7 million population
so<00:05:39.310> I<00:05:39.340> think<00:05:39.810> for<00:05:40.810> any<00:05:40.960> Chilean<00:05:41.890> playing

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
so I think for any Chilean playing

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.880 
so I think for any Chilean playing
abroad<00:05:42.840> it<00:05:43.840> comes<00:05:44.050> with<00:05:44.200> a<00:05:44.229> certain<00:05:44.680> amount<00:05:44.800> of

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
abroad it comes with a certain amount of

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.159 
abroad it comes with a certain amount of
responsibility<00:05:45.130> you<00:05:45.850> know<00:05:46.240> our<00:05:46.720> marketplace

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
responsibility you know our marketplace

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.170 
responsibility you know our marketplace
footballers<00:05:48.100> is<00:05:48.250> totally<00:05:48.729> different<00:05:48.880> so

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
footballers is totally different so

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.590 
footballers is totally different so
that's<00:05:49.300> if<00:05:49.479> say<00:05:49.630> Brazil<00:05:50.080> or<00:05:50.950> Argentina<00:05:51.030> so<00:05:52.030> you

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
that's if say Brazil or Argentina so you

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.490 
that's if say Brazil or Argentina so you
know<00:05:52.690> you<00:05:52.780> don't<00:05:52.900> tend<00:05:53.169> to<00:05:53.200> see<00:05:53.260> as<00:05:53.380> many

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
know you don't tend to see as many

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.520 
know you don't tend to see as many
Chileans<00:05:53.919> abroad<00:05:54.580> so<00:05:55.180> yeah<00:05:55.360> I<00:05:55.389> take<00:05:55.690> take<00:05:56.380> it

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
Chileans abroad so yeah I take take it

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.170 
Chileans abroad so yeah I take take it
really<00:05:56.770> really<00:05:56.979> seriously<00:05:57.400> that<00:05:57.610> role<00:05:57.820> and<00:05:58.150> I

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
really really seriously that role and I

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.330 
really really seriously that role and I
think<00:05:58.210> that<00:05:58.539> it<00:05:58.900> is<00:05:59.080> important<00:05:59.680> and<00:05:59.860> as<00:06:00.160> I<00:06:00.190> say

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
think that it is important and as I say

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.640 
think that it is important and as I say
