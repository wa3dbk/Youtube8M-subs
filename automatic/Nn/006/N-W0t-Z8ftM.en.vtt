00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:14.059

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:18.600
 I was really welcome to the sunny 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:21.180
 tutorials with the funny laughing 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.660
 types or bed lay and the topic of books 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.699
 Yeah, I'm going to walk around today 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.380
 imagine the plug-in corp review 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.279
 actually pretty easy to set 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.390
 you just have to download it 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.390
 download is a description as always 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.719
 on now less then easy 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.289
 then download in line 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.079
 undergo and confessionally in 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.579
 you can then set the folder 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.940
 what they want to have lured and what 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.430
 Not 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.629
 and now suppose you have her to the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.660
 pine spruce now have something with kde 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.609
 always that should be everything 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.890
 destroyed and take no longer expand 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.600
 is oh children, I should of course now 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.210
 better the plug-in before it had 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.890
 What's left is to make a joke 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.140
 we with theo inspect know for what 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.540
 we do not actually click then we 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.939
 to where it has the word then there is 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.939
 where blockbuster of the location 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.890
 arises there peter I already have 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.940
 thought it stood nothing 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.020
 friedrichs enstone then we can 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.180
 same - on bands like two hd 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.560
 difference since you can with these 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.690
 players would not be okay that is 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.170
 usually not that normal 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.840
 could these games lock ok mostly 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.520
 Hand on heart are for me is like you 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.720
 as much as I can hear now with man on the 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.460
 that's because you've been using me now 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.930
 That's why we can do the boys 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:05.870
 wolbeck name of the buyer okay that was 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:08.570
 now bitterly cold and time we have 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.200
 I now estimate three minutes 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.250
 enable 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.050
 then we can also have a radius 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:19.970
 Set now have to take 50,750 mw 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.890
 we do not need this now and how 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.890
 he can see everything is pretty nice 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.370
 restored 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:36.670
 almost everything radius taken from 50 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:36.670
 that was probably not enough marius of 90 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.780
 incompetent yes and that's how it works 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.640
 plug-in only after phone is that it 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.530
 quite a lot of space consumed 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.930
 but that's what most people knew 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.310
 no problem since you unlimited 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.590
 memory hans then much fun 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.260
 we use the plugin and still at 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.260
