going to be putting a copper colored

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.370 
going to be putting a copper colored
paint<00:00:21.619> on<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:21.920> calipers<00:00:22.540> so<00:00:23.540> mostly<00:00:24.260> you<00:00:24.320> know

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
paint on the calipers so mostly you know

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.950 
paint on the calipers so mostly you know
it's<00:00:24.619> not<00:00:24.770> something<00:00:25.010> that's<00:00:25.160> super<00:00:25.400> visible

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
it's not something that's super visible

it's not something that's super visible
you<00:00:26.960> know<00:00:27.080> during<00:00:27.290> your<00:00:27.500> everyday<00:00:27.740> driving

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
you know during your everyday driving

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.859 
you know during your everyday driving
bézier<00:00:28.730> as<00:00:28.970> your<00:00:29.390> wheels<00:00:29.570> are<00:00:29.750> spinning

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
bézier as your wheels are spinning

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.130 
bézier as your wheels are spinning
you'll<00:00:30.140> be<00:00:30.230> more<00:00:30.380> visible<00:00:30.640> kind<00:00:31.640> of<00:00:31.700> a<00:00:31.790> gloss

call it to it so yeah right now we're
just<00:00:35.300> we<00:00:35.510> have<00:00:35.630> a<00:00:35.660> jack<00:00:35.900> up<00:00:36.050> off<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.320> ground

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
just we have a jack up off the ground

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.569 
just we have a jack up off the ground
we're<00:00:36.650> taking<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:36.950> tires<00:00:37.160> off<00:00:39.430> that's<00:00:40.430> right

we're taking the tires off that's right

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:41.950 
we're taking the tires off that's right
now<00:00:40.700> we're<00:00:40.820> just<00:00:40.910> scraping<00:00:41.360> off<00:00:41.450> all<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.720> dust

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
now we're just scraping off all the dust

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.850 
now we're just scraping off all the dust
and<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.320> mud<00:00:42.500> stuff<00:00:42.920> that's<00:00:43.100> on<00:00:43.190> the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
and the mud stuff that's on the

and the mud stuff that's on the
California<00:00:45.860> all<00:00:45.950> nice<00:00:46.160> and<00:00:46.399> clean<00:00:47.000> surface<00:00:47.210> to

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
California all nice and clean surface to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:59.709 
California all nice and clean surface to
paint<00:00:47.750> on<00:00:57.429> all<00:00:58.429> right<00:00:58.640> next<00:00:59.179> step<00:00:59.359> is<00:00:59.539> to<00:00:59.690> just

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
paint on all right next step is to just

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.049 
paint on all right next step is to just
kind<00:01:00.079> of<00:01:00.170> isolate<00:01:00.589> the<00:01:00.710> caliper<00:01:01.129> make<00:01:01.940> sure

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
kind of isolate the caliper make sure

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.150 
kind of isolate the caliper make sure
you<00:01:02.149> put<00:01:02.329> tape<00:01:02.539> over<00:01:02.719> all<00:01:02.929> those<00:01:03.109> inside<00:01:03.559> you

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
you put tape over all those inside you

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.290 
you put tape over all those inside you
know<00:01:04.250> components<00:01:04.760> because<00:01:04.910> you<00:01:05.000> don't<00:01:05.150> want

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
know components because you don't want

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.330 
know components because you don't want
paint<00:01:05.570> on<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.930> on<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.620> actual<00:01:06.890> rotor<00:01:07.130> itself

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
paint on the on the actual rotor itself

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.520 
paint on the on the actual rotor itself
and<00:01:08.210> it's<00:01:08.390> how<00:01:08.510> it<00:01:08.630> kind<00:01:08.810> of<00:01:08.840> works<00:01:08.960> itself<00:01:09.170> up

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
and it's how it kind of works itself up

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.680 
and it's how it kind of works itself up
underneath<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:09.950> caliper<00:01:10.370> and<00:01:11.330> around<00:01:11.600> the

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
underneath the caliper and around the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.880 
underneath the caliper and around the
backside<00:01:11.900> so<00:01:12.290> you<00:01:12.350> don't<00:01:12.500> get<00:01:12.590> paint<00:01:12.830> on

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
backside so you don't get paint on

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.160 
backside so you don't get paint on
anything<00:01:13.220> important<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:14.690> paint<00:01:14.960> we're

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
anything important the paint we're

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.700 
anything important the paint we're
actually<00:01:15.260> using<00:01:16.630> where<00:01:17.630> does<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:17.930> go<00:01:18.110> right

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
actually using where does that go right

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.030 
actually using where does that go right
here<00:01:18.920> it's<00:01:19.520> actually<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:19.910> high<00:01:20.150> temp<00:01:20.830> paint<00:01:21.830> so

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
here it's actually a high temp paint so

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.870 
here it's actually a high temp paint so
it's<00:01:22.160> a<00:01:22.370> says<00:01:22.880> it's<00:01:23.060> good<00:01:23.210> up<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:23.450> 1200<00:01:24.380> degrees

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
it's a says it's good up to 1200 degrees

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.710 
it's a says it's good up to 1200 degrees
which<00:01:25.880> I've<00:01:26.060> worked<00:01:26.300> out<00:01:26.450> pretty<00:01:26.600> well

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
which I've worked out pretty well

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.860 
which I've worked out pretty well
because<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:27.140> calipers<00:01:27.530> get<00:01:27.710> pretty<00:01:27.890> hot<00:01:28.870> but

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
because the calipers get pretty hot but

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.420 
because the calipers get pretty hot but
if<00:01:29.960> they<00:01:30.050> get<00:01:30.230> you<00:01:30.380> know<00:01:30.440> up<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.740> thousand

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
if they get you know up to a thousand

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.650 
if they get you know up to a thousand
two<00:01:31.520> hundred<00:01:31.730> degrees<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:32.150> have<00:01:32.180> more

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
two hundred degrees you have more

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.330 
two hundred degrees you have more
problems<00:01:32.990> on<00:01:33.050> your<00:01:33.170> hand<00:01:33.350> besides<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.890> chipping

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
problems on your hand besides a chipping

00:01:34.340 --> 00:02:11.260 
problems on your hand besides a chipping
paint<00:01:34.520> so

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.370 

all<00:02:12.270> right<00:02:12.450> we're<00:02:12.570> doing<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> second<00:02:13.020> ago<00:02:13.200> we

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
all right we're doing a second ago we

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:39.820 
all right we're doing a second ago we
waited<00:02:13.680> prod<00:02:13.860> out<00:02:14.040> ten<00:02:14.580> minutes<00:02:14.970> or<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.209> now

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.380 

our<00:02:40.830> eyes<00:02:41.010> when<00:02:41.280> you're<00:02:41.400> spray-painting<00:02:42.060> want

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
our eyes when you're spray-painting want

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.610 
our eyes when you're spray-painting want
to<00:02:42.450> make<00:02:42.570> sure<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.840> keep<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.170> about<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.590> know

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
to make sure you keep it about you know

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.100 
to make sure you keep it about you know
you<00:02:44.070> know<00:02:44.190> 10<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.520> 12<00:02:44.760> inches<00:02:44.970> away<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.480> then<00:02:46.080> I

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
you know 10 to 12 inches away and then I

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.040 
you know 10 to 12 inches away and then I
do<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.410> short<00:02:46.800> verse<00:02:47.420> just<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:48.570> I<00:02:48.600> don't<00:02:48.810> get<00:02:48.930> any

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
do a short verse just so I don't get any

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.630 
do a short verse just so I don't get any
runs<00:02:49.350> or<00:02:49.590> drips<00:02:49.620> or<00:02:50.010> anything<00:02:50.160> going<00:02:50.489> off<00:02:50.610> of

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
runs or drips or anything going off of

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.960 
runs or drips or anything going off of
this<00:02:52.040> just<00:02:53.040> kind<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.250> like<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:55.940> make<00:02:56.940> a

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
this just kind of like that make a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.430 
this just kind of like that make a
church<00:02:57.239> non<00:02:57.480> drip<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:57.989> is<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.230> third

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
church non drip and this is the third

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:12.840 
church non drip and this is the third
show<00:02:58.739> we're<00:02:59.610> going<00:02:59.820> to<00:02:59.910> be<00:03:00.000> three

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.980 

all<00:03:13.850> right<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:14.240> we<00:03:14.300> took<00:03:14.420> off<00:03:14.570> all<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.810> tape

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
all right so we took off all the tape
