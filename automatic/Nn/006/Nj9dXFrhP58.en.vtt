00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.309
 Eighth game day in the second handball 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.650
 bundesliga the sc dhfk leipzig guest 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.539
 in the ems-hall the saxony in the 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.029
 dark jerseys so far with right 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.160
 mixed season start three wins 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.130
 face four defeats 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.289
 the domestic tv emsdetten however the 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.170
 positive surprise of the league the 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.060
 seven of trainer patrik liljestrand 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.070
 but had one in the last week 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.470
 completely new in this season 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.340
 make experiences in ludwigshafen 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.050
 the team took the first defeat 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.200
 and also the prelude in the match against 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.240
 leipzig rather moderately the tvb ii often found 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.190
 no way through the cover of the guests the 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.860
 in turn, at a fast pace 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.290
 collisions for danger and just as well 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.150
 hit before 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.560
 so plenty of conversation needs 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.290
 trainers and players 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.690
 there was a lot of sand in the gears, the 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.940
 next scene where as well as with a try 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.650
 right in the arms of gabor pulay the 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.680
 Keeper quickly makes a pass over the 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.470
 entire defensive and rené evil meets 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.110
 to 7 to 5 guest guide after twelve 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.940
 minutes it was time for coach 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.130
 patrik liljestrand his team new 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.840
 even if we are at his 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.330
 you can not listen to the speech 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.850
 See that the coach is pretty clear 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.140
 became and that one noticed in the consequence 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.690
 also with his team 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.750
 the tvb ii after the timeout like 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.170
 replaced ragnarsson uncompromising 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.170
 india 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.960
 showing the guys in the hero jerseys 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.650
 now a very different face andrej 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.930
 kourtchev to 7 7-balancing and 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.040
 Emsdetten did not let it go 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.750
 again after sunning with the guide the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.810
 Saxony now became downright 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.230
 overrun by tv express very strong 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.000
 phase in the game of the home team 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.720
 Here Lutz Wesseling wears himself in the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.720
 scorers list 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.490
 and also new entry olafur ragnar song 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.370
 from the distance again to 13 to 9 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.980
 now reads correctly around the host 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.250
 the defensive was back as usual 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.100
 strong and left hardly anything to 15 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.000
 to 9 there were six hits in the cabin 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.069
 Advance of the tvb ii was clearly on course 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.950
 home victory could now be photos 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.370
 against it are then with errors in the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.180
 Attack and I say only a few 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.590
 Good defense came in the back 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.430
 and they could not play that anymore 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.860
 compensate 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.260
 right after the re-whistle and here 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.230
 Dear spectators, you see what a guest coach 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.709
 uwe jungandreas with not so good 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.330
 depreciate writes stefan thünemann 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.150
 alone on the circle of the tva 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.340
 made as much as a half 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.500
 one had left coach Patrick 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.660
 liljestrand was still working 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.180
 tense but he actually had 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.400
 no reason very concentrated went 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.980
 his maneuvers become what it is called 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.530
 So nice games will be on the offensive 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.519
 won titles on the defensive and there 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.010
 let the tv nothing to used every 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:28.519
 merciless little mistake from jeffrey 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.519
 bruma ice cold no chance for leipzigs 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.980
 only from Saxony left slowly but 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.420
 surely the faith in here 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.530
 any wise what countable 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.260
 take 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.440
 Once again it is blue with one of his 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.950
 six hits this evening 24 to 14 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.440
 10 gates out there it could be 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.000
 tv emsdetten allow one or 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.400
 other players from the second row 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.480
 to give a little practice as here 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.480
 the 23 maik schulz and also the meets 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.239
 Leipzig was absolutely that evening 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.900
 Chanceslos emsdetten brought the game 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:12.400
 sure about the time and wins in the end 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:14.879
 clearly with 31 20 nadal leipzig wants there 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.979
 but ascend a good troop 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:20.199
 I am very satisfied will the 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:24.960
 Team showed that you wanted the 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:28.510
 have points home and that was one 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.410
 wild rose over the whole team 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.120
 one has seen 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.330
 Leipzig definitely wanted to win 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.260
 and we held up well and we did 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.580
 are then good in the second 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.430
 have half arrived then directly 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.780
 led with 78 goals and then was the 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.190
 resistance pretty much broken and 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.720
 then we could do the game 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.720
 I think driving home easily
