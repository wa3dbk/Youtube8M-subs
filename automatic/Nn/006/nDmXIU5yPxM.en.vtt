so<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.850> start<00:00:51.199> take<00:00:52.199> your<00:00:52.350> avocado<00:00:53.329> and<00:00:54.329> cut<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
so to start take your avocado and cut I

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.270 
so to start take your avocado and cut I
cut<00:00:55.050> off<00:00:55.140> both<00:00:55.379> ends<00:00:57.379> makes<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.530> easier<00:00:58.859> then

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
cut off both ends makes it easier then

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.380 
cut off both ends makes it easier then
slice<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.640> down<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> middle<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:05.000> then<00:01:06.000> you

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
slice it down the middle and then you

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.969 
slice it down the middle and then you
should<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.750> able<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.260> divide<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.860> two

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
should be able to divide it in two

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.640 
should be able to divide it in two
halves<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.820> then<00:01:09.510> what<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.049> do<00:01:10.229> is

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
halves and then what I like to do is

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.649 
halves and then what I like to do is
just<00:01:11.040> scoop<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.790> out<00:01:11.880> into<00:01:12.180> my<00:01:12.270> bowl<00:01:14.390> should<00:01:15.390> be

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
just scoop it out into my bowl should be

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.370 
just scoop it out into my bowl should be
fairly

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:31.929 

okay<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:28.479> let's<00:01:29.479> add<00:01:29.689> some<00:01:29.750> fresh<00:01:30.229> lime<00:01:30.939> that
