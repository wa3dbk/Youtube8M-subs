00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
keep the guitar suspended within the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.250 
keep the guitar suspended within the

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
case so I have piece of foam here I have

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.820 
case so I have piece of foam here I have
a<00:01:45.350> piece<00:01:45.590> of<00:01:45.620> foam<00:01:45.950> here<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:47.180> upper<00:01:47.479> bouts<00:01:47.830> and

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
a piece of foam here the upper bouts and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.600 
a piece of foam here the upper bouts and
I<00:01:49.310> have<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.490> piece<00:01:49.729> of<00:01:49.760> foam<00:01:50.090> by<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.020> lower<00:01:51.260> bar

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
I have a piece of foam by the lower bar

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.500 
I have a piece of foam by the lower bar
at<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.700> butt<00:01:52.910> end<00:01:53.120> of<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:53.300> case<00:01:53.510> so<00:01:54.290> there<00:01:54.800> is

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
at the butt end of the case so there is

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.560 
at the butt end of the case so there is
somewhat<00:01:56.510> of<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.780> gap<00:01:57.170> some<00:01:58.130> gap<00:01:58.310> pitch<00:01:58.570> here

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
somewhat of a gap some gap pitch here

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.790 
somewhat of a gap some gap pitch here
but<00:02:00.520> that's<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.760> general<00:02:01.910> idea<00:02:02.180> so<00:02:02.510> the<00:02:03.380> trip

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
but that's the general idea so the trip

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.670 
but that's the general idea so the trip
the<00:02:04.210> plan<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.420> suspend<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.990> guitar<00:02:06.320> within

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
the plan is to suspend the guitar within

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.590 
the plan is to suspend the guitar within
the<00:02:06.770> case<00:02:08.440> so<00:02:09.440> it<00:02:09.920> would<00:02:10.250> fast<00:02:10.580> being<00:02:10.880> mocked

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
the case so it would fast being mocked

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.370 
the case so it would fast being mocked
about<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.170> stuff<00:02:13.030> okay<00:02:14.030> now<00:02:14.240> I<00:02:14.270> also<00:02:14.690> have<00:02:14.990> a
