00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.389
 i 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.869
 hello all welcome to the good channel 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.060
 Today I will do'll show as 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.529
 make us the French manicure of a 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.010
 very easy way and it is because many 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.230
 times with the right hand we make ourselves 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.210
 well the left but then with the hand 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.430
 left us more difficult to do it in the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.050
 right or even with both hands we 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.870
 it costs a lot we have the line and we 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.460
 straight out the smile of the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.469
 francesita 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.820
 while I'm going to teach you a very 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.940
 easy to make 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.850
 I have applied a first base gloss 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.400
 and then I will use the base well 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.160
 you have several shades this is 02 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.980
 kiko that is a base and this is a 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.360
 little bit more pink we can use the 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.949
 what we like 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.949
 in this case I will use the peak 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.140
 we painted our normal nails 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.330
 once painted we apply seca and 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.210
 he used the collapse 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.760
 and we let them dry we could give 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.500
 a second layer good one we relate 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.450
 dry we prepare a little bit of 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.100
 acetone and I 've put here a 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:57.080
 cotton bud and white enamel then 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.080
 what will make the white enamel 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.700
 we cook we put it there in the hand 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.280
 and what we are going to do is pass 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.280
 the nail 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.170
 Over there 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.340
 then with the swab we clean this 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.340
 zone 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.720
 what we are going to do is pass 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.720
 The nail 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.650
 over there and that's how the French girl stays 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.890
 then with the swab and the 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.430
 nail polish remover we went under to 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.430
 clean up 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.590
 and we would have done the manicure 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.800
 we would do the same with the rest of the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.800
 nail 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.800
 we put ourselves here a little 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.000
 and we went through here the nail 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.420
 and then we remove 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.670
 what has been stained 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.859
 ah 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.099
 and so we would stay 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.099
 French manicure 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.799
 this would be the result and the other hand 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.229
 we would do the same 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.470
 to finish we could apply shine 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.759
 and a blotter this has been all I hope 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.900
 that you liked it and see you in the 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:31.900
