00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
I've lost 39 pounds past couple weeks

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.850 
I've lost 39 pounds past couple weeks
has<00:00:33.870> been<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.020> little<00:00:34.230> bit<00:00:34.320> slower<00:00:34.590> than<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
has been a little bit slower than the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.220 
has been a little bit slower than the
first<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.730> know<00:00:35.760> first<00:00:36.059> six<00:00:36.420> weeks<00:00:36.600> or<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:36.930> I

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
first you know first six weeks or so I

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.069 
first you know first six weeks or so I
think<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.820> has<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.660> fact<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:39.960> I

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
think it has to do with the fact that I

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.420 
think it has to do with the fact that I
was<00:00:40.200> really<00:00:40.410> hungry<00:00:40.710> right<00:00:41.040> after<00:00:41.280> surgery

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
was really hungry right after surgery

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.900 
was really hungry right after surgery
and<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.730> think<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.969> put<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.420> my<00:00:42.510> last<00:00:42.690> video

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
and I think I put that on my last video

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.790 
and I think I put that on my last video
I'm<00:00:44.910> one<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.809> those<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.140> didn't<00:00:46.440> get<00:00:46.559> sick

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
I'm one of those that I didn't get sick

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.229 
I'm one of those that I didn't get sick
I<00:00:47.010> didn't<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.309> any<00:00:47.460> issues<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.850> didn't<00:00:48.149> have

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
I didn't have any issues I didn't have

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.470 
I didn't have any issues I didn't have
any<00:00:48.360> complications<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:50.460> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.969> above

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
any complications so it's kind of above

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.319 
any complications so it's kind of above
above<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:54.079> raw<00:00:55.079> stage<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.820> started<00:00:57.180> eating

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
above the raw stage so I started eating

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.110 
above the raw stage so I started eating
or<00:00:57.840> drinking<00:00:57.989> shakes<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> third<00:00:58.800> day<00:00:59.120> which

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.560 
day and right now I'm struggling to get
500<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.320> day<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.740> think<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.150> broken

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
500 in a day I think I have broken

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.210 
500 in a day I think I have broken
through<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.380> past<00:01:25.560> couple<00:01:25.710> days<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.040> have

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
through that the past couple days I have

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.969 
through that the past couple days I have
had<00:01:26.430> lost<00:01:27.060> almost<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.600> pound<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.900> today<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.950> I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
had lost almost a pound a today so I

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.590 
had lost almost a pound a today so I
think<00:01:29.070> I'm<00:01:29.340> getting<00:01:29.579> back<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.909> track<00:01:30.090> although

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
think I'm getting back on track although

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.390 
think I'm getting back on track although
I'm<00:01:30.840> probably<00:01:30.960> another<00:01:31.380> week<00:01:31.680> if<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.100> figured

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
I'm probably another week if I figured

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.789 
I'm probably another week if I figured
it<00:01:32.520> out<00:01:32.810> but<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:33.960> way<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.140> get<00:01:34.380> more<00:01:34.590> protein

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
it out but one way to get more protein

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.940 
it out but one way to get more protein
in<00:01:35.220> through<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> day<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.329> eat<00:01:36.509> not<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.770> much

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
for each meal but it's just in my

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.509 
for each meal but it's just in my
schedule<00:02:37.200> just<00:02:37.439> doesn't<00:02:37.739> work<00:02:37.889> so<00:02:38.159> I<00:02:38.219> know<00:02:38.280> my

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519
