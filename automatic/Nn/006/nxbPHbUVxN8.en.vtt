here<00:03:31.770> then<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.340> full-back<00:03:32.700> would<00:03:32.880> be<00:03:33.000> too

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
here then the full-back would be too

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.180 
here then the full-back would be too
wide<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.230> would<00:03:34.350> not<00:03:34.470> have<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.710> good<00:03:34.770> match

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190
