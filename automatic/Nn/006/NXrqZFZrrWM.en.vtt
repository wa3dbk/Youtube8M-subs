it but you know it's it's good for
multi-threaded<00:00:56.370> applications<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:57.030> well<00:00:57.059> if

you're<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:57.989> gaming<00:00:58.410> like

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you're not just going to be gaming like

you're not just going to be gaming like
you<00:00:59.430> know<00:00:59.520> if<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.730> want<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> live<00:01:00.149> stream<00:01:00.420> as

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.240 
you know if you want a live stream as
well<00:01:00.690> since<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.530> could<00:01:01.680> take<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.980> lot<00:01:02.219> of

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
based on booze clock cpu it's six cores

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.199 
based on booze clock cpu it's six cores
it's<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:06.030> 95<00:02:06.509> watt<00:02:06.780> TDP<00:02:07.110> as<00:02:07.770> bit<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.759> cpu<00:02:09.119> is

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
it's a 95 watt TDP as bit the cpu is

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.440 
it's a 95 watt TDP as bit the cpu is
basically<00:02:09.750> like<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:11.060> 8350<00:02:12.060> except<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.420> little

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
basically like the 8350 except a little

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.730 
basically like the 8350 except a little
bit<00:02:12.720> cheaper<00:02:13.140> and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
bit cheaper and

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.000 
bit cheaper and
to<00:02:14.010> les<00:02:14.250> cours<00:02:15.290> clock<00:02:16.290> speeds<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.620> little<00:02:16.650> bit

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
to les cours clock speeds a little bit

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.550 
to les cours clock speeds a little bit
lower<00:02:17.220> but<00:02:17.610> again<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.270> CPU<00:02:18.660> overclocks<00:02:19.170> very

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
lower but again the CPU overclocks very

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.530 
lower but again the CPU overclocks very
well<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.550> if<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.760> want<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:20.970> throw<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.150> hyper<00:02:21.330> 212

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
well so if you want to throw a hyper 212

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.750 
well so if you want to throw a hyper 212
evo<00:02:21.960> on<00:02:21.990> this<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.590> boost<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.340> up<00:02:23.430> just<00:02:23.610> a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
evo on this and boost it up just a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.170 
evo on this and boost it up just a
little<00:02:23.880> bit<00:02:24.000> then<00:02:24.330> go<00:02:24.600> right<00:02:24.810> ahead<00:02:26.030> yeah<00:02:27.030> now

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
little bit then go right ahead yeah now

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.370 
little bit then go right ahead yeah now
much<00:02:27.270> more<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.480> could<00:02:27.600> say<00:02:27.660> for<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.930> next<00:02:27.990> CPU

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
much more I could say for the next CPU

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.060 
much more I could say for the next CPU

you know sandy bridge cpus worn in terms
of<00:02:46.440> TDP<00:02:46.860> but<00:02:47.670> yeah<00:02:48.630> good<00:02:48.870> cpu<00:02:49.200> overall<00:02:49.650> if<00:02:50.610> you

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
of TDP but yeah good cpu overall if you

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.730 
of TDP but yeah good cpu overall if you
do<00:02:51.000> want<00:02:51.240> you<00:02:51.360> can<00:02:51.450> go<00:02:51.480> with<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.690> 4770k<00:02:52.380> and

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
do want you can go with the 4770k and

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.410 
do want you can go with the 4770k and
overclock<00:02:53.460> it<00:02:53.490> I<00:02:53.760> don't<00:02:53.910> know<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.150> don't<00:02:54.360> know

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
overclock it I don't know I don't know

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.720 
overclock it I don't know I don't know
why<00:02:54.600> this<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:55.560> CPU<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.280> sits<00:02:56.610> slightly

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
why this the CPU it sits slightly

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.470 
why this the CPU it sits slightly
overclocked<00:02:57.390> from<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.660> 4770k<00:02:59.240> it's<00:03:00.240> just

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
overclocked from the 4770k it's just

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.020 
overclocked from the 4770k it's just
slightly<00:03:00.750> better<00:03:01.050> in<00:03:01.320> all<00:03:02.040> terms<00:03:02.580> than<00:03:02.970> the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
slightly better in all terms than the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.210 
slightly better in all terms than the
4770k<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.110> it's<00:03:04.230> like<00:03:04.350> what<00:03:04.590> forty<00:03:04.920> dollars

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
4770k and it's like what forty dollars

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.580 
4770k and it's like what forty dollars
more<00:03:05.400> something<00:03:05.610> like<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.720> yeah<00:03:07.200> for<00:03:07.500> the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
more something like that so yeah for the

if<00:03:59.760> you're<00:03:59.880> not<00:03:59.940> going<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.120> overclock<00:04:00.480> just<00:04:00.660> to

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
if you're not going to overclock just to

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.990 
if you're not going to overclock just to
keep<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:01.020> cool<00:04:01.200> under<00:04:02.040> heavy<00:04:02.250> loads<00:04:02.610> such<00:04:02.970> as

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
keep it cool under heavy loads such as

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.430 
keep it cool under heavy loads such as
you<00:04:03.270> know<00:04:03.360> video<00:04:03.630> editing<00:04:03.930> or<00:04:04.050> whatever<00:04:06.440> if

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
you know video editing or whatever if

you know video editing or whatever if
you<00:04:07.650> really<00:04:07.920> wanted<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.250> overclock<00:04:08.580> this

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
you really wanted to overclock this

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.650 
you really wanted to overclock this
thing<00:04:08.880> you'd<00:04:09.000> have<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.210> go<00:04:09.330> with<00:04:09.480> something

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
thing you'd have to go with something

expensive you know of course there are
h100i<00:04:11.730> or<00:04:12.060> someone<00:04:12.510> like<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:13.250> but<00:04:14.390> yeah<00:04:15.390> good
