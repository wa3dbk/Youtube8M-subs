00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.680
 my name is bruno bernard 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.680
 thirty years that I work at l'orÃ©al 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.930
 my specialty today and 10 have 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.130
 an expertise that is recognized is the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.950
 biology of the hair follicle 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.680
 ie the operation of the small 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.610
 organ that produces your hair so 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.199
 continuous and daily to understand 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.650
 and analyze the biology of the follicle 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.420
 it's watching biology in a small 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.980
 cube of a small test tube 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.180
 but what is fabulous is that any 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.180
 gathered biology is waiting for him 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.690
 1 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.800
 first we discovered that it was a 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.160
 absolutely unique cell reserve 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.290
 strains 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.879
 that is to say that from a follicles 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.680
 hair one can rebuild skin 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.809
 bones or build muscles 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.310
 you can re build nerves so 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.320
 that's already something of families 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.240
 the hair follicle is a structure 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.979
 extremely complex at his level 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.240
 organization it's probably up to 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.660
 most complicated organs in the 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.050
 human body 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.119
 it includes about 15 15 types 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.830
 co-operating cellular phones that dialogue 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:26.110
 with each other to make 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.440
 this horse is the only organ that has 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.090
 such at such internal balances 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.950
 which makes even a life too much outside 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.869
 of its context continues to make the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.300
 work for which it is programmed that 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.920
 if there is no equivalent the third 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.149
 point which is really fabulous for the 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.300
 game the team and I know it's the 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.060
 the only organ that in humans degenerates 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.960
 on the spot and regenerates on site 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.940
 cyclic way 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.590
 there is no other organ yet human 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.590
 who undergo this cycle of operation 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.189
 yann hair loss process that 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.359
 called androgenetic alopecia it's in 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.509
 does it's a process that is 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:09.009
 progressive with certain steps that 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.690
 follow one after the other and this 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.250
 we discovered is that actually 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.660
 follicles is an organ that is stable 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.900
 that is, it exists under two 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.690
 states a dormant state or an active state 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.470
 and from time to time he jumps out of a state 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.200
 to the other 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.730
 the idea of course is to help the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.180
 hair follicle to jump from a state 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.709
 sleeping in the active state concept of 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.360
 retouch no longer exists and the result 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.390
 is that we are today in the 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.459
 position to offer products that 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.870
 will target simultaneously 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:46.060
 different steps involved in the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.370
 hair loss understand biology 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.290
 of the hair follicle that will allow us 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.940
 in the future to propose a 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.620
 combination of assets that will block 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.650
 extremely effective way of falling from 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.650
 hair
