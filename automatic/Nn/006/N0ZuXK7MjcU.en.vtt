something's<00:03:43.569> goofy<00:03:43.930> with<00:03:44.049> that<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.260> think<00:03:44.379> the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
something's goofy with that I think the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.080 
something's goofy with that I think the
batteries<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.280> receiver<00:03:45.700> are<00:03:45.819> probably

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
batteries and the receiver are probably

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.380 
batteries and the receiver are probably
just<00:03:46.239> dead<00:03:46.930> but<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:48.160> they<00:03:48.370> run<00:03:48.760> that<00:03:48.940> by<00:03:49.120> hand

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
just dead but so they run that by hand

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.430 
just dead but so they run that by hand
but<00:03:51.480> yeah<00:03:52.480> there<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:52.900> go

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
but yeah there you go

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.430
