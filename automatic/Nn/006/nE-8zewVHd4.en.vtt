of the flashlights themselves because

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.189 
of the flashlights themselves because
this<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.310> not<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> review<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.630> flashlights

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
really but I will go over a little bit

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.910 
really but I will go over a little bit
of<00:00:31.230> them<00:00:32.510> this<00:00:33.510> first<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.260> guess<00:00:34.410> let's<00:00:34.559> start

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
of them this first I guess let's start

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.560 
of them this first I guess let's start
you<00:00:35.010> don't<00:00:35.160> well<00:00:35.940> something<00:00:36.210> interesting

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
you don't well something interesting

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.630 
you don't well something interesting
about<00:00:36.630> these<00:00:37.200> two<00:00:37.500> flashlights<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.399> Ryan

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
about these two flashlights is that Ryan

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.869 
about these two flashlights is that Ryan
has<00:00:38.940> pretty<00:00:39.270> much<00:00:39.980> branched<00:00:40.980> out<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.309> lot<00:00:41.610> in

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
has pretty much branched out a lot in

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.600 
has pretty much branched out a lot in
his<00:00:42.149> dira<00:00:42.360> coating<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.280> he's<00:00:44.280> pretty<00:00:44.430> much

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
his dira coating and he's pretty much

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.770 
his dira coating and he's pretty much
decided<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.180> he<00:00:45.270> doesn't<00:00:45.510> want<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.660> be

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
decided that he doesn't want to be

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.020 
decided that he doesn't want to be
limited<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.230> knives<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.340> Firearms<00:00:47.789> he<00:00:47.879> can

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
limited to knives and Firearms he can

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.170 
limited to knives and Firearms he can
literally<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.450> anything<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:49.170> want<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.760> I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
literally do anything you want and I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.709 
literally do anything you want and I
think<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.870> an<00:00:51.960> example<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.640> so

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
think this is just an example of that so

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.209 
think this is just an example of that so
let's<00:00:54.719> talk<00:00:55.440> about<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.800> blue<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.190> here

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
let's talk about this blue one here

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.799 
let's talk about this blue one here
first<00:00:57.859> these<00:00:58.859> are<00:00:59.039> both<00:00:59.160> Phoenix<00:00:59.670> lights<00:00:59.879> this

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
first these are both Phoenix lights this

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.030 
first these are both Phoenix lights this
blue<00:01:01.020> one<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> Phoenix<00:01:01.710> 21<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:03.390> got<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
blue one is the Phoenix 21 it's got the

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.920 
blue one is the Phoenix 21 it's got the
cree<00:01:05.040> xp-g<00:01:05.670> are<00:01:06.420> two<00:01:06.830> LED<00:01:07.830> bulb<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.340> there<00:01:08.490> and

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
cree xp-g are two LED bulb in there and

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.770 
cree xp-g are two LED bulb in there and
it's<00:01:09.930> 150<00:01:10.560> lumens<00:01:11.270> this<00:01:12.270> light<00:01:12.420> has<00:01:12.540> two

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
it's 150 lumens this light has two

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.520 
it's 150 lumens this light has two
settings<00:01:13.549> it<00:01:14.549> has<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.360> standard<00:01:15.780> setting<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
settings it has the standard setting and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.980 
settings it has the standard setting and
then<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.549> turn<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.970> little<00:01:18.000> bit<00:01:19.130> up<00:01:20.990> it

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
then if you turn it a little bit up it

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.350 
then if you turn it a little bit up it
goes<00:01:22.140> into<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.650> turbo<00:01:23.070> mode<00:01:23.280> which<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.670> 150

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
goes into the turbo mode which is 150

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.780 
goes into the turbo mode which is 150
lumens<00:01:25.640> so<00:01:26.720> there's<00:01:27.720> 150<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:29.579> there's

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
lumens so there's 150 and then there's

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.289 
lumens so there's 150 and then there's
the<00:01:29.970> standard<00:01:33.049> great<00:01:34.049> flashlight<00:01:35.030> nice<00:01:36.030> tail

what he did here this is just a proof of
concept<00:01:53.510> basically<00:01:54.140> this<00:01:54.530> is<00:01:54.590> kind<00:01:54.860> of<00:01:54.920> one<00:01:55.040> of

flashlights<00:02:16.370> are<00:02:16.459> not<00:02:16.640> easy<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.060> Dirk<00:02:17.240> out

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
flashlights are not easy to Dirk out

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.650 
flashlights are not easy to Dirk out
because<00:02:17.810> there<00:02:17.990> are<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:18.410> many<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.490> these

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
because there are so many of these

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.290 
because there are so many of these
little<00:02:20.660> grooves<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.560> different<00:02:22.340> surface

most<00:04:24.390> in<00:04:24.630> terms<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:24.960> how<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.169> select<00:04:25.500> the

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
most in terms of how you select the

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.920 
most in terms of how you select the
modes<00:04:25.890> this<00:04:26.040> has<00:04:26.190> three<00:04:26.520> modes<00:04:26.760> and<00:04:27.150> then<00:04:27.900> I

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
modes this has three modes and then I

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.909 
modes this has three modes and then I
think<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.290> has<00:04:29.180> I<00:04:30.180> think<00:04:30.690> it's<00:04:31.020> got<00:04:31.169> three

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
think it has I think it's got three

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.090 
think it has I think it's got three
different<00:04:31.950> outputs<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:33.780> believe<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.830> lowest

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
different outputs I believe the lowest

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.300 
different outputs I believe the lowest
setting<00:04:35.340> is<00:04:35.430> 5<00:04:35.669> lumens<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:37.650> next<00:04:37.890> highest<00:04:38.040> is

setting is 5 lumens the next highest is

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.680 
setting is 5 lumens the next highest is
90<00:04:38.700> lumens<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.919> max<00:04:40.919> is<00:04:41.280> 240<00:04:42.090> lumens<00:04:42.450> and

90 lumens and the max is 240 lumens and

90 lumens and the max is 240 lumens and
it<00:04:43.560> also<00:04:43.680> has<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:43.950> strobe<00:04:44.960> again<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.290> has

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
they are not brand new and that is why

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.580 
they are not brand new and that is why
this<00:05:03.240> flashlight<00:05:03.630> is<00:05:03.900> not<00:05:04.050> as<00:05:04.140> bright<00:05:04.320> as<00:05:04.470> it

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.400 
is as it should be I do not have brand
new<00:05:08.640> batteries<00:05:09.090> at<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.390> moment<00:05:09.750> so<00:05:09.870> I'm<00:05:10.140> just

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
new batteries at the moment so I'm just

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.710 
new batteries at the moment so I'm just
using<00:05:10.620> them<00:05:10.890> to<00:05:11.360> display<00:05:12.360> that<00:05:12.390> the

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
using them to display that the

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.740 
using them to display that the
flashlight<00:05:13.230> actually<00:05:13.530> works<00:05:13.740> so<00:05:14.090> anyways<00:05:15.090> so

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
flashlight actually works so anyways so

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.290 
flashlight actually works so anyways so
this<00:05:15.900> would<00:05:16.050> be<00:05:16.850> normally<00:05:17.850> this<00:05:17.970> would<00:05:18.120> be<00:05:18.210> the

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
this would be normally this would be the

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.909 
this would be normally this would be the
250<00:05:18.870> lumen<00:05:19.110> setting<00:05:19.410> right<00:05:19.560> now<00:05:19.620> it's

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
250 lumen setting right now it's

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.100 
250 lumen setting right now it's
probably<00:05:20.280> it's<00:05:21.270> much<00:05:21.539> lower<00:05:21.690> than<00:05:21.810> that<00:05:21.990> it's

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
probably it's much lower than that it's

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.900 
probably it's much lower than that it's
probably<00:05:22.320> at<00:05:22.410> about<00:05:22.500> 90

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
probably at about 90

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.860 
probably at about 90
maybe<00:05:24.510> less<00:05:24.830> and<00:05:25.830> then<00:05:26.510> all<00:05:27.510> you<00:05:27.600> have<00:05:27.630> to<00:05:27.780> do

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
maybe less and then all you have to do

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.990 
maybe less and then all you have to do
is<00:05:27.960> turn<00:05:28.080> little<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.470> the<00:05:28.560> left<00:05:28.790> you<00:05:29.790> get<00:05:29.910> that

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
is turn little to the left you get that

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.920 
is turn little to the left you get that
nice<00:05:30.180> strobe<00:05:30.540> feature<00:05:30.810> and<00:05:31.790> then<00:05:32.790> if<00:05:33.120> you<00:05:33.330> it's

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
nice strobe feature and then if you it's

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.030 
nice strobe feature and then if you it's
a<00:05:33.990> little<00:05:34.050> weird<00:05:34.260> but<00:05:34.380> if<00:05:34.560> you<00:05:34.650> turn<00:05:34.830> this

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
a little weird but if you turn this

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.680 
a little weird but if you turn this
twice<00:05:35.400> relatively<00:05:36.360> quickly<00:05:38.270> then<00:05:39.270> you're<00:05:39.480> on

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
twice relatively quickly then you're on

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.300 
twice relatively quickly then you're on
a<00:05:39.720> different<00:05:39.930> setting<00:05:40.380> up<00:05:40.650> stolen<00:05:41.100> strobe

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
a different setting up stolen strobe

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.140 
a different setting up stolen strobe

there you go now I'm on turbo with low
with<00:05:48.480> five<00:05:48.750> lumens<00:05:49.170> and<00:05:52.640> then<00:05:55.400> now<00:05:56.400> I'm<00:05:56.520> on<00:05:56.610> 50

with five lumens and then now I'm on 50

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.820 
with five lumens and then now I'm on 50
lumens<00:05:57.330> there<00:05:58.020> what<00:05:58.230> would<00:05:58.350> be<00:05:58.530> 50<00:05:58.830> lumens<00:05:59.660> so

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830
