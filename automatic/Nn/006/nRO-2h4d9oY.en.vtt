00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.629
 I delete minecraft montpoint 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.789
 running minecraft ya what to see I had 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.660

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.310
 net 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.030
 so that could see how a 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.370
 fear starts properly and that the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.240
