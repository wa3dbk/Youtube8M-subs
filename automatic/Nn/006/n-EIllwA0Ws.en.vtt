right now I'm a strong believer that SBA
is<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:02.070> huge<00:02:02.790> help<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.689> small<00:02:04.290> businesses<00:02:04.740> all

is a huge help to small businesses all
across<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.369> country<00:02:05.399> yes<00:02:06.030> but<00:02:06.829> we're<00:02:07.829> also

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
across the country yes but we're also

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.790 
across the country yes but we're also
living<00:02:08.819> at<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.060> time<00:02:09.270> when<00:02:09.450> our<00:02:09.720> government<00:02:10.349> has

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
living at a time when our government has

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.970 
living at a time when our government has
to<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.129> more<00:02:11.340> efficient

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
to be more efficient

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.770 
to be more efficient
or<00:02:12.069> lean<00:02:12.310> because<00:02:12.760> we've<00:02:13.209> got<00:02:13.300> a<00:02:13.360> lot<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.540> need

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
or lean because we've got a lot of need

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.190 
or lean because we've got a lot of need
and<00:02:14.019> we<00:02:14.379> don't<00:02:14.560> have<00:02:14.709> as<00:02:14.830> many<00:02:15.340> resources<00:02:15.610> as

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and we don't have as many resources as

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.259 
and we don't have as many resources as
we<00:02:17.200> used<00:02:17.379> to<00:02:17.500> have<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:18.489> terms<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.970> being<00:02:19.150> able

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
we used to have in terms of being able

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.000 
we used to have in terms of being able
to<00:02:19.450> advocate<00:02:19.870> on<00:02:20.049> behalf<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.440> small<00:02:20.680> business

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
to advocate on behalf of small business

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.640 
to advocate on behalf of small business
so<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:22.000> leaner<00:02:22.239> it<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:23.049> more<00:02:23.230> efficient

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
so the leaner it is the more efficient

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.229 
so the leaner it is the more efficient
it<00:02:23.739> is<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.370> better<00:02:24.519> it's<00:02:24.730> going<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.909> be<00:02:25.030> for

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
it is the better it's going to be for

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.149 
it is the better it's going to be for
those<00:02:25.330> small<00:02:25.599> businesses<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.290> I'll<00:02:26.769> still
