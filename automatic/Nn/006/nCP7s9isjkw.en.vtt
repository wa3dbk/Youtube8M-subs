explain<00:00:13.630> to<00:00:13.690> you<00:00:13.870> a<00:00:13.900> little<00:00:13.990> bit<00:00:14.139> about<00:00:14.550> it's

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:15.550 
explain to you a little bit about it's

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.920 
explain to you a little bit about it's
called<00:00:15.639> the<00:00:16.680> hot<00:00:17.680> water<00:00:17.920> safety<00:00:18.340> valve<00:00:18.550> or

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
called the hot water safety valve or

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.220 
called the hot water safety valve or
commonly<00:00:19.930> called<00:00:20.170> a<00:00:20.730> t<00:00:21.730> TR<00:00:22.330> the<00:00:22.869> hub<00:00:23.020> which<00:00:23.199> is

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
commonly called a t TR the hub which is

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.250 
commonly called a t TR the hub which is
a<00:00:23.380> temperature<00:00:24.130> pressure<00:00:24.970> well<00:00:25.779> it<00:00:25.930> really

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
a temperature pressure well it really

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.590 
a temperature pressure well it really
felt<00:00:26.529> now<00:00:27.430> how<00:00:28.060> they<00:00:28.180> work<00:00:28.390> is<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:30.180> this<00:00:31.180> is<00:00:31.539> a

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
felt now how they work is that this is a

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.770 
felt now how they work is that this is a
murse<00:00:31.869> to<00:00:32.050> not<00:00:32.199> water<00:00:32.410> tank<00:00:32.650> and<00:00:33.540> what<00:00:34.540> it<00:00:34.660> is

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
murse to not water tank and what it is

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.430 
murse to not water tank and what it is
it's<00:00:35.199> a<00:00:35.379> bi-metal<00:00:36.339> tube<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:38.110> what<00:00:38.229> I<00:00:38.260> mean<00:00:38.379> by

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
it's a bi-metal tube and what I mean by

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.500 
it's a bi-metal tube and what I mean by
wide<00:00:38.800> little<00:00:39.040> tube<00:00:39.220> is<00:00:39.430> that<00:00:39.879> on<00:00:40.150> the<00:00:40.239> out<00:00:40.330> it's

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
wide little tube is that on the out it's

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.619 
wide little tube is that on the out it's
covered<00:00:40.750> in<00:00:40.780> plastic<00:00:41.170> but<00:00:41.409> it's<00:00:41.680> actually<00:00:41.979> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
covered in plastic but it's actually a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.350 
covered in plastic but it's actually a
marine<00:00:43.629> grade<00:00:43.870> metal<00:00:44.409> tube<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.879> inside<00:00:46.210> the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
marine grade metal tube and inside the

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.229 
marine grade metal tube and inside the
tube<00:00:46.629> is<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.589> metal<00:00:47.920> rod<00:00:48.070> and<00:00:48.879> when<00:00:48.970> they<00:00:49.089> say

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
tube is a metal rod and when they say

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.350 
tube is a metal rod and when they say
bi-metal<00:00:49.600> one<00:00:50.080> metal<00:00:50.470> expands<00:00:50.920> at<00:00:51.820> a<00:00:51.879> faster

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
bi-metal one metal expands at a faster

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.750 
bi-metal one metal expands at a faster
rate<00:00:52.390> than<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.720> other<00:00:52.780> so<00:00:53.470> when<00:00:54.040> this<00:00:54.519> is

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
rate than the other so when this is

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.020 
rate than the other so when this is
immersed<00:00:55.089> in<00:00:55.269> the<00:00:55.330> hot<00:00:55.479> water<00:00:55.690> system<00:00:56.080> and<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
immersed in the hot water system and the

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.450 
immersed in the hot water system and the
hot<00:00:58.150> water<00:00:58.360> hood<00:00:58.570> goes<00:00:59.140> over<00:00:59.379> temperature<00:00:59.739> the

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
hot water hood goes over temperature the

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.420 
hot water hood goes over temperature the
inside<00:01:01.059> rod<00:01:01.390> will<00:01:02.320> express<00:01:02.920> against<00:01:03.220> the<00:01:03.339> end

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
inside rod will express against the end

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.429 
inside rod will express against the end
of<00:01:03.519> the<00:01:03.580> tube<00:01:04.019> expand<00:01:05.280> pressed<00:01:06.280> against<00:01:06.729> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
of the tube expand pressed against a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.830 
of the tube expand pressed against a
belt<00:01:08.439> inside<00:01:08.770> here<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.420> open<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.509> belt<00:01:10.689> off

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
belt inside here and open the belt off

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.719 
belt inside here and open the belt off
slightly<00:01:11.229> to<00:01:11.590> just<00:01:11.799> let<00:01:11.950> an<00:01:12.070> our<00:01:12.399> hot<00:01:12.700> water

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
slightly to just let an our hot water

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.779 
slightly to just let an our hot water
out<00:01:13.149> to<00:01:13.180> bring<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.960> system<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:15.399> temperature

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
out to bring the system the temperature

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.670 
out to bring the system the temperature
down<00:01:15.939> and<00:01:16.149> the<00:01:16.210> pressure<00:01:16.390> down<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:16.990> save

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
down and the pressure down and save

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.679 
down and the pressure down and save
health<00:01:17.920> water<00:01:18.070> system<00:01:18.430> so<00:01:18.700> that's<00:01:19.509> how<00:01:19.570> they

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
health water system so that's how they

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.020 
health water system so that's how they
work<00:01:19.899> why<00:01:20.170> metal<00:01:20.500> rod<00:01:20.649> one<00:01:21.429> rod<00:01:21.640> expands

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
work why metal rod one rod expands

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.950 
work why metal rod one rod expands
greater<00:01:22.359> than<00:01:22.539> the<00:01:22.600> other

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
greater than the other

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.980 
greater than the other
once<00:01:23.380> achieved<00:01:23.740> once<00:01:24.130> a<00:01:24.250> rod<00:01:24.429> and<00:01:24.700> one<00:01:25.570> boy<00:01:25.780> and

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
once achieved once a rod and one boy and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.719 
once achieved once a rod and one boy and
as<00:01:26.079> they've<00:01:26.259> got<00:01:26.439> expands<00:01:26.829> it<00:01:27.130> pushes<00:01:27.369> as

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
as they've got expands it pushes as

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.669 
as they've got expands it pushes as
simple<00:01:28.060> as<00:01:28.119> that<00:01:28.179> pushes<00:01:28.630> against<00:01:29.049> a<00:01:29.200> little

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
simple as that pushes against a little

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.039 
simple as that pushes against a little
valve<00:01:29.859> opens<00:01:30.280> it<00:01:30.399> up<00:01:30.490> now<00:01:31.090> also<00:01:31.659> they<00:01:31.840> have<00:01:32.020> a

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
valve opens it up now also they have a

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.810 
valve opens it up now also they have a
spring<00:01:32.530> inside<00:01:32.950> here<00:01:33.189> in<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.429> bottom<00:01:33.579> main

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
spring inside here in the bottom main

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.870 
spring inside here in the bottom main
body<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:35.200> that's<00:01:35.350> your<00:01:35.590> pressure<00:01:35.950> a<00:01:36.280> spring

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
body and that's your pressure a spring

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.499 
body and that's your pressure a spring
and<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.479> idea<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.929> that<00:01:38.079> is<00:01:38.109> it's<00:01:38.950> not

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
and the idea of that is it's not

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.310 
and the idea of that is it's not
temperature<00:01:40.509> that's<00:01:40.780> a<00:01:40.840> problem<00:01:41.200> and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
temperature that's a problem and

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.300 
temperature that's a problem and
pressure<00:01:42.310> then<00:01:43.149> any<00:01:43.539> overpressure<00:01:44.530> situation

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
pressure then any overpressure situation

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.849 
pressure then any overpressure situation
will<00:01:45.939> force<00:01:46.390> that<00:01:46.509> valve<00:01:46.899> open<00:01:47.289> and<00:01:47.469> again

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
will force that valve open and again

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:49.950 
will force that valve open and again
allow<00:01:48.249> water<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.609> pour<00:01:48.909> out<00:01:49.090> and<00:01:49.299> they're

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
allow water to pour out and they're

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.020 
allow water to pour out and they're
relieving<00:01:50.499> any<00:01:50.829> stress<00:01:51.520> on<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.729> hot<00:01:51.819> water

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
relieving any stress on the hot water

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.069 
relieving any stress on the hot water
system<00:01:52.390> it's<00:01:52.539> as<00:01:52.630> simple<00:01:52.749> as<00:01:52.929> that

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
system it's as simple as that

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.279 
system it's as simple as that
yeah<00:01:53.590> now<00:01:54.069> these<00:01:54.399> valves<00:01:54.840> should<00:01:55.840> be<00:01:55.960> checked

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
yeah now these valves should be checked

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.919 
yeah now these valves should be checked
for<00:01:56.380> adequate<00:01:57.009> performance<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.749> replace<00:01:58.749> the

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
for adequate performance and replace the

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.499
