00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
something and this is going to be a good

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.020 
something and this is going to be a good
methods<00:02:47.210> still<00:02:49.600> no<00:02:50.600> that's<00:02:50.870> not<00:02:51.170> good<00:02:52.030> then

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
methods still no that's not good then

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:02.350 
methods still no that's not good then
then<00:02:53.570> print<00:02:54.220> me<00:03:00.670> there<00:03:01.670> we<00:03:01.790> go<00:03:01.910> this<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.120> our

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
then print me there we go this is our

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.040 
then print me there we go this is our
all<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.140> methods<00:03:03.320> that<00:03:03.709> can<00:03:04.040> be<00:03:04.100> done<00:03:05.050> with

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
all the methods that can be done with

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.400 
all the methods that can be done with
the<00:03:06.230> cell<00:03:06.580> its<00:03:07.580> weak<00:03:07.760> do<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:08.930> do<00:03:09.170> get

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
the cell its weak do you do get

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.820 
the cell its weak do you do get
activation<00:03:09.920> energy<00:03:10.520> key<00:03:11.330> latency<00:03:11.990> get<00:03:12.440> max

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
activation energy key latency get max

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.060 
activation energy key latency get max
energy<00:03:13.130> received<00:03:13.910> get<00:03:14.900> energy<00:03:15.350> stored<00:03:15.680> which

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
energy received get energy stored which

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.759 
energy received get energy stored which
is<00:03:16.340> what<00:03:16.700> i<00:03:16.730> like<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.180> use<00:03:17.209> get<00:03:18.050> max<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.560> as<00:03:18.680> you

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
is what i like to use get max and as you

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.410 
is what i like to use get max and as you
store<00:03:19.070> to<00:03:19.250> get<00:03:19.489> max<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:20.060> he<00:03:20.209> received<00:03:22.420> said

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
store to get max and he received said

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.070 
store to get max and he received said
understand<00:03:24.290> this<00:03:24.830> could<00:03:25.100> be<00:03:25.720> this<00:03:26.720> guy<00:03:27.019> the

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
understand this could be this guy the

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.630 
understand this could be this guy the
output<00:03:29.620> so<00:03:30.620> yeah<00:03:30.739> this<00:03:30.890> is<00:03:31.070> all<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.459> methods

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
output so yeah this is all the methods

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.360 
output so yeah this is all the methods
you<00:03:32.030> can<00:03:32.090> do<00:03:32.650> now<00:03:33.650> we're<00:03:33.830> going<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.010> go<00:03:34.100> back<00:03:34.160> to

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
you can do now we're going to go back to

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.590 
you can do now we're going to go back to
our<00:03:34.640> mean<00:03:34.850> program<00:03:35.769> start<00:03:36.769> up<00:03:37.360> we're<00:03:38.360> going<00:03:38.480> to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
our mean program start up we're going to

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.880 
our mean program start up we're going to
do<00:03:38.780> first<00:03:41.650> cell<00:03:42.650> dot<00:03:43.430> wait<00:03:44.350> we<00:03:45.350> have<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:45.500> put<00:03:45.769> it

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
do first cell dot wait we have to put it

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.460 
do first cell dot wait we have to put it
in<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.070> variable<00:03:46.370> swinging<00:03:46.910> at<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:47.150> energy<00:03:47.600> go

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
in a variable swinging at you energy go

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.309 
in a variable swinging at you energy go
sell<00:03:48.860> dot<00:03:49.310> yeah

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:02.130 

there<00:03:56.319> you<00:03:56.380> go<00:03:56.819> do<00:03:57.819> print<00:03:58.440> energy<00:03:59.440> and<00:04:01.140> then

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
there you go do print energy and then

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.740 
there you go do print energy and then
just<00:04:02.770> going<00:04:02.950> to<00:04:03.010> print<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.310> in<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.459> computer

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
just going to print it in the computer

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.780 
just going to print it in the computer
now<00:04:04.750> we<00:04:05.230> got<00:04:05.380> print<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.920> monitors<00:04:06.370> we<00:04:06.610> going

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
now we got print the monitors we going

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:14.040 
now we got print the monitors we going
to<00:04:06.849> do<00:04:06.970> end<00:04:07.239> up<00:04:07.420> ride<00:04:09.810> energy<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:13.780> going<00:04:13.959> to

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
to do end up ride energy you going to

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.550 
to do end up ride energy you going to
end<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.319> look<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:16.840> sleep<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:18.310> second<00:04:19.560> start

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
end to look to sleep and second start

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.790 
end to look to sleep and second start
off<00:04:21.300> so<00:04:22.300> you<00:04:22.389> see<00:04:22.570> here<00:04:22.750> we<00:04:22.900> have<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:23.290> energy

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
off so you see here we have the energy

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.930 
off so you see here we have the energy
on<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.490> thing<00:04:24.850> here<00:04:25.330> now<00:04:26.139> if<00:04:26.200> we<00:04:26.410> get<00:04:26.620> up<00:04:26.940> empty

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
on the thing here now if we get up empty

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.570 
on the thing here now if we get up empty
redstone<00:04:28.740> any<00:04:29.740> conduit<00:04:30.479> and<00:04:32.130> maybe<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.220> drill

according to the cell there you go so

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.870 
according to the cell there you go so
this<00:04:58.600> is<00:04:58.720> pretty<00:04:58.960> see<00:04:59.350> how<00:04:59.530> to<00:04:59.590> use<00:04:59.860> modems<00:05:00.310> we

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
this is pretty see how to use modems we

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.230 
this is pretty see how to use modems we
connected<00:05:01.419> a<00:05:01.660> monitor<00:05:02.440> any<00:05:02.770> sale<00:05:03.490> on<00:05:03.729> the<00:05:04.000> same

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
connected a monitor any sale on the same

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.830 
connected a monitor any sale on the same
side<00:05:04.630> which<00:05:05.620> is<00:05:05.650> this<00:05:06.130> guy<00:05:06.450> now<00:05:07.450> the<00:05:07.510> cool

activate it on the other program and and
yeah<00:05:23.890> also<00:05:24.880> this<00:05:25.780> guys<00:05:25.990> who<00:05:26.260> really<00:05:26.530> turned

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
yeah also this guys who really turned

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.230 
yeah also this guys who really turned
off<00:05:27.280> and<00:05:28.120> that<00:05:28.410> programs<00:05:29.460> problems<00:05:30.460> with<00:05:30.729> this

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
off and that programs problems with this

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.750 
off and that programs problems with this
guy<00:05:31.450> straining<00:05:31.870> off<00:05:32.050> so<00:05:32.979> it<00:05:33.280> shouldn't<00:05:33.700> really

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
guy straining off so it shouldn't really

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.170 
guy straining off so it shouldn't really
happen<00:05:34.030> to<00:05:34.240> you<00:05:34.570> and<00:05:35.610> yeah<00:05:36.610> it's<00:05:36.789> pretty<00:05:37.000> easy
