00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
trying to make town borders look good

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.950 
trying to make town borders look good
and<00:00:17.369> I'm<00:00:17.520> getting<00:00:17.760> very<00:00:17.789> sick<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.510> back<00:00:18.779> to

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
and I'm getting very sick of it back to

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.920 
and I'm getting very sick of it back to
combat<00:00:19.320> tweaking<00:00:19.710> for<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> while<00:00:20.930> basically

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
combat tweaking for a while basically

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.540 
combat tweaking for a while basically
this<00:00:22.109> tells<00:00:22.380> us<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.619> there<00:00:23.010> are<00:00:23.070> town

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
this tells us that there are town

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.540 
this tells us that there are town
borders<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.529> guess<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.769> guess<00:00:26.039> they<00:00:26.220> will<00:00:26.400> be

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
borders I guess I guess they will be

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.730 
borders I guess I guess they will be
walled<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.119> towns<00:00:27.480> not<00:00:27.900> just<00:00:28.170> random<00:00:28.380> towns

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
walled in towns not just random towns

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.830 
walled in towns not just random towns
mountain<00:00:29.220> or<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.179> could<00:00:30.420> just<00:00:30.449> mean<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
mountain or or it could just mean the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.590 
mountain or or it could just mean the
town's<00:00:31.260> borders<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> blocks<00:00:32.790> border

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
town's borders as in the blocks border

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.270 
town's borders as in the blocks border
textures<00:00:34.250> but<00:00:35.250> that's<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.640> thing<00:00:35.850> next<00:00:36.360> thing

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
textures but that's one thing next thing

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.520 
textures but that's one thing next thing
hitting<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.430> mob<00:00:38.610> while<00:00:38.820> rushing<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.390> now<00:00:40.020> sends

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
hitting a mob while rushing it now sends

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.709 
hitting a mob while rushing it now sends
them<00:00:40.710> flying<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.640> satisfying<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.600> I'm

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
them flying it is satisfying and I'm

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.990 
them flying it is satisfying and I'm
giggling<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.230> bit<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:44.250> means<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.610> he<00:00:44.820> did

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
giggling a bit this means that he did

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.229 
giggling a bit this means that he did
not<00:00:45.030> make<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.739> stop<00:00:47.610> hitting

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
not make it so you have to stop hitting

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.240 
not make it so you have to stop hitting
stuff<00:00:48.600> when<00:00:48.870> you're<00:00:48.989> running<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.590> simply

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
stuff when you're running it simply

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.330 
stuff when you're running it simply
means<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:51.379> when<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.500> hit<00:00:52.680> something<00:00:52.980> when

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
means that when you hit something when

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.090 
means that when you hit something when
you're<00:00:53.460> running<00:00:53.670> then<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.600> mob<00:00:54.780> goes<00:00:55.199> flying

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
you're running then the mob goes flying

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.270 
you're running then the mob goes flying
so<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.760> there's<00:00:57.390> knock<00:00:57.719> back<00:00:58.050> now<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.680> there's

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
so it there's knock back now and there's

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.849 
so it there's knock back now and there's
this<00:00:59.399> final<00:00:59.850> thing<00:01:00.030> which<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.859> pretty

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
this final thing which is pretty

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.939 
this final thing which is pretty
exciting<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.670> guess<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> new<00:01:04.680> mop

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
exciting I guess and that is a new mop

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.240 
exciting I guess and that is a new mop
um<00:01:05.600> if<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:07.400> look<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.729> can't<00:01:09.720> really<00:01:09.900> zoom<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.070> i

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
um if we look I can't really zoom in i

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.609 
um if we look I can't really zoom in i
guess<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:11.909> um<00:01:13.580> it's<00:01:14.580> pretty<00:01:14.729> tall<00:01:15.509> they<00:01:16.080> look

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
guess but um it's pretty tall they look

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.120 
guess but um it's pretty tall they look
like<00:01:16.650> very<00:01:16.950> tall<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.790> slender<00:01:18.650> enemies<00:01:19.650> that

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
like very tall and slender enemies that

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.640 
like very tall and slender enemies that
appear<00:01:20.640> only<00:01:20.850> during<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.450> night<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:22.470> have

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
appear only during a night they have

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
eyes that are easily seeable in the dark

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.140 
eyes that are easily seeable in the dark
