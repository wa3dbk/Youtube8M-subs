00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.269
 hello welcome to mister fine admin today 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.870
 let's talk about commodities the 

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:10.340
 third way to create passive income 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.710
 Well first of all I remind you that I 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.650
 came a lot of seriousness in like and share 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.970
 of good video now let's remember 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.380
 which are passive income are 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.720
 income that is initially worked 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.689
 a lot but then incomes come 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.509
 without working now that this investment in 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.300
 Commodities commodities are like the 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.029
 gold silver oil and so on 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.860
 etc. mainly let's talk 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.050
 of gold and silver 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.740
 because the investment in gold and silver 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.390
 it is a passive income 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.500
 good is a passive income as 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.750
 increasing its value over time 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.420
 well now let's see why the gold and 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.730
 the silver increase the value through the 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.120
 time and good and why is this moment 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.280
 in spite of everything in the long term it always goes 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.430
 increasing 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.930
 good the physical gold and silver itself 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.200
 same is black 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.710
 has a very high value density since 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.820
 that a small portion of silver gold 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.510
 it requires a great value 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.620
 increases its value over time 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.720
 but because it increases its value through 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.780
 of time this is because it increases your 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.600
 demand and good gold is limited is not 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.040
 infinite then that makes it increase 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.680
 its value 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.840
 another important option to consider the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.900
 It is good to invest in gold or silver 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.650
 is because in crisis increases its value 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.030
 it is a good refuge in times of crisis 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.540
 as well as is the support of 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.540
 many economies 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.190
 since the beginning of time gold has 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.740
 has used as currency like the 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.780
 silver that's why we can see that gold and 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.690
 Silver is the currency par excellence 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.090
 since it is the only currency that was used 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.470
 from the beginning the times and not only not 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.750
 has lost its value like the others 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.720
 coins that have disappeared but that has 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.970
 increased its value and it is the same gold 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.039
 the one that was used years ago and the one that 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.049
 use now 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.670
 how can we an easy way to acquire 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.709
 gold or silver 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.590
 good in banks sell ounces of 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.469
 Silver and centenarians is an easy way 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.420
 of acquiring these precious metals for 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:25.159
 last I want to mention that the ibarra and 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.590
 also the silver but this is short 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:30.439
 term if they see a graph through the 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.049
 always in the long term 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:35.659
 upwards and all this is due to the 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.980
 characteristics mentioned above good 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.930
