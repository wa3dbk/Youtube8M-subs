00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.340
 it's the concept of the boat and the ski of 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.920
 hiking 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.980
 so here we are actually chartering a boat 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.629
 it is actually taken directly to the port 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.670
 of troops what is already really at 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.699
 north norway 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.920
 and then we leave for an adventure of 7 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.330
 days on the boat all together so 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.300
 we were actually 14 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:33.410
 neither clients and guide with my colleague 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.680
 richard and then we lift the anchored the 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.000
 first morning here we go sailing a 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.190
 little bit in the fjords have chosen 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.180
 our ford and then they come running next 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.800
 weather and snow conditions and the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.910
 first hike here is the 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.550
 morning after taking his little 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.080
 lunch quietly in the square on 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.239
 glue the skins on the platform is 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.680
 ride in zodiac the zodiac we 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.350
 drop on the beach 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.870
 So here we have almost the skis in 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.030
 the water starts at 0 meters altitude 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.280
 and then we leave for our sleep mode 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.979
 this is our first summit in 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.870
 seal skin is often in fact the 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.940
 boat concept is to go down 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.979
 in fact in the other side the other 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.470
 pouring mountains this is what makes 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.990
 unevenness that oscillates between a thousand 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.479
 1400 meters of elevation change 1005 per day 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.280
 maximum and we actually come down in the 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.990
 were two following and the boat in 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.020
 done is that what other day in bond 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.020
 radio picks us up from the other 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.170
 side this is a point that is known and the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.910
 zodiac arrive we recharge on the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.420
 boat here it is a day a little 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.450
 cheap 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.220
 arrived on the boat and ben snack 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.520
 for everyone little soup of 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.050
 fish is the comfort that's after 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.460
 a day that from time to time can be 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.390
 a little bit difficult with the 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.180
 weather conditions it's really a 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.210
 boat and a luxury refuge welcomed 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.100
 really 4 stars we redo a 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.960
 health to be ready to restart the 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.150
 next morning to a flower top 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.580
 next two that's what kind of 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.659
 meuse the bowl then the snow in fact we have 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.989
 a bit of everything because it's true 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:13.000
 from altitude 0 with snow 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:16.280
 little bit wet with a little bit of 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.080
 of sea air that's a little bit 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.810
 heavy and then often done at the top 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.370
 it can be a very cold snow 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.049
 powder very very beautiful because there is 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.690
 a lot of precipitation anyway and 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.680
 then also a little windy so that's 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.409
 true that you have to be wary a little 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.730
 Nivology and wind slabs 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:36.050
 it is a field that remains a little bit 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.690
 delicate to manage but that's what 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.069
 do it without problems and it's 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.690
 beautiful descents so we can never 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.980
 guarantee in advance what we will find 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.500
 because it can be snow in 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.500
 cardboard a little blow but we this 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.520
 year we did real real nice ski on 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.080
 had bad weather so we had 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.550
 a lot of rainfall and a lot 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.680
 snow and suddenly we made the beautiful 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.540
 powder and you're actually doing 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.099
 the solution with two guide guides 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.300
 announcement but two guides because in 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:05.240
 actually makes the boat to 12 places so 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.160
 either we put ourselves alone with six 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.560
 customers and in fact it's the boat that 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.540
 can complement in celebration with his requests 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.750
 and with a guide mode and then we get 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.780
 always actually with my friend 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.190
 Richard who I'm used to 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.510
 work it's the fourth time 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.010
 we go there in norway 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.420
 well the field and that's our concept 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.820
 like that makes all our customers it's 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.710
 the same we know both guides 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.230
 the customers know each other and 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.400
 it's a formula that works well 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.230
 it's nice to be in this kind of 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.090
 field makes it a guide in front of a guide 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.420
 behind it is true that there is still 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.860
 a lot of steps where work or gps 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.090
 because there is fog of the bad 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.450
 time we can leave in the morning 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.610
 big beautiful 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.950
 we can have bad weather in the 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.510
 climb and again big beautiful in the 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.950
 descent it's true that working with 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.300
 two guides it's really really 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.310
 nice to guide them for customers 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.270
 also for the tour a guide in surfing he 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.270
 ran aground
