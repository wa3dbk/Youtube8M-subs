00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
Liat removing the water pump the first

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.340 
Liat removing the water pump the first
step<00:00:59.040> is<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.370> remove<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.790> two<00:00:59.970> pulleys<00:01:00.350> this

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
step is to remove the two pulleys this

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.569 
step is to remove the two pulleys this
probably<00:01:01.680> needs<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.100> moved<00:01:02.310> because

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
probably needs to be moved because

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.060 
probably needs to be moved because
there's<00:01:02.760> one<00:01:02.910> bolt<00:01:03.210> that's<00:01:03.890> obscured<00:01:04.890> by<00:01:05.040> the

remove<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.770> pulleys<00:01:12.860> okay<00:01:13.860> now<00:01:14.369> we've<00:01:14.579> need

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
remove the pulleys okay now we've need

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.789 
remove the pulleys okay now we've need
remove<00:01:15.329> the<00:01:15.479> two<00:01:15.630> pulleys<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.530> see<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
eight bolts on the water pump that we

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.010 
eight bolts on the water pump that we
need<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.600> remove<00:01:19.490> gently<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.450> screw<00:01:21.870> them

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
as we move the last of the bolts it will

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.390 
as we move the last of the bolts it will
start<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.140> leak<00:01:34.290> water<00:01:34.530> at<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.830> bottom<00:01:34.950> so

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
start to leak water at the bottom so

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.010 
start to leak water at the bottom so
prepared<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.940> catch<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.479> leaks<00:01:36.720> out<00:01:36.930> the

the<00:06:13.100> stud<00:06:15.890> using<00:06:16.890> a<00:06:17.190> special<00:06:17.760> extractor<00:06:18.560> going

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
the stud using a special extractor going

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:31.850 
the stud using a special extractor going
to<00:06:19.680> wind<00:06:19.890> it<00:06:20.130> and<00:06:20.370> tightening<00:06:21.030> back<00:06:21.180> up<00:06:30.800> now<00:06:31.800> we

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
to wind it and tightening back up now we

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.360 
to wind it and tightening back up now we
can<00:06:32.160> replace<00:06:32.400> the<00:06:32.670> tensioner<00:06:34.220> noting<00:06:35.220> the

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
can replace the tensioner noting the

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.350 
can replace the tensioner noting the
locating<00:06:36.150> peg<00:06:36.420> fits<00:06:36.870> in<00:06:37.050> a<00:06:37.110> hole<00:06:38.210> slide<00:06:39.210> it

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
locating peg fits in a hole slide it

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.840 
locating peg fits in a hole slide it
over<00:06:39.510> the<00:06:39.720> stud<00:06:40.080> and<00:06:41.070> line<00:06:41.280> it<00:06:41.430> up<00:06:41.580> with<00:06:41.640> the

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
over the stud and line it up with the

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:54.110 
over the stud and line it up with the
hole<00:06:42.140> and<00:06:43.140> replace<00:06:44.010> the<00:06:44.220> nut<00:06:52.910> okay

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
hole and replace the nut okay

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.330 
hole and replace the nut okay
now<00:06:54.360> on<00:06:54.480> refitting<00:06:54.960> the<00:06:55.050> belt<00:06:55.260> is<00:06:55.650> much<00:06:55.920> easier

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
now on refitting the belt is much easier

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.580 
now on refitting the belt is much easier
if<00:06:56.430> you<00:06:56.490> have<00:06:56.610> a<00:06:56.700> second<00:06:57.090> pair<00:06:57.300> of<00:06:57.330> hands<00:06:57.630> to

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
if you have a second pair of hands to

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.940 
if you have a second pair of hands to
pull<00:06:59.460> the<00:06:59.670> tension<00:06:59.910> up<00:07:00.240> into<00:07:00.570> position<00:07:00.950> safe

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:01.950 
pull the tension up into position safe

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.920 
pull the tension up into position safe
somebody<00:07:02.400> can<00:07:02.520> hold<00:07:02.730> it<00:07:02.850> over<00:07:02.970> there<00:07:03.150> that'll

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
somebody can hold it over there that'll

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.710 
somebody can hold it over there that'll
give<00:07:04.860> me<00:07:05.010> two<00:07:05.220> pairs<00:07:05.520> of<00:07:05.610> hands<00:07:06.060> and<00:07:06.360> I<00:07:06.390> usually

tension<00:07:30.850> that<00:07:31.850> should<00:07:32.090> tighten<00:07:32.480> up<00:07:32.510> nicely

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:32.830 
tension that should tighten up nicely

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.450
