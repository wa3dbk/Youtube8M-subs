quite rare and more than that even if a

fall board were to fall it might make a

fall board were to fall it might make a
crashing<00:01:03.390> sound<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:04.350> I've<00:01:04.470> never<00:01:04.650> seen<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
crashing sound but I've never seen a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.370 
crashing sound but I've never seen a
piano<00:01:05.369> actually<00:01:05.880> get<00:01:06.030> damaged<00:01:06.540> from<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.140> fall

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
piano actually get damaged from a fall

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.649 
piano actually get damaged from a fall
board<00:01:07.680> falling<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> fall<00:01:09.210> board<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
board falling but the fall board the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.990 
board falling but the fall board the
only<00:01:09.840> purpose<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.799> really<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.760> prevent

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
only purpose of it really is to prevent

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.840 
only purpose of it really is to prevent
dust<00:01:12.420> from<00:01:12.659> getting<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> keys<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
dust from getting on the keys so it

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.480 
dust from getting on the keys so it
doesn't<00:01:15.299> really<00:01:15.540> serve<00:01:16.229> any<00:01:16.500> other<00:01:16.890> function

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
doesn't really serve any other function

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.670 
doesn't really serve any other function
and<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:18.000> not<00:01:18.240> important<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.020> close<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.470> fall

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
and it's not important to close the fall

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.969 
and it's not important to close the fall
board<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.369> fact<00:01:20.670> if<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.960> real<00:01:22.290> ivory

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
board and in fact if you have real ivory

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.950 
board and in fact if you have real ivory
keys<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.759> want<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.240> keep<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> fall<00:01:24.720> board

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
keys you want to keep the fall board

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.679 
keys you want to keep the fall board
open<00:01:25.470> because<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.610> sunlight<00:01:27.060> will<00:01:27.299> prevent

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
open because the sunlight will prevent

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.280 
open because the sunlight will prevent
the<00:01:28.020> keys<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.710> ivory<00:01:29.070> keys<00:01:29.280> from<00:01:29.460> yellowing

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
the keys the ivory keys from yellowing

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.410 
the keys the ivory keys from yellowing
so<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.320> virtually<00:01:32.070> never<00:01:32.250> close<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:32.640> fall<00:01:33.119> board

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
so I virtually never close my fall board

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.590 
so I virtually never close my fall board
and<00:01:33.740> I<00:01:34.740> don't<00:01:35.310> think<00:01:35.610> there's<00:01:35.759> any<00:01:36.030> particular

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and I don't think there's any particular

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.780 
and I don't think there's any particular
reason<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.110> unless<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:38.009> want<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.640> know

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
reason to unless you want to you know

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.359 
reason to unless you want to you know
discourage<00:01:39.630> youngsters<00:01:40.560> from<00:01:40.829> banging<00:01:41.250> on

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
discourage youngsters from banging on

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.800 
discourage youngsters from banging on
the<00:01:41.460> piano<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:42.030> might<00:01:42.210> keep<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.540> piano

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the piano you might keep the piano

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.990 
the piano you might keep the piano
closed<00:01:43.229> for<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.710> reason<00:01:44.159> or<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.850> don't

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
closed for that reason or if you don't

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.969 
closed for that reason or if you don't
want<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> dust<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.540> keys<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.320> still

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
want to dust the keys but then you still

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.340 
want to dust the keys but then you still
have<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.159> dust<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.549> fall<00:01:47.759> board<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.659> it's<00:01:49.049> not

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
have to dust the fall board so it's not

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.800 
have to dust the fall board so it's not

a particularly essential function for a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.380 
a particularly essential function for a
piano<00:01:52.079> but<00:01:52.799> nearly<00:01:53.159> all<00:01:53.310> pianos<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.149> them

piano but nearly all pianos have them
some<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.049> may<00:01:55.170> wonder<00:01:55.409> why<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.189> called

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
some of you may wonder why is it called

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.270 
some of you may wonder why is it called
a<00:01:56.520> fall<00:01:56.790> board<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.649> we<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.770> only<00:01:58.890> theorize

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
a fall board and we can only theorize

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.789 
a fall board and we can only theorize
that<00:01:59.490> this<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> board<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.140> falls<00:02:01.469> over<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
that this is a board that falls over the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.219 
that this is a board that falls over the
keys<00:02:02.100> that's<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.060> simple<00:02:03.390> answer<00:02:03.540> if<00:02:03.960> any<00:02:04.110> of

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
keys that's the simple answer if any of

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.139 
keys that's the simple answer if any of
you<00:02:04.350> know<00:02:04.500> any<00:02:05.070> historical<00:02:05.969> significance

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
