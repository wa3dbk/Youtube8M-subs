00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.919
 it's like being on top to do what 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.919
 we do 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:22.520
 What happens in the wasteland is that there are many 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.720
 questions without any answers reach 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.520
 the base absolutely desolate and full 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.739
 of weapons or like nobody knows what 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.509
 what happened and every place and every thing that 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.250
 find open many questions 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.410
 then if you are soul margalló the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.800
 heads until you get if this happens in 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.800
 this movie 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.460
 melo 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.879
 but not 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.520
 the film deals with the internal war that 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.949
 has each of the soldiers that 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.410
 all the paranoia detonates and all 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.710
 the pain of these evils to go to that 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.729
 revenge that frustration fear 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.040
 all the feelings are unleashed in that 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.500
 moment where everyone is isolated 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.820
 not knowing what to do trying to solve 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.820
 what to see what happens in the páramo 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.840
 and they have shown some pictures and they did not know 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.530
 read a script because they did not let us 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.540
 have the script then 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.619
 we really have a different concept 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.619
 what was education 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.290
 really well we are borrowed from the base 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.290
 It has everything we need 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.870
 a place where I live 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.770
 much stronger that he started to apply the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.150
 script 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.830
 we started organizing all the trenches 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.500
 that the bottom was all that nothing 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.780
 existed was simply a game all 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.920
 this is what we build and because 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.870
 two others that are there also the 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.610
 we build 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.390
 with the help of all the soldiers that 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.390
 they were born in the fields 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.560
 and really geography consists of that 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.329
 more fortification construction 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.300
 bunkers already specific to the 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:42.490
 needs that we have russians 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.880
 There is a search for a lot of textures 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.880
 all that was women's textures 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.880
 illumination 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.049
 in the walls 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.849
 and close the shots 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.290
 with chisel and now comes the part of the 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.150
 application of effector blood 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.150
 special this know euros 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.970
 but no 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:15.450
 so solid so bearable too 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:17.560
 written and that was what motivated me to 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.690
 save us usually 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.840
 there are not so many possibilities to work 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.030
 about genre films 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.960
 so authentic so strong and so 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.270
 interesting is psychological thriller with 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.120
 a bit of terror is not a movie 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.970
 inside a genre and everything they bring 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.990
 inside you bust in that place already 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.610
 as time goes by 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.770
 they start making mistakes commit 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.540
 mistakes and so many the madness of war 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.540
 that in a moment all
