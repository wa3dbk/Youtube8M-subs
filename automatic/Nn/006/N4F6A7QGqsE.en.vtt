Pook Pook Pook Pook Pok Pook-kaaah! [chicken sounds]

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.269
What's up guys! Welcome to Slow Mo Lab!

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:06.199
Today we got a chicken egg!

00:00:06.508 --> 00:00:09.548
A small chicken egg for some reason and a BB...

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.520
And a BB gun

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.620
And we are going to shoot the egg with the BB gun and we are going to film the egg

00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:19.066
in super close up, at 25000 frames per second

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.127
in slow motion...Let's check it out!

00:00:21.127 --> 00:00:24.273
Alright, first I am going to shoot the egg at 25,000 frames per second (slow motion)

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.580
really up close, just one egg

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.229
and then we are going to do a bunch of them at the same time, maybe at a slower rate

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:32.138
Let's check it out

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.020
Alrighy, let's get to it!

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:41.439
That's how you make scrambled egg, in slow motion. Let's check it out!

00:00:42.928 --> 00:00:44.688
[slow motion music starts

00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:46.280
[slow mo shoots are fired]

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.209
[bb bullet is penetrating the egg, crashing the egg in slow mo]

00:01:01.863 --> 00:01:03.623
[bb gun shooting up close]

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.840
well that was pretty exciting I have to say

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.789
Did you see how the yolk jumped up actually from the BB

00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:17.615
and the top of the skin, I guess, or whatever it's called

00:01:17.615 --> 00:01:19.866
it looked like it was a hamlet for it

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.712
we are about it to make it even more exciting

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:25.296
I got six of the eggs...1, 2, 3 ...6 of the eggs set up

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:28.480
and I am going to shoot through them and we will see what's happen

00:01:28.586 --> 00:01:29.706
everyone ready?

00:01:30.997 --> 00:01:31.637
Let's go!

00:01:34.082 --> 00:01:36.322
Let's check it out in slow motion!

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.820
Well I hope you guys enjoyed this video, don't forget to subscribe

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.073

Peace out!

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.443
[chopping eggs with the machete] 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.140
all i am going to do is I am going to grab it on two ends, and twist it up and we are going to see it explode

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.780
