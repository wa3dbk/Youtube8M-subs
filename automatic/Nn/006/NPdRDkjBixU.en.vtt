00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.040 
not open at the top like knitting is so
you<00:00:52.320> need<00:00:52.469> an<00:00:52.680> open<00:00:53.190> stitch<00:00:53.640> marker<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.960> to

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
begin a circle we're going to begin with

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.200 
begin a circle we're going to begin with
a<00:00:57.270> slipknot<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:58.379> always<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:59.100> crochet<00:00:59.399> put

a slipknot like always with crochet put

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.729 
a slipknot like always with crochet put
that<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.510> your<00:01:00.660> hook<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.020> tighten<00:01:01.350> up<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
that on your hook and tighten up and

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.039 
that on your hook and tighten up and
you're<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.579> begin<00:01:02.940> by<00:01:03.149> crocheting<00:01:03.629> two

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
you're going to begin by crocheting two

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.670 
you're going to begin by crocheting two
chains<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.869> just<00:01:07.020> yarn<00:01:07.320> over<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.560> pull

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
chains so we just yarn over and pull

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.450 
chains so we just yarn over and pull
through<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.100> loop<00:01:08.280> twice<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.479> then<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.770> like

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
through the loop twice and then I like

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.700 
through the loop twice and then I like
to<00:01:11.610> use<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.909> bump<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> back<00:01:12.560> we're<00:01:13.560> going

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
to use the bump on the back we're going

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.800 
to use the bump on the back we're going
to<00:01:13.979> into<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> second<00:01:15.060> chain<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> one

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
to into the second chain so the one

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.660 
to into the second chain so the one
that's<00:01:15.990> farthest<00:01:16.530> from<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> hook<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.340> first

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
that's farthest from the hook the first

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.149 
that's farthest from the hook the first
one<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.150> made<00:01:18.390> we're<00:01:19.170> going<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.560> make<00:01:19.770> six

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
into that further away chain and I'm

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.420 
into that further away chain and I'm
going<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.610> make<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.150> double<00:01:27.689> crochet<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.530> I'm

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.050 
going to keep going into that same space
and<00:01:32.780> make<00:01:33.780> six<00:01:34.250> double<00:01:35.250> crochets<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.939> will

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and make six double crochets and it will

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.600 
and make six double crochets and it will
very<00:01:36.299> naturally<00:01:36.990> turn<00:01:37.920> round<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.430> make<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
very naturally turn round and make a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.359 
very naturally turn round and make a
circle<00:01:39.090> for

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.810

a join so for this first round we're

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.959 
a join so for this first round we're
going<00:02:00.619> to<00:02:00.770> double<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.429> number<00:02:01.459> of<00:02:01.759> stitches

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969

stitch<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:04.970> instead<00:04:05.329> of<00:04:05.480> putting<00:04:05.720> two<00:04:06.019> into

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
stitch so instead of putting two into

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.229 
stitch so instead of putting two into
each<00:04:06.440> one<00:04:06.709> I'm<00:04:06.890> going<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.099> put<00:04:07.280> in<00:04:07.400> two<00:04:07.819> into

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
each one I'm going to put in two into

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.089 
each one I'm going to put in two into
every<00:04:08.510> other<00:04:08.630> stitch<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:09.470> I<00:04:09.500> take<00:04:09.739> my<00:04:09.769> stitch

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
every other stitch so I take my stitch

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.910 
every other stitch so I take my stitch
marker<00:04:10.130> out<00:04:11.019> remembering<00:04:12.019> which<00:04:12.200> stitch<00:04:12.739> it's

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
marker out remembering which stitch it's

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.949 
marker out remembering which stitch it's
in<00:04:14.590> okay<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:15.820> I'm<00:04:16.820> that's<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.389> first<00:04:17.690> stitch

always going to put my hook back into so

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.650 
always going to put my hook back into so
put<00:04:22.039> my<00:04:22.130> hook<00:04:22.250> in<00:04:22.430> there<00:04:22.610> make<00:04:23.270> my<00:04:23.450> first

put my hook in there make my first

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.700 
put my hook in there make my first
stitch<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.080> round

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
stitch to the round

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.190 
stitch to the round
that's<00:04:25.460> my<00:04:25.789> new<00:04:26.060> first<00:04:26.360> stitch<00:04:26.630> so<00:04:26.810> I<00:04:26.870> need<00:04:27.080> to

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
that's my new first stitch so I need to

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.659 
that's my new first stitch so I need to
mark<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.530> again<00:04:29.770> okay<00:04:30.800> I'm<00:04:31.160> just<00:04:31.370> going

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
mark it again okay I'm just going

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.379 
mark it again okay I'm just going
through<00:04:31.699> the<00:04:31.910> leg<00:04:33.639> so<00:04:34.639> that's<00:04:34.820> one<00:04:35.090> in<00:04:35.240> that

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
through the leg so that's one in that

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:36.969 
through the leg so that's one in that
one<00:04:35.570> that's<00:04:35.750> finished<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.560> now<00:04:36.620> I'm<00:04:36.740> going<00:04:36.889> to

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
one that's finished and now I'm going to

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.690 
one that's finished and now I'm going to
put<00:04:37.160> two<00:04:37.520> in<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:38.090> next<00:04:38.360> one

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
put two in the next one

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.920 
put two in the next one
remember<00:04:40.700> we're<00:04:40.820> doubling<00:04:41.270> every<00:04:41.720> other

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
remember we're doubling every other

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.040 
remember we're doubling every other
stitch<00:04:42.440> in<00:04:42.830> this<00:04:42.979> round<00:04:43.280> okay<00:04:44.270> so<00:04:44.330> it's<00:04:44.660> one<00:04:44.900> in

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
stitch in this round okay so it's one in

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.339 
stitch in this round okay so it's one in
this<00:04:45.200> one<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.340> next<00:04:46.400> one<00:04:46.639> and<00:04:46.940> two<00:04:47.840> in<00:04:48.169> the

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
this one and the next one and two in the

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.050 
this one and the next one and two in the
next<00:04:48.470> one

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:05:01.670 

1<00:04:54.340> &amp;<00:04:55.340> 2

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.670 

and<00:05:02.340> then<00:05:02.580> one<00:05:05.060> two<00:05:06.060> if<00:05:07.020> you're<00:05:07.229> following<00:05:07.410> a

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
and then one two if you're following a

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.680 
and then one two if you're following a
pattern<00:05:08.009> it<00:05:08.250> will<00:05:08.430> tell<00:05:08.790> you<00:05:09.000> how<00:05:09.630> many

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
pattern it will tell you how many

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.420 
pattern it will tell you how many
increases<00:05:10.350> it<00:05:10.470> wants<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:10.830> to<00:05:10.860> make<00:05:11.100> it<00:05:11.310> will

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
increases it wants you to make it will

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.950 
increases it wants you to make it will
tell<00:05:11.580> you<00:05:11.669> how<00:05:11.820> often<00:05:12.030> to<00:05:12.210> do<00:05:12.449> your<00:05:12.600> increase

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
tell you how often to do your increase

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.620 
tell you how often to do your increase
and<00:05:13.199> it<00:05:13.500> will<00:05:13.620> usually<00:05:13.889> give<00:05:14.430> you<00:05:14.460> a<00:05:14.910> number<00:05:15.389> at

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
and it will usually give you a number at

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.050 
and it will usually give you a number at
the<00:05:15.780> end<00:05:15.900> of<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.259> round<00:05:16.440> to<00:05:17.220> tell<00:05:17.400> you<00:05:17.520> so<00:05:17.970> you

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
the end of the round to tell you so you

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.520 
the end of the round to tell you so you
can<00:05:18.240> count<00:05:18.630> and<00:05:18.840> see<00:05:18.960> if<00:05:19.080> you've<00:05:19.199> done<00:05:19.410> it

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
can count and see if you've done it

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.270 
can count and see if you've done it
properly<00:05:19.940> one<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:22.520> two<00:05:24.470> okay<00:05:25.470> so<00:05:26.009> we're<00:05:26.160> back

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
properly one and two okay so we're back

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.360 
properly one and two okay so we're back
to<00:05:26.610> our<00:05:27.139> marked<00:05:28.139> stitch<00:05:28.500> we<00:05:28.860> don't<00:05:29.039> crochet

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
to our marked stitch we don't crochet

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.439 
to our marked stitch we don't crochet
into<00:05:29.490> that<00:05:29.669> one<00:05:29.789> because<00:05:29.940> that's<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.180> first

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
into that one because that's the first

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.600 
into that one because that's the first
one<00:05:30.630> in<00:05:30.720> the<00:05:30.780> row<00:05:30.930> so<00:05:31.620> this<00:05:31.800> if<00:05:32.100> you<00:05:32.160> had<00:05:32.490> the

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
one in the row so this if you had the

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.740 
one in the row so this if you had the
math<00:05:32.759> you<00:05:33.150> would<00:05:33.270> know<00:05:33.389> that<00:05:33.419> this<00:05:33.690> is

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
math you would know that this is

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.570 
math you would know that this is
supposed<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:34.199> be<00:05:34.260> 18<00:05:34.710> so<00:05:34.919> let's<00:05:35.100> just<00:05:35.310> double

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
supposed to be 18 so let's just double

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.120 
supposed to be 18 so let's just double
check<00:05:35.610> 2<00:05:36.150> 4<00:05:36.630> 6<00:05:37.110> 8<00:05:37.470> 10<00:05:37.979> 12<00:05:38.490> 14<00:05:39.120> 16<00:05:39.630> and<00:05:40.080> 18<00:05:40.620> so

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
check 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 and 18 so

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.760 
check 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 and 18 so
that's<00:05:41.280> correct<00:05:41.729> so<00:05:42.570> on<00:05:42.780> the<00:05:42.930> any<00:05:43.229> following

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
that's correct so on the any following

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.750 
that's correct so on the any following
rows<00:05:44.300> you<00:05:45.300> would<00:05:45.449> then<00:05:46.070> increase<00:05:47.070> every<00:05:47.430> third

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
rows you would then increase every third

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.879 
rows you would then increase every third
stitch<00:05:48.030> so<00:05:48.570> we<00:05:48.690> started<00:05:49.020> out<00:05:49.139> by<00:05:49.320> increasing

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
stitch so we started out by increasing

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:51.620 
stitch so we started out by increasing
every<00:05:50.160> stitch<00:05:50.400> in<00:05:50.550> the<00:05:50.639> round<00:05:50.760> and<00:05:51.090> then<00:05:51.449> this

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
every stitch in the round and then this

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.450 
every stitch in the round and then this
past<00:05:51.870> one<00:05:52.139> we<00:05:52.289> increased<00:05:52.710> every<00:05:52.919> other<00:05:53.130> stitch

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
past one we increased every other stitch

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.820 
past one we increased every other stitch
so<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.180> next<00:05:54.389> one<00:05:54.660> we<00:05:54.810> would<00:05:54.960> put<00:05:55.139> one<00:05:55.620> in<00:05:55.740> the

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
so the next one we would put one in the

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.070 
so the next one we would put one in the
first<00:05:56.070> one<00:05:56.310> one<00:05:56.760> in<00:05:56.880> the<00:05:57.000> second<00:05:57.360> one<00:05:57.539> and<00:05:57.750> two

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
first one one in the second one and two

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.839 
first one one in the second one and two
in<00:05:58.229> the<00:05:58.349> third<00:05:58.380> one<00:05:58.800> and<00:05:59.010> then<00:05:59.400> 1<00:05:59.789> 1<00:06:00.150> 2<00:06:01.050> 1<00:06:01.460> 1<00:06:02.460> 2

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
in the third one and then 1 1 2 1 1 2

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.760 
in the third one and then 1 1 2 1 1 2
all<00:06:03.389> the<00:06:03.539> way<00:06:03.630> around<00:06:03.960> I<00:06:04.320> think<00:06:04.380> that<00:06:04.620> would<00:06:04.740> be

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
all the way around I think that would be

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.640 
all the way around I think that would be
24<00:06:05.490> and<00:06:05.699> then<00:06:06.479> the<00:06:06.690> next<00:06:07.199> round<00:06:07.410> would<00:06:07.590> be

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
24 and then the next round would be

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.070 
24 and then the next round would be
every<00:06:08.310> 4th<00:06:08.610> stitch<00:06:08.910> so<00:06:09.240> you<00:06:09.300> would<00:06:09.510> put<00:06:09.690> 1<00:06:09.960> in

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
every 4th stitch so you would put 1 in

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.810 
every 4th stitch so you would put 1 in
the<00:06:10.139> first<00:06:10.380> one<00:06:10.590> 1<00:06:10.770> in<00:06:10.860> the<00:06:10.949> second<00:06:11.280> one<00:06:11.430> third

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
the first one 1 in the second one third

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.850 
the first one 1 in the second one third
one<00:06:11.880> and<00:06:12.419> then<00:06:12.780> in<00:06:12.960> the<00:06:13.080> fourth<00:06:13.320> one<00:06:13.530> you<00:06:13.710> would

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
one and then in the fourth one you would

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.879 
one and then in the fourth one you would
put<00:06:14.039> 2<00:06:14.220> stitches<00:06:14.520> 1<00:06:15.360> 1<00:06:15.840> 1<00:06:16.440> 2<00:06:17.430> 1<00:06:18.090> 1<00:06:18.330> 1<00:06:18.810> 2<00:06:19.470> all<00:06:19.770> the

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
put 2 stitches 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 all the

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:21.350 
put 2 stitches 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 all the
way<00:06:19.979> around<00:06:20.310> and<00:06:20.580> it<00:06:20.940> increases

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
way around and it increases

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.000 
way around and it increases
mathematically<00:06:22.110> like<00:06:22.320> that<00:06:22.500> and<00:06:22.740> as<00:06:22.800> long<00:06:22.830> as

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
mathematically like that and as long as

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.129 
mathematically like that and as long as
you<00:06:23.220> maintain<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.970> mathematical<00:06:24.780> increase

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
you maintain the mathematical increase

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.170 
you maintain the mathematical increase
you<00:06:25.320> will<00:06:25.440> get<00:06:25.560> a<00:06:25.590> flat<00:06:25.919> disk<00:06:26.220> every<00:06:26.490> time<00:06:26.909> and

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
you will get a flat disk every time and

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.920 
you will get a flat disk every time and
you<00:06:27.240> can<00:06:27.419> make<00:06:27.539> it<00:06:27.659> as<00:06:27.780> big<00:06:27.960> as<00:06:28.199> you<00:06:28.320> want<00:06:28.620> to

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
you can make it as big as you want to

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.600 
you can make it as big as you want to
and<00:06:30.930> that's<00:06:31.050> how<00:06:31.260> you<00:06:31.320> make<00:06:31.560> a<00:06:31.740> circle<00:06:32.159> for<00:06:32.550> a

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
and that's how you make a circle for a

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.960 
and that's how you make a circle for a
left-handed<00:06:33.360> precious
