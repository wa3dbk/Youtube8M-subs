neck<00:00:49.230> out<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> back<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.640> will<00:00:50.910> go<00:00:51.809> behind

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
neck out the back so that will go behind

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.029 
neck out the back so that will go behind
the<00:00:52.649> side<00:00:52.829> panel<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.780> hook<00:00:54.780> underneath

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:04.040 

one-handed<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> I'll<00:01:01.289> hook<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:02.370> there<00:01:03.050> and

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
one-handed so I'll hook on there and

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.370 
one-handed so I'll hook on there and
then<00:01:04.230> gets<00:01:04.440> that<00:01:04.620> buckle<00:01:04.949> there<00:01:06.170> this<00:01:07.170> one

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
then gets that buckle there this one

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.650 
then gets that buckle there this one
goes<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> front<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.090> you'll<00:01:09.240> put<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.420> behind

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
goes the front so you'll put that behind

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.860 
goes the front so you'll put that behind
your<00:01:09.930> panel<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:12.090> screw<00:01:12.360> will<00:01:12.480> go<00:01:12.600> through

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
your panel the screw will go through

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.490 
your panel the screw will go through
this<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.510> in<00:01:15.510> all<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.750> buckle<00:01:16.350> there

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
this and then in all this buckle there

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.120 
this and then in all this buckle there
which<00:01:17.430> leaves<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:18.000> complicated<00:01:18.690> bit<00:01:19.040> but<00:01:20.040> not

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
which leaves a complicated bit but not

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.590 
which leaves a complicated bit but not
so<00:01:20.190> complicated<00:01:20.580> now<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.300> it<00:01:22.070> front<00:01:23.070> piece

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
so complicated now to do it front piece

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.330 
so complicated now to do it front piece
I'll<00:01:24.600> loop<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.930> around<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.350> front<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
I'll loop it around the front of the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:34.840 
I'll loop it around the front of the
tank<00:01:26.490> there<00:01:27.620> goes<00:01:28.730> the<00:01:29.730> other<00:01:29.910> side<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.860> then

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.080 

to<00:01:35.850> reveal<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> side<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.720> sink<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.770> goes

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
to reveal the side of the sink it goes

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.600 
to reveal the side of the sink it goes

underneath here and will come up in this
gap<00:01:44.910> here<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.170> go<00:01:46.320> into<00:01:46.410> the<00:01:46.530> buckle<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.810> no

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
gap here and go into the buckle so no

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.170 
gap here and go into the buckle so no
stop<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.560> now<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.520> sort<00:01:51.480> that<00:01:52.910> okay<00:01:53.910> so<00:01:54.000> you
