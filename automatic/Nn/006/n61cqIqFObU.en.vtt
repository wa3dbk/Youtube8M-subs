00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
four or five years before i upgraded and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.220 
four or five years before i upgraded and
had<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> new<00:00:31.529> computer<00:00:32.519> as<00:00:32.640> my<00:00:32.820> primary<00:00:33.239> machine

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
had a new computer as my primary machine

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.970 
had a new computer as my primary machine
and<00:00:35.420> that<00:00:36.420> was<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.870> recently<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.530> was<00:00:37.559> within

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the last six months I decided upgrade I

the last six months I decided upgrade I
had<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.110> same<00:00:40.350> computer<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:41.010> four<00:00:41.370> years<00:00:41.880> and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
had the same computer for four years and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.319 
had the same computer for four years and
you<00:00:42.270> know<00:00:42.420> what<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:43.170> was<00:00:43.380> fine<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:44.579> was<00:00:44.879> fast

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
you know what it was fine it was fast

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.229 
you know what it was fine it was fast
enough<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.050> didn't<00:00:47.040> have<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.579> many<00:00:47.730> issues

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
enough I didn't have that many issues

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.740 
enough I didn't have that many issues
with<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:50.070> lasted<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:51.030> long<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
with it and it lasted that long a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.380 
with it and it lasted that long a
question<00:00:52.440> came<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.399> other<00:00:53.489> day<00:00:53.579> from<00:00:53.730> Lynn

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390

question came in the other day from Lynn
asking<00:00:55.079> how<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.590> know<00:00:55.829> when<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.190> time<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
asking how do you know when it's time to

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.700 
asking how do you know when it's time to
just<00:00:58.590> upgrade<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.969> entire<00:01:00.360> computer<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
just upgrade the entire computer the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.740 
just upgrade the entire computer the
entire<00:01:01.920> pc<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.699> get<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> new<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.059> versus

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
entire pc and get a new one versus

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.639 
entire pc and get a new one versus
upgrading<00:01:04.619> one<00:01:04.770> component<00:01:05.100> at<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.460> time<00:01:05.670> and

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
upgrading one component at a time and

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.540 
upgrading one component at a time and
that's<00:01:07.649> a<00:01:07.770> question<00:01:07.920> that's<00:01:08.100> difficult<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
that's a question that's difficult to

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.550 
that's a question that's difficult to
answer<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:09.240> all<00:01:09.420> relative<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.080> depends<00:01:10.500> on

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
answer it's all relative it depends on

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.550 
answer it's all relative it depends on

upgrading you know the entire machine

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.740 
upgrading you know the entire machine
more<00:01:22.259> than<00:01:22.439> once<00:01:22.950> every<00:01:23.220> three<00:01:23.820> years<00:01:23.850> maybe

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
more than once every three years maybe

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.390 
more than once every three years maybe

and<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.729> not<00:01:42.240> necessary<00:01:42.979> over<00:01:43.979> that

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
and it's just not necessary over that

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.399 
and it's just not necessary over that
four-year<00:01:44.850> period<00:01:45.090> when<00:01:45.630> again<00:01:45.960> remember<00:01:46.290> I'm
