00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.300
 lg also has a lot with the gp 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.219
 For example, accessories are presented here 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.540
 also this quick circle cover on the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.340
 I come to speak the same again 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.190
 but did not want the opportunity 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.350
 miss you even the live band 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.480
 to introduce touch that's how it is 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.250
 has often knows but fitness bracelet 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.390
 What you can do here is fast 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.099
 I can not demonstrate here now 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.570
 but if you take it up from the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.580
 Movement then becomes automatic 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.940
 also the display is displayed now 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.739
 for example calorie consumption 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.660
 distance traveled or content 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.300
 how many steps do I take today? 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.309
 and that acts naturally 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.219
 along with the corresponding app 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.809
 the g3 and other smartphones but what 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.420
 me also what surprised me is 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.250
 the back here no sensor for 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.050
 pulse measurement on it is that lies 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.210
 probably that 's from lg 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.879
 a corresponding headset is also included 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.590
 pulse measurement but in the foreseeable future 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.719
 at least not for germany 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.059
 In Germany, you would have to go there 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.630
 about bluetooth 4.0 for example this 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.530
 Polar external heart rate monitor chest strap or 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.080
 use something like that 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.580
 Also prices and availability here from 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.760
 I do not know the live band touch yet 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.049
 But times I wanted to have briefly shown 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.360
 Chic, I also find this here that 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.009
 is also a novel mister time calls 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.900
 find yourself toning him 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.790
 of course I have the photos 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.770
 Ever wondered how to wear the thing 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.869
 Now I know that reminds me that way 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.000
 a little bit of this explosive belt 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.009
 themes from some science fiction film 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.570
 So he knows that will be around here 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.030
 neck laid hands it is like that 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.130
 flexible so different hall 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.360
 second ones are supported up here 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.700
 I always can easily recognize 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.390
 for example, the keys answer 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.640
 or to control the mp3 player 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.520
 and be in tune with the g3 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.159
 then the names of incoming 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.020
 announced call and back here the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.149
 are the in ear headset which will be then 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.860
 pulled out here and in the ears 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.380
 plugged in and that I then here 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.270
 just the length I can vary 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.469
 then that's just right for 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.390
 different sizes 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.190
 here is not yet known so 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.140
 and if I consume it completely clear then 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.979
 Of course I can do it here, too 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.440
 let it move in 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.730
 That's how it looks when the sound in 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.019
 finne mit deutschland comes and goes 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.150
 what price it still up to now 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.610
 not known but it was called between 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.349
 the lines also to g3 that is 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.099
 probably start as center 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.360
 july and so here's the covers 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.640
 So first of course there is every one 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.379
 amount of colors also I 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.410
 For example, something like this found here 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.599
 with his imitation leather look or something 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.280
 Whether they come to Germany I know 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.040
 not the difference again 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.519
 that is partly with partial 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.049
 without the charging function that is what I had 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.480
 yes here when already is shown again 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.209
 this wireless download is here 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.150
 Now with buy and this principle sets 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.010
 Zeuke is also continuing here at the clicks 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.340
 So that we covers, for example, 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.109
 now without me but I have earlier 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.680
 also the white one here 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.879
 seen 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.370
 that means I have here too 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.810
 wireless charging I guess 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.010
 So again, the prices are not 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.959
 known that there is a small 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.640
 there will be a difference in the prices 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.290
 that maybe a ten euro 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.030
 is cheaper or that I have no idea 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.450
 but of course I wanted to above all 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.769
 Show things like that then here 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.810
 Now she works that white one 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.169
 For example, I'm up here now 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.910
 got my watch in there and of course 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:31.260
 that I'm going out here now 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.940
 still can make it completely clear and also 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.709
 to turn off again and if I then 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.680
 then shut up that of course 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.030
 the device also gets the beta of course 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.370
 software here everything still 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.160
 mind you, we start 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.480
 you can just try again 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.669
 it sounded again now do that 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.380
 again , for example, now comes 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.180
 directly without there again the clock to 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.280
 Show that this is not yet 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.569
 everything totally one hundred percent final here 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.160
 but it's nice to see 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.310
 and of course here then 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.319
 also appropriate events displayed when 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.150
 now no idea calendar everything 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.709
 reminders or missed calls sms 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.109
 mp3 player control of course i can 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.669
 So run here but let the looks 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.379
 but also very chic in detail that 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:16.049
 is of course the question when come 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.400
 this quick circle cover and above all 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.780
 What do they cost but that's what they wanted 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.570
 At least now I also showed 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.150
 have so much accessories to make 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.720
 11 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.720
 g3 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.940
 Yes
