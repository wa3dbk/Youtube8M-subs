00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
from everybody I think top to bottom we

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.930 
from everybody I think top to bottom we
made<00:00:43.530> some<00:00:43.610> some<00:00:44.610> pretty<00:00:44.850> basic<00:00:45.149> mistakes

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.700 

if<00:00:48.359> we<00:00:48.510> make<00:00:48.660> those<00:00:48.870> kind<00:00:49.109> of<00:00:49.170> mistakes<00:00:49.230> that

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
if we make those kind of mistakes that

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.080 
if we make those kind of mistakes that
the<00:00:49.800> world<00:00:49.980> championships<00:00:50.670> were<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:50.940> trouble

those<00:01:00.149> may<00:01:01.159> what<00:01:02.159> was<00:01:02.309> key<00:01:02.519> in<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.879> mean<00:01:03.239> we

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
those may what was key in that I mean we

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.080 
those may what was key in that I mean we
had<00:01:03.839> a<00:01:03.870> lead<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.379> scott<00:01:04.649> and<00:01:04.949> tony<00:01:05.790> was<00:01:06.060> right

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
in there yeah well here's a scenario i

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.910 
in there yeah well here's a scenario i
think<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.659> reality<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.530> Tony
