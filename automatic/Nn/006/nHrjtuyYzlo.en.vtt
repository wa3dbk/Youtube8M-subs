00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:10.830
 This is it people, good morning, everything beauty comes. 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.349
 Good, I said I 'll make a video. 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:19.050
 showing the solution of the problem of failure 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:22.890
 Unfortunately, I had no solution. 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.519
 I calm down, same day, at the same time 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.490
 Night with calm stirring here working. 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.940
 with this hypothesis 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.820
 working with the finished crumb 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.399
 unlocking there carefully I did in 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:47.300
 I played with graphite I did a job there 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:51.449
 and already keep the covers here showing that 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.360
 is one more for the team the chance is going 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.710
 appear and needs to be a key 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.210
 long it is well in the south and already 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.989
 It is mounted 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.989
 It is already running 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:16.980
 The key is normal and it was not 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:20.040
 coming out was in that's it 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.580
 and I'll show you here I'll enjoy it 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.260
 Chin enjoy the video will close pound 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.080
 completed to talk about another 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:35.520
 Subject is this car he has 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:38.550
 lighting is a little hopscotch 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:49.430
 little yellow and let's just say it's a 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:52.080
 line and it has this lighting here 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.560
 this other lighting here I had 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.720
 problems with it recently 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.680
 deleted here are two luso two lights 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:07.050
 spinning is good here and one of them who 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.810
 looked at one side here and then erased 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:14.700
 the other side and I had these lights on 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:18.330
 and just kept house swapping're two 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.940
 Little hands are here to change these lights. 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.130
 here is a little simple is she stand 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:28.620
 inside this panel of controls 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:33.230
 air conditioner and you need to 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:36.660
 remove this cover and how I had it 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.630
 unhappiness I 'm not half this type 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.450
 was without the camera on the day 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.200
 so I'll leave it down here in the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:50.670
 description of the video is a link where I 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:54.630
 this structure is being 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.730
 removed in an easy and 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.170
 to be able to take much that has to 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.270
 be careful not to break the 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.720
 Kibon hangs on the video explaining 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.720
 the silver 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:12.850
 and I have other vuitton here there is a 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:15.190
 lighting inside that cushion 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:26.830
 This is where I opted for a show. 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:28.510
 here I open the car has here is that 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.450
 cushion that there is an illumination here 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.770
 also that I chose not to not switch 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.690
 lamp does not fix up a matter of 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.310
 do not stay here be the work with 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.260
 This pussy is open all the time. 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:46.620
 inside the glove compartment we have 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:56.770
 lighting also lighting also 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:58.150
 but it is not refrigerated it is more 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.670
 one 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:05.950
 another curiosity here 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:09.820
 the car alarm sensor that is 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.340
 original tape your father here this mirror 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.270
 He is not an economic factor, he is. 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.980
 only this setting here but it is not 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.790
 snapshot 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:27.730
 this side here we have door to door 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:31.840
 documents to the same theme door to door 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.669
 the moon the mirror grandson by courtesy 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.860
 we have a courtesy mirror 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.880
 original spirit of that car he he 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.750
 It was plastic and approached quite there 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.210
 making it easier to go to women only 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.970
 for anyone to use a blessed mirror 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.470
 but how did it get worn out ? 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.270
 very poor quality I went to a 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.880
 Any simple mirror glazing 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.340
 to come even I took this frame that 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:59.100
 wide track it's all dark off 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.100
 here and put in place so it's 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.840
 it's not hard for you to work he has 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.420
 Those the bitch that bore you back here has 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.280
 22 years has put everything very 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.730
 video is not for less 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:18.680
 showing also the flesh has no light of 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:20.720
 courtesy that does not have a 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.380
 third head restraint reminding that 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.500
 the 30 years palio 1,148 valves it has 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.780
 with backrest here it is very foldable 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.720
 cool but I do not have the 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:37.760
 three points is only the protective belt 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.560
 lumbar, even that's good, these people. 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.930
 I took the opportunity to talk about some 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.990
 curiosities aheta 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:48.890
 and that's it turned the keychain back on 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:52.570
 told me that it might not be the 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:55.910
 but the locking mechanism of the 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:58.280
 direction you remove thought the 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.170
 steering lock 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.410
 Let's wait and if he comes back to a 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.030
 something happens, something happens, me and me 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.770
 I'll talk to you again, I'll be back. 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:15.380
 show you a solution then it 's 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:20.289
 That's a quick video, there it is. 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:24.839
 We're closing here.
