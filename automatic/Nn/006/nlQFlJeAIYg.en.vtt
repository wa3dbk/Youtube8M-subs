by<00:00:36.050> getting<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.140> running<00:00:37.469> leap<00:00:37.800> from<00:00:38.370> a

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
by getting a running leap from a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.760 
by getting a running leap from a
building<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.540> you're<00:00:39.989> gonna<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.590> go

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
building so you're gonna see that go

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.670 
building so you're gonna see that go
down<00:00:40.920> right<00:00:41.129> now<00:00:44.870> couple<00:00:45.870> buildings<00:00:46.050> actually

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
down right now couple buildings actually

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.979 
down right now couple buildings actually
so<00:00:47.520> there<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:50.160> get<00:00:50.850> shot<00:00:51.059> up<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.870> then

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
so there it is and get shot up and then

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:00.170 
so there it is and get shot up and then
process<00:00:52.410> all<00:00:52.680> right

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.710 

our<00:01:01.180> this<00:01:01.720> one's<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.200> little<00:01:02.410> tricky<00:01:03.340> it's<00:01:03.760> a<00:01:04.030> on

got<00:01:10.870> to<00:01:11.080> go<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.230> an<00:01:11.350> upper<00:01:11.650> area<00:01:11.890> to<00:01:12.040> actually

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
got to go to an upper area to actually

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.650 
got to go to an upper area to actually
reach<00:01:12.580> it<00:01:12.730> so<00:01:12.880> I'm<00:01:13.030> starting<00:01:13.360> from<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.630> very

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
reach it so I'm starting from the very

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.440 
reach it so I'm starting from the very
start<00:01:13.960> of<00:01:14.530> where<00:01:14.830> you<00:01:15.300> hopefully<00:01:16.300> will

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
start of where you hopefully will

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.090 
start of where you hopefully will
recognize<00:01:16.930> you<00:01:17.200> go<00:01:17.290> through<00:01:17.560> this<00:01:17.620> town<00:01:17.860> right

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
recognize you go through this town right

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.370 
recognize you go through this town right
here<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.490> there's<00:01:19.090> an<00:01:19.360> elevator<00:01:19.780> that<00:01:20.020> will

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
here and there's an elevator that will

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:34.990 
here and there's an elevator that will
take<00:01:20.620> you<00:01:20.770> up

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.010 

we're<00:01:35.840> coming<00:01:36.200> across<00:01:36.380> an<00:01:36.650> electrical<00:01:38.020> fence

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
we're coming across an electrical fence

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.770 
we're coming across an electrical fence
thing<00:01:39.440> whatever<00:01:39.770> that<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:41.240> trick<00:01:41.510> with<00:01:41.660> these

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
thing whatever that the trick with these

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.719 
thing whatever that the trick with these
is<00:01:42.050> look<00:01:42.410> for<00:01:42.620> the<00:01:42.680> wire<00:01:42.890> that<00:01:43.310> comes<00:01:43.460> out<00:01:43.700> of

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
is look for the wire that comes out of

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.030 
is look for the wire that comes out of
that<00:01:43.880> well<00:01:44.330> that<00:01:44.840> supplies<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.410> power<00:01:45.770> and

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
that well that supplies the power and

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.719 
that well that supplies the power and
that<00:01:46.160> will<00:01:46.370> shut<00:01:46.490> off<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.820> power<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:48.200> way

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
that will shut off the power so the way

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.760 
that will shut off the power so the way
there's<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.820> wire<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.330> the<00:01:51.020> way<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:51.619> is

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
there's a wire and the way to it is

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.010 
there's a wire and the way to it is
right<00:01:52.250> down<00:01:52.460> there<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:52.970> then<00:01:53.150> there's<00:01:53.840> going

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
right down there and then there's going

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.660 
right down there and then there's going
to<00:01:54.080> be<00:01:54.110> a<00:01:54.170> power<00:01:54.530> box<00:01:54.830> in<00:01:55.010> there<00:01:55.160> that<00:01:55.400> you<00:01:55.520> can

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
to be a power box in there that you can

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.520 
to be a power box in there that you can
turn<00:01:55.880> off<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.510> that's<00:01:57.020> going<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.290> turn<00:01:57.470> off

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
turn off and that's going to turn off

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.469 
turn off and that's going to turn off
that<00:01:57.830> electricity<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:58.729> get<00:01:59.119> back<00:01:59.300> over

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
that electricity so you get back over

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.980 
that electricity so you get back over
there<00:02:01.030> alright<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:02.240> with<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.479> power<00:02:02.690> turned

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
there alright so with the power turned

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.510 
there alright so with the power turned
off<00:02:03.200> you're<00:02:03.470> actually<00:02:03.590> going<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:03.950> have<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.160> go

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
off you're actually going to have to go

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.880 
off you're actually going to have to go
back<00:02:04.940> up<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:06.050> elevator<00:02:06.260> that<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:06.710> took

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
back up that elevator that you took

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.490 
back up that elevator that you took
earlier<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:07.580> you<00:02:07.640> have<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:07.940> go<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.239> left

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
earlier so you have to go to the left

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.350 
earlier so you have to go to the left
hang<00:02:09.500> right<00:02:09.770> hang<00:02:10.520> another<00:02:10.640> right<00:02:10.850> into<00:02:11.270> that

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
hang right hang another right into that

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.340 
hang right hang another right into that
tunnel<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:11.840> take<00:02:11.989> that<00:02:12.140> elevator<00:02:12.350> up<00:02:12.770> again

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
tunnel and take that elevator up again

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.810 
tunnel and take that elevator up again
so<00:02:15.350> remember<00:02:15.590> keep<00:02:15.950> in<00:02:16.100> mind<00:02:16.280> out<00:02:16.459> when<00:02:16.730> you

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
so remember keep in mind out when you

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.910 
so remember keep in mind out when you
see<00:02:16.940> Electrical<00:02:17.450> fences<00:02:17.570> look<00:02:18.080> for<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.320> wire<00:02:18.620> on

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
see Electrical fences look for a wire on

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.949 
see Electrical fences look for a wire on
anything<00:02:19.520> it's<00:02:20.120> all<00:02:20.300> throughout<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.690> game

there's<00:02:21.260> going<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.470> be<00:02:21.500> those<00:02:21.739> fences<00:02:22.190> look

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
there's going to be those fences look

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.430 
there's going to be those fences look
for<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.150> wire<00:02:23.330> that's<00:02:23.630> coming<00:02:23.959> out<00:02:24.050> of<00:02:24.110> there

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
for the wire that's coming out of there

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.620 
for the wire that's coming out of there
follow<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.340> wire<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:25.940> you'll<00:02:26.060> find<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.390> fuse

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
follow that wire and you'll find a fuse

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.720 
follow that wire and you'll find a fuse
box<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.380> can<00:02:27.410> turn<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.860> off<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.370> that

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
box and you can turn that off and that

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:50.960 
box and you can turn that off and that
will<00:02:28.880> get<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.120> behind<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.630> fence
