00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 I hope you are well so me 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.940
 today I'm just too much too 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.919
 well I am very excited I am 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.809
 so glad that this day is 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.429
 finally arrived it's been three years since I 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.360
 my channel and that I had not yet 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.190
 made of emulators top 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.250
 simply because I did not want 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.960
 not do that necessarily in a park a 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.779
 little bit to the snatch can not be able 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.109
 enjoy each of you I 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.570
 really wanted to organize something pretty 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.160
 nice and super warm with spite of 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.710
 the animation of the little things to eat and 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.870
 cetera I said to myself I want to make a 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.850
 myth hop that's just obligatory but I 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.469
 really want to do something really cool 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.239
 and so with Swiss jodie we talked about it 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.320
 for weeks and weeks we 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.570
 said to himself we really need to do 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.000
 a compact complexion in it off three children 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.469
 but something really cool and so we 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.149
 did this myth up in partnership with 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.809
 marmara and we thought why do 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.670
 a thing 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.219
 why not do something really 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.289
 together but between super warm a 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.480
 little on holiday theme and so on 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.250
 in quotation marks and suddenly we had 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.010
 the idea of ​​doing this big up together so 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.990
 it will be really the first me top 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.240

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.620
 me short dope anyway and I 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.510
 do not even know how to explain to 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.280
 how much I look forward to it 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.870

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.360
 When I met you on the street is 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.190
 at an absolutely awesome time you 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.440

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.850
 all smiling and it makes me too happy 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.740
 I said to myself here I'm going to be with 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.060
 full of employment little of adana it's going 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.940
 to be just too good 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.160
 So it was just you read 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.960

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.850
 so I hope you do as much 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.920
 pleasure that it makes me happy to me 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.290
 so we really organize this together 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.150
 and we just answered the right day for 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.390
 you for it announced to you that everything 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.040
 be really finished and so and so 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.240
 here I will put the link in the bar 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.460
 info so you can 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.920
 participate in the draw which you know 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.570
 that there will be 150 people drawn at 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.670
 sort more 1 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.619
 that is, each person draws 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.690
 fate will have the right to come with the 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.410
 no one of his choice his girlfriend his 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.940
 darling his mom no matter but suddenly 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.680
 it will be three hundred people in total 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.990
 250 people drawn 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.130
 plus one each time so we said 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.750
 that it would be better to do that rather 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.090
 than to make 300 people drawn at 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.010
 fate and it may be that a girlfriend are 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.770
 drawn and not the other and so on 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.180
 advice we will do five years +1 so 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.810
 the person will be able to say with the person 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.060
 Of his choice 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.260
 and then to and then here are I 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.600
 just wanted to point out that 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.060
 no matter the draw you can 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.220
 participate until April 20 so to page 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.230
 from today until April 20th 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.090
 April 20 there will be the draw 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.310
 so be aware that even if you participate 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.140
 on April 18th you have had a chance 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.750
 to win anyway because we 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.610
 hit haven we will not do any shooting so 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.410
 already it is not us who is taking care of 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.970
 draw neither me nor julie this will be 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.890
 really marmara who will take care of everything 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.120
 that but be aware that if you participate 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.340
 in the last you can be seven 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.019
 will gain a place in quotation marks 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.480
 meetup so really we did not want 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.400
 do that yeah the first 300 the 150 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.810
 first the winners because I 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.069
 it is not cool at all because in 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.510
 who are not on youtube every 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.370
 days there are who work there are some 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.709
 will be there who will see this video 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.790
 that in three or four days you know 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.500
 that no matter when you 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.480
 will participate it would be a draw 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.739
 anyway so here we said to each other 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.379
 that it would be a lot more 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.090
 logical to do that like this and then 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.819
 here I think I told you everything 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.530
 so especially ask if you're 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.450
 minor asked the agreement had parents 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.950
 before you participate because your 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.660
 coordinates will be requested when 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.930
 of participation I believe she name 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.459
 the first name I do not know what else 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.680
 besides, but ask for your 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.150
 parents of the dukes do not disclose as 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.010
 that to your coordinates without asking them 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.510
 well do nothing with your coordinates 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.609
 we will not pick you up at your place 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.840
 but it's really for identity in 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.310
 does when after his lover 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.359
 contact by email we will send you 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.159
 your invitation 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.200
 it will really be a water but actually 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.730
 you should have to come with your 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.720
 ID in the midem for 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.069
 that we can verify that it is good 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.049
 you and not someone else 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.579
 and then that's all that is 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.349
 I have to tell you about it 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.959
 so much to I hope you will pass 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.470
 a great time with us and 300 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.660
 people 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.340
 it's not in quotation marks 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.680
 because 300 people personally 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.569
 I think it's huge but at least 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.700
 it will be very warm we will have a lot 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.260
 more privacy we can discuss everything 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.970
 the whole I could discuss with 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.739
 each of you rather than being 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.229
 with thousands of people and not 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.970
 finally be able to spend a moment 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.900
 intimate with you actually i have not so 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.580
 You see what I mean 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.349
 but here it is it will really be you want 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.330
 something warm somewhere 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.960
 very thing his girl is high school where 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.030
 it actually 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.560
 and here we are, we sincerely hope that 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.180
 it makes you happy and you 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.889
 have a great time with us 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.300
 and anyway know that these 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.320
 first of the top is that there will be 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.840
 others will have one 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.490
 I will have 1 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.320
 other issue - normally and one ways 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.350
 day will say that do not worry but 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.360
 here we are super super happy 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.080
 happy to finally offer you 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.430
 an author and that's it I think I have 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.020

 school and clairac field has very little 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.570
 for there are still people who 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.919
 work on Sunday unfortunately the 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.570
 we have done our best to 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.550
