00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
GetGo three saloon with a choice of

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.899 
GetGo three saloon with a choice of
four-cylinder<00:01:53.530> turbocharged<00:01:54.220> engines<00:01:54.700> now

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
four-cylinder turbocharged engines now

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:55.980 
four-cylinder turbocharged engines now
running<00:01:55.210> through<00:01:55.330> some<00:01:55.479> of<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.600> highlights

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
running through some of the highlights

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.249 
running through some of the highlights
now<00:01:56.320> so<00:01:56.890> there's<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.640> 1.6<00:01:58.360> litre<00:01:58.659> diesel<00:01:58.690> which

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
now so there's a 1.6 litre diesel which

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.889 
now so there's a 1.6 litre diesel which
emits<00:01:59.590> under<00:02:00.160> 100<00:02:00.880> grams<00:02:01.149> per<00:02:01.330> kilometer<00:02:01.750> of

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
emits under 100 grams per kilometer of

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.749 
emits under 100 grams per kilometer of
carbon<00:02:02.560> dioxide<00:02:03.009> so<00:02:03.160> that<00:02:03.280> means<00:02:03.460> that<00:02:03.610> it's

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
carbon dioxide so that means that it's

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:04.740 
carbon dioxide so that means that it's
free<00:02:03.910> from<00:02:04.060> road<00:02:04.300> tags

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
free from road tags

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.219 
free from road tags
they'll<00:02:05.380> also<00:02:05.560> return<00:02:06.090> 74<00:02:07.090> miles<00:02:07.479> per<00:02:07.720> gallon

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
they'll also return 74 miles per gallon

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.919 
they'll also return 74 miles per gallon
there's<00:02:08.739> also<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:09.039> 2<00:02:09.399> liter<00:02:09.670> diesel<00:02:10.090> which<00:02:10.630> is

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
there's also a 2 liter diesel which is

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.140 
there's also a 2 liter diesel which is
almost<00:02:11.680> as<00:02:11.860> economical<00:02:12.459> you<00:02:12.610> can<00:02:12.790> get<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.030> with

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
almost as economical you can get it with

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.970 
almost as economical you can get it with
184<00:02:14.140> horsepower<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.180> absolutely<00:02:16.180> flies

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
184 horsepower so it absolutely flies

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.170 
184 horsepower so it absolutely flies
thing<00:02:17.980> is<00:02:18.100> though<00:02:18.310> unless<00:02:18.550> you're<00:02:18.820> doing<00:02:19.000> mega

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
diesels I will go for the engine in this

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.500 
diesels I will go for the engine in this
car<00:02:22.570> it's<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.410> 1.4<00:02:23.980> liter<00:02:24.040> turbo<00:02:24.670> petrol<00:02:25.209> and

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
it's smooth it's extremely quiet in fact

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.910 
it's smooth it's extremely quiet in fact
you<00:02:28.209> already<00:02:28.330> know<00:02:28.569> it's<00:02:28.750> running<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.319> it's

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
you already know it's running and it's

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.400 
you already know it's running and it's
reasonably<00:02:30.340> nippy<00:02:30.760> yeah<00:02:31.329> how<00:02:31.570> do<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:31.750> say<00:02:31.959> it

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
reasonably nippy yeah how do you say it

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.860 
reasonably nippy yeah how do you say it
will<00:02:32.650> do<00:02:32.860> 60<00:02:33.790> miles<00:02:34.180> per<00:02:34.329> gallon<00:02:34.750> which<00:02:34.840> is

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
will do 60 miles per gallon which is

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.020 
will do 60 miles per gallon which is
incredible<00:02:35.620> for<00:02:35.769> a<00:02:35.829> petrol<00:02:36.280> now<00:02:36.820> there<00:02:36.940> is

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
incredible for a petrol now there is

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.490 
incredible for a petrol now there is
it's<00:02:37.209> capable<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.570> doing<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.019> is<00:02:38.140> because

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
it's capable of doing that is because

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.009 
it's capable of doing that is because
when<00:02:39.250> you're<00:02:39.400> just<00:02:39.610> cruising<00:02:40.150> along<00:02:40.269> it<00:02:40.810> goes

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
when you're just cruising along it goes

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.620 
when you're just cruising along it goes
into<00:02:41.350> cylinder<00:02:41.980> deactivation<00:02:42.280> mode<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.480> what

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
into cylinder deactivation mode and what

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.970 
into cylinder deactivation mode and what
that<00:02:43.780> means<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.170> that<00:02:44.200> instead<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.590> running<00:02:44.829> on

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
that means is that instead of running on

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.039 
that means is that instead of running on
all<00:02:45.220> four<00:02:45.610> cylinders<00:02:46.120> it's<00:02:46.510> only<00:02:46.690> running<00:02:46.930> on

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
all four cylinders it's only running on

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.069 
all four cylinders it's only running on
two<00:02:47.290> of<00:02:47.410> them<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:47.829> it<00:02:47.920> uses<00:02:48.130> less<00:02:48.430> fuel<00:02:48.870> as<00:02:49.870> with

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
two of them so it uses less fuel as with

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.470 
two of them so it uses less fuel as with
other<00:02:50.290> Audi's<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:50.950> a3<00:02:51.430> saloon<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.910> available

that's more than adequate it is of
course<00:04:25.100> head<00:04:25.400> room<00:04:25.640> because<00:04:25.970> that's<00:04:26.090> sloping

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
roofline of the slough means that it's

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.310 
roofline of the slough means that it's
not<00:04:28.550> so<00:04:28.700> good<00:04:28.910> in<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.390> back<00:04:29.570> here's<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:29.960> a3
