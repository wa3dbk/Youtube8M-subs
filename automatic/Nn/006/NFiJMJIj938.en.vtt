00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:13.639
 good day with you again tatyana 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:18.000
 today we will talk about how and when 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:22.169
 temper with petunia and how to care for already 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.820
 girlfriends not and petunias here are my petunias 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:32.520
 already grown up and petunias hybrid 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:38.070
 many-flowered which I fixed on 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:42.809
 video today spots for today April 15 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.539
 this which is planted is sown on January 27 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.620
 look at here so he let go 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.250
 acoustics all 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:55.250
 and it's urgent but it's still cold outside 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:02.010
 with children in open ground so now 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:03.080
 so that she got stronger took power and gave a wound 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.500
 flower 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:11.579
 need to move petunia to fresh air 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.490
 I will bring to the balcony while not in the sun 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.920
 although petunias are not afraid of the sun it is not 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.280
 tomato seedlings or peppers that can 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.960
 burn your petunias unusually fresh 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:29.909
 air and cool and farther in the sunshine 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:33.840
 they will stand by me until the leaves are not 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.520
 become dark green became very 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.460
 circles she it seems that she 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.020
 strong but greenhouse services 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.360
 here they are where all the tails they are ready 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.299
 hardening must not look at age 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.869
 day landing and need to look at the outside 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.509
 mind plants this here again I repeat 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.740
 why don't you pinch modern 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.250
 hybrid pita is not because they themselves 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.159
 let twigs that in this period 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.240
 Patkar lobes as usual ten times 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.240
 days but i'm feeding 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.110
 I told before how I baked and 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:22.050
 feeding total turns out every 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:24.590
 week petunia, too many-flowered she 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.680
 Of course these bushes did not give well, too 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.080
 series yes but it can already be tempered 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.360
 she had terry feathers 1 as they 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.640
 grow longer than for example short 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.830
 This one has already been sent. 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.050
 pretty evenly there is a little 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.350
 less they ok they try 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.570
 keep growing 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.680
 give a flower principle if we 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.760
 we grow petunia 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:57.270
 for yourself not for sale it is not necessary 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:02.330
 wait for a flower if we have recorded 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:06.060
 the grade can be planted in the flower bed 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:09.450
 container before it even let the best 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.350
 she suddenly sweat the earth already on constant 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:18.450
 the place will bloom lush and more beautiful than petunia 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:22.920
 there is a small, too, not everyone is allowed 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.400
 side shoots although it is not cascading 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.660
 food but don't let so modern 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.959
 hybrid petunias 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.420
 so they grow here still catch on from those 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.580
 varieties that say cascade avalanche 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.160
 you can still pinch it high 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.380
 these sticks are already impossible 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.510
 from his pinch release a lot 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.730
 shoots and in the plant can even 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.590
 die him or be ugly not 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.790
 can the flowers here are these three jars i 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.860
 exactly on our 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:59.100
 Here there is there if you can see it, too, varieties 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.850
 new but some were small i once 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.830
 I came to life later, I will not bear the little 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.830
 that is, not all that are planted in 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.760
 Odintsovo and those who have achieved great 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.760
 size and 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:20.239
 these are small large-flowered 0 low 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.590
 bushes here it started here and though 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.820
 she was saddled with a third 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.560
 but she is ready for tempering and I am her too 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.440
 I'll harden 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:35.120
 from the same sort I will spread them 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:38.960
 summed them up a lot of seating up a cup 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.210
 These are not small even greater 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.210
 did not let the side peppa I will not they 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.870
 while remain warm that is partially 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.150
 and there on hardening this grade too 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.340
 who planted the third stage until I will 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.260
 let grow up and small big 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:00.020
 By the way, those that we were treated and someone 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:02.810
 watched here they are green leaves yet 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.420
 one yellow but mostly everything 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:11.540
 cavity turned green everything grows well 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:13.540
 develops juice too its for some 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.670
 reasons for part of the seed 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.550
 were seen weaker and developing 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:23.140
 worse so I'll take this part here 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:29.950
 here obviously there was already a flower 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:36.410
 I will send this part to hardening 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:38.270
 rap feasts the court he but he was still young 1 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.940
 it was already possible to order well, I'll leave it all 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.930
 before hitting become a little bit they got sick 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.680
 after 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:50.050
 depart after the transplant had been ill 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:53.420
 Now they develop normally grow 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.820
 after spraying the leaves are not yet 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.880
 settlements but the middle is already green and 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:02.060
 grow i'm observed grows she will grow 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.860
 just a little later so bye this soup 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.860
 not hardened 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:17.850
 real cascade days ampelous 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:20.100
 petunia utena planted last juice 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.980
 it will be visible only leaves 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.770
 appear and immediately go side 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.880
 shoots for still small it will grow 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:31.110
 I'm warm 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:34.500
 but again this proves that if 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.270
 we pinch the tip then from these 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.720
 side shoots should appear more 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:42.330
 more so they go between each 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.760
 this groove otherwise paints with a leaf therefore 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:48.660
 not that is it still small let 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:54.080
 I'm getting older 4 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.080
 their la. sending to order and part 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.900
 growing up there are still little ones 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:05.820
 who still think to grow and we don't grow 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.930
 let them stay warm and us this well 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.660
 temper me already 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:13.170
 I repeat the food again temper very 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:17.790
 just the main walk and fresh air and 

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:19.650
 after a day or two the sun I put them on 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:23.790
 unglazed balcony 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:26.760
 and I will bring it overnight since nights 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:30.920
 until the cold from the night about zero degrees 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:34.830
 every day well, it is too early for her petunia 

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:39.950
 very cold-resistant plant but not in 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:45.360
 such a young age get stronger and 

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:48.770
 soon all will go on this all goodbye 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.770
 to new meetings
