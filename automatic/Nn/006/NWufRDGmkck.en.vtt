00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.660
 hey love that again 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.719
 that's what the hawks have been up to 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.219
 motto and I have something for you today 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.710
 nice spread and that one 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.990
 german heart these shoes from me die 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.910
 are a bit old and dirty and so 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.140
 I can not get out and the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.820
 are just too good to throw away 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.480
 because they are still fully functional 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.730
 are 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.619
 and there we have our debt for 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.090
 you're thinking and that's woods 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.090
 once say what have thought for us 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:39.120
 tennis team simpler and with 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.969
 I paint the shoe on and on 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.539
 it is as you see looks like new 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.289
 how I'll implement the whole thing right away 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.510
 See here needs much fun 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.860
 Of course, textile dyes are looking for you 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.180
 just any came from you 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.739
 please her but you must not pack 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.199
 Otherwise, buy buys just single 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.890
 founder as you like it and for 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.960
 formal you need a pencil like that 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.470
 and then of course you need shoes on 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.820
 best with a bright color and me 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.189
 just start with my shoes 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.030
 to decorate 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:24.119
 you take the shoe and it is best 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:25.409
 if you remove the laces then 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.009
 you just start 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.770
 with a pencil the pattern what you 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.090
 you have chosen especially after I have 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.049
 me a nice zig zag pattern 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.970
 select 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.579
 For that I cook once on my mobile phone 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.290
 I 'm so beautiful 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.399
 almost this aztec with zig zag pattern 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.610
 in colorful and will now easy 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.530
 trace 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.750
 although I have now gave one 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.240
 other tactics now just want to paint 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.950
 Old newspaper and fabric in the shoe 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.950
 to make it easier 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.740
 then I just sit here with the 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.780
 pencil on and paint as free as possible 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.189
 Here's a nice zig zag pattern 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.170
 it does not have to be too perfect 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:12.940
 to look authentic 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.940
 is just what homemade are that 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.440
 is then very nice if it too 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.410
 Of course, it looks good, too 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.819
 the self made 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.519
 if you are formally that's it 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.220
 not bad I just a little bit 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:36.069
 over it and pencil can be synonymous yes 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:39.849
 So great, that's the front one 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.830
 part of the shoe I 'm starting now 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.840
 a dark blue front on the cap 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.480
 because she gets ahead of course faster 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.870
 dark and you have to be careful that you 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.570
 here, the sole not with the forest so 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.090
 a bit careful chairman 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.739
 French x 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.400
 I believe in contrast, I take here 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.379
 now just one 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.230
 bright tone of the then also the dark blue 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:08.569
 the color follows a bit 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.849
 I also washed the shoes before 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.769
 Of course it can be that now 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.049
 still some residual moisture 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:19.069
 possess the color something 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.140
 but I hope you can see that 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.739
 then to liquid more or looks wanted 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.180
 from that, of course, great too 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.400
 I have to just my template 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.780
 picture eq 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.780
 now the black ones have taken 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.540
 so the black runs a bit 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.000
 pen I think that's the yellow now 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.860
 once they top that na na because that 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.600
 this looks a bit frayed 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.860
 but do not let that alone 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.860
 unsettle just keep going 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.120
 So the bottom line is the result 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.740
 actually we have become quite beautiful 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.320
 only a few things I noticed you 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.300
 now want to give it similar to the 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.730
 make the same mistakes and that should be done 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:17.100
 you if we have a dark color first 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.959
 and then used a light color 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.380
 you should definitely the dark 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.670
 fill or let paint dry 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.380
 because the colors are the moisture 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.270
 own and that's how they run 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.370
 into each other and that's something 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.830
 happy that could mend 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.600
 but in the end I have this in here 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.050
 the bend was implemented just like me 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.720
 find 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.330
 and here I have one too 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.450
 I have had learning progress here 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.640
 white shoes can also be had 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.530
 Lastly , it had to relax 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.400
 This is also pretty good 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.290
 close 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.600
 yes that's my little learning effect now 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.250
 and now we have one again 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.930
 after that effect here once the 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.540
 dirty shoes with those and 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.690
 Removable stains and the shoe 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.430
 then almost painting is what you say 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.590
 how would you like school ? 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.690
 you do that too, I'm glad 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.970
 on your comments like to click 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.930
 That's what it came to and then until the end 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.930
 pull next time
