00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.930
 in this video we are going to generate cuts 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.320
 escaped cuts also to elevations 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.410
 let's go to the design palette and 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.570
 let's complete our drawing 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.169
 placing a floor we use the object 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.169
 called slap 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.920
 and we can use the close option 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.800
 what the program has drawn is this 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.809
 slab by selecting it in the panel 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.860
 properties we can make variations to 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.860
 its thickness for example 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.400
 and as I have seen in the previous videos 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.190
 we could use a property sets so that 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.450
 Determine what is the health area 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.770
 Now we are going to complement our 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.140
 drawing 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.140
 with a gable roof for it we go 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.150
 to use the option bluf 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.150
 and let's start from this corner 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.140
 and we are going to tell you that on this side the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.770
 ceiling is higher for this we access 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.770
 the gable option 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.100
 we indicate yes 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.760
 we click and now we are going to deactivate 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.760
 the gable option 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.620
 and we continue with the gap to two waters 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.520
 with the regular height 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.970
 finally between what we have is this 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.970
 design 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.470
 an opening in this sector where you 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.470
 we indicate the gable option we are going to 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.450
 configure the roof we mark it and you 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.850
 We indicate that the plate height option 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.530
 instead of 3 meters that is 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.530
 about the modules that are 240 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.740
 in the second place we are going to indicate to him that 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.869
 the inclination is not 45 degrees but 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.869
 that is 25 degrees 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.690
 third, the option to see what is 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.300
 the cantilever currently has 8 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.950
 centimeters 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.850
 we are going to indicate that the cantilever is 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.000
 50 centimeters 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.900
 and finally the terminations we 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.900
 they indicated this option 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.150
 The next thing we're going to do is 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.370
 project this wall until it reaches 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.040
 the lower part of the roof 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.830
 we mark the right button module 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.640
 we choose this option 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:49.010
 we select the auto project option 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.010
 we mark the roof and then inside 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.500
 and now we are going to generate the cuts 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.379
 we choose the vertical section option 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.099
 a cut passing through the roof 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:06.830
 doors and the walls we see enter 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.319
 ask what will be the depth of 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.920
 our court we are going to enter you 15 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.870
 meters 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.470
 and that 15 meters refers to this 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.800
 distance 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.820
 if we had placed a distance of 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.670
 1 centimeter 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.100
 we could not visualize this wall of 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.680
 background to generate the cut we mark 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.140
 this line right button we indicate that 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.940
 generate the section where we choose the 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.370
 option you will top 10 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.740
 finally peak point and we click 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.740
 to be shown in the section 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.109
 here you see the cut of the door and 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.389
 you can see the bottom wall that is 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.660
 this one here also observes the cut of 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.910
 the light 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.870
 by clicking on the right button and then choosing the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.280
 edit option 12 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.730
 We can make changes in the 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.730
 display 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.510
 if we make a variation in this window 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.200
 we can update the information that is 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.040
 shows in the right button cut 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.930
 we choose the option reflection 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.859
 and the same would happen if we eliminate 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.859
 window 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.310
 and we are going to generate a cut in the other 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.310
 sense 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.350
 if we want the cut to be generated 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.860
 to the other side, just make a 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.860
 mirror 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.680
 this time we are going to generate a leaked cut 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.140
 we choose the option of three section 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.510
 and unlike these elements that 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.530
 there are 12 this last element if it has 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.530
 3d rendering 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:37.129
 if we remove an element 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.129
 we can update the information 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.310
 these cuts not only go through the 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.419
 doors walls and windows or slabs also 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.159
 all the smart objects that 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.580
 let's use for example if I choose a 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.580
 stairs 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.710
 and I will generate a new cut 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.420
 or you could also update the 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.420
 information of one of the cuts 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.380
 finally they can also be generated 

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:01.380
 elevations 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:31.449
 let's see in the next video the 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:32.919
 work with lighting materials and 

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:35.520
 rendering options that it has 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:35.520
 autocad architecture
