00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
drains batteries real quick and then

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:19.749 
drains batteries real quick and then
after<00:01:18.320> that<00:01:18.469> you're<00:01:18.619> having<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.950> rely<00:01:19.249> on<00:01:19.280> glow

worst<00:01:24.439> looking<00:01:24.770> game<00:01:24.979> i<00:01:25.130> mean<00:01:25.280> the

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
worst looking game i mean the

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.099 
worst looking game i mean the
environments<00:01:25.850> get<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.209> job<00:01:26.389> done<00:01:26.659> but<00:01:26.929> the

environments get the job done but the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:28.989 
environments get the job done but the
darkness<00:01:27.530> is<00:01:27.740> more<00:01:27.979> obscuring<00:01:28.670> than<00:01:28.789> at<00:01:28.880> this

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999 
darkness is more obscuring than at this

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:30.940 
darkness is more obscuring than at this
stylistic<00:01:29.689> and<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:29.990> game<00:01:30.139> definitely<00:01:30.590> needs

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
stylistic and the game definitely needs

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.569 
stylistic and the game definitely needs
more<00:01:31.249> if<00:01:31.459> not<00:01:31.909> just<00:01:32.209> brighter<00:01:32.539> light<00:01:32.840> sources

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
more if not just brighter light sources

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.620 
more if not just brighter light sources
now<00:01:34.579> the<00:01:34.639> whole<00:01:34.819> point<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.209> game<00:01:35.329> is<00:01:35.509> to

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
now the whole point of the game is to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.029

really only a couple of hours game
playing<00:04:32.539> max<00:04:33.430> escaping<00:04:34.430> will<00:04:34.669> take<00:04:34.909> a<00:04:35.120> lot<00:04:35.419> of

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
playing max escaping will take a lot of

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.390 
playing max escaping will take a lot of
retries<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.409> only<00:04:36.710> way<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:36.860> was<00:04:37.129> able<00:04:37.280> to

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
retries the only way I was able to

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.100 
retries the only way I was able to
finish<00:04:37.639> the<00:04:37.789> game<00:04:38.000> was<00:04:38.210> because<00:04:38.539> the<00:04:38.689> monster

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
finish the game was because the monster

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.240 
finish the game was because the monster
glitched<00:04:39.439> out<00:04:39.620> during<00:04:39.949> one<00:04:40.069> of<00:04:40.099> my

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
glitched out during one of my

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.279 
glitched out during one of my
playthroughs<00:04:40.849> and<00:04:40.879> was<00:04:41.479> absent<00:04:41.960> for<00:04:42.080> pretty

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
playthroughs and was absent for pretty

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.559 
playthroughs and was absent for pretty
much<00:04:42.379> the<00:04:42.500> entire<00:04:42.680> thing<00:04:43.310> but<00:04:43.669> even<00:04:44.090> then<00:04:44.539> I

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:44.569 
much the entire thing but even then I

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:45.879 
much the entire thing but even then I
couldn't<00:04:44.930> imagine<00:04:45.080> is<00:04:45.349> taking<00:04:45.710> much<00:04:45.860> more

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
couldn't imagine is taking much more

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.920 
couldn't imagine is taking much more
longer<00:04:46.430> than<00:04:46.580> two<00:04:46.759> or<00:04:46.849> three<00:04:47.030> hours<00:04:47.270> tops<00:04:47.539> and

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
longer than two or three hours tops and

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.450 
longer than two or three hours tops and
if<00:04:48.169> you're<00:04:48.319> lucky<00:04:48.469> and<00:04:48.860> get<00:04:48.979> a<00:04:49.039> good<00:04:49.219> placement

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
if you're lucky and get a good placement

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.180 
if you're lucky and get a good placement
of<00:04:49.699> items<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.240> could<00:04:50.479> be<00:04:50.659> even<00:04:50.900> shorter<00:04:51.319> but

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
of items it could be even shorter but

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.820 
of items it could be even shorter but
still<00:04:52.250> 15<00:04:53.180> bucks<00:04:53.479> for<00:04:53.719> a<00:04:53.780> single<00:04:54.229> cargo<00:04:54.620> ship

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
still 15 bucks for a single cargo ship

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.129 
still 15 bucks for a single cargo ship
and<00:04:55.069> two<00:04:55.250> monsters<00:04:55.759> isn't<00:04:56.210> a<00:04:56.300> very<00:04:56.539> good<00:04:56.870> deal

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
and two monsters isn't a very good deal

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.080 
and two monsters isn't a very good deal
however<00:04:57.949> this<00:04:58.250> is<00:04:58.430> still<00:04:58.520> a<00:04:58.669> game<00:04:58.849> worth

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
however this is still a game worth

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.939 
however this is still a game worth
keeping<00:04:59.479> your<00:04:59.599> eye<00:04:59.629> on<00:04:59.750> the<00:05:00.229> red<00:05:00.409> eyed<00:05:00.530> monster

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
keeping your eye on the red eyed monster

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:02.439 
keeping your eye on the red eyed monster
scared<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.370> living<00:05:01.639> shit<00:05:01.669> out<00:05:02.060> of<00:05:02.240> me<00:05:02.360> the

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
scared the living shit out of me the
