many theories if you culture it it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.840 
many theories if you culture it it
rarely<00:00:48.750> causes<00:00:49.260> any<00:00:49.739> kind<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.340> bacterial

rarely causes any kind of a bacterial

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.810 
rarely causes any kind of a bacterial
growth<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:52.170> believed<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:53.070> most

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
growth so it is not believed in most

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.229 
growth so it is not believed in most
cases<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.570> be<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:55.050> bladder<00:00:55.680> infection<00:00:55.940> now<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
cases to be a bladder infection now that

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660 
cases to be a bladder infection now that
changes<00:00:57.600> with<00:00:57.960> older<00:00:58.410> cats<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.460> is

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
changes with older cats but this is

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.630 
changes with older cats but this is
really<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.090> young<00:01:00.390> cat<00:01:00.750> problem<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.620> most<00:01:02.250> cases

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
really a young cat problem in most cases

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.210 
really a young cat problem in most cases
but<00:01:03.059> if<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.629> get<00:01:03.780> an<00:01:03.930> older<00:01:04.170> cat<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
but if you get an older cat with the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.010 
but if you get an older cat with the
symptoms<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:06.210> yes<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> bladder<00:01:06.900> infection

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
symptoms then yes a bladder infection

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.950 
symptoms then yes a bladder infection
gets<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.310> list<00:01:08.549> but<00:01:09.360> most<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.810> time

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
gets on the list but most of the time

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.899 
gets on the list but most of the time
it's<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.229> young<00:01:10.470> cat<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.189> not<00:01:11.610> an

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
it's a young cat and it's not an

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.510 
it's a young cat and it's not an
infection<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.810> far<00:01:13.140> as<00:01:13.229> bacteria<00:01:13.680> goes<00:01:13.860> there

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
infection as far as bacteria goes there

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.580 
infection as far as bacteria goes there
are<00:01:14.729> some<00:01:15.420> theories<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.439> an

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
are some theories that it is an

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.310 
are some theories that it is an
inflammatory<00:01:17.310> condition<00:01:17.780> compared<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.080> one

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
inflammatory condition compared to one

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.640 
inflammatory condition compared to one
in<00:01:19.500> women<00:01:19.890> called<00:01:20.159> interstitial<00:01:20.520> cystitis

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
in women called interstitial cystitis

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.550 
in women called interstitial cystitis
there<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:23.070> one<00:01:23.430> camp<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.270> people<00:01:24.840> who<00:01:25.170> believe

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
there is one camp of people who believe

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.310 
there is one camp of people who believe
that<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.100> viral<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.810> maybe<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.290> is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
that it is viral and that maybe it is

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.710 
that it is viral and that maybe it is
caused<00:01:28.650> by<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.100> same<00:01:29.400> herpes<00:01:29.970> virus<00:01:30.450> that

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
caused by that same herpes virus that

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.429 
caused by that same herpes virus that
cats<00:01:31.049> carry<00:01:31.670> from<00:01:32.670> birth<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.450> part<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
cats carry from birth and part of the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.289 
cats carry from birth and part of the
reason<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.430> seems<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.880> come<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
reason for that is it seems to come and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.050 
reason for that is it seems to come and
go<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:37.020> stress<00:01:37.470> stressful<00:01:38.130> situations<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
go with stress stressful situations and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.550 
go with stress stressful situations and
so<00:01:40.939> many<00:01:41.939> many<00:01:42.210> people<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.750> different<00:01:43.200> views

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
so many many people have different views

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.889 
so many many people have different views
on<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.250> we've<00:01:44.610> been<00:01:44.820> working<00:01:45.030> trying<00:01:45.840> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
on it and we've been working trying to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.359 
on it and we've been working trying to
figure<00:01:46.079> out<00:01:46.140> what<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.649> best<00:01:46.829> treatment<00:01:47.070> is

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
figure out what the best treatment is

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.010 
figure out what the best treatment is
and<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.939> almost<00:01:48.119> individualize<00:01:48.840> it

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and you have to almost individualize it

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.639 
and you have to almost individualize it
to<00:01:49.140> every<00:01:49.470> cat<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.970> number<00:01:51.450> one<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
to every cat so the number one that the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.539 
to every cat so the number one that the
symptoms<00:01:53.100> are<00:01:53.280> urinating<00:01:53.759> blood<00:01:54.180> and

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
symptoms are urinating blood and

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.399 
symptoms are urinating blood and
urinating<00:01:56.549> places<00:01:57.090> outside<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.719> box<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
urinating places outside the box and

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.280 
urinating places outside the box and
maybe<00:01:58.890> painful<00:01:59.549> urination<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.479> then<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
maybe painful urination and then the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.740 
maybe painful urination and then the
very<00:02:01.469> worst<00:02:02.009> thing<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.520> happen<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:03.240> male

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
very worst thing that can happen is male

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.100 
very worst thing that can happen is male
cats<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.950> get<00:02:05.189> plugged<00:02:05.700> because<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:06.930> this

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
cats can get plugged because in this

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.499 
cats can get plugged because in this
condition<00:02:07.380> they<00:02:07.860> make<00:02:08.099> crystals<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
condition they make crystals and the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.290 
condition they make crystals and the
crystals<00:02:09.989> turn<00:02:10.500> into<00:02:11.039> plugs<00:02:11.430> with<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.910> mucus

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
crystals turn into plugs with the mucus

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.620 
crystals turn into plugs with the mucus
and<00:02:12.510> plug<00:02:12.840> up<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.230> year<00:02:13.410> we

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
and plug up the year we

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.170 
and plug up the year we
through<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.350> they<00:02:14.530> cannot<00:02:14.860> urinate<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.940> that

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
through so they cannot urinate and that
