similarities seem to see fighters I mean
quick<00:01:26.160> it's<00:01:26.369> my<00:01:26.520> first<00:01:26.789> top<00:01:27.030> speed<00:01:27.330> right

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
quick it's my first top speed right

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.109 
quick it's my first top speed right
there<00:01:27.630> very<00:01:28.050> agile<00:01:28.500> Liat<00:01:29.100> were<00:01:29.340> sort<00:01:30.030> of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
there very agile Liat were sort of

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.200 
there very agile Liat were sort of
attack<00:01:30.509> most<00:01:31.640> versus<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.820> other<00:01:32.940> ones

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
attack most versus the other ones

attack most versus the other ones
problem

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
problem

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.890 
problem
not<00:01:34.620> as<00:01:34.830> agile<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.030> quick<00:01:36.120> enter<00:01:36.480> this<00:01:36.600> lower

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
not as agile and quick enter this lower

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.980 
not as agile and quick enter this lower
speed<00:01:37.290> right<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.700> think<00:01:39.060> these<00:01:39.150> are<00:01:39.210> pretty<00:01:39.450> oh

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
speed right I think these are pretty oh

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:56.660 
speed right I think these are pretty oh
yeah<00:01:46.550> oh<00:01:47.660> yeah<00:01:49.880> that's<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.120> predominant<00:01:55.670> some

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670
