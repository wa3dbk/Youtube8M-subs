00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.489 
smart speed control system basically it
gives<00:00:34.969> you<00:00:35.149> two<00:00:35.390> speed<00:00:35.719> ranges<00:00:36.199> that<00:00:36.350> are

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:36.499 
gives you two speed ranges that are

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
slowing down the engine speed which

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.489 
slowing down the engine speed which
would<00:00:40.640> affect<00:00:40.940> blade<00:00:41.210> speed<00:00:41.570> and<00:00:41.870> quality<00:00:42.440> of
