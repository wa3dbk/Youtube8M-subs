00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello welcome one more day does bad hd 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.170
 today I bring you heading here in drones 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.840
 playing with this in 94 that the truth 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.660
 it goes quite pretty well it took her 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.429
 with as you see here in customized 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.859
 you mean monkey that I three accessories 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.789
 I do not carry it with stock but I take it with 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.519
 silencer and with hilt the truth 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.720
 as I say it goes very well I think that 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.849
 I was missing too much 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.039
 hunter not of modern warfare 3 you already know 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.500
 that hunter here is that stock that 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.300
 It is put as an accessory in weapons for 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.559
 me a fallito but by a failure of the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.140
 game that puts a flaw or a 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.149
 modification not of which to which there is 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.670
 to get used to and as you see in the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.219
 title started a new series in the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.219
 channel not a new series in which they are going to 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.770
 be parted then they will be going to put 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.770
 in the game really the ratio not of 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.390
 low deaths of that game are going to be 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.489
 games so interesting is 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.730
 quite with quite low and quite 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.170
 enough mobility not the case as it is 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.080
 living in this game because it is a 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.030
 radio plus 10 good more than ten but they're going 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.810
 to be split so radio plus 10 ratio 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.590
 more 15 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.810
 20 things like that and then good discounts more 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.329
 50 plus 75 so those are going to be the series 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.610
 this new one of this black ops because 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.189
 well there are no maps so I do not know how 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.360
 do it differently I do not also have 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.880
 thought what you told me 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.530
 you commented on many who made a 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.590
 good game that of love what would be 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.429
 30 casualties that would be the medal that 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.070
 nuclear 30 casualties and how good that yes 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.720
 really interesting and surely do not 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.539
 I know if a robot or directly upload 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.970
 games that I already have some of that 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.190
 not as I say is going to be going to 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.770
 start uploading enough games 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.090
 interesting and what was the good this 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.069
 channel not that there are many you have 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.159
 subscribed for it not because there were good 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.990
 games had no games and so what 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.789
 you have to go back to the origins we're not going to 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.689
 come back a little bit to what it was that the 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.459
 channel to the channel at the beginning not of a 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.250
 daily love, then there will be a 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:08.130
 pretty interesting game every day and 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.599
 well let's see how I do not know if 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.790
 you want for example to come back also 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.319
 the subscriber class that kind that 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.209
 gameplays with a class that you 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.250
 he said and if to see what happens 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.079
 to see if you feel like it if you feel like it 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.689
 Well, you just leave me here below 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:25.780
 comment and you put me a class I'm going to 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:27.040
 catch the first one you see today so if 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.480
 you've got here the video that 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.920
 it's two and a half minutes I do not think either 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.269
 be much then what has been said in which 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.159
 they want me to leave the 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.310
 classes I would have pointed and this 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.620
 time 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.920
 I'm going to do what I 'm talking about 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.810
 the modern warfare 3 does not make a game 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.730
 with a class and in that same game 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.650
 I will put two comments with two classes 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.239
 with two classes that seem to me 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.489
 showy or that appear to me of the 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.870
 better or worse, better for 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.700
 play not because the truth that I want 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.980
 to play with class is to know that 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.110
 see what happens and they put a 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.959
 comment or two rather and the most 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.340
 voted will be the will be the next 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.370
 heading does not follow will be the next 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.480
 episode of that is the kind of 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.709
 subscriber 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.330
 I hope that good a mole the 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.959
 initiative I believe that in modern warfare 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.430
 3 a way enough I do not know if he says it 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.810
 before other youtuber or after the 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.080
 case is that good the case is that it gives 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.260
 same as a mola the idea is and a cool the 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.319
 roll to tell me a class the worst 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.330
 possible to play because you leave it in the 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.430
 comments and I then I play in it 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.220
 I play to see what happens and see if 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.650
 we get if we get something not like 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.600
 you see here vtol I already have the vtol 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.790
 We are in round 1 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.370
 good as you see in the title a game 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.220
 I say quite interesting enough here 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.860
 here you see how to kill her in 94 for me 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.900
 a gun check and many people will say 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.720
 always call weapons check things 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.610
 cases in this game there are weapons that 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.380
 stand out and for me because if you stand out there 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.000
 I'm running out of bullets and highlights or 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.040
 if a weapon stands out for me it is a 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.500
 cheto and it 's that simple as 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.750
 highlights 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.700
 the submachine gun is soccer the rifle 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.920
 sniper although a lot of people do not 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.780
 it seems like that many people criticize me for 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.390
 to say it I have always said that to me what 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.670
 it bothers me is that I 'm shooting 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.200
 and he kills me before simply because 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.750
 that happens to all of us I do not know if you 're 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.900
 firing and the uncle then you do not have 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.060
 fortune or luck or skill can you 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.010
 even if you are killing us we are 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.970
 shooting can kill you and that's what 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.280
 only that I do not like the rifle 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.570
 sniper to me that they kill you like 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.400
 example happened to me in the previous game 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.320
 inside they killed you even 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.180
 without you even shooting 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.760
 perfect it seems to me like fucking mother but 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.140
 let him kill me just when they have already 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.570
 I'm shooting it does not seem like I'm not 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.340
 It seems very very normal and good for that 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.770
 I say I wanted to clarify the point because 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.600
 Many people have criticized me for that and 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.240
 it's just that I think no 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.190
 we should touch a little the difficulty to 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.230
 the time when you are being shot 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.510
 then kill you with the franc not a 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.520
 just upload it a little bit more and 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.740
 and would be perfect because as 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.860
 are now as far as the rest is very 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.060
 very well there that man who catches the 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.740
 door to the head three or four times 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.090
 which is very good in francs just as 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.740
 is now they do not have to touch anything else 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.030
 that that adjust that tad 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.650
 difficulty that you move a bit the 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.660
 look when you are being shot what 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.370
 good that in theory moves but in the 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.729
 practice from my point of view I do not know 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.319
 move nothing 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:28.259
 well over here we are already looking for the 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:30.659
 second the second furtive and as I say 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.610
 try this weapon so try it as 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.169
 I wear it because good to those who 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.120
 like hunter clear if we liked 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.969
 hunter then try it with another accessory 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.680
 but those who liked hunter like me 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.449
 try it with stock because the truth I 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.029
 I was throwing as I say less the 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.219
 hunter and with this one with the butt 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:49.259
 beast 5 game back game good 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:51.509
 well here I spend a little bit he sees everything 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:53.099
 the fast camera because it's nothing 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.870
 I do not know and has not seen much 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.580
 you just load up a lot of 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.349
 people until they demolish it and without more 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.930
 sometimes it lasts longer sometimes less less sometimes 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:03.360
 holds more missiles than other times but 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.279
 well I do not know the case is I did not have another 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.779
 rat to put me so because I was 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:08.430
 rising in prestige I did not have any 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:09.749
 another streak continues more or less destructive 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.219
 I put one so I put it on myself 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:16.020
 I prefer for example dogs do not 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:18.360
 in being but good did not have 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.249
 they had what it was to be and to put what 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.319
 that I always use it not and well here 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:24.120
 this is second round is already going to end 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.430
 the game as you see we are winning 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.270
 pretty easy enough with three 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.210
 flags taken 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.040
 looking at it controlling now I wanted to 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.260
 controlling from here you can also 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.990
 control pretty well with this weapon and 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.030
 as I say a pretty game 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.550
 interesting a series start that 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.890
 surely you like it if you do not 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.570
 leave in the comments that you pretend 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:50.370
 you pretend that is what you want 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:52.830
 do and good without more see us here 168 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.200
 99 is a minute and a half of departure 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.880
 but I'm going to cut it before because then 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.340
 I'm a minute looking for people who do not 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.740
 it must be that they stay 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.360
 because I do not find them killed one more 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:07.740
 after I remove it from here is the 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:10.110
 game ends here 59 4 and in the game 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.360
 final that ends 64 thing that I do not think that 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.980
 let's be here a minute to see 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.330
 to see a low it seems a bit 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.010
 absurd I find a bit boring like that 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.990
 I'm going to cut here as I say 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.000
 you leave the eye put some new series and 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.260
 Well, nothing simply I hope so 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.760
 that you liked gameplay see you 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.760
 in the next video a greeting
