00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 yes hello together this video from the 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.899
 Area neurobiology deals 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.900
 mainly with the construction of 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.550
 nerve cells so neurons one 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.549
 ordinary nerve cell ultimately in 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.880
 three sections divide the varianz 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.619
 summer for ried and action summer 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.260
 denotes the actual cell body 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.230
 the neuron here is all 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.400
 cell organelles of the nerve cell so to 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.910
 Example cell nucleus ribosomes with oranges 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.079
 or the goldbacher is striking that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.820
 There are no centers in Europe 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.730
 Central plays a central role in the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.430
 frame the cell division since these two 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.350
 Living does not exist shows that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.059
 already that the division skills 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.710
 neuronal cells with the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.199
 completed embryo development 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.989
 become the second period of 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.760
 neuron dendrites include what 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.260
 nothing but short always thinner 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.570
 Expectant continue to be the target body 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.220
 There are no cell organelles here 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.390
 the third essential period of time is 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.189
 the action or the new one is here 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.500
 in contrast to the greeks um 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.710
 a very long drive around the am 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.710
 At the end there are a little button 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.450
 we can develop a holiday 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.950
 Human spinal cord at the action 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.790
 a length of over a meter 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.100
 to reach 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.280
 to illustrate the construction 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.409
 shown here schematically 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.200
 You see the cell body here 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.960
 cell nucleus his reminder cytoplasm in 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.979
 inner ones here those are the songs 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.590
 short continuation of the body here 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.320
 is the action 's action 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.560
 is over the axis hill with the 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.899
 Connected to the cell body 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.399
 the extending action at the other end 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.990
 it's about collateral to the designs 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.479
 cell contacts via other synapses 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.840
 can either fight here at the end 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.899
 done or else if others 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.729
 Synapse your stock in this area 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.489
 so at the dendrites or the 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.900
 cell body recognizes itself further 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.470
 to put the writing 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.000
 these are nothing but fat pads 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.400
 to lay down the file 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.110
 here in the example three pieces and 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.480
 in between a little distance 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.040
 let the so-called rich lace 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.760
 without can form completely different 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.590
 respectively 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.140
 I have three of them here for you 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.360
 sketched here you can see the catching up 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:44.290
 net sound a euro countries spain and 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.870
 just a pyramid game running in the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.850
 Normal case was or was not tight 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.859
 close together but are over 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.220
 so-called glial cells from each other 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.709
 separated these cells are extreme 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.650
 tricky and have the following tasks 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.590
 on the one hand, they supply the neurons with them 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.079
 nutrients and oxygen to another 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.470
 protect the neurons 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:11.680
 So the greed count one among other 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.169
 stop giving the substrate and too good 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.470
 Finally, they still isolate and care 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.700
 so continue for an undisturbed excitement 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.760
 Now we thought the nerve fibers as 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.590
 all over is between marrow 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.750
 so-called mobilized several 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.019
 driver and sailors so not possible 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.430
 are nerve fibers to distinguish the 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.470
 central difference between these 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.299
 both types are the presence 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.919
 or missing the brand seems 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.170
 this means nothing else than that 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.640
 the tail tip 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.910
 offer several times and in action and so on 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:47.200
 a dense high-fat so mobilized 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.150
 layer make up this brand so it lies 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.489
 an immaculate nerve fiber 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.860
 so there are still black numbers 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.530
 However, this could only very loosely 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.010
 the axes so it would already be 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.989
 again 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.730
 I say goodbye and hope you 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.989
 soon back on the frog tv channel 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.989
 to welcome
