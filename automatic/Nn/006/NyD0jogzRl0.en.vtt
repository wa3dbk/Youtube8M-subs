 I do not want to talk all the same day but 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.430
 like different 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.980
 I want to make a decent proposition a 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.630
 proposition you will see is the elm this 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.630
 is put in football there's club like 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.440
 the oven pardoned elm that was 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.440
 behind a white cat 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.380
 This elm is in the FC as dust 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.910
 pardoned this elm take it to the 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.910
 first edition of manga festa 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.190
 for good to sell it this formed 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.770
 part of a large game of elms 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.130
 Cheap 5 for all of saplings 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.380
 books a bit of everything and this tree a 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.660
 man who went to buy it fell out of 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.000
 my hands in front of me and the 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.110
 pot and of course I did not want to take it to 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.550
 naked root I told him I do not know 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.050
 worried that she gave to another and 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.100
 this one I wore it I planted it when 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.900
 come here to me I do not suppose any 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.080
 problem that I'm not that good 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.080
 people 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.479
 so then look how are you not 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.440
 I have done nothing I transplant I dedicate myself to 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.280
 cultivate it and it's getting in order 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.920
 but huge look 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.260
 Look, it's starting to open more and 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.549
 I'm going to make you a proposal look like that 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.549
 the branches are long 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.610
 how are you the long branches then 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.980
 I'm going to work it but I'm going to work 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.150
 you 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.800
 I'm thinking of two possibilities 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.500
 do not tell me I can think of a 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.510
 treated by the owner everything pulls over there 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.570
 because not two possibilities 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.850
 and catch all these branches and make a 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.960
 big broom and put it like that all a bit 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.380
 in the shape of an umbrella 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.679
 or do it the weeping style obviously 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.910
 to the elms 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.940
 gives them more broom style 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.340
 but as this is pardoned 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:25.470
 It is a special tree because 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:28.709
 especially because of its history, so I'm going 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.500
 to ask you to vote 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.629
 I just opened in the ficus bonsai club 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.500
 for all of you who 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:39.530
 want to vote 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.310
 that you and you decide 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.760
 I do it here dash and we're going to put on 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.350
 I do it on a broom or do it 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.830
 weeping 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.990
 we have to do it fast because it 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.490
 has started to open buds and how do I 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.950
 make him tremble with the yolks and 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.410
 I'm going to break them all is very 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.510
 difficult then I will decide you 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.190

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.910

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:19.480
