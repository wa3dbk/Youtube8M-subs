clean<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:27.790> read<00:03:28.390> online<00:03:28.750> some<00:03:29.080> people<00:03:29.110> saying

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620

that<00:03:29.770> oh<00:03:29.860> my<00:03:30.070> gosh<00:03:30.310> after<00:03:30.610> using<00:03:30.910> this

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
that oh my gosh after using this

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.910 
that oh my gosh after using this
toothpaste<00:03:31.600> my<00:03:31.870> teeth<00:03:32.080> had<00:03:32.260> never<00:03:32.440> felt<00:03:32.740> so

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
be a placebo effect in that you spend

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.600 
be a placebo effect in that you spend
ten<00:03:37.870> dollars<00:03:38.230> on<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.410> tube<00:03:38.890> of<00:03:39.040> toothpaste<00:03:39.070> you

ten dollars on a tube of toothpaste you
