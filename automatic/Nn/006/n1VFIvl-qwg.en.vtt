my other videos and the air of 15 it did

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.459 
my other videos and the air of 15 it did
make<00:00:50.219> flashing<00:00:50.670> lights<00:00:50.910> around<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.260> this

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
make flashing lights around it but this

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.000 
make flashing lights around it but this
one<00:00:52.620> does<00:00:52.770> not<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:54.469> in<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.559> barrel<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
one does not have that in the barrel and

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.240 
one does not have that in the barrel and
the<00:00:57.000> scope<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.600> kind<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.899> weird<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:58.980> see

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the scope is kind of weird you can see

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.229 
the scope is kind of weird you can see
it's<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> plus<00:01:00.719> top<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.879> around<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
it's like a plus top and around the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.390 
it's like a plus top and around the
bottom<00:01:04.159> now<00:01:05.180> since<00:01:06.200> I've<00:01:07.200> never<00:01:07.590> saw<00:01:07.890> real<00:01:08.189> gun

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
bottom now since I've never saw real gun

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.050 
bottom now since I've never saw real gun
like<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.850> before<00:01:09.030> I'm<00:01:10.220> guessing<00:01:11.220> here<00:01:11.790> is

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
like this before I'm guessing here is

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.539 
like this before I'm guessing here is
the<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:13.110> guessing<00:01:14.100> there's<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.310> slot

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the because guessing there's a slot

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.530 
the because guessing there's a slot
they<00:01:14.760> pull<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.770> I<00:01:16.770> think<00:01:17.509> has<00:01:18.509> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
they pull that and I think has a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.260 
they pull that and I think has a
flashlight<00:01:19.100> it's<00:01:20.100> not<00:01:20.220> very<00:01:20.430> bright<00:01:20.700> then<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
flashlight it's not very bright then the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.090 
flashlight it's not very bright then the
but<00:01:21.840> if<00:01:21.900> you're<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> dark<00:01:22.320> room<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.890> works

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
but if you're in a dark room it works

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.600 
but if you're in a dark room it works
pretty<00:01:23.280> good<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:27.290> wait<00:01:28.290> no<00:01:28.770> that's<00:01:30.170> okay

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
pretty good I and wait no that's okay

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.330 
pretty good I and wait no that's okay
I'm<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:33.060> sure<00:01:33.450> what<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.590> I'm<00:01:35.159> pretty

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
I'm not sure what this is I'm pretty

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.530 
I'm not sure what this is I'm pretty
sure<00:01:35.549> that's<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.000> safety

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
sure that's the safety

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.100 
sure that's the safety
I'm<00:01:36.840> not<00:01:37.170> could<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.070> wrong<00:01:38.869> you're<00:01:39.869> not

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
I'm not could be wrong you're not

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.429 
I'm not could be wrong you're not
removable<00:01:40.650> clip<00:01:40.860> house<00:01:41.549> grip<00:01:41.939> up<00:01:42.119> here<00:01:42.479> you

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
removable clip house grip up here you

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.910 
removable clip house grip up here you
can<00:01:43.710> grab<00:01:43.979> onto<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.399> clip<00:01:44.990> but<00:01:45.990> if<00:01:46.350> your<00:01:46.619> hands

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
can grab onto the clip but if your hands

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.139 
can grab onto the clip but if your hands
are<00:01:47.100> small<00:01:47.280> enough<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.549> can't<00:01:47.850> fit<00:01:48.060> your

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
are small enough you can't fit your

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.350 
are small enough you can't fit your
hands<00:01:48.299> under<00:01:48.570> here<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.869> do<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.939> but<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:50.970> could

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
hands under here to do this but I could

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.830 
hands under here to do this but I could
be<00:01:51.509> mistaken<00:01:51.630> for<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:53.060> on<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.360> real<00:01:54.600> one

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
be mistaken for that and on the real one

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.459 
be mistaken for that and on the real one
it<00:01:55.619> looks<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:57.020> even<00:01:58.020> though<00:01:58.290> I've<00:01:58.380> never

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
it looks like even though I've never

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.880 
it looks like even though I've never
seen<00:01:58.740> one<00:01:58.920> I'm<00:01:59.490> guessing<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> pullback<00:02:00.890> thing

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
seen one I'm guessing the pullback thing

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.690 
seen one I'm guessing the pullback thing
is<00:02:02.430> right<00:02:02.790> here<00:02:03.180> cough<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.110> pullback<00:02:04.520> goes<00:02:05.520> on

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
is right here cough a pullback goes on

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.190 
is right here cough a pullback goes on

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
regular guns machine guns they just pull

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.480 
regular guns machine guns they just pull
out<00:02:10.229> from<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:11.099> thing

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
out from this thing

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.430 
out from this thing
it<00:02:11.610> looks<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> circle<00:02:12.300> here<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.170> ever<00:02:13.320> had

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
it looks like a circle here you ever had

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.840 
it looks like a circle here you ever had
a<00:02:13.470> toy<00:02:13.650> gun<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.280> doesn't<00:02:14.370> have<00:02:14.670> anything

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
a toy gun that doesn't have anything

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:22.850 
a toy gun that doesn't have anything
like<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.680> well<00:02:16.820> good<00:02:17.820> luck<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:21.650> I'm<00:02:22.650> not

I'm<00:02:26.130> not<00:02:26.820> sure<00:02:27.120> pretty<00:02:27.720> sure<00:02:27.930> tix<00:02:28.410> double-a

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
I'm not sure pretty sure tix double-a
