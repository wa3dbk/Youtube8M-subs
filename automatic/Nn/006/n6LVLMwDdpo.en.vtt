some<00:00:42.989> patterns<00:00:43.290> call<00:00:43.530> for<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.789> might<00:00:45.180> as

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
some patterns call for so we might as

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.100 
some patterns call for so we might as
well<00:00:45.360> do<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.660> while<00:00:45.870> we're<00:00:46.050> burning<00:00:46.789> anyway

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the corner is made of two chains each so

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.609 
the corner is made of two chains each so
when<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.720> double<00:01:07.530> crochet<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
when you do double crochet you have to

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.730 
when you do double crochet you have to
start<00:01:10.619> with<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> chain<00:01:11.100> three<00:01:11.580> because<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.740> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
start with a chain three because of the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.980 
start with a chain three because of the
height<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.490> stitch<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.689> we're<00:01:15.840> gonna

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
height of the stitch so we're gonna

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.920 
height of the stitch so we're gonna
chain<00:01:16.350> three<00:01:16.880> one<00:01:18.170> two<00:01:19.250> three

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
chain three one two three

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.690 
chain three one two three
that<00:01:21.930> chain<00:01:22.290> three<00:01:22.619> then<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.220> made<00:01:23.460> is

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
that chain three then I just made is

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.859 
that chain three then I just made is
called<00:01:23.909> beginning<00:01:24.479> chain<00:01:24.810> three<00:01:24.840> okay<00:01:26.840> okay

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
called beginning chain three okay okay

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.910 
called beginning chain three okay okay
and<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.590> count<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.369> one<00:01:29.610> double<00:01:29.880> crochet

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
and we count that as one double crochet

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.620 
and we count that as one double crochet
so<00:01:31.920> now<00:01:32.130> we're<00:01:32.340> gonna<00:01:32.610> double<00:01:32.820> crochet<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.390> do

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
