00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.060
 as mentioned when you reach a 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.890
 goal you must immediately fix a 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.089
 other we have other videos from 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.300
 to reach 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:14.090
 hoping to succeed 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.559
 I have nothing and I always think below 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.060
 voltage 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.800
 we must try to get more points 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:24.580
 our six games are possible and me 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.840
 would like to close or close it 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.420
 closed well because I do n't like to do 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.110
 bad impression 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.180
 like me and video or even make people understand 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.000
 them and trying to give anyway 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.940
 always the best then I always say them 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.040
 that attitude must performance 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.110
 to be considered then result comes from 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.900
 consequence but it is important that anyway 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.629
 when easy field you have consciousness 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.489
 clean of having given everything and then a 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.680
 that point also those who are in 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.230
 tribune notice and applaud you 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.850
 even the one who trains you knows what 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.600
 he gave everything and they don't give you a mass 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.120
 you leave the field thinking you can have 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.120
 given more and you have not given is that not 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.150
 okay because you have one thing left 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.409
 something inside that you talk about for days 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.220
 then you have to avoid this thing here 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.049
 we try because they are young boys 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.900
 we try above all to improve them by 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:23.920
 also head of continuity and all that me 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:27.060
 sometimes I break too much 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.900
 never boxes for their sake because 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.490
 I think they should also 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.130
 thank them maybe sometimes 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.320
 they are also angry as I think 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.460
 which is right that I with what I have 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.359
 lived what I went through that I give him 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.090
 right advice 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.890
 unfortunately when I was a player like that 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.939
 I didn't have a trainer who could 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.770
 say certain things 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.780
 I was doing all of management and I was wrong 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.990
 also a lot 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.780
 they still have a chance to say 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.820
 to understand and make him explain some 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.469
 things 1 that passed with all that 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.950
 that they owe it to him to do it well or 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:05.149
 better a little 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.489
 however, they are good guys 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.989
 sometimes they make me angry though it is 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.420
 normal 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.190
 so we hope that the fans there 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.120
 they are always as close as they have been 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.069
 always my kids doing damage 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.250
 always the best when they go on the field 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:29.220
 and we have achieved the salvation that it was 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.500
 let's say a main goal moment 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.610
 although I think that for a team and 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.709
 a society as secondary salvation is 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.459
 a minimum goal that one can do 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.160
 but let's say in this period now 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.840
 we are happy to have reached it 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.720
 ac that we try to finish it well 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.780
 you know if I've known him for a long time too 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.980
 when he was a player we were never not 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.450
 we never dated because anyway 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.370
 when I left red alone 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.760
 of which I am video sandor e 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.519
 sold alessandria but I know well 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.330
 all that is a very good boy and 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:14.140
 a great professional and everything then 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.750
 as anyway line serves I wanted to have 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.740
 a staff serve only led to emilio 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.620
 such as 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:25.840
 I called him because I knew how 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:29.920
 he works because he was already working under 17 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.710
 knowing it later then I also learned 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.420
 appreciate it and all because anyway one 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.300
 that does its job well what it does 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.480
 with how 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.920
 does it with passion everything can be a 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.819
 good guy that 's the key thing 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.010
 I knew we had to do very well for 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.770
 save us, however, I have seen for some time 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.920
 games everything I saw I saw a 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.900
 a bit of quality that can be done then we are 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.849
 they were good at convincing them they are 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.250
 been good put players into practice 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:06.520
 but surely no one could 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.890
 wait for these results because 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.160
 be salt of nine days before the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.600
 end the championship however among the 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.760
 four good months if you couldn't 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.759
 wait for the regions and kids why 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.819
 however they did very well 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:26.509
 I am very happy here so I think 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:28.190
 that for what I came to sir 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.880
 because as I said when I am 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.349
 arrived I didn't think about what 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.940
 santoro can do for me because i am where 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.490
 for months he did so much but what I did 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.250
 I can do for you and I did it now 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.819
 with this salvation or evened the accounts 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.580
 here was a debt to them now 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:49.449
 I think with this that who we have 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.879
 matched with you we can start again 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.189
 I'm sure that sampdoria of 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:57.699
 then today he would win championship too 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:05:01.990
 with the juve so I think then if not 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:05.409
 we know we can never try it though 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.879
 seeing those players who are you though 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:09.969
 it was something else 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:12.550
 also the Italian championship 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:17.139
 yes but also because other teams were 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:21.180
 it is not that sandra was strong 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:24.999
 but also adults you see milan juve inter 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:28.930
 rome anyway all I do now 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:33.039
 i look at the players of the inter Milan 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.560
 and juve then I think about it 15 20 years ago who's 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:38.860
 they would have been the owners of those 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.229
 12 teams maybe I always look for 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:45.520
 to moderate all a punishment yes 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:49.270
 also a nature world because like the 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.249
 calciavo I did not fit so high 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.560
 because they couldn't hug him 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:56.289
 then surely after t7 subscription 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.849
 affectionate and all but reminds me 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:01.060
 when he was neither the inter then there is the 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:05.800
 recopa figo adriano I don't know they were there 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:08.499
 again and put themselves behind for 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.099
 see how it was hunted and how to kick 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:13.090
 like the ball and we watched it is 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:16.570
 obviously he says no 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:19.360
 impossible to preserve so because it 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:22.389
 I took in a way that they didn't 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.419
 we can catch it then it can't either 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:28.720
 so much ligament because it later became 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:30.699
 an automatic thing that I remember 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.370
 should be pulled open punishments to lo 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:35.530
 I felt sorry for the chaos I knew right away evening 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.660
 fly as it touched the ball in 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.660
 that moment was already certain that they regulate
