00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
to start losing some strength but I'm

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.690 
to start losing some strength but I'm
happy<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.260> say<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.679> haven't<00:00:32.130> really<00:00:32.279> lost<00:00:32.460> all

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that much strength yet at least

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.229 
that much strength yet at least
my<00:00:35.100> last<00:00:35.340> day<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.760> definitely<00:00:35.969> remember

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
my last day and I definitely remember

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.060 
my last day and I definitely remember
losing<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.660> lot<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.840> strength<00:00:36.989> but<00:00:37.440> getting

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
losing a lot of strength but getting

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.500 
losing a lot of strength but getting
really<00:00:38.250> really<00:00:38.370> lean<00:00:38.640> which<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> idea<00:00:39.450> so

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
really really lean which is the idea so

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.530 
really really lean which is the idea so
that<00:00:39.660> goals<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.350> shift<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.860> little<00:00:41.040> bit<00:00:41.540> between

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
that goals do shift a little bit between

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.900 
that goals do shift a little bit between
bulking<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.290> leaning<00:00:43.920> out<00:00:44.100> what<00:00:44.579> I'm<00:00:44.670> bulking

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
bulking and leaning out what I'm bulking

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.639 
bulking and leaning out what I'm bulking
I<00:00:45.210> definitely<00:00:45.570> feel<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:45.989> like<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.620> know

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
I definitely feel just like a you know

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.709 
I definitely feel just like a you know

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
workouts and feel really good that way

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.110 
workouts and feel really good that way
but<00:00:52.649> when<00:00:52.770> I'm<00:00:52.860> dieting<00:00:53.219> things<00:00:53.640> change<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
but when I'm dieting things change a

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.100 
but when I'm dieting things change a
little<00:00:54.239> bit<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.690> still<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.020> an

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
little bit you can still have an

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.869 
little bit you can still have an
intensity<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.890> some<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.520> those<00:00:56.610> really

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
intensity and some of those really

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.459 
intensity and some of those really
really<00:00:57.000> awesome<00:00:57.239> workouts<00:00:57.809> but<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.170> lot<00:00:58.350> of

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
really awesome workouts but a lot of

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.790 
really awesome workouts but a lot of
times<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.920> me<00:00:59.100> when<00:00:59.940> I'm<00:01:00.059> dieting<00:01:00.390> my<00:01:01.050> my<00:01:01.469> sort

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
times for me when I'm dieting my my sort

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.189 
times for me when I'm dieting my my sort
of<00:01:01.859> intensity<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.640> brought<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.870> more

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
of intensity is brought in to a more

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.070 
of intensity is brought in to a more
focused<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:05.189> calm<00:01:05.640> intensity<00:01:06.420> if<00:01:06.600> that

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
focused like calm intensity if that

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.020 
focused like calm intensity if that
makes<00:01:07.290> sense<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.100> go<00:01:08.280> from<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.610> raging

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
makes sense so you go from a raging

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.240 
makes sense so you go from a raging
Berserker<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> gym<00:01:10.200> total<00:01:10.680> bit<00:01:10.920> more<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.159> a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
Berserker in the gym total bit more of a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.010 
Berserker in the gym total bit more of a
Zen<00:01:11.490> master<00:01:11.700> or<00:01:12.390> at<00:01:12.479> least<00:01:12.600> that's<00:01:12.780> kind<00:01:12.990> of

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
Zen master or at least that's kind of

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.929 
Zen master or at least that's kind of
how<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.200> do<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.710> that's<00:01:13.860> good<00:01:14.369> at<00:01:14.549> least<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.820> way

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
how I do it that's good at least the way

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.370 
how I do it that's good at least the way
I<00:01:14.970> think<00:01:15.090> about<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> way<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.810> feels<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.200> me

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
I think about it the way it feels to me

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.460 
I think about it the way it feels to me
I<00:01:17.250> tend<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.270> get<00:01:18.360> more<00:01:18.600> focused<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.080> my<00:01:19.200> form

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
I tend to get more focused on my form

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.230 
I tend to get more focused on my form
more<00:01:19.650> focus<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.580> time<00:01:20.880> under<00:01:21.210> tension

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
more focus on the time under tension

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.679 
more focus on the time under tension
aspect<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.320> things<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:23.670> know<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.790> start<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.570> do

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
aspect of things you know I start to do

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.990 
aspect of things you know I start to do
a<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.320> bit<00:01:25.470> higher<00:01:25.710> reps<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.400> little<00:01:26.880> bit

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
a little bit higher reps a little bit

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.580 
a little bit higher reps a little bit
lower<00:01:27.270> weight<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.810> that's<00:01:28.110> not<00:01:28.350> really

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
lower weight and that's not really

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.800 
lower weight and that's not really
because<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.280> know<00:01:29.310> I'm<00:01:29.549> trying<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.450> change

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
because you know I'm trying to change

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.899 
because you know I'm trying to change
the<00:01:31.079> way<00:01:31.200> I'm<00:01:31.320> training<00:01:31.710> necessarily<00:01:32.460> what

the way I'm training necessarily what

I'm<00:01:33.030> trying<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.450> maintain<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.799> intensity

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
I'm trying to maintain is that intensity

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.819 
I'm trying to maintain is that intensity
in<00:01:35.700> my<00:01:36.329> workouts<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.020> what<00:01:37.470> I'm<00:01:37.560> dieting

although I don't have that raw explosive
power<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.640> when<00:01:41.790> I'm<00:01:41.909> bulking<00:01:42.150> I'm

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
power that I have when I'm bulking I'm

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.510 
power that I have when I'm bulking I'm
still<00:01:43.020> able<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.350> put<00:01:43.560> together<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:44.070> lot<00:01:44.399> of

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
still able to put together a lot of

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.069 
still able to put together a lot of
quality<00:01:45.060> reps<00:01:45.299> even<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.810> means<00:01:45.930> that

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
quality reps even if that means that

to throw my leg days I don't think these
are<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.650> most<00:03:13.860> important<00:03:14.370> aspect<00:03:14.820> of<00:03:14.910> my<00:03:15.060> leg

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
are the most important aspect of my leg

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.780 
are the most important aspect of my leg
training<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.020> feel<00:03:16.050> like<00:03:16.320> my<00:03:16.440> squats<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.130> maybe

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
training I feel like my squats and maybe

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.950 
training I feel like my squats and maybe
even<00:03:17.970> my<00:03:18.060> leg<00:03:18.240> pressing<00:03:18.660> are<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.810> most

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
even my leg pressing are the most

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.920 
even my leg pressing are the most
important<00:03:19.470> things<00:03:19.620> but<00:03:20.340> um<00:03:20.570> honestly<00:03:21.570> I<00:03:21.840> do

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
important things but um honestly I do

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.050 
important things but um honestly I do
want<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.170> make<00:03:22.260> sure<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.410> include<00:03:22.770> the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
want to make sure I include the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.740 
want to make sure I include the
isolation<00:03:24.060> exercises<00:03:24.390> because<00:03:24.570> I<00:03:24.690> think

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
isolation exercises because I think

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.090 
isolation exercises because I think
they're<00:03:24.960> worthwhile<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.620> think<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.010> keeps

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
they're worthwhile I think it keeps

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.070 
they're worthwhile I think it keeps
everything<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.580> balance<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:27.150> speaking<00:03:28.020> of

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
everything in balance and speaking of
