00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
have to make sure you only do it usually

have to make sure you only do it usually
for<00:02:40.200> around<00:02:40.380> 12<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.770> 16<00:02:41.130> weeks<00:02:41.160> unless<00:02:41.459> you're

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
preparing for it so third and final

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.370 
preparing for it so third and final
point<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.250> cutting<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:44.910> calories<00:02:45.209> too<00:02:45.810> soon

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
point is cutting you calories too soon

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.800 
point is cutting you calories too soon
remember<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.760> only<00:02:47.880> want<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.239> be<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.480> slight

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
or deficit why because then you're more

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.860 
or deficit why because then you're more
likely<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.500> utilize<00:02:53.280> fat<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:53.940> your<00:02:54.000> fat<00:02:54.690> loss
