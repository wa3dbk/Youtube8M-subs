 Arben is very much back then 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:20.509
 Bahr 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.289
 All clear in sight 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.399
 this is the first in the 29 need clarity in Russia 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.910
 Again and again we are in the framework of our program, the Russian cuisine 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.140
 imagine 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.730
 we are doing less business 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.380
 but it's a game that's well-known all over the country 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.510
 savory from Eastern Europe is among the local media or animals 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.190
 barely known 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.450
 and there we start today with the classic Russian court for 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.679
 but one is missing 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.890
 as in this country bratwurst the DX 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.640
 because shashlik 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.060
 this one is hard we embarrassed any Russian creations dollar comes from 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.740
 from the Caucasus 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.370
 from there, the city has hit 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.140
 already in Tsarist times spread all over Eurasia 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.310
 Today we present the Russian version like Sido or similar in 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.310
 Tallin is available to the bottom of the country 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.970
 which is an important year 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.480
 Shipyard is next to meat still onions furry saw now and spices 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.960
 No one has to break up and want a pin here 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.770
 at the end of our endorses 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.870
 as shown now the exact list of ingredients per kilo of meat 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.870
 where it is just an ingredient list of the we like Inden variant 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.470
 because Fischer suggests almost every Russian father had been 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.570
 own secret recipe 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.910
 usually meat comes from pigs in Russia 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.780
 in the Caucasus they are approved of opposite or lamb meat 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.980
 It is important that it grows well 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.840
 in a Zuma play the grills Spice will print 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.659
 Pork neck or came is well suited 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.459
 the meat is made 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.459
 freed from the bones and diced 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:24.769
 these should be slightly larger on average than a goulash with it 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.879
 can get stuck on the skewers later 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.879
 meanwhile, the onions are peeled and length is distributed 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:35.959
 Now you get a big dream and take turns eating meat onions 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.179
 Salt and spices in layers on top of each other 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:43.069
 In our case, the spice mixture consisted of paprika coriander 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.709
 Mustard seeds and whether the planning 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.970
 the stacked shops are well matched and then only 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.459
 once stood for an hour 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.939
 so that the meat in taste of spices to min 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.110
 the men de 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.250
 which will be given to the eh already 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.159
 who first properly and produced water 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.070
 after expiry of the waiting period 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.070
 the pot is not called and infused with it 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:12.229
 The meat should then marinate from at least two of the onslaught depending on 

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:14.859
 Preference with the care court 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:20.079
 now there is time to drive to the lane where the ones played usually 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.059
 be prepared 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:24.959
 In summer you can anyone in between 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.759
 experience countless shashlik beforehand 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.419
 arrived in the garden the meat is then put on skewers 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:35.619
 the senses against sanctions known in Germany Hungarian 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:38.619
 Shashlik is made of metal 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.930
 while now a payer with he is on skewers since then 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:47.819
 Meat counter dedicated to others outside the flames 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.239
 Often we had used today 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.180
 the fire burns down here our wide Nolting Haydn immense bluetooth left over 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.999
 was 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:59.999
 the track is put on it 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.599
 Now you just have to think of them regularly 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.599
 how is they crispy through and outside 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.529
 important here is the preparation directly over the Proll end without 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:14.849
 Alufoil also on the grid 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.219
 because the smoky taste is an important ingredient 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:22.769
 Ryanair wants the opportunity lies a tremendous pleasure also because of her 

00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:26.419
 interesting combination of the bushes makes a light 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.570
 sourish ready 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.310
 and we match the right words for the feature-length raw food 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.710
 or salads black bread 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.410
 in the end once again all the ingredients partners maybe soon Beate 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.840

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.759
 on 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.759
 a few 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:52.610
 Dr to see them 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.610
