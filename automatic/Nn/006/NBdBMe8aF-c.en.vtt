00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
cux should still look like this when it

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.160

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.080

that's<00:01:23.799> because<00:01:24.100> instead<00:01:24.400> they<00:01:24.580> put<00:01:24.820> two

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
that's because instead they put two

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.359 
that's because instead they put two
cameras<00:01:25.600> either<00:01:25.750> side<00:01:26.170> which<00:01:26.770> relay<00:01:27.189> the
