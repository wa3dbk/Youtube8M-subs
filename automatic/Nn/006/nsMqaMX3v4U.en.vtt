is okay so you're going to give that a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.910 
is okay so you're going to give that a
crumb<00:00:35.670> coat<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.149> buttercream<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.739> that

crumb coat of buttercream this one that

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.020

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
I've used a chocolate buttercream

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.459 
I've used a chocolate buttercream
because<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.540> think<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.750> would<00:00:39.840> go<00:00:39.989> perfectly

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
because I think it would go perfectly

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.049 
because I think it would go perfectly
with<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.829> marble<00:00:41.040> cake<00:00:41.309> once<00:00:41.790> you've<00:00:41.910> got

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
with the marble cake once you've got

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.670

fridge until it's ready for the second

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.090 
fridge until it's ready for the second
coat<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.469> has<00:00:46.590> come<00:00:46.770> straight<00:00:47.070> out

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
