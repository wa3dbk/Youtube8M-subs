00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.640

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.620

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.930
 taste and soy sauce that's all gone 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.690
 Let's start with the fact that we cook our makaroshki 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.520
 how to cook pasta look at the pack 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.129
 durum wheat pasta 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.949
 boil water for about 10 minutes 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.340
 we throw in the defense and cook for 10 minutes all 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.340
 simply 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.570
 pasta cooked 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.600
 now we need to prepare vegetables 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.450
 first of all the tomato need to remove the skin 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.450
 for this we make a cross-cut and 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.540
 pour tomatoes with boiling water about 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.540
 One minute 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:28.080
 now the skin of the door can be removed 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:35.369
 easy and simple garlic shred 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:38.119
 finely also finely chop 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.119
 tomatoes 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.420
 take the biggest griddle in my 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:55.220
 case, it's a wok pan, heat it up 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.220
 and pour a drop of olive oil 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:08.360
 the pan warmed up tosses here 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:10.390
 garlic and tomatoes and fry literally 5 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.390
 minutes 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.690
 it was the turn to throw seafood 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.450
 but seafood must be 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.860
 thawed if you took frozen 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.260
 seafood then at least pour 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.880
 horoshenechko throw boiling water frozen 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.790
 the dish is impossible otherwise you will spoil everything 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:39.310
 there will be a whole puddle of squid and shrimp 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.310
 and all that you want to throw here 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:54.260

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:01.090
 time tuck about some yummy 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.090
 seasoning and do not forget to mix 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.849
 I intentionally do not sorel dish because in 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.120
 as a gas station 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.620
 we will use soy sauce 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.250
 how much do u look at your face 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.109
 taste note that it is salty so here 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:28.180
 the main thing is not to overdo it better no 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:32.010
 salted than overdoing stew it all 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.010
 dealing with another five minutes and 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.750

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.069
 makaroshka and we have the last 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.750
