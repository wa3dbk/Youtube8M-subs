00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
good side of the bed and we're going to

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.160 
good side of the bed and we're going to
knock<00:00:16.230> up<00:00:16.379> some<00:00:16.410> banana<00:00:16.830> bread<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:18.170> subscribe

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
knock up some banana bread so subscribe

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:34.470 
knock up some banana bread so subscribe
and<00:00:19.640> yeah<00:00:20.640> we'll<00:00:21.029> get<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.300> happening

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.130 

all<00:00:34.960> right<00:00:35.110> so<00:00:35.260> our<00:00:35.290> first<00:00:35.410> step<00:00:35.830> will<00:00:36.010> be<00:00:36.070> to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
all right so our first step will be to

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.670 
all right so our first step will be to
mush<00:00:38.140> up<00:00:38.440> four<00:00:39.130> bananas<00:00:39.760> so<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:41.170> riper<00:00:41.440> they

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
mush up four bananas so the riper they

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.650 
mush up four bananas so the riper they
are<00:00:41.830> the<00:00:42.430> better<00:00:42.610> they'll<00:00:42.820> be<00:00:43.000> in<00:00:43.240> your<00:00:43.450> banana

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
are the better they'll be in your banana

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.850 
are the better they'll be in your banana
bread<00:00:43.750> they're<00:00:43.990> gonna<00:00:44.080> get<00:00:44.230> all<00:00:44.380> squashed<00:00:44.650> up

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
bread they're gonna get all squashed up

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.560 
bread they're gonna get all squashed up
so<00:00:45.130> it<00:00:45.580> doesn't<00:00:45.790> have<00:00:45.880> to<00:00:45.940> perfect<00:00:46.300> just<00:00:46.420> chuck

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
so it doesn't have to perfect just chuck

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.120 
so it doesn't have to perfect just chuck
them<00:00:46.600> in<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:46.810> bowl<00:00:46.990> it's<00:00:47.320> four<00:00:47.590> bananas<00:00:48.010> in

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
them in the bowl it's four bananas in

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.549 
them in the bowl it's four bananas in
there<00:00:48.220> we'll<00:00:49.150> just<00:00:49.180> break<00:00:49.510> them<00:00:49.690> up<00:00:49.840> get<00:00:50.410> rid

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
there we'll just break them up get rid

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.950 
there we'll just break them up get rid
of<00:00:50.620> these<00:00:51.239> come<00:00:52.239> down<00:00:52.390> my<00:00:52.510> hidey<00:00:52.720> hole<00:00:54.960> then

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
of these come down my hidey hole then

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.750 
of these come down my hidey hole then
just<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.530> mush<00:00:56.650> them<00:00:56.739> up<00:00:56.890> just<00:00:57.280> get<00:00:57.489> right<00:00:57.640> in

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
just to mush them up just get right in

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.080 
just to mush them up just get right in
there

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
there

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.330 
there
the<00:00:58.989> idea<00:00:59.320> is<00:00:59.410> squashing<00:00:59.650> this<00:00:59.860> up<00:01:00.010> is<00:01:00.160> that

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
the idea is squashing this up is that

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.869 
the idea is squashing this up is that
instead<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:00.880> having<00:01:00.970> big<00:01:01.360> chunks<00:01:01.809> of<00:01:01.960> banana

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
instead of having big chunks of banana

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.829 
instead of having big chunks of banana
randomly<00:01:03.879> through<00:01:04.089> your<00:01:04.210> bread<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.690> whole

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
randomly through your bread the whole

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.510 
randomly through your bread the whole
bread<00:01:05.140> every<00:01:05.410> bite<00:01:05.620> every<00:01:05.920> slice<00:01:06.220> will<00:01:06.430> be

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
bread every bite every slice will be

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.010 
bread every bite every slice will be
banana<00:01:06.850> flavoured<00:01:07.390> all<00:01:07.509> right<00:01:07.660> so<00:01:07.869> we've

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
banana flavoured all right so we've

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.450 
banana flavoured all right so we've
mushed<00:01:08.200> up<00:01:08.320> bananas<00:01:08.530> up<00:01:08.830> and<00:01:09.009> we're<00:01:09.130> just<00:01:09.160> uh

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
mushed up bananas up and we're just uh

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.800 
mushed up bananas up and we're just uh
just<00:01:09.729> throw<00:01:09.880> him<00:01:09.970> straight<00:01:10.180> in<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.300> flour<00:01:10.540> so

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
just throw him straight in the flour so

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.719 
just throw him straight in the flour so
that's<00:01:10.990> six<00:01:11.619> cups<00:01:11.860> of<00:01:12.009> flour<00:01:12.190> just<00:01:12.490> plain

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.169 
grams of butter so it looks like a lot
but<00:01:53.200> this<00:01:53.410> is<00:01:53.470> making<00:01:53.920> two<00:01:54.640> loaves

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
but this is making two loaves
