 well in all environments are very 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.870
 used in washrooms and bathrooms and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.290
 larger spaces for the installation because 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.559
 they stay totally on top of the bench 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.080
 [Music] 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.000
 with large tanks the bench should 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.790
 be lower than normal so as not to 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.750
 to hinder its use is the preferred type 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.700
 of many interior designers and 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.310
 architects since there is a great variety of 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.620
 models with modern design and 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.630
 differentiated and unique 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:29.030
 [Music] 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:38.569
 the most suitable for basic vat 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:41.360
 support is high today wall but guilty 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.840
 Flush has a simple design 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.959
 are a good option being very affordable 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.509
 are fixed below the edges of the top 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:53.630
 and the bench will have to be deep 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.539
 enough to hold there to be in 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.610
 simple cube you can abuse in 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.649
 finishes of your bathroom to 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.869
 leave it with your face 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.959
 in addition they are easy maintenance vats 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.450
 and cleaning there are more taps 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:15.230
 for built-in tanks are those of nozzle 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:18.530
 lower curves are the models and superimpose 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.769
 which contains the leading edge above the 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.829
 or less deep than those of 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.440
 embed less space 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:32.900
 however the bench should be larger than the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:35.480
 themselves are ideal for those who do not 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.549
 likes used parts like the curves of 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.819
 support but also do not want simplicity 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.370
 the vats of the first embed more 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.480
 indicated for the curves and about 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.480
 more low spout 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.110
 the accounts of this fit require more 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.810
 attention at the time of your project . 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:03.520
 because some of the blame lies outside the 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:06.370
 of the counter is this cube with all certainty 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.390
 give that special and sophisticated touch 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.880
 in your bathroom 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.070
 the first ones most suitable for 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:18.250
 fit courses are those of spout 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:20.320
 low for the operation of the vessel 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:43.870
 you will need accessories like 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:46.600
 siphon valve and thread sealing cleaning 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.240
 your tank should be made regularly 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.340
 clean all surfaces with water and 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.740
 soap or cleaning products not 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.590
 because they can remove the 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.110
 solution enamel with chlorine 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.380
 are not recommended because they can cause 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:07.849
 damages 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:10.829
