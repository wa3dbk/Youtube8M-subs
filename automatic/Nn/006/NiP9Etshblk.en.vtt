next<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:11.850> sim<00:01:12.810> Kinect<00:01:13.110> DLL<00:01:13.650> found<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
next you have sim Kinect DLL found and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.570 
next you have sim Kinect DLL found and
connect<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.850> FS<00:01:16.939> if<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:19.110> not<00:01:19.229> found<00:01:19.580> you

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
connect to FS if this is not found you

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.800 
connect to FS if this is not found you
put<00:01:20.909> your<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.720> either<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.909> deal<00:01:23.909> alpha<00:01:24.360> sim

is how you can just walk around the
world<00:02:36.110> without<00:02:36.410> your<00:02:37.810> know<00:02:38.810> without<00:02:39.140> using

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
world without your know without using

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.130 
world without your know without using
driving<00:02:40.490> without<00:02:40.820> driving<00:02:41.180> flying<00:02:41.900> your

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
driving without driving flying your

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.860 
driving without driving flying your
flying<00:02:42.350> around<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:43.270> guess<00:02:44.270> you<00:02:44.450> were<00:02:44.510> driving

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
flying around I guess you were driving

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.460 
flying around I guess you were driving
it<00:02:45.140> there<00:02:45.350> taxiing<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:47.900> walk<00:02:48.050> around<00:02:48.230> but

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
it there taxiing it to walk around but

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.070 
it there taxiing it to walk around but
anyway<00:02:49.810> your<00:02:50.810> body<00:02:51.200> move<00:02:51.470> in<00:02:52.040> world<00:02:52.580> camera<00:02:53.120> um

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
anyway your body move in world camera um

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.190 
anyway your body move in world camera um
and<00:02:55.010> then<00:02:55.820> you<00:02:55.970> have<00:02:56.120> this<00:02:56.630> smoothing<00:02:57.050> for

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
and then you have this smoothing for

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.860 
and then you have this smoothing for
that<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.830> move<00:02:57.950> speed<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:59.360> have<00:02:59.510> place

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
that and the move speed you have place

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.010 
that and the move speed you have place
camera<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:00.380> this<00:03:00.530> was<00:03:00.740> aircraft<00:03:01.310> position<00:03:02.020> and

camera in this was aircraft position and

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.890 
camera in this was aircraft position and
it'll<00:03:03.320> place<00:03:03.590> it<00:03:03.800> in<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.880> aircraft<00:03:05.450> that<00:03:05.630> you

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
it'll place it in the aircraft that you

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.490 
it'll place it in the aircraft that you
are<00:03:06.050> using

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
are using

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.840 
are using
it'll<00:03:06.830> place<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.130> camera<00:03:07.400> in<00:03:07.430> that<00:03:07.580> position

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
it'll place the camera in that position

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.280 
it'll place the camera in that position
and<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:08.780> can<00:03:08.900> delete<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.200> camera<00:03:10.090> in

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
and you can delete the camera in

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.660 
and you can delete the camera in

smoothing and um like the amount it
zooms<00:03:26.900> in<00:03:27.230> I<00:03:27.940> explained<00:03:28.940> that<00:03:28.970> but<00:03:29.300> yeah<00:03:29.930> but

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
zooms in I explained that but yeah but

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.750 
zooms in I explained that but yeah but
you<00:03:30.110> can<00:03:30.260> play<00:03:30.770> on<00:03:30.920> these<00:03:31.100> settings<00:03:31.430> see<00:03:31.640> what

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
you can play on these settings see what

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.280 
you can play on these settings see what
works<00:03:31.910> best<00:03:32.150> for<00:03:32.240> you<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.630> haven't<00:03:33.110> really

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
works best for you I haven't really

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.820 
works best for you I haven't really
found<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.680> good<00:03:34.100> setting<00:03:34.610> yet<00:03:35.209> I've<00:03:35.680> tested<00:03:36.680> out

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
found a good setting yet I've tested out

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.010 
found a good setting yet I've tested out
there<00:03:37.100> change<00:03:37.850> the<00:03:37.940> numbers<00:03:38.180> too<00:03:38.300> much<00:03:38.450> and

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
there change the numbers too much and

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.050 
there change the numbers too much and
then<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.650> have<00:03:39.770> virtual<00:03:40.370> cockpit<00:03:40.550> wall

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
then you have virtual cockpit wall

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.290 
then you have virtual cockpit wall
camera<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.380> have<00:03:42.500> body<00:03:42.770> move<00:03:43.070> in<00:03:43.700> virtual

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
camera and you have body move in virtual

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.940 
camera and you have body move in virtual
cockpit<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:44.959> then<00:03:45.320> you<00:03:45.470> have<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:46.810> move

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
cockpit and then you have the move

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.270 
cockpit and then you have the move
smooth<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.400> then<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.910> speed<00:03:50.200> such<00:03:51.200> just<00:03:52.160> like

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
smooth and then the speed such just like

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.270 
smooth and then the speed such just like
the<00:03:52.370> other<00:03:52.520> ones<00:03:52.700> here<00:03:53.600> oh<00:03:53.810> man<00:03:54.800> you<00:03:54.980> can<00:03:55.130> play

the other ones here oh man you can play
around<00:03:55.340> with<00:03:55.520> that<00:03:55.730> then<00:03:56.510> your<00:03:56.660> a<00:03:56.690> separate

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
around with that then your a separate

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.979 
around with that then your a separate
head<00:03:57.500> axis<00:03:58.040> from<00:03:58.400> body<00:03:58.670> axis<00:03:59.150> you<00:03:59.959> can

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
head axis from body axis you can

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.390 
head axis from body axis you can
separate<00:04:01.090> this<00:04:02.090> move<00:04:02.570> body<00:04:02.989> with<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.160> head

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
separate this move body with the head

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.500 
separate this move body with the head
and<00:04:05.170> get<00:04:06.170> some<00:04:06.470> pretty<00:04:06.980> cold<00:04:07.730> views<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.420> know

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
and get some pretty cold views you know

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.180 
and get some pretty cold views you know
you<00:04:08.600> can<00:04:08.750> just<00:04:08.780> play<00:04:09.170> around<00:04:09.200> with<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:09.709> sweet

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
yet and that is about it for the program

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.920 
yet and that is about it for the program
um<00:04:15.800> well<00:04:16.790> I'm<00:04:16.970> going<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.150> show<00:04:17.270> you<00:04:17.330> how<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:17.570> use

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
it in flight simulator so

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.230 
it in flight simulator so
switch<00:04:20.320> over<00:04:20.560> to<00:04:20.920> so<00:04:21.460> now<00:04:21.580> I'm<00:04:21.850> on<00:04:21.970> flight

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
switch over to so now I'm on flight

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.720 
switch over to so now I'm on flight
simulator<00:04:22.660> you'll<00:04:22.960> see<00:04:23.200> that<00:04:23.380> uh<00:04:23.670> you<00:04:24.670> know

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.470 
yeah right but and also with your arrow
keys<00:04:51.940> you<00:04:52.150> can<00:04:53.220> left-right<00:04:54.480> back<00:04:55.920> forward<00:04:56.920> and

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
keys you can left-right back forward and

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.360 
keys you can left-right back forward and
with<00:04:58.480> the<00:04:58.630> page<00:04:58.930> up<00:04:59.170> and<00:04:59.290> down<00:04:59.500> keys<00:04:59.830> you<00:05:00.280> know

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
with the page up and down keys you know

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.330 
with the page up and down keys you know
page<00:05:00.640> up<00:05:00.880> is<00:05:01.090> you<00:05:01.540> can<00:05:01.690> ascend<00:05:02.320> and<00:05:02.890> page<00:05:03.100> young

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
page up is you can ascend and page young

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.570 
page up is you can ascend and page young
as<00:05:03.520> you<00:05:03.640> can<00:05:03.820> descend<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:05.160> on<00:05:06.160> your<00:05:06.370> number

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
as you can descend and on your number

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.140 
as you can descend and on your number
pad<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:08.080> one<00:05:08.320> key<00:05:08.620> is<00:05:08.950> hyper<00:05:09.430> acceleration

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
pad the one key is hyper acceleration

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.620 
pad the one key is hyper acceleration
the<00:05:10.960> zero<00:05:11.260> key<00:05:11.500> is<00:05:11.800> just<00:05:12.610> acceleration<00:05:13.270> so

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
the zero key is just acceleration so

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.670 
the zero key is just acceleration so
it's<00:05:13.810> a<00:05:13.840> little<00:05:13.960> bit<00:05:14.110> slower<00:05:14.260> than<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.470> hyper

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
it's a little bit slower than the hyper

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.150 
it's a little bit slower than the hyper
acceleration<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.730> then<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.540> Delete<00:05:16.840> key

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
acceleration and then the Delete key

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.290 
acceleration and then the Delete key
just<00:05:18.270> enables<00:05:19.270> or<00:05:19.480> disables<00:05:19.660> it<00:05:21.300> completely

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
just enables or disables it completely

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.300 
just enables or disables it completely
so<00:05:22.570> depending<00:05:23.140> if<00:05:23.290> it's<00:05:23.380> disabled<00:05:24.010> and<00:05:24.130> it'll

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
so depending if it's disabled and it'll

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.700 
so depending if it's disabled and it'll
enable<00:05:24.460> it<00:05:24.760> and<00:05:25.000> if<00:05:25.210> you<00:05:25.420> know<00:05:25.540> vice<00:05:26.050> versa

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
enable it and if you know vice versa

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.460 
enable it and if you know vice versa
and<00:05:27.330> last<00:05:28.330> thing<00:05:28.650> if<00:05:29.650> you<00:05:30.160> go<00:05:30.250> into<00:05:30.400> custom<00:05:31.470> or

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
and last thing if you go into custom or

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.880 
and last thing if you go into custom or
in<00:05:33.070> the<00:05:33.340> world<00:05:33.580> walk<00:05:34.240> camera<00:05:34.930> tab<00:05:35.410> on<00:05:35.770> the

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
in the world walk camera tab on the

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:36.510 
in the world walk camera tab on the
program

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
program

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.690 
program
if<00:05:36.700> you<00:05:37.060> hit<00:05:37.210> place<00:05:38.160> camera<00:05:39.160> in<00:05:39.370> aircraft

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
if you hit place camera in aircraft

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.810 
if you hit place camera in aircraft
position<00:05:40.710> and<00:05:41.710> you<00:05:41.950> close<00:05:42.190> flight<00:05:42.430> simulator

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
position and you close flight simulator

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.820 
position and you close flight simulator
and<00:05:42.910> open<00:05:43.120> it<00:05:43.210> back<00:05:43.240> up<00:05:43.330> you<00:05:44.320> will<00:05:44.440> have<00:05:44.560> a<00:05:44.620> new

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
and open it back up you will have a new

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.890 
and open it back up you will have a new
camera<00:05:45.190> it's<00:05:45.610> called<00:05:45.970> world<00:05:46.270> walk<00:05:46.480> camera

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
camera it's called world walk camera

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.110 
camera it's called world walk camera
basically<00:05:47.500> what<00:05:47.800> this<00:05:47.920> is<00:05:48.160> it<00:05:48.430> allows<00:05:48.730> you<00:05:48.940> to

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
basically what this is it allows you to

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.660 
basically what this is it allows you to
walk<00:05:49.360> any<00:05:49.660> or<00:05:49.960> move<00:05:50.680> around<00:05:50.920> anywhere<00:05:51.520> you

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
walk any or move around anywhere you

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.610 
walk any or move around anywhere you
want<00:05:51.880> so<00:05:52.090> you<00:05:52.540> can<00:05:52.690> see<00:05:52.810> the<00:05:52.900> epic<00:05:53.110> water<00:05:53.350> and

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
want so you can see the epic water and

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.110 
want so you can see the epic water and
stuff<00:05:54.400> like<00:05:54.550> that<00:05:55.440> and<00:05:56.670> that's<00:05:57.670> really<00:05:57.880> cool

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
stuff like that and that's really cool

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.720 
stuff like that and that's really cool
because<00:05:58.330> you<00:05:58.810> know<00:05:59.620> you<00:05:59.800> can<00:06:00.040> just<00:06:00.250> get<00:06:00.520> like

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:00.730 
because you know you can just get like

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.840 
because you know you can just get like
some<00:06:00.940> really<00:06:01.090> cool<00:06:01.300> videos<00:06:01.360> with<00:06:01.780> this<00:06:01.990> go<00:06:02.710> up

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
some really cool videos with this go up

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.580 
some really cool videos with this go up
like<00:06:03.850> say<00:06:04.090> there's<00:06:04.240> a<00:06:04.300> plane<00:06:04.570> take<00:06:04.960> it<00:06:05.110> off<00:06:05.260> and

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
like say there's a plane take it off and

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.260 
like say there's a plane take it off and
you<00:06:05.710> don't<00:06:06.280> need<00:06:06.370> a<00:06:06.400> plane<00:06:06.670> over<00:06:06.820> here<00:06:06.940> you<00:06:07.120> can

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
you don't need a plane over here you can

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.520 
you don't need a plane over here you can
just<00:06:08.010> take<00:06:09.010> a<00:06:09.310> shot<00:06:10.090> of<00:06:10.270> that<00:06:10.420> you<00:06:11.050> know<00:06:11.140> and

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
just take a shot of that you know and

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.050 
just take a shot of that you know and
you<00:06:11.860> can<00:06:11.980> use<00:06:12.100> all<00:06:12.220> the<00:06:12.280> same<00:06:12.370> controls<00:06:12.730> you

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
you can use all the same controls you

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.350 
you can use all the same controls you
know<00:06:13.180> up-down<00:06:14.310> acceleration<00:06:15.310> blah<00:06:15.430> blah<00:06:15.670> and

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
know up-down acceleration blah blah and

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.880 
know up-down acceleration blah blah and
I<00:06:16.780> think<00:06:16.930> that's<00:06:17.140> about<00:06:17.290> it

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
I think that's about it

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.280 
I think that's about it
it's<00:06:18.430> pretty<00:06:18.820> simple<00:06:19.270> actually<00:06:19.450> if<00:06:19.840> you<00:06:20.020> get

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 
it's pretty simple actually if you get

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.650 
it's pretty simple actually if you get
the<00:06:20.380> hang<00:06:20.530> of<00:06:20.590> it<00:06:21.120> which<00:06:22.120> doesn't<00:06:22.360> take<00:06:22.450> that

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
the hang of it which doesn't take that

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.220 
the hang of it which doesn't take that
long<00:06:23.790> and<00:06:24.790> if<00:06:25.120> you<00:06:25.180> have<00:06:25.270> any<00:06:25.420> questions<00:06:25.930> feel
