these simple skits some scrap Beach I've
had<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:25.080> what<00:00:25.199> I'm<00:00:25.289> going<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.439> do<00:00:25.560> now<00:00:25.740> I'm

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
had and what I'm going to do now I'm

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.550 
had and what I'm going to do now I'm
gonna<00:00:26.130> bolt<00:00:26.880> those<00:00:27.060> onto<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.420> cradle<00:00:27.779> and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
gonna bolt those onto the cradle and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.470 
gonna bolt those onto the cradle and
show<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.890> what<00:00:28.980> hugs<00:00:29.189> like<00:00:29.400> right<00:00:30.029> that's<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
show you what hugs like right that's the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.180 
show you what hugs like right that's the
skids<00:00:31.669> fixed<00:00:32.669> into<00:00:32.880> position<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:34.100> think<00:00:35.100> it's

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
skids fixed into position I think it's

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.260 
skids fixed into position I think it's
going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> look<00:00:35.430> quite<00:00:35.610> good<00:00:35.670> when<00:00:36.030> that's

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
going to look quite good when that's

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.700 
going to look quite good when that's
what<00:00:36.930> I'm<00:00:37.020> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.200> actually<00:00:37.350> going<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
what I'm going to actually going to

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.889 
what I'm going to actually going to
paint<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.040> engine<00:00:38.450> not<00:00:39.450> something<00:00:39.809> I

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
paint this engine not something I

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.889 
paint this engine not something I
normally<00:00:39.960> do<00:00:40.379> as<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.800> all<00:00:40.920> know<00:00:41.899> obviously

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
normally do as you all know obviously

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.880 
normally do as you all know obviously
varnish<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:44.640> timbers<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.739> hopefully<00:00:46.739> it'll

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
varnish the timbers and hopefully it'll

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.319 
varnish the timbers and hopefully it'll
quite<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> smarter<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> set<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.090> when<00:00:48.239> he's

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
quite a smarter to set up when he's

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.270 
quite a smarter to set up when he's
finished<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.469> think<00:00:49.680> I'm<00:00:49.770> gonna<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:50.070> now

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
finished what I think I'm gonna do now

finished what I think I'm gonna do now
is<00:00:51.860> bolt<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> engine<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.340> into<00:00:53.550> position<00:00:53.670> and

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
is bolt the engine up into position and

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.810 
is bolt the engine up into position and
show<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.410> how<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.649> complete<00:00:56.070> set<00:00:56.309> up<00:00:56.520> for

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
show you how the complete set up for

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.479 
show you how the complete set up for
looks<00:00:57.809> when<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.109> all<00:00:58.230> assembled<00:01:01.280> that's<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
looks when it's all assembled that's the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.600 
looks when it's all assembled that's the
engine<00:01:02.760> bolted<00:01:03.210> into<00:01:03.329> its<00:01:03.570> cradle<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:05.430> that's

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
engine bolted into its cradle and that's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.310 
engine bolted into its cradle and that's
how<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.850> finished<00:01:06.409> sets<00:01:07.409> going<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.680> look<00:01:09.320> not

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
how the finished sets going to look not

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.950 
how the finished sets going to look not

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
steel work yet I might not go with green

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.649 
steel work yet I might not go with green
and<00:01:15.150> there<00:01:15.479> was<00:01:15.570> something<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.930> bit<00:01:16.080> different

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the kickstart as I wanted to know works

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.090 
the kickstart as I wanted to know works
as<00:02:05.970> it<00:02:06.060> should

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
as it should

as it should
I'm<00:02:08.100> still<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.489> start<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.880> engine<00:02:09.590> not<00:02:10.590> clean

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
I'm still to start the engine not clean

the carburetor it'll yet so that's

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.340 
the carburetor it'll yet so that's
probably<00:02:13.230> going<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.470> be<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.650> next<00:02:13.830> job<00:02:14.070> and

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
probably going to be the next job and

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:41.430 
probably going to be the next job and
time<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.470> up

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
hopefully we'll have it running in the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:57.300 
hopefully we'll have it running in the
