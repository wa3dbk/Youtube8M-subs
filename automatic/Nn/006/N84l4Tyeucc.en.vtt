00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.149
 This game is based on the popular 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.149

 Secrets and a bonus level 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.590
 3 dragon spiro this game almost not what 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.229
 I played but it was very entertaining 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.210
 I hope you find yourself chasing sheep 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.250
 in the prairies of the dragon while 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.530
 they are doing an interview to one of 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.869
 the veteran dragons these insult 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.850
 marc nasty enemy of dragons 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.859
 consequence of it nasty throws a 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.899
 spell that freezes the dragons and the 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.149
 enclosed in glass statues and the 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.000
 jewels in creatures and enemy monsters 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.979
 the nasty spell does not give to everyone because 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.810
 the small size of spyro gets 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.789
 be saved and this one takes the mission of 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.399
 free the dragons to rescue their 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.479
 lands this is a part of the pretty 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.610
 history haha 4 bloody roar is a saga 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.140
 of video games of fights one on one 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.670
 where the particular is the 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.739
 fighter has the possibility of 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.319
 transform into a beast and fight in 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:10.810
 that limited form in the form of 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.569
 beast the fighter is much more powerful 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.060
 and has access to the best combos each 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.980
 Character has combos styles of 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.730
 fight and a special attack available 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.040
 only in beast mode came out in the year 1998 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.230
 5 river 2 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.750
 we will talk about this game because I liked it 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.209
 more than the 1x of this game has 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.000
 mainly two game modes one is 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.159
 free mode and other missions history 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.230
 of the game begins when he is killed 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.909
 a Brazilian who was related to 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.340
 with a mafia in which he was 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.530
 linked to vÃ¡squez is a good game 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.730
 for this console what I liked 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.830
 to do is to cause 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.310
 problems for patrols me 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.129
 follow and I dodge axd6 more 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.900
 face heading the main object of the game 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.750
 is to win a race or series of races 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.640
 against one or up to five opponents but 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.610
 what's different from other racing games 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.440
 is that in this game while you go 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.180
 competing in the race you must 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.220
 find a key type that if the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.230
 you unlock a car you go by the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.970
 race grabbing powers that help you 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.980
 in the race or powers to attack 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.310
 your adversaries 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.530
 7 in the year 1999 and developed a 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.599
 video game for the sony console like 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.879
 pepsi man the player runs through 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.890
 various areas avoiding the dangers and 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.569
 picking the pepsi cans at once 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.400
 than trying to reach a person 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.519
 thirsty as in commercials 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.200
 you must sweep jump around different 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.129
 things in a time that are left for 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.129
 finish the mission 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.340
 this game was one of my favorites and 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.860
 I think that eight of you also feel 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.710
 few people knew him but he was 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.070
 quite entertaining the game is in 3-d 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.080
 was released in 1997 is a game of 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.690
 missions that you must go killing with weapons 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.900
 as firearms luggage chairs 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.120
 suitcases bottles rims and so on 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.120
 mission mode you could play one or two 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.120
 players that was the entertaining 9 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.040
 running wild is a little-known game 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.930
 it's a racing game but what 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.320
 difference to other games is that they were 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.360
 animal racing was launched in 1998 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.240
 Each character has its own 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.340
 statistics and skills those that 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.980
 played this game they will know what I'm talking about and 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.900
 how entertaining is there are different 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.390
 types of clues that each one has a 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.460
 different obstacle and different types 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.070
 of animals like the elephant is the most 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.410
 strong the bull is the most agile and the zebra 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.540
 It is the fastest hidden characters 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.669
 bosses can be unlocked in the 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.860
 mode game challenge while 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.370
 time trial allows you to compete against 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.800
 your own best time 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.330
 there is a great variety of accelerations and 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.960
 power loops that there are and you will need 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.600
 to get faster 10 crafting 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.320

 this list was released in 1999 the 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.979
 The dynamics of the game is to dispute 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.780
 races next to a series of 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.660
 opponents that can be attacked 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.880
 by various weapons the goal of 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.740
 game is to beat the evil nitro enemy 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.620
