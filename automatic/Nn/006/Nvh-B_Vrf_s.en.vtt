00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.089
 ok now for a joke let's start with 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.060
 the list of tips I already made a video 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:27.669
 wrong around two or three months two or 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.099
 three months saying a few tips and 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.590
 tips on how to be a sniper 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.690
 but I was seeing it these days 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.280
 just before yesterday and I noticed that 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.070
 it was not very complete that I was missing 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.740
 a few things then I decided to do 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.240
 another video on this day where they 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.180
 I will explain to each one of you 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.910
 how to be a better sniper to a 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.760
 even more 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.670
 and then let's start the number of 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.980
 one feels comfortable 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.690
 feel totally comfortable when I go 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.940
 to play I have to be totally 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.300
 comfortable if you feel comfortable playing 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.970
 with a since a tc since if you 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.070
 you feel comfortable playing with a clock 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.190
 put on your watch if you feel comfortable 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.180
 in naked leather plays naked if you 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.000
 you feel comfortable 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.490
 inside a pool buy yourself a 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.740
 pool buy yourself a television 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.970
 buy yourself an xbox and buy the game and 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.250
 play inside the pool 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.210
 but while while you're comfortable 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.240
 everything will go well number 2 point 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.190
 cheer up if you do not have the courage to play 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.780
 you will not leave anything if and more if you 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.000
 you are a fidel if you are a feeder and not 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.990
 you're in the mood release the xbox loose the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.090
 play loose the u and release the pc because no 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.070
 you're going to get nothing and since you're not going 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.110
 to get out you're going to get frustrated you're going to 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.760
 annoying will annoy you and easily go 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.870
 just to end up breaking the game 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.510
 You understand 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.150
 I hope good then get in the mood 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.580
 that is the number 2 courage 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.780
 and if he is discouraged better or to give them 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.790
 control number 3 ignores the rest 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.340
 players with what else stand I mean 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.110
 this is always going to have people in both 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.810
 your team as in the opposing team 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.570
 sending you message or telling you by 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.090
 chat that you are a cool but what 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.610
 do you do not know how to do wisco 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.210
 that there is a terrible one with the franc 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.550
 ignore the ones because he ignores the ones because 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.190
 you are or are pressing on you 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.860
 same when someone is far from a 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.590
 helmet visit closely the most effective 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.110
 It would be a whiskey but if it is of course not 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.940
 you make a record is almost 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.250
 impossible to hit around the map 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.130
 I have not said this, only I have 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.520
 said optics predator said optics 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.900
 and I have said face temper that they are of the 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.340
 three larger figures that have been 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.830
 in the history of the sniper call 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.940
 of duty and here I am saying it but 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.430
 I understand it in Spanish and well that's the 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.260
 hardcore business if it's far away has 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.530
 in Jalisco without fear no matter what 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.170
 the others say number four hear 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.150
 music if you do not like to play with 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.000
 so much noise and with all those bullets 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.280
 sounding and with the sniper and the grenades and 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.910
 the friends deconcentrating the when 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.060
 they speak with music a music that 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.450
 identify for example I play with a 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.440
 what is the matrix in future bound that 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.720
 online flame 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.860
 in a facebook video and every time 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.690
 I play with that game too well no no 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.350
 I still understand why but there is no 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.720
 day that I with that song and badly or 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.390
 that there is music and not only music 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.170
 but music that satisfies you at the moment 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.450
 to play number 5 I do not look closely 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.310
 distance what I mean by that is 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.590
 a lot of people when they are very close was 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.170
 from the other enemies what he does is 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.500
 throw a knife or try to make a 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.540
 disk that almost almost always end 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.180
 being three judgments of louise cox because 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.810
 they always fail and kill or try 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.270
 make a helmet to ensure elkin not 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.730
 lose the fear risk a little and 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.450
 pull a nose cox and is very close to you 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.090
 no notes shoot without aiming and point 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.430
 to where there is a 80 to 85 percent 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.930
 of chances that you hit the 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.010
 bullet ok number 6 do not move while 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.050
 shoot 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.600
 what do I mean by this every time 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.090
 I am going to shoot and I move I take a step 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.020
 later my character one step further 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.910
 ahead 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.740
 I will not hit the truth is you can 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.250
 point at the tip of the head 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.800
 can point at the tip in the belly 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.660
 on the roof anywhere but you never go 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.090
 to hit because when you walk is like 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.640
 that the bullet would never have come out if 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.640
 it leaves but it deviates and never never never 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.160
 you 're never going to hit her and that's the 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.950
 cricket time or what what I 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.020
 recommend is to release the 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.390
 joystick the joystick tv with which one 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.920
 moves with which it does not move 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.080
 front to back and sides that 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.940
 release at the time of making a record and 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.130
 use only the other immediately 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.290
 keep the enemy still using him and 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.450
 when they come back again they leave it and 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.820
 finally number 7 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.380
 never camps is and look for the enemy because 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.300
 I say this because when you go to 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.340
 keep changing you're not going to practice 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.770
 aim you're going to stay making leaves 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.360
 like cusco in a corner where they are not going to 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.919
 demonstrate no skill 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.050
 where the skill you have it 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.120
 prove looking for the enemy where you 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.280
 5 enemies appear at the same time and 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.770
 5 which manages to kill with the sniper 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.569
 with the sniper and well they have 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.569
 been the seven tips that I bring 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:42.460
 for this week and for the tips of 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.900
 sniper I hope you liked it 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.460
 much this video and that it has served 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.349
 also to those who want to be 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.439
 snipers or what they already are and not 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:52.060
 they knew something and well I hope nothing that 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:56.759
 have enjoyed it and see you in the 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.759
 next to God here he says goodbye
