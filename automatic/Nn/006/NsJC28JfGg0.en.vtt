and that ecosystem going first thing we

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.830 
and that ecosystem going first thing we
wanted<00:01:16.370> to<00:01:16.430> do<00:01:16.579> is<00:01:16.700> make<00:01:16.850> it<00:01:16.939> look<00:01:17.060> like<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.240> 360

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840

came<00:01:19.430> out<00:01:19.490> today<00:01:19.759> how<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.060> feel<00:01:20.390> how<00:01:20.570> would<00:01:20.630> it

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
came out today how to feel how would it

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.840 
came out today how to feel how would it
be<00:01:20.780> different<00:01:20.869> sometimes<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.920> find<00:01:22.430> a<00:01:22.610> little

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
be different sometimes you find a little

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.760 
be different sometimes you find a little
addition<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:23.420> it's<00:01:23.509> like<00:01:23.600> god<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:23.810> wish<00:01:23.990> this

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770

could<00:01:24.979> have<00:01:25.130> been<00:01:25.159> in<00:01:25.340> there<00:01:25.460> 10<00:01:25.670> years<00:01:25.700> ago

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
could have been in there 10 years ago

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.490 
could have been in there 10 years ago
and<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.329> looks<00:01:26.509> so<00:01:26.689> right<00:01:26.869> in<00:01:27.020> there<00:01:27.170> right<00:01:27.200> now

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
and it looks so right in there right now

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.840 
and it looks so right in there right now
then<00:01:27.979> that's<00:01:28.009> what<00:01:28.219> we're<00:01:28.369> looking<00:01:28.610> for<00:01:28.640> and
