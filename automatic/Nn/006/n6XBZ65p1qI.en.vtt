model has the machine guns and in the of
course<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.359> original<00:00:27.830> airplane<00:00:28.830> is

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
course in the original airplane is

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.679 
course in the original airplane is
synchronized<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.760> fire<00:00:29.939> through<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.210> problem

synchronized to fire through the problem

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.170 
synchronized to fire through the problem
so<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.960> way<00:00:31.080> with<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.410> prop<00:00:31.710> as<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.820> notice

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
so that way with this prop as you notice

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.260 
so that way with this prop as you notice
we<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:34.230> landing<00:00:34.710> gears<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.280> spring

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
we have landing gears that spring

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.940 
we have landing gears that spring
mounted<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> give<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.530> little<00:00:37.739> extra

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
mounted so I give you a little extra

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.450 
mounted so I give you a little extra
action<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.329> there<00:00:39.629> for<00:00:39.960> impact<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.160> harder

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
action in there for impact on harder

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.549 
action in there for impact on harder
landings<00:00:42.050> excel<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> sides<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
landings excel the sides of the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.860 
landings excel the sides of the
airplanes<00:00:43.980> about<00:00:44.219> 50<00:00:44.520> inch<00:00:44.670> wingspan<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.780> it's

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
airplanes about 50 inch wingspan so it's

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.660 
airplanes about 50 inch wingspan so it's
fairly<00:00:46.050> large<00:00:46.789> a<00:00:47.789> little<00:00:48.690> assembly<00:00:49.590> hit<00:00:50.039> hints

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
fairly large a little assembly hit hints

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.459 
fairly large a little assembly hit hints
would<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:51.059> when<00:00:51.660> assembling<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
would be when assembling like the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.319 
would be when assembling like the
landing<00:00:52.800> gear<00:00:53.039> put<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> rod<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:53.879> through

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
landing gear put the rod in through

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.810 
landing gear put the rod in through
first<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.960> then<00:00:55.710> align<00:00:56.010> everything<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.610> that

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
first and then align everything on that

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.389 
first and then align everything on that
because<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.539> screws<00:00:57.840> work<00:00:58.050> better<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.590> way

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
because the screws work better that way

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.970 
because the screws work better that way
the<00:00:59.969> other<00:01:00.090> item<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:01.260> leave<00:01:01.440> if<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.739> if

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the other item you can leave if you if

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.830 
the other item you can leave if you if
for<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.579> guys<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.000> really<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> scale

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
for the guys that really like the scale

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.899 
for the guys that really like the scale
look<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.559> always<00:01:04.710> leave<00:01:05.010> off<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.430> tail

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
look you can always leave off the tail

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.840 
look you can always leave off the tail
wheel<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.479> work<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> skid<00:01:07.850> that

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
wheel and just work on the skid that

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.730 
wheel and just work on the skid that
proves<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.720> more<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.170> problem<00:01:10.409> when<00:01:10.710> we

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
proves to be more of a problem when we

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.830 
proves to be more of a problem when we
have<00:01:10.860> crosswinds<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.090> right<00:01:12.270> now<00:01:12.420> we've<00:01:12.630> got<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
have crosswinds so right now we've got a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.770 
have crosswinds so right now we've got a
out<00:01:13.110> about<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.830> 20<00:01:14.159> mile<00:01:14.310> an<00:01:14.460> hour<00:01:14.549> breeze<00:01:14.970> so

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
out about a 20 mile an hour breeze so

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.520 
out about a 20 mile an hour breeze so
this<00:01:16.740> thing<00:01:16.920> really<00:01:17.250> weather<00:01:17.549> vane<00:01:17.790> into<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
this thing really weather vane into the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.499 
this thing really weather vane into the
wind<00:01:19.549> this<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.790> battery<00:01:20.970> compartment

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
wind this is the battery compartment

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.260 
wind this is the battery compartment
forward<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.950> notice<00:01:23.250> how<00:01:23.369> large<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.880> is

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
forward and you notice how large it is

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.670 
forward and you notice how large it is
they<00:01:25.460> recommended<00:01:26.479> 2,200<00:01:27.479> if<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.530> that

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
they recommended 2,200 if you do that

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.380 
they recommended 2,200 if you do that
you<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.549> add<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> little<00:01:29.939> nose<00:01:30.119> way<00:01:30.329> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
you can have to add a little nose way to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.310 
you can have to add a little nose way to
get<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> CG<00:01:31.079> right<00:01:31.290> about<00:01:32.070> two<00:01:32.939> ounces<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:34.020> in

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
get the CG right about two ounces so in

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.920 
get the CG right about two ounces so in
cases<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.579> prefer<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.750> add<00:01:36.900> a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
cases like that I prefer just to add a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.990 
cases like that I prefer just to add a
larger<00:01:37.350> battery<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.130> quite<00:01:38.369> easy<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.729> do

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
larger battery and it's quite easy to do

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.319 
larger battery and it's quite easy to do
just<00:01:39.869> trim<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.170> off<00:01:40.380> here<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.610> can

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
just trim it off here and and you can

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.630 
just trim it off here and and you can
fit<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.600> right<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:42.990> Bobby<00:01:43.710> back<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> shop

gives<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.310> very<00:01:59.340> very<00:01:59.880> good<00:02:00.030> effect<00:02:00.390> as<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.600> can

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
gives a very very good effect as you can

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.440 
gives a very very good effect as you can
tell<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.369> let's<00:02:02.369> plug<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> battery<00:02:03.060> and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
tell so let's plug in the battery and

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.470 
tell so let's plug in the battery and
I'll<00:02:04.110> take<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.469> up<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.740> its<00:02:04.950> flight

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.670 

and<00:02:11.480> we're<00:02:11.750> going<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.900> take<00:02:12.079> off<00:02:12.290> right<00:02:12.500> into

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
and we're going to take off right into

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.899 
and we're going to take off right into
the<00:02:12.859> breeze<00:02:17.650> very<00:02:18.650> very<00:02:19.129> short<00:02:19.489> takeoff<00:02:19.879> you

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
the breeze very very short takeoff you

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.110 
the breeze very very short takeoff you
notice<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.569> just<00:02:21.379> lift<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.459> right<00:02:22.519> off

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
notice that just lift it right off

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:35.440 
notice that just lift it right off
typical<00:02:23.540> actually<00:02:23.989> of<00:02:24.109> biplanes<00:02:33.519> do<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.549> flyby

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
typical actually of biplanes do a flyby

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.720 
typical actually of biplanes do a flyby
here<00:02:35.870> kind<00:02:36.079> of<00:02:36.139> a<00:02:36.230> cruise

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.270 

and<00:02:43.239> will<00:02:43.510> come<00:02:43.690> around<00:02:43.810> again<00:02:44.080> I'll<00:02:45.069> come

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
and will come around again I'll come

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.820 
and will come around again I'll come
around<00:02:45.370> downwind<00:02:46.080> one<00:02:47.080> thing<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:47.410> airplane

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
around downwind one thing this airplane

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.460 
around downwind one thing this airplane
does<00:02:48.040> requires<00:02:48.519> that<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.660> be<00:02:49.690> able<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.319> use

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
does requires that you be able to use

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.430 
does requires that you be able to use
two<00:02:50.620> rudder<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.980> bit<00:02:51.250> more<00:02:51.489> a<00:02:52.180> much<00:02:52.959> more<00:02:53.110> scale

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
two rudder a bit more a much more scale

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.940 
two rudder a bit more a much more scale
like<00:02:53.709> on<00:02:53.920> your<00:02:54.040> turns<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.640> way

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.180 

pull<00:02:59.950> up<00:03:00.099> vertically<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.670> little<00:03:00.910> bit<00:03:01.050> come

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
pull up vertically a little bit come

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.809 
pull up vertically a little bit come
swooping<00:03:03.190> down<00:03:03.220> right<00:03:04.180> onto<00:03:04.569> our<00:03:05.819> positions

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
swooping down right onto our positions

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.740 
swooping down right onto our positions
there<00:03:07.090> okay

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.500

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
now we're going to come by again and

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.110 
now we're going to come by again and
we're<00:03:15.050> going<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.230> pull<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.470> roll<00:03:15.820> see<00:03:16.820> how<00:03:16.910> that

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
we're going to pull a roll see how that

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.320 
we're going to pull a roll see how that
handles<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.630> I<00:03:17.840> actually<00:03:18.530> have<00:03:18.920> not<00:03:19.180> done<00:03:20.180> any

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
handles it I actually have not done any

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.000 
handles it I actually have not done any
aerobatics<00:03:20.930> with<00:03:21.020> the<00:03:21.110> US<00:03:21.260> airplane<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:21.830> we'll

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
aerobatics with the US airplane so we'll

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.660 
aerobatics with the US airplane so we'll
just<00:03:22.220> find<00:03:22.460> out<00:03:22.550> how<00:03:22.670> it<00:03:22.760> goes<00:03:22.940> oh<00:03:27.430> very<00:03:28.430> nice

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
just find out how it goes oh very nice

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.760 
just find out how it goes oh very nice
very<00:03:29.170> nice<00:03:30.170> for<00:03:30.440> a<00:03:30.470> biplane

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.080 

yeah<00:03:33.770> we'll<00:03:34.040> come<00:03:34.160> by<00:03:34.370> again<00:03:34.490> we're<00:03:34.940> going<00:03:35.030> to

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
yeah we'll come by again we're going to

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.400 
yeah we'll come by again we're going to
pull<00:03:35.270> it<00:03:35.390> off<00:03:35.480> vertically<00:03:38.110> pull<00:03:39.110> into<00:03:39.260> a

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
pull it off vertically pull into a

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.530 
pull it off vertically pull into a
little<00:03:39.740> stall<00:03:40.040> there

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:04:02.330 

come<00:03:44.540> back<00:03:44.720> down<00:03:45.019> and<00:03:46.810> cruise<00:03:47.810> on<00:03:48.050> by

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.240 

okay<00:04:03.340> we're<00:04:03.490> gonna<00:04:03.900> try<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:04.990> looper<00:04:05.350> on<00:04:05.470> over<00:04:05.860> do

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
okay we're gonna try a looper on over do

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:16.789 
okay we're gonna try a looper on over do
a<00:04:06.280> cobra<00:04:06.730> roll<00:04:06.880> come<00:04:07.870> on<00:04:08.050> down

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.830 

we<00:04:17.400> did<00:04:17.549> two<00:04:17.729> little<00:04:17.970> rolls<00:04:18.209> they're<00:04:18.539> kind<00:04:18.780> of

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
we did two little rolls they're kind of

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:26.119 
we did two little rolls they're kind of
squeeze<00:04:19.739> that<00:04:19.979> in<00:04:24.080> now<00:04:25.080> because<00:04:25.440> of<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.889> wind

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:26.129 
squeeze that in now because of the wind

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:28.820 
squeeze that in now because of the wind
I'm<00:04:26.940> flying<00:04:27.449> it<00:04:27.659> a<00:04:27.690> little<00:04:27.840> more<00:04:28.080> more<00:04:28.650> or<00:04:28.710> less

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
I'm flying it a little more more or less

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.629 
I'm flying it a little more more or less
a<00:04:28.860> full-power<00:04:29.490> very<00:04:30.150> close<00:04:30.419> to<00:04:30.659> it<00:04:30.840> oh<00:04:30.990> I<00:04:31.889> don't

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
a full-power very close to it oh I don't

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.730 
a full-power very close to it oh I don't
want<00:04:32.879> to<00:04:32.940> be<00:04:33.120> caught<00:04:33.360> going<00:04:33.659> downwind<00:04:34.199> and

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
want to be caught going downwind and

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.510 
want to be caught going downwind and
being<00:04:34.949> caught<00:04:35.129> in<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.310> very<00:04:35.490> very<00:04:35.699> bad<00:04:35.909> position

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
being caught in a very very bad position

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.830 
being caught in a very very bad position
because<00:04:38.520> it'll<00:04:38.759> breeze<00:04:38.940> like<00:04:39.210> this<00:04:39.419> is<00:04:39.659> easy

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
because it'll breeze like this is easy

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.360 
because it'll breeze like this is easy
you<00:04:40.259> can<00:04:40.440> almost<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:42.270> wind<00:04:42.479> is<00:04:42.569> almost<00:04:42.840> as<00:04:43.080> so

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
you can almost the wind is almost as so

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.969 
you can almost the wind is almost as so
strong<00:04:44.370> as<00:04:44.669> it<00:04:44.879> flying<00:04:45.150> downwind<00:04:45.780> so<00:04:46.379> if<00:04:46.650> I<00:04:46.770> did

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
strong as it flying downwind so if I did

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.200 
strong as it flying downwind so if I did
that<00:04:47.159> I<00:04:47.190> lose<00:04:47.490> all<00:04:47.669> my<00:04:47.819> lift

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
that I lose all my lift

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.050 
that I lose all my lift
now<00:04:48.900> let's<00:04:49.800> slow<00:04:50.250> it<00:04:50.280> down<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:50.699> see<00:04:50.849> how<00:04:50.880> it

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
now let's slow it down and see how it

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.790 
now let's slow it down and see how it
reacts<00:04:51.330> into<00:04:51.659> the<00:04:51.750> wind<00:04:54.259> the<00:04:55.259> balance<00:04:55.650> is<00:04:55.770> just

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
reacts into the wind the balance is just

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.800 
reacts into the wind the balance is just
about<00:04:56.280> right<00:04:56.520> now<00:04:57.090> I<00:04:57.120> have<00:04:57.360> a<00:04:57.419> fairly<00:04:57.720> large

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
about right now I have a fairly large

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.240 
about right now I have a fairly large
battery<00:04:58.289> here<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.560> I<00:04:58.620> actually<00:04:58.710> put<00:04:59.069> in<00:04:59.190> a

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
battery here and I actually put in a

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.399 
battery here and I actually put in a
four<00:04:59.490> thousand<00:04:59.970> give<00:05:00.630> me<00:05:00.720> a<00:05:00.780> little<00:05:01.259> extra

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
four thousand give me a little extra

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:18.700 
four thousand give me a little extra
flight<00:05:01.800> time

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.170 

okay<00:05:19.710> let's<00:05:19.920> do<00:05:20.040> a<00:05:20.070> little<00:05:20.280> bit<00:05:20.490> of<00:05:20.610> invert<00:05:21.000> it

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
okay let's do a little bit of invert it

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.630 
okay let's do a little bit of invert it
and<00:05:21.270> see<00:05:21.390> how<00:05:21.480> she<00:05:21.570> handles<00:05:21.900> handles<00:05:22.860> that<00:05:23.340> I

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
and see how she handles handles that I
