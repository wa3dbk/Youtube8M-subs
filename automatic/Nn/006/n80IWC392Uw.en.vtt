00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:08.610
 sometimes in portugal and there we are 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.660
 here for one more school tip 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.880
 professionals 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.530
 Let's give you a tip today. 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.969
 how to install a 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.980
 parking 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.680
 he will show you what 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.990
 from the parking sensor that the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.160
 parking indication goes straight 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.189
 in the rearview 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.710
 then this is the installation kit 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.260
 He's going to show you guys now. 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.090
 the marking I made on the bumper I 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.460
 I'll give you details how to do it. 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.920
 you see I got this one. 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.040
 I tell the story of the car because the other point 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.800
 it has an angle if I put capsule 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.950
 that he's going to drive out of the car 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.430
 and you will understand that some obstacle 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.739
 wall is like obstacle parking 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.570
 so I got a point here online 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.559
 straight line that approves the capsule 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.350
 directed 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.989
 Then you see how many capsules you 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.480
 have to measure from one end of the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.890
 capsules and you have to divide into three 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.799
 to power of the middle of the straight - laced to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.840
 shock with capsules stay right 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.440
 in the middle of the shock is not that 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.630
 Score 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.910
 Are you going to do it now? I 'll get the 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.570
 I'll get the drill that's coming in 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.570
 kit 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.580
 I'm going to start drilling the panel. 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.530
 then this one is the one that comes in the 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.410
 kit I'll put on the drill and I'll 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.800
 start sticking it to car shock 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:36.340
 Hello everyone, how's the motorcycle tip for you? 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.060
 this one that came in the kit today will go 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.030
 want to show you her own 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.890
 came out crooked and hot to the breeze she 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.650
 gave a slip that sees pie 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.930
 there what I had to do use a 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.990
 another drill to be able to do the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.170
 hole and that slide that gave the 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.900
 capsule will cover so you have to take 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.420
 this care to own here because O 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.190
 the unforeseen we lacked not 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.440
 it may also be that since this situation 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.000
 Here's a tip for you not to 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.000
 damage him to his car's shock 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.569
 OK 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.440
 So the people we're going to call now. 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.740
 positive and negative feed that will 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.430
 into the whip of the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.620
 straight 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.960
 let's make this bid now 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.030
 So we just found 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.490
 that the son of the Re 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.990
 this is the movie will be released on the network 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.270
 How do you engage the reverse? 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.980
 it gives a positive boost and here we 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.050
 we have a negative 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.720
 so you see we already tested here 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.960
 it's working now we 're just missing 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.820
 position the mirror in place of the car 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.440
 now with a new cut on that side 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.440
 human sun sign from there 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:04.689
 i 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.430
 ball is then installed and a 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.040
 sensor that's more a school tip and 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.490
 for you , it was worth it until the 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.490
 next
