during the attack on December the 7th
1941<00:00:16.520> ok<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:17.580> let's<00:00:18.090> pop<00:00:18.240> up<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.510> pilots<00:00:18.869> notes

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
1941 ok so let's pop up the pilots notes

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.250 
1941 ok so let's pop up the pilots notes
by<00:00:19.260> pressing<00:00:19.710> shift<00:00:20.039> 2<00:00:20.460> ok<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.510> first<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:22.080> have

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
by pressing shift 2 ok so first we have

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.870 
by pressing shift 2 ok so first we have
ground<00:00:22.500> speed<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.070> that's<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> actual<00:00:23.609> speed

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
ground speed and that's the actual speed

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.670 
ground speed and that's the actual speed
you're<00:00:24.060> flying<00:00:24.390> over<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.930> ground<00:00:25.170> surface

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
you're flying over the ground surface

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.080 
you're flying over the ground surface
very<00:00:26.099> simple<00:00:26.570> ok<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:27.630> second<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.380> endurance

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
very simple ok so second is endurance

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.790 
very simple ok so second is endurance
this<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.570> amount<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.990> time<00:00:31.199> your<00:00:31.439> aircraft

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
this is the amount of time your aircraft

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.459 
this is the amount of time your aircraft
can<00:00:31.949> fly<00:00:32.360> at<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> current<00:00:33.809> rate<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.079> fuel

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
can fly at the current rate of fuel

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.869 
can fly at the current rate of fuel
consumption<00:00:36.230> range<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> distance<00:00:38.579> are

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
consumption range is the distance are

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.630 
consumption range is the distance are
your<00:00:39.450> aircraft<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.079> fly<00:00:40.110> at<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.250> current

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
your aircraft can fly at the current

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.160 
your aircraft can fly at the current
speed<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.239> rate<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.989> fuel<00:00:43.559> consumption<00:00:44.370> again

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
speed and rate of fuel consumption again

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.500 
speed and rate of fuel consumption again
ok<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.230> last<00:00:46.590> but<00:00:46.710> not<00:00:46.920> least<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.399> fuel<00:00:47.910> economy

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
ok so last but not least is fuel economy

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.840 
ok so last but not least is fuel economy
this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> current<00:00:50.070> rate<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.309> fuel

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
this is the current rate of fuel

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.490 
this is the current rate of fuel
consumption<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.690> gallons<00:00:52.140> per<00:00:52.410> hour<00:00:52.680> gph<00:00:54.500> your

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
consumption in gallons per hour gph your

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.430 
consumption in gallons per hour gph your
high<00:00:55.739> temperature<00:00:55.770> warning<00:00:56.690> will<00:00:57.690> display<00:00:58.170> if

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
high temperature warning will display if

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.470 
high temperature warning will display if
your<00:00:58.859> engine<00:00:59.039> temperatures<00:00:59.730> do<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.090> get<00:01:00.300> too

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
your engine temperatures do you get too

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.560 
your engine temperatures do you get too
hot<00:01:01.219> alright<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.579> next<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.359> power

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
hot alright so next we have power

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.950 
hot alright so next we have power

we now have a box in the top left hand

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.179 
we now have a box in the top left hand
corner<00:01:21.170> this<00:01:22.170> feature<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.619> more<00:01:22.830> or<00:01:23.159> less

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
corner this feature is more or less

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.030 
corner this feature is more or less
quick<00:01:23.580> access<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.659> let<00:01:25.320> me<00:01:25.350> read<00:01:25.560> out<00:01:25.740> some<00:01:25.770> of

the things you can actually get with
this<00:01:28.220> quick<00:01:29.220> access<00:01:29.400> tool<00:01:29.900> ok<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.320> put

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
this quick access tool ok so you can put

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.100 
this quick access tool ok so you can put
your<00:01:31.590> aircraft<00:01:32.040> up<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.369> jacks<00:01:32.670> more<00:01:33.659> or<00:01:33.750> less<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
your aircraft up on jacks more or less a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.800 
your aircraft up on jacks more or less a
practiced<00:01:34.680> all<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.070> taking<00:01:35.220> off<00:01:35.810> landings

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
practiced all for taking off landings

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.660 
practiced all for taking off landings
and<00:01:37.140> things<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.070> really<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.579> can

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
and things like that really so you can

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.760 
and things like that really so you can
go<00:01:38.759> through<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.060> cockpit<00:01:39.240> procedures<00:01:39.840> so

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
go through the cockpit procedures so

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.319 
go through the cockpit procedures so
you're<00:01:40.920> familiar<00:01:41.040> with<00:01:41.280> them<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:41.729> when<00:01:42.240> you

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
you're familiar with them but when you

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.810 
you're familiar with them but when you
come<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.659> actually<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.259> real<00:01:43.409> thing<00:01:43.820> nice

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
come to actually do the real thing nice

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.340 
come to actually do the real thing nice
little<00:01:45.119> feature<00:01:45.270> accuracy<00:01:45.930> might<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.170> put

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
little feature accuracy might have put

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.310 
little feature accuracy might have put
in<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.950> radiator<00:01:47.369> flaps<00:01:47.729> slider<00:01:48.479> okay<00:01:49.259> you

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
in is the radiator flaps slider okay you

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.719 
in is the radiator flaps slider okay you
can<00:01:49.500> slide<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.009> right<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
can slide it to the right and to the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.639 
can slide it to the right and to the
left<00:01:50.820> which<00:01:51.240> basically<00:01:51.570> means<00:01:51.810> open<00:01:52.259> or

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
left which basically means open or

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.200 
left which basically means open or
closed<00:01:52.890> so

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
closed so

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.850 
closed so
should<00:01:56.210> probably<00:01:56.270> see<00:01:56.630> under<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.380> aircraft

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
should probably see under the aircraft

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.280 
should probably see under the aircraft
they<00:01:57.920> are<00:01:58.070> opening<00:01:58.400> and<00:01:58.660> now<00:01:59.660> they're<00:01:59.870> closing

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
they are opening and now they're closing

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.690 
they are opening and now they're closing
it<00:02:00.410> does<00:02:00.590> give<00:02:00.800> you<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:00.920> percentage<00:02:01.220> of<00:02:01.520> what

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
it does give you a percentage of what

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.300 
it does give you a percentage of what
they<00:02:01.820> are<00:02:01.970> as<00:02:02.120> well<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:03.500> other<00:02:03.680> nice<00:02:04.040> one

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
they are as well the other nice one

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.360 
they are as well the other nice one

personal weight is 159 pounds okay 72 so

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.050 
personal weight is 159 pounds okay 72 so
I<00:03:08.930> always<00:03:09.290> enter<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.770> in<00:03:09.950> before<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.760> go<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:10.910> a

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
I always enter that in before I go to a

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.720 
I always enter that in before I go to a
flight<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:13.040> does<00:03:13.190> give<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.489> lot<00:03:13.640> of

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
flight it does give you a lot of

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.270 
flight it does give you a lot of
information<00:03:14.270> such<00:03:14.450> as<00:03:14.480> a<00:03:14.660> fuel<00:03:15.380> total<00:03:15.770> and

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
information such as a fuel total and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.860 
information such as a fuel total and
tells<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:16.880> a<00:03:16.910> bit<00:03:16.940> about<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.239> there<00:03:17.540> as<00:03:17.660> well

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
tells you a bit about it there as well

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.900 
tells you a bit about it there as well
and<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.709> think<00:03:18.739> gets<00:03:19.010> low<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.280> can<00:03:19.550> always<00:03:19.730> stop

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
and I think gets low you can always stop

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.360 
and I think gets low you can always stop
it<00:03:20.060> up<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.390> problem<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.680> what<00:03:22.070> you<00:03:22.160> got<00:03:22.280> to

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
it up a problem so what you got to

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.850 
it up a problem so what you got to
remember<00:03:22.430> is<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.150> aircraft<00:03:23.630> is<00:03:23.860> basically

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
remember is the aircraft is basically

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.030 
remember is the aircraft is basically
initially<00:03:25.520> it's<00:03:25.790> prepared<00:03:26.300> for<00:03:27.040> standard

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
initially it's prepared for standard

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.130 
initially it's prepared for standard
flights<00:03:28.280> with<00:03:28.700> ammunition<00:03:29.060> loaded<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:29.930> the

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
flights with ammunition loaded and the

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.699 
flights with ammunition loaded and the
oxygen<00:03:30.260> tanks<00:03:30.950> empty<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:32.540> before<00:03:33.110> you<00:03:33.410> gave

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
oxygen tanks empty so before you gave

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.110 
oxygen tanks empty so before you gave
for<00:03:33.860> a<00:03:33.920> flight<00:03:34.160> disturb<00:03:34.790> will<00:03:34.910> check

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
for a flight disturb will check

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.300 
for a flight disturb will check
everything<00:03:35.420> get<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.380> nice<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:36.590> smooth<00:03:37.040> and

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
everything get it nice and smooth and

everything get it nice and smooth and
obviously<00:03:37.940> enjoy<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.420> rescue<00:03:38.720> time<00:03:38.840> in<00:03:39.019> a

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
obviously enjoy the rescue time in a

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.250 
obviously enjoy the rescue time in a
cockpit<00:03:39.580> okay<00:03:40.580> so<00:03:40.640> next<00:03:41.030> is<00:03:41.330> the<00:03:41.390> maintenance

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
cockpit okay so next is the maintenance

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.310 
cockpit okay so next is the maintenance
hangar<00:03:42.590> so<00:03:43.459> by<00:03:43.790> pressing<00:03:44.180> shift<00:03:44.450> 7<00:03:44.840> we'll<00:03:45.170> just

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
hangar so by pressing shift 7 we'll just

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.750 
hangar so by pressing shift 7 we'll just
bring<00:03:45.560> that<00:03:45.620> up

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.880 

so<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.540> maintenance<00:03:52.989> hangar<00:03:53.290> is<00:03:53.439> where<00:03:53.470> you

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
can obviously see that if anything needs

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.280 
can obviously see that if anything needs
replacing<00:05:15.310> if<00:05:15.760> it's<00:05:15.940> yellow<00:05:16.300> or<00:05:16.750> if<00:05:16.900> it's<00:05:17.050> red

replacing if it's yellow or if it's red
you<00:05:17.320> can<00:05:17.530> just<00:05:17.800> fix<00:05:17.980> it<00:05:19.020> depending<00:05:20.020> on<00:05:20.020> what<00:05:20.380> it

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
you can just fix it depending on what it

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.010 
you can just fix it depending on what it
is<00:05:20.590> red<00:05:21.040> obviously<00:05:21.460> is<00:05:21.610> critical<00:05:22.240> or<00:05:22.480> it's<00:05:22.780> not

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
is red obviously is critical or it's not

working properly yellow is ok but needs

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.410 
working properly yellow is ok but needs
some<00:05:26.680> attention<00:05:26.890> or<00:05:27.460> some<00:05:27.640> assistance<00:05:28.090> to<00:05:28.270> it
