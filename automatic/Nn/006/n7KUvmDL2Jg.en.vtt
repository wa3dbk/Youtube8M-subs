 [Music] 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.980
 out there I hope you are doing today 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.660
 google 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.670
 I would like to show you how to 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.960
 make fast itself makes namely 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.599
 I have first of all about 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.699
 Inquire from where the concept of French nails 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.710
 at all , and you can 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.670
 Of course, clearly he thinks he comes from the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.279
 French 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.119
 but you give it back to the 18th 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.760
 century 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.269
 that means the women or ladies from the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.520
 At that time, I say, to a higher society 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.340
 have started their fingernails 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.559
 to stain white tips and have them 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.930
 that's just because it is 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.820
 at that time did not send just filthy 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.120
 have fingernails and they have then 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.620
 just painted the fingernails white with it 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.000
 one the dirt tab or not see it 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.579
 you only thought I was okay 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.699
 the chic lady is maybe now 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.350
 also a farmer's wife or something and that's why 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.100
 that's how it was then i would say now 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.100
 go now 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.580
 before you start the nail for yourself 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.540
 first or the nails first 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.470
 clean up 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.140
 I'll just take that 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.850
 nail polish remover and polishes the whole 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:21.110
 a little bit and then I go 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:27.320
 with the rauswurf of peter goes here 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:34.479
 the skin on it with the side push the 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.479
 skin backwards about like that 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.800
 after that, plant parts and do the 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.970
 surface of the nail a bit 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.280
 Smoother so that looks just nicer 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.170
 Just find us a better one 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.830
 basis for the nail polish he 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.830
 equal to the order 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.200
 and now I go with the first 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:06.549
 Layer of nail polish on it take here 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.580
 to the in nude blame nail polish carries him 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.879
 with the first shift to one 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:17.790
 small tip from me if the nail polish 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:20.459
 then wear here in the middle 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.280
 first quiet a bit from the edge 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.980
 free because that makes it easy 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:35.019
 Fingernail visually just a bit 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:40.180
 narrower so I'm wearing the second now 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:43.709
 shift up and I recommend you 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.140
 to bring a lot of rest with you 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.690
 and not just try somehow the 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.410
 to make fans in five minutes because of it 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.849
 is definitely wrong on that day 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.349
 best drink no coffee before 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.349
 because that makes shaky hands 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.420
 the nail polish would have to be dried slowly 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.790
 and now I use essens 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:15.799
 this tip painter needlepoint white 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:19.900
 lace white and I draw first 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.900
 here a contour and indeed 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.799
 Crescent-shaped you see then you have to 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.299
 really very much 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:33.560
 have a touch of tact 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:40.519
 you've already got those 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:42.680
 form only paints I can definitely 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.150
 I too can do a lot 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.980
 I think it will not get better either 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.930
 and now even you here the other side 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.930
 also still a little bit 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:04:05.739
 actually quite simple 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:07.510
 but you see, as always, stay calm and 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.430
 to be patient 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.870
 it's very hard for me I am 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.870
 actually an absolutely illogical 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.820
 now comes the last step and that 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.810
 I go now with the overpaint of peto 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:28.080
 again over here area actually 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.600
 a layer completely and you see the 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.250
 Location shines directly and what I too 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.750
 super find here is this overcoating 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.780
 that he also minor paint damage and 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:41.880
 Scratch away makes that is totally that is 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.350
 very very great and after it that way 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.030
 I will now make my final 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.440
 quickly out and I am mine 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.930
 actually quite good for that 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.669
 I do not do that often, but now 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.310
 which is very important for a quick one 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.080
 really fit with every outfit 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.940
 that is when work is working now and 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.300
 you have a little red or pop 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.060
 orange-colored nail polish on it 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.110
 they can be very wrong 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.720
 arrive badly 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.880
 therefore suitable for any look on the rock 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.650
 and I think it's better than you 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.260
 does not wear nail polish because it works 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.699
 then kinda paint it a bit 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.780
 and i hope i could help you with that 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.150
 help a little bit further 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.710
 if you have any questions just below 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.150
 write in the comments 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.070
 and then we'll see each other next time 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.070
 again bite then make it good 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.279
