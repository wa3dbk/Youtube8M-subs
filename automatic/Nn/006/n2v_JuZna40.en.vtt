00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.900
 that I am studying to be a chef and 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.970
 I bring you a recipe that can 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.070
 enjoy and can take advantage of doing it 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.680
 this end of the year to surprise your 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:38.730
 families and give yourself a good taste after 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:40.140
 of having dined and in the new year and the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.330
 ingredients that we will need are 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.430
 the crushed cookie that here more you 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.979
 like four teaspoons of butter 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.230
 a teaspoon of vanilla extract 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:54.320
 three eggs 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.930
 half a cup of sugar 3 bars of cheese 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.000
 cream layer 7 is ok very well let's 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.370
 start to put it as we are seeing 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.440
 today here I had already put to melt 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.440
 the butter and then put it in the 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.710
 capacetes and we're going to crush it with a 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.400
 glass so that we have what is the 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.530
 base of our friends jokes 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.770
 in a bowl we are going to put the three bars 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.300
 of cream cheese and remember at temperature 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.010
 environment to make it better we continue 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.010
 beating and what we are beating 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.510
 add teaspoon extract 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.510
 vanilla and we keep beating 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.700
 and we add the eggs slowly for 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.720
 promote a better mix of eggs 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.720
 and the cream cheese 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.650
 we add the sugar 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.530
 and emotional we want everything until the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.740
 that a very good consistency parts the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.740
 Water 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.650
 this is the consistency that we must 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.750
 have we are going to add to the 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:17.430
 graveyards already with the cookie our 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:20.550
 mix can see let's leave a 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.860
 centimeter of space to prevent it from 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.770
 spill us at the time of baking 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.440
 once we have them in the layers in 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.510
 three already ready let's try to give 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.370
 a few hits to remove all 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.190
 the sheets of air that may remain 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.230
 that can make our product not 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.010
 go out the way you want then we go 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.400
 to bake at 165 degrees for about 25 or 30 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.400
 minutes 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.500
 at the time of completion of the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.300
 25 or 30 minutes of baking 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.310
 we're going to take them out and we'll leave them 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.200
 aside to cool as we can 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.620
 see in this image they are already a little 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.950
 inflated already after they cool down they 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.090
 they're going to decrease their size and they're going 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.090
 to stay this way 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.069
 I will leave it like that but why I like it 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.269
 the most singlist 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.909
 but I say the same and you can 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.370
 ingeniate them more and you can make challenges 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:18.799
 this we can see also how is 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.019
 divided the cookie and the stuffing that is 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.510
 obviously what is the cheesecake of 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.799
 true but also very rich and good 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.780
 people this was all for today 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.790

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.319

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.459
