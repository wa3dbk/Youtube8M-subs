button
not<00:00:29.130> yet<00:00:29.250> no<00:00:29.400> I'll<00:00:29.550> let<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.789> know<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.480> always

not yet no I'll let you know I always

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.680 
not yet no I'll let you know I always
ran<00:00:30.960> first<00:00:31.800> about<00:00:32.009> oh<00:00:32.369> okay<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.300> when<00:00:33.570> he

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
ran first about oh okay and when he

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.120 
ran first about oh okay and when he
captured<00:00:34.020> me<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.260> changed<00:00:34.710> my<00:00:34.829> left

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
captured me that I changed my left

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.549 
captured me that I changed my left
portal<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.180> then<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.110> put<00:00:37.320> him<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.469> an

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
portal to here and then I put him in an

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.830 
portal to here and then I put him in an
infinite<00:00:37.890> loop<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.160> let's<00:00:39.149> see<00:00:39.360> how<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.629> goes

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
infinite loop and let's see how it goes

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.290 
infinite loop and let's see how it goes
so<00:00:40.170> I'm<00:00:40.800> pushing<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> button<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.550> three<00:00:41.760> two

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
so I'm pushing the button in three two

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.430 
so I'm pushing the button in three two
one<00:00:42.680> push<00:00:47.510> right<00:00:48.510> now<00:00:48.570> he's<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:48.960> an<00:00:49.020> infinite

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
one push right now he's in an infinite

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.400 
one push right now he's in an infinite
loop<00:00:49.559> his<00:00:50.280> job<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> point<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.809> lasers<00:00:52.170> at

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
loop his job is to point the lasers at

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.709 
loop his job is to point the lasers at
the<00:00:52.590> robots<00:00:53.059> once<00:00:54.059> he's<00:00:54.239> done<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.510> they'll

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
the robots once he's done that they'll

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.510 
the robots once he's done that they'll
destroy<00:00:55.079> them<00:00:55.260> now<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.010> only<00:00:56.160> but<00:00:56.430> it

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
destroy them now this is the only but it

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.610 
destroy them now this is the only but it
takes<00:00:56.640> time<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.020> touch<00:00:58.199> him<00:00:58.410> once

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
takes time it's just a touch him once

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.950 
takes time it's just a touch him once
and<00:00:58.859> oh<00:00:59.070> my<00:00:59.280> lord
