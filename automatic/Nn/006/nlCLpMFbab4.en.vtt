00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 Welcome everyone to watch "Heroes you don't know". This time is about Timo. 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.989
 Don't forget that I will upload a new episode every Sunday and remember to watch it regularly. 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:16.078
 If you like it, don’t say a word, let’s talk about the skills. 

00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:18.289
 Little knowledge I only knew when I was making a film. 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.876
 If you get hurt after launching the light shield 

00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:26.547
 (This is because you are not in combat and you are just like going back to the city and five-speed shoes.) As long as the light shield is still absorbing damage, you will still enter the invisible 

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:30.968
 Although Timothy is not seen, it will still appear when it is hurt. 

00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:36.891
 Like the repelling of Rams Q skills, careful ridicule, etc. 

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:43.064
 We all know that when Timothy is hurt, it will not enter the invisible general attack. 

00:00:43.064 --> 00:00:49.195
 But igniting is another matter. Timing in the body, no action, still invisible. 

00:00:49.195 --> 00:00:54.492
 Timothy's passive launch when returning to the city or transmitting 

00:00:54.492 --> 00:01:01.457
 Even if you are invisible, you will return to the city or transfer. 

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:03.000
 This is quite interesting 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.716
 Timothy's slow-moving mushrooms are based on grades of 30% 40% and 50% 

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:14.470
 If you bring a cane range skill slowdown effect 15% 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.768
 The slow-acting effect of the ice stick and the mushroom will only provide a 5% slowdown. 

00:01:20.768 --> 00:01:25.189
 This is because of the slow superposition setting of League of Legends. 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.067
 But after the slow speed of the mushrooms is finished, 

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:32.488
 There will be a slowdown of 0.5 seconds provided by the ice stick 

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:38.285
 This is because the slow speed of the ice stick is 1.5 seconds and the mushroom is 1 second. 

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:46.669
 (This is why the mushroom that is stepping on the ice stick and the speed of the mushroom will slowly increase.) That is, when the mushroom is slowed down, 15% of the ice stick will be saved. 

00:01:47.503 --> 00:01:54.176
 A point to pay attention to Tim Q's Q skills can be reset by the general attack cooling 

00:01:54.176 --> 00:02:00.391
 So you can use Maximize - Q - General Attack (AQA) to maximize damage. 

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:05.271
 If you put it on Warwick, then he will open it to you. 

00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:11.735
 (Because their big ones all have a hit effect and blindness will make the skill with a hit effect 喔) will strongly reduce the damage of the big ones. 

00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:15.406
 If Timothy's mushrooms hit a spell shield such as Xavier or Banshee. 

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:19.743
 They will completely absorb the attack of mushrooms and will not spread to nearby teammates. 

00:02:19.743 --> 00:02:27.793
 Remember that lowering the cooling can also reduce the time it takes to store the mushrooms. 

00:02:27.793 --> 00:02:33.924
 And when you save three, you need to use one to restart the timer. 

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:41.182
 A common mistake made by Timothy players is to put mushrooms together and think it will cause a lot of damage. 

00:02:41.182 --> 00:02:47.271
 Because the poisoning damage of mushrooms is not superimposed, it is only refreshed. 

00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:52.526
 When you upgraded, you have let go of the mushrooms. 

00:02:52.526 --> 00:03:02.203
 All the mushrooms you have already let go will increase your damage after you put a upgraded mushroom. 

00:03:02.203 --> 00:03:08.375
 Skills are enough to talk about it. It’s time to come up with little knowledge and story time. 

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:11.003
 (This is a designer is not a hero.) Timothy was designed by Ezreal. 

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:13.297
 He has created many heroes喔

00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:16.217
 Including Aliamm Yi Master Jax 

00:03:16.217 --> 00:03:18.761
 Cristina Warwick Nasser Rams 

00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:21.222
 Sinjid Britz Irrija Hanmedinger 

00:03:21.222 --> 00:03:22.264
 There are still many 喔

00:03:22.264 --> 00:03:26.393
 Now I know that I am unhappy, who is going to find out? 

00:03:26.393 --> 00:03:30.105
 Do you know that Teemo is the riddle of Emote? 

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:33.192
 The "Detective" talent in Universal Talent 

00:03:33.192 --> 00:03:36.028
 The person holding the telescope is Timothy. 

00:03:36.028 --> 00:03:43.327
 (Under the influence) Timo and Evelyn are the only heroes in the league who can be permanently invisible. 

00:03:43.327 --> 00:03:50.167
 In the movie released in the Mac version, you can see the arrow on the weapon display cabinet. 

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:52.920
 Do you know that Timothy is the smallest hero in the league? 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.469
 Its 100-unit x 100-unit shape makes it very easy to test range or range. 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.806
 Timo's joke: Body shape does not mean everything 

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:06.976
 Perhaps it is also to explain this fact. 

00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:09.603
 Although Timothy is very cute (?) 

00:04:09.603 --> 00:04:12.773
 But he was very serious when fighting. 

00:04:12.773 --> 00:04:18.195
 The jungle hunter styling should be based on a Flash animation "Badger Song" 

00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:20.406
 Christmas leprechaun in shape 

00:04:20.406 --> 00:04:22.992
 The snowman seems to be Houlgate 

00:04:22.992 --> 00:04:28.205
 And in the sky you can still see the Christmas style of the 寇格魔 and Gulagus喔

00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:32.918
 Cottontail (Cottontail) is a cottontail (Cottontail) rabbit 

00:04:32.918 --> 00:04:37.131
 Riot acknowledges Timothy’s ridicule 

00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:39.717
 If you use the resurrection rabbit shape, the effect is better. 

00:04:39.717 --> 00:04:44.096
 Timo Superman is of course based on Superman. 

00:04:44.096 --> 00:04:49.476
 This style will also fly when you start W skills. 

00:04:49.476 --> 00:04:57.609
 There are also many sentences similar to Superman in the announcement of this style. 

00:04:57.609 --> 00:04:58.652
 E.g 

00:04:58.652 --> 00:05:00.821
 It seems to be the time for Timo Superman to play. 

00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:04.658
 That is, the corresponding time seems to be Superman's appearance. 

00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:10.539
 The other sentence is to look at it! It is Phoenix! (refers to Ainivia) is a helicopter! (referring to Kutcher) is Timo Superman! 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.586
 It is the corresponding look! It is a bird! It is an airplane! It is Superman! 

00:05:15.586 --> 00:05:20.716
 The roast meat 粽 烧 烧 烧 烧 烧 烧 烧 烧 烧 烧 烧 烧 烧 烧 粽 粽 粽

00:05:20.716 --> 00:05:25.554
 Timo and Cristina became good friends after joining the League of Legends. 

00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:28.182
 There are also rumors that they have become lovers. 

00:05:28.182 --> 00:05:34.188
 When Vijay wanted to steal the mothership, Timo shot Vega (the escape balloon). 

00:05:34.188 --> 00:05:39.443
 And the mothership is an unfinished rocket protected by Timo and other guards. 

00:05:39.443 --> 00:05:43.655
 This episode of "The Hero You Don't Know" ends here. 

00:05:43.655 --> 00:05:50.913

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:06.178
 There are quite a few suggestions for Timothy’s suggestion in the previous episode. 

00:06:06.178 --> 00:06:08.180
 So what will you do? 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.684
