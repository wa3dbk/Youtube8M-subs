 also in this limited edition 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:55.830
 at 20 euros then battlefield 3 is the best 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.580
 multiplayer shooter

 spectacular mom shooter 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.780

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.130
 call of Duty 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.990
 then assassin's creed well i have to say that 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.880
 the other absent scripts I didn't play 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.950
 I stopped only on the 1st that I didn't 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.200
 bought at launch I bought it ie 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:34.690
 I recovered it in this version 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.400
 essential best of the platinum game 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.550
 very nice though in some places 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.139
 very repetitive tests the power of a 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.360
 assassin jesus aspects focus 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.610
 jerusalem 1191 after christ during the 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.870
 brutal period of the third crusade the 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.330
 life on the streets proceed 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.060
 frantically but in a few moments each 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.900
 what will change because of your altair a 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.260
 dreaded killer is very nice recovery 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.480
 the two brotherhood revelations on the 34th 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.150
 I have to recover this saga because it is 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:12.130
 beautiful though this even if the first one 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:16.120
 a little but then guys here are games of 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:19.419

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.890
 12 I sold it ok, let's talk 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:25.479
 briefly of the saga of pes 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:28.000
 here at pes 2011 and pes 2008 well let's say 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:32.710
 which was devastated precisely by fear 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.229
 much of the state has been exceeded 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.380
 overcome thanks fifa is much better 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:40.270
 buy row very very nice 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.400
 especially for the graphics for the 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.820
 realism ie take a shot from 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.410
 midfield pompeys may be marking 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.030
 35 13 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.950
 the ball may not even arrive 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.110

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:57.160
