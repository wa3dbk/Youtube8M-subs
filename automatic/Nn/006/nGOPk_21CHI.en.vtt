many<00:00:09.679> but<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.740> know<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:11.070> one<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.280> quite<00:00:11.550> easy

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
many but I know this one is quite easy

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.209 
many but I know this one is quite easy
to<00:00:11.910> get<00:00:12.120> hold<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:13.320> it's<00:00:13.500> reasonably<00:00:13.889> cheap

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
to get hold of and it's reasonably cheap

sketches pocket box and it's kind of
their<00:00:21.300> mid-range<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.619> above<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.699> you'd<00:00:23.910> get

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
their mid-range so above this you'd get

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.679
