00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.600
 we do something more 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.539
 the three meals to an absolute necessity 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:11.609
 the music star 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.859
 by wind do I say not that it's the same thing I bite myself I do not 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.539
 could not live without music 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.650
 but we know that there are millions of people who live very well without music 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.650
 it's a luxury 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.199
 the harmonic orchestra st-amantais what always strikes me in this clip 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.610
 young az stock 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.870
 quite simply 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.010
 at the generation change fair and the expansion of the 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.900
 portal so generation change to mindset change and 7 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.020
 it was a nationality now 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.340
 it's even huge 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.940
 it is obviously a mixture of lady that one lives today to put a friend of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.210
 difference culture that musically is not always easy because 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.350
 that's really it also means different schools of education on the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.059
 purely instrumental plane very different sometimes you have to try to 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.450
 to merge what is not always obvious 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.690
 but it's an orchestra full of enthusiasm that in my opinion has a 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.690
 huge potential 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.200
 it's a very special thing to play in the collective which for many is 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.590
 something absolutely 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.730
 incomprehensible because again he thinks that music is 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.410
 necessarily occur alone 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.390
 ton it's a collective job with all that that also entails as 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.820
 difficulty is a special thing but snsm 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.560
 a wonderful job 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.730
 I think it's really a beautiful success on the architectural level I 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.490
 from the building I'm not talking about the environment and then there is a 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.950
 extraordinary programming composed of a ranking will be made not only 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.390
 managed to make an extraordinary programming but also to drain a 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.470
 public 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.170
 completely new that we did not know before a very public 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.170
 cosmopolitan 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.960
 it's not palpable at the same time for anyone who does not like art 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.309
 who do not like music 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:13.049
 who does not like vibrations because it's vibrations in the air and in 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.529
 same time it's something extraordinary because it's 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:16.759
 prepares like a Swiss watch
