00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.770
 Turbo the pc for games you already stopped to think about how much could leave the 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.820
 your computer faster are several factors that can improve performance 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.219
 of your machine so that the games performing better before going into detail is 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.800
 It's good to evaluate the existing motherboard on your computer 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.609
 fundamentally the chassis of your machine is she who in rule day will define 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.970
 how much you can boost your pc is important to evaluate which are 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.770
 the ins and outs for the video card and memory processor and if they are 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.879
 compatible with the peripherals that we will indicate next we go there 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.930
 before you start to take good care 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.860
 We are very careful to work in the 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.140
 the agreement to give testimony French magina left the college past 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.880
 a lack 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.920
 so that you unload this because my contact until opposed to 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.240
 compute the department 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.609
 be with br 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:54.770
 the 'performance' 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.890
 we have some of the laboratory that protect the contract between psv that the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.630
 phone calls this question 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.630
 so that we can handle properly contains gloves 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.600
 The bracelets that we wore are attached to a bench ps 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.259
 to charge 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.930
 and you can quietly handle equipment 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.240
 without fear of erring three an electric current to damage the equipment 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.760
 electronic 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.720
 now 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.590
 hands down the first tip a motherboard our love of is usually 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.340
 It's best to stop here if the score is good. 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.520
 votes for video cards explains that this is a key element for the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.290
 good renal performance 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.210
 had video card with scottish memory 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.700
 to 15 12 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.549
 and even more than that in fact but the mind and its impact on the strong beating of the 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.909
 game was related to the processor we folks what we still board 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.250
 video 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.840
 the ufologist of memory interesting to load the visual of the game of the last one 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.409
 proof of maps 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.900
 of the texture part of the skating such 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.190
 but the mind what will make the paca serra plateau is the processor of it she has 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.700
 memory it has processor is the set 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.799
 the bag with the weak video card with lots of memory you will not have 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.799
 result with stronger paternity with slightly less memory 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.909
 so it's important 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.450
 Do you know what you're buying? 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.380
 and you really know 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.510
 when this mup plate marks points 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.510
 square beautiful game that makes 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.360
 if the memory 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.520
 today there are three standards of the market of cds and dvds and two dvds 3 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.400
 assessing the cost benefit of debtors is the best option in this case 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.180
 roberta decades 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.369
 fidelity is faster 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:37.339
 but if we go in the games and the modules are bigger in the two gigas of 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:38.180
 4 in force 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.599
 because you know there's no end 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.509
 this amount of memory goals 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:46.499
 a power supply is another key element, 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.120
 machine 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.760
 it is good to pay attention to this detail since they can not always be 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.700
 announced 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.440
 is the power that that device will actually deliver highlighted for example 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.219
 promises 450 vacancies when in the actual deliver penalty 168 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:07.079
 this one that promises 350 delivery up to 330 in limit situations 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.019
 do not be fooled he would go straight to the technical specifications of the 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.840
 equipment because more powerful computers 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.619
 require more energy 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:20.229
 already in the choice of agaves the possibilities are only three 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:24.309
 standard older idea and ended up being replaced by sasha 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:26.709
 which already has the models 5 2 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.709
 logically the two have better and faster 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.010
 there is a pattern that we are a form of caution since it is a 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.359
 a ride called 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.489
 we can get 'performance' will say what has something to say in a 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.040
 machine two hds sata arrival of zero 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.920
 that happens you will increase will put a lane more traffic c'mon 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.159
 up but it's normal 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.430
 an avenue with two ways a life like the way 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.640
 in two times you will be able to travel much more information to work 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.269
 faster and faster 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.080
 this leaves the machine in a few seconds faster than the normal mark 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.060
 the map of performace gives a difference to aol the question is that you have to have 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.080
 been used unequal or 2 82 6 60 then investment that is made 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.669
 performace kills 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.930
 investments in the question of italy I think it is a scam to approve in 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:17.349
 the fastest 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:21.069
 This is a very important factor to avoid overheating and 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:24.960
 consequently the decrease of performance today with the 

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:28.009
 technological equipment spend less energy 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:32.159
 and so this then - also there are still people who insist on 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:35.159
 demanding the maximum of processors is the so-called public 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.949
 dangerous behavior 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.229
 you have to know how to make invitations ready now that you already know how to choose 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.890
 the peripherals it's time to turn on the computer 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.730
 and there excluding suspect or view which is the best option in the world of games 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.610
 officer he works with texas 9 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.669
 When I saw them, it only works with sepsis 10 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.610
 you have a considered difference in game details over 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.919
 this kind of thing 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.949
 is the main one of the country only that so few are still the youngest games 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.129
 who have these managerial functions 10 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:16.770
 so today we have all games by susep to play perfectly in our 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.550
 site 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.789
 and will not have problem but will not have big big problems with oo 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.789
 air quality 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.229
 for better rap performance or set up the game with the settings 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.409
 compatible with your band 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:31.689
 you dance 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:34.189
 window concept istanbul 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:38.819
 according to your computer you connect puts to a minimum 4 medium coloco 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.580
 game with the high wall wheel by their perfect movement 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.750
 put an action is you come back soon 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.729
 the hotel in which case I play and the maximum double comparisons 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.729
 just like the video card can not handle it 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.469
 who also comes to give me better graphic quality 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:57.469
 no role car control caught fire becomes much more difficult 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.769
 why the pcp do it for him right with the left it does with more 

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:07.679
 Slowness percent of victims want to know more about this issue 

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:08.249
 access
