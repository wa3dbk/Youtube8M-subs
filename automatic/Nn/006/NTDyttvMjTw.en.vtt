screenshot by tommaso today this is

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.520 
screenshot by tommaso today this is
pretty<00:00:48.329> much<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.539> but<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.840> has<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> lot<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.230> stuff

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
pretty much it but it has a lot of stuff

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.490 
pretty much it but it has a lot of stuff
in<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.370> he<00:00:50.399> said<00:00:50.879> jay<00:00:51.329> afterthoughts<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.260> was

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
in it so he said jay afterthoughts I was

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.260 
in it so he said jay afterthoughts I was
fixing<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> bow<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> clock<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.789> comp<00:00:54.059> ass

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
fixing the bow and the clock in comp ass

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.360 
fixing the bow and the clock in comp ass
became<00:00:54.750> easy<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.140> add<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.829> neat<00:00:56.070> when<00:00:56.250> it

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
became easy to add it's neat when it

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.760 
became easy to add it's neat when it
happens<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.510> was<00:00:57.629> basically<00:00:57.780> fixing<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
happens so it was basically fixing the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.540 
happens so it was basically fixing the
bug<00:01:00.079> 47.6<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.230> believe<00:01:01.469> where<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.949> bow<00:01:02.340> looks

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
bug 47.6 I believe where the bow looks

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.369 
bug 47.6 I believe where the bow looks
like<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> crossbow<00:01:03.329> which<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.899> pretty<00:01:04.140> sick

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
like a crossbow which it's pretty sick

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.840 
like a crossbow which it's pretty sick
but<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.949> kind<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.220> annoying<00:01:05.400> at<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> same

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
but it's kind of annoying at the same

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.380 
but it's kind of annoying at the same
time<00:01:06.060> anyways<00:01:06.600> uh<00:01:07.460> he<00:01:08.460> said<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.330> don't

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
time anyways uh he said that I don't

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.230 
time anyways uh he said that I don't
know<00:01:09.570> what<00:01:10.080> coding<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.970> don't<00:01:11.970> know<00:01:12.030> how<00:01:12.150> it

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
know what coding I don't know how it

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.620 
know what coding I don't know how it
works<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:13.430> apparently<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.700> bad<00:01:15.119> there<00:01:15.450> uh

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
works but apparently that bad there uh

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.469 
works but apparently that bad there uh
yeah<00:01:16.200> rap<00:01:16.500> okay<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.100> apparently<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.210> was<00:01:18.299> easy

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
yeah rap okay so apparently it was easy

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.820 
yeah rap okay so apparently it was easy
to<00:01:18.570> add<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.020> clock<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.740> compass<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.490> I

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
to add the clock and compass and I

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.640 
to add the clock and compass and I
honestly<00:01:22.830> never<00:01:23.220> use<00:01:23.610> those<00:01:23.790> things<00:01:24.290> but<00:01:25.290> it's

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
honestly never use those things but it's

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.390 
honestly never use those things but it's
cool<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.520> they're<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> game<00:01:28.280> first<00:01:29.280> of

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
cool that they're in the game first of

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.950 
cool that they're in the game first of
all<00:01:29.460> clocks<00:01:29.790> are<00:01:29.970> only<00:01:30.090> useful<00:01:30.360> when<00:01:30.659> you're

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
all clocks are only useful when you're

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.819 
all clocks are only useful when you're
mining<00:01:31.380> town<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:32.270> underground<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:34.079> there's

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
mining town like underground but there's

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.620 
mining town like underground but there's
no<00:01:34.979> caves<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.549> they're<00:01:36.000> technically<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
no caves so they're technically a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.260 
no caves so they're technically a
useless<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:38.250> worlds<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:38.880> small<00:01:39.210> that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
useless and the worlds are so small that

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.380 
useless and the worlds are so small that
the<00:01:39.900> compass<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.619> not<00:01:41.520> useful<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:42.180> then<00:01:42.329> I

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the compass is not useful but then I

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.420 
the compass is not useful but then I
remembered<00:01:42.780> oh<00:01:42.899> yeah<00:01:43.110> infinite<00:01:43.799> world<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.250> I

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
remembered oh yeah infinite world so I

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.840 
remembered oh yeah infinite world so I
guess<00:01:44.909> it'll<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.210> useful<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.689> kompis<00:01:46.490> also<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
guess it'll be useful to kompis also a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.819 
guess it'll be useful to kompis also a
flint<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.390> steel<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.229> see<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.470> there<00:01:49.500> and

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
flint and steel you can see it there and

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.219 
flint and steel you can see it there and
