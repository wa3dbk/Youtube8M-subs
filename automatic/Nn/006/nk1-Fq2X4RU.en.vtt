00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 very good guys in this new video 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.609
 You are going to know a new box and you are going to 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.250
 know two new products of two 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.320
 very disparate batteries among them would be 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.670
 first of all the battery that more than 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.590
 more capacity that we have analyzed in the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.619
 channel that in this case is 28,000 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.380
 milliamps one pass 28,000 and then 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.300
 we have here another smaller one of 3600 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.130
 milliamperes in this case is not the most 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.869
 small that we have analyzed but good 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.660
 yes it would be one of the smallest that 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.660
 let's analyze so you know 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.399
 but we have two batteries of the brand 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.620
 aoc and you will already know it since we have 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.359
 analyzed different products of this 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.680
 mark and well you are seeing that the 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.149
 true that they are pretty good as 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.370
 we always make the links leave 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.920
 amazon of these two products then yes 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.420
 you want to keep an eye on them let's start 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.789
 watching this battery battery 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.589
 chiquitita that is the one of 3600 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.629
 milliamperios how good that this battery 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.699
 well, it would not be of great capacity 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.829
 and in my case for example that I have 13 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.020
 was it would give us for something more than a load 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.429
 no but it would give us a burden for all 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.619
 your devices and it was good at 

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:11.690
 so then it would be up to two charges 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.679
 It's worth depending on the capacity of 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.679
 your device 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.290
 and well here I will have a battery 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.820
 true that it is quite small is 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.010
 fine and good well it would be fine 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.810
 elongated and would not be addressed especially 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.980
 above all, it would be long 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.570
 I want to show you that here we have a 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.160
 of 10,000 milliamps in terms of 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.590
 thickness because it shows that this is 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.810
 practically triple and as soon as 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.790
 wide, it would also be like double 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.130
 so let 's leave it aside 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.420
 battery of 3 thousand 600 thousand amperes that 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.920
 well it's always good to have some 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.630
 of these chiquititas to have it then 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.850
 in the bag in case you are some 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.440
 web girl or the backpack if you are guys or 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.970
 have it at home because it never hurts 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.770
 he did not specifically tell us that you 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.180
 you buy this I do not just say so 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.369
 It's good to always have some 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.990
 battery for just the part 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.970
 central we have here the logo of although 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.440
 on the right edge we have nothing and in 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.270
 the left edge then we would have 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.070
 the usb connector on which we will connect 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.600
 the cable to charge our 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.850
 devices and then here we would have 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.340
 the micro usb where we will load this 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.470
 battery in the box also comes this 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.070
 cover to save our battery 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.780
 and not to lose it and not get damaged and good 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.730
 now we carry with this brutality of 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.489
 battery 28,000 thousand amperes is that more 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.110
 of 28,000 well let's open it here 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.740
 and good to tell you that this battery apart 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.600
 what is it 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.230
 amazing that I'm looking forward to opening it 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.580
 already because it has 28,000 milliamps 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.410
 would be compatible so good to load 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.970
 all devices not know how many 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.650
 usb ports have let's see it now 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.080
 but we could also load our 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.790
 portable so good to see the 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.250
 power that this battery can have and 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.810
 here we have it my mother here is 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.030
 let's take it out 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.709
 ah look good because it really is 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.239
 quite big but it's not that big 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.700
 I had thought that the box would be 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.970
 well up here not but the truth is 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.560
 that is not so great either, so it's 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.270
 It has a very considerable size as 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.040
 you are seeing and well we are the part 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.989
 left we will have two usb ports 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.430
 to connect here for example our 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.319
 smartphone or our player 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.900
 music our camera or whatever we want 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.730
 and then here we have two connectors worth 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.410
 that is good one will be then to receive 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.989
 the current and another one will be then for 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.790
 connect our laptop okay I'm not 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.920
 sure we will see it now there 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.350
 we would have like a kind of wheels 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.440
 that I will have depending on the level of 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.480
 load will be full as full 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.860
 partially worth it will not be appreciated 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.150
 but good and it puts 25 100% 75% it is not 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.970
 focusing but he puts it there 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.160
 around that little circle and how am I 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.620
 seeing then we do not have anything else it would not be 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.700
 a pretty smart battery 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.170
 logically we are not going to take this 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.930
 every day it would therefore be to 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.030
 travel and carry the backpack or for those 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.050
 cases let's see what else we have in the 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.240
 box 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.760
 and well here we had the connector for 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.380
 connect it to the current in which it 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.380
 we will give power to this battery 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.610
 there would be there we would have a guide of 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.250
 I use a microusb cable that would connect 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.870
 or logically in the usb and then this is 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.730
 what I wanted to see that would be 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.830
 adapters to connect our 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.570
 laptop is worth it so I do not know this either 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.010
 how very well as more as this one will go 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.660
 connected to one of the holes that 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.489
 we have seen the battery and then 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.489
 you have it would be the tip that 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.290
 match our laptop so 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.330
 well we have everything we are going to clear 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.270
 a little the table and let's try this 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.580
 piece of battery 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.979
 Well, guys, we've already taken all the 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.470
 box and all the papers and we have here 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.330
 our battery of 28,000 amps 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.039
 First, as mentioned before 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.289
 in the two ports of which one goes 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.389
 to be at 1 amp and another to be at 2.1 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.639
 amps this would be the port of entry 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.560
 It's worth to charge our battery with 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.569
 this charger and this would be the port of 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.400
 exit to charge our laptop 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.409
 now let's do is load 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.569
 devices so you can see what can 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.590
 load several at a time without problem and 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.569
 well then to charge the battery 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.819
 we simply connect that the current 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.009
 and we connect you in this port of 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:05.009
 here it's going to reconnect first 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:07.020
 a usb are going to connect 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:11.159
 here a phone we are going to take this from 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.330
 here that here the blade s6 and as 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.190
 You see, it does not start charging and this is 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.930
 because the battery is off for 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.139
 turn it on we just give it double 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.139
 click 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.550
 and that's how the phone would start 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.960
 load and get well there is I think 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.330
 that you can see that it starts to load 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.910
 let's connect the laptop well just 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.380
 connect another phone so that ja uy 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.690
 what scare are we going to connect to another 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.450
 phone to put you in a bit of trouble 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.720
 to this battery we're going to heat it up 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.720
 here 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.460
 here would be the second phone as 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.550
 you see here I would be also loading if 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.350
 focus 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.730
 well I think that it looks like you see 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.070
 the wheel is spinning that is 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.840
 loading up here we would have the second 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.790
 loaded device and now we're going to 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.620
 to do is connect the laptop for it 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.750
 let's connect one of the ports 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.639
 well let's connect this cable in the 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.590
 exit port that is east of here 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:10.249
 and at the end we should take the 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:12.199
 adapter corresponding to our a 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:15.889
 our laptop in my case would be this 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:18.490
 from here and that we place it now pick up 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.490
 the laptop 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.389
 we already have here our laptop what 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.740
 we do not have a lot of space so 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.900
 I'm going to leave here in a little way 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.820
 bitch and just the ones to connect 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.470
 would like to upload will not go up the 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.419
 divided led that has it has it 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.340
 spoiled but he has already tried it and 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.720
 yes that would start loading up here is it 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.400
 I should do the LED but as it is 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.660
 spoiled because it did not prove it also with 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.130
 another laptop with him with the most 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.260
 big but good is a bit of a mess 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.949
 move everything and how it would be loading the 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.570
 three devices at once this battery 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:50.210
 no doubt this battery is an authentic 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.010
 logically passed with segmented us 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.840
 for day to day but for example 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.460
 you can have it for example in a 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.190
 office for as an emergency measure 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.200
 in case the light goes out or take it to a 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.180
 camping then in those cases and that would be 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.889
 pretty good to have this battery in the 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.960
 case from day to day, well, well, this is 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.880
 battery of 3 thousand 600 thousand amperes not me 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.770
 It seems that it was great the truth that 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.330
 It is quite light, quite comfortable, so 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.919
 that two good alternatives that as I have 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.020
 said before I leave the links below 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:17.240
