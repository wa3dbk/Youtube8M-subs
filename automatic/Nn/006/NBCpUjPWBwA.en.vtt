00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:20.070
 hello tankers this is marathon tr 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:23.340
 and today we will play for Germany in 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.910
 the t-34 game against the tiger and the first mission 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.009
 us patrol combat mission pursue 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.480
 on the way south 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.669
 shades in the area of ​​the destroyed bridge 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.420
 destroy any detected forces 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.420
 adversary 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.010
 mission objectives to take a position at the river 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.330
 destroy the enemy forces observed mission 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:49.340
 not so complicated 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:54.780
 here we have two tanks no 233 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:01:00.270
 t-34 and in my four or maybe even 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:06.930
 more zis guns our tiger will need them 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:10.500
 all destroy now I'll show you 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.740
 inside the tank how it all works 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.740
 you 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.620
 you turn the barrel to the right to the left up 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.620
 down here is what a massive weapon he has 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.400
 playing for tigor is very interesting 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.870
 it feels powerful in this game 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.140
 it really feels the power of the tiger 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.560
 so we went here with him already 8 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.560
 speeds 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.590
 and he develops 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.590
 pretty decent speed 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.860
 from 35 to 40 and 37 38 how it fluctuates 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.610
 speed without turning the accident 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.610
 I turn 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.590
 I have an ally here, too, but a tiger 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:15.010
 for some reason he drives slow 4 speed 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.010
 Only then should he fit 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.000
 battle and will help at all if you 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.610
 first play the mission better wait 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.540
 play it together the family already know 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.540
 what is dakar here 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:38.920
 here right after this hillock here 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.690
 there will be guns enemy tanks and therefore 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.000
 we will need a neat vessel 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.110
 get close 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.110
 otherwise we just get killed 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.660
 have time and even 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.660
 and shoot 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.250
 neatly now let's see where they have 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.250
 Pushkin fans usually high-explosive projectile 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.250
 we charge 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:15.100
 here are the tides we see authentic 88 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:18.590
 centimeters 88 mm gun or a 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.890
 here actually guns need 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:26.210
 destroy but not necessarily at 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.670
 Valea least if the first 3 lyayutsya 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.160
 need to destroy people who 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:39.920
 worth downloads here we are visually now 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:42.260
 saw yes how or give here if we 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.960
 all done that malaria destroy 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:56.330
 and oh, how you got dads I years to keep 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:04:01.160
 miner that destroyed or arias so here 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:03.740
 and everything okay 4 lal guns destroyed i don't 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:08.300
 I remember if here still 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:10.990
 Well, no, I do not see them on the channel 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.990
 destroy 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:24.390
 or they missed. 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.790
 here you can customize imagine 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.480
 usually with standard yes but sometimes 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.420
 tune 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:38.300
 we have three on the go shoot queues you can 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:39.050
 but easier even at 34 than the native view 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.420
 in the photo 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.420
 the tiger takes longer to charge 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.860
 where is he slower 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:55.720
 and the dynamic longer his gun 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:59.800
 very powerful and long-range 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:07.750
 really does not aim as we tanks 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:11.110
 there will now be on the caterpillar 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.050
 we laid siege to the first tank right now or 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:19.389
 Ares sighting 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:21.460
 take here our tank already drove the enemies 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.789
 will flock to it 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:29.220
 damn read without getting necessary somehow more precisely 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:29.220
 aim or 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:37.960
 daddy your luminary so nehilo and 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:42.939
 easy so i can tower too 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:46.400
 butterflies damn that's just gorgeous 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:48.680
 forms immediately towers demolished and this one already 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:55.520
 forehead turned usually towers demolished 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:57.860
 when we shoot by rank or ares 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:07.000
 getting into the gun mask in the forehead is just 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:11.360
 can tank or be damaged and leave 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.240
 or 1 and so if here you can see visually that 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:19.410
 the gun grimaced at the tank means everything 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:23.759
 so you look like another one there is another 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:26.490
 a tank or a gun 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:31.289
 case charge problems because if 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:38.610
 something they are there who needed it quickly and 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:41.370
 destroy the narrow heap and beat and more 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.319
 curve than tanks so completed 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.360
 mission look at the object and to which 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:52.669
 destroyed 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:52.669
 here they are the guns zis are dead and the soldiers 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:07:01.740
 here are the tanks here whose towers flew off 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:03.930
 burning at all cool I'm just like 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:08.280

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:12.500
 and this is ours on 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:16.850
