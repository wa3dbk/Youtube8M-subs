00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.289
 these images that we are seeing now 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:09.870
 they are from the very same gameplay of forza 

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:12.209
 motorsport 5 a lot is talking about 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.490
 this game the truth is that it is not for 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.440
 unless you know what the title is 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.930
 we say here again and again is the title 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.150
 that really shows that xbox one is 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.340
 able to show us full hd in 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.620
 resolution and show above all a 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.890
 Great frame rate pretty 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.720
 stable and also high in this case 60 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.120
 frames per second at all times something 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.580
 that makes us see still 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.500
 a lot more speed in a title of 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.360
 speed how is this so attentive 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.280
 because this time we see these two 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.000
 new videos of that gameplay 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.739
 forza motorsport 5 the racing title 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.829
 par excellence for the launch of 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.510
 xbox one two videos distributed from 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.640
 official way by microsoft 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.410
 very important is to repeat that all 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.600
 these sequences are extracted 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.700
 directly from the gameplay of the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.240
 title of the playable part and we 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.220
 allow then 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.620
 a little bit how to do that section 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.330
 technical title and make us an idea 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.460
 of how it will look when we are 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.780
 playing and attentive because what we are 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.030
 watching is a youtube video 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.710
 obviously you can not appreciate the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.450
 complete title quality for it 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.310
 you have to accept it be a fair of 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.050
 videogames somewhere where you are 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.410
 really running this title in a 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.550
 xbox one that can assure us that it is 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.040
 awesome that is drool when 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.440
 You see, I really tell you the title 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.950
 It arrives the same day it goes on sale 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.320
 Xbox One next November 22 and 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.420
 there are a lot of nerves already approved 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.000
 its final version and the truth is that the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.369
 first impressions of the media 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.250
 specialized are pretty good already 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.869
 we will see how this title coalesces with the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.869
 launch of xbox one
