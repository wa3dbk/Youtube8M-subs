00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
tulip poplar wood and what I've done is

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.960 
tulip poplar wood and what I've done is
I<00:00:27.599> cut<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.050> sections<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:29.429> size<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.939> I

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
I cut it in sections the size that I

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.740 
I cut it in sections the size that I
need<00:00:30.170> now<00:00:31.170> at<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:32.009> Lancaster's<00:00:32.610> show<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:33.480> had

National Association that made canes for
veterans<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.559> they<00:00:40.739> told<00:00:41.070> me<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.300> one

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
veterans and they told me that the one

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.850 
veterans and they told me that the one
guy<00:00:42.660> there<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:42.989> don't<00:00:43.140> know<00:00:43.350> they<00:00:43.500> all<00:00:43.530> do<00:00:43.829> it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
guy there I don't know they all do it

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.470 
guy there I don't know they all do it
the<00:00:44.219> one<00:00:44.399> guy<00:00:44.550> there<00:00:44.730> told<00:00:44.969> me<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.270> he

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the one guy there told me that he

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.200 
the one guy there told me that he
actually<00:00:45.780> glues<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.860> ends<00:00:47.340> with<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.940> glue

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
actually glues the ends with just glue

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.799 
actually glues the ends with just glue
to<00:00:48.809> seal<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.739> because<00:00:50.100> what<00:00:50.280> happens<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.910> when

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
to seal it because what happens is when

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.720 
to seal it because what happens is when
this<00:00:52.050> thing<00:00:52.350> drives<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:52.890> drying<00:00:53.190> from<00:00:53.489> this

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
this thing drives it's drying from this

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.110 
this thing drives it's drying from this
side<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.270> as<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.110> dries<00:00:55.440> first<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.340> starts

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
side and as this dries first it starts

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.540 
side and as this dries first it starts
to<00:00:57.239> crack<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.590> was<00:00:58.710> my<00:00:58.890> concern<00:00:59.100> with

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
to crack it so that was my concern with

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.549 
to crack it so that was my concern with
carving<00:00:59.969> anything<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.989> including

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
carving anything in this and including

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.590 
carving anything in this and including
the<00:01:01.680> small<00:01:02.010> little<00:01:02.370> branches<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.300> I

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
the small little branches that I have I

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.170 
the small little branches that I have I
thought<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.170> had<00:01:04.409> one<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:04.790> how<00:01:05.790> do<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.939> keep

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
thought I had one here how do you keep

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.450 
thought I had one here how do you keep
it<00:01:06.360> from<00:01:06.510> checking<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.439> know<00:01:07.590> how<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.340> you

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
it from checking you know how do you

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.420 
it from checking you know how do you
keep<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.909> stuff<00:01:09.270> from<00:01:09.720> from<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.100> green

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
keep this stuff from from if it's green

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.630 
keep this stuff from from if it's green
and<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.240> check<00:01:12.570> now<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> dry<00:01:14.280> piece

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
and to check now if you have a dry piece

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.690 
and to check now if you have a dry piece
versus<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.860> fresh-cut<00:01:16.860> piece<00:01:17.100> there<00:01:17.340> are<00:01:17.490> much

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
versus a fresh-cut piece there are much

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.760 
versus a fresh-cut piece there are much
heavier<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.869> what<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> did<00:01:19.320> was<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.560> got<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
heavier so what I did was I got a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.710 
heavier so what I did was I got a
digital<00:01:20.250> scale<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.820> weighed<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
digital scale and I weighed this and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.200 
digital scale and I weighed this and
this<00:01:21.810> was<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:23.070> piece<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.460> worked<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.880> was<00:01:24.030> about

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
this was the piece I worked on was about

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.469 
this was the piece I worked on was about
a<00:01:24.240> hundred<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.720> twenty<00:01:25.040> grams<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.479> weight

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
a hundred and twenty grams of weight

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.859 
a hundred and twenty grams of weight
okay<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.070> one<00:01:29.250> piece<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.939> as<00:01:30.659> I

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
okay just the one piece and as I

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.440 
okay just the one piece and as I
microwaved<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.130> did<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.369> procedure<00:01:33.180> that

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
microwaved it and did the procedure that

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.300 
microwaved it and did the procedure that
I'm<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.750> tell<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.650> went<00:01:34.920> down<00:01:35.130> to

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
I'm going to tell you it went down to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.569 
I'm going to tell you it went down to
about<00:01:35.520> 87<00:01:36.360> down<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.020> 83<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:38.070> think<00:01:38.460> I'm

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
about 87 down to 83 and I think I'm

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.340 
about 87 down to 83 and I think I'm
pretty<00:01:38.729> safe<00:01:39.090> with<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.630> leaving<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.110> that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
pretty safe with just leaving it that

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.090 
pretty safe with just leaving it that
way<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.130> now<00:01:42.259> because<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.380> think<00:01:43.619> most<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
way for now because I think most of the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.139 
way for now because I think most of the
water<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:47.100> know<00:01:47.250> as<00:01:47.520> as

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
water is out of it and you know as as

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.620 
water is out of it and you know as as
time<00:01:48.899> goes<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.799> cure<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.310> its<00:01:50.520> own<00:01:50.729> but

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
time goes on it can cure on its own but

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.370 
time goes on it can cure on its own but
what<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> did<00:01:52.920> was<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.460> cut<00:01:53.939> these<00:01:54.210> sections<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
what I did was I cut these sections the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.920 
what I did was I cut these sections the
length<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.799> need<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.399> put<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.719> plastic

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
length that I need I put it in a plastic

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
I'm carving after that I took it back to

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.780 
I'm carving after that I took it back to
the<00:03:24.000> bag<00:03:24.180> put<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.170> back<00:03:25.560> in<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:25.890> microwave<00:03:26.040> and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.880 
the bag put it back in the microwave and
but<00:03:27.630> now<00:03:27.900> when<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.350> put<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.770> microwave

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
but now when I put it in the microwave

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.630 
but now when I put it in the microwave
from<00:03:29.640> here<00:03:29.940> on<00:03:30.060> out<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.420> put<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.959> on<00:03:31.160> defrost<00:03:32.160> for

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
from here on out I put it on defrost for

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.850 
from here on out I put it on defrost for
about<00:03:33.650> 35<00:03:34.650> 30<00:03:35.370> 30<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.450> 35<00:03:36.900> seconds<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.530> larger

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
about 35 30 30 to 35 seconds the larger

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.270 
about 35 30 30 to 35 seconds the larger
pieces<00:03:38.070> you<00:03:38.370> can<00:03:38.489> do<00:03:38.640> 35<00:03:39.560> smaller<00:03:40.560> pieces<00:03:40.890> such

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
pieces you can do 35 smaller pieces such

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.430 
pieces you can do 35 smaller pieces such
as<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.640> small<00:03:42.030> one<00:03:42.300> like<00:03:42.330> this<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.959> would<00:03:43.110> only<00:03:43.230> do

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
as a small one like this I would only do

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.540 
as a small one like this I would only do
like<00:03:43.620> 20<00:03:44.489> 20<00:03:45.270> maybe<00:03:45.630> 15<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.620> 20<00:03:47.010> seconds

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
like 20 20 maybe 15 to 20 seconds

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.150 
like 20 20 maybe 15 to 20 seconds
because<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:48.420> glue<00:03:48.720> will<00:03:48.959> start<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.410> char<00:03:49.800> at

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
because the glue will start to char at

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.990 
because the glue will start to char at
the<00:03:50.340> top<00:03:50.610> if<00:03:50.910> you're<00:03:51.030> not<00:03:51.209> careful<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:53.000> with

or<00:04:05.760> four<00:04:05.940> times<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.420> would<00:04:06.870> read<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:08.070> ends

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
or four times I would read you the ends

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.820 
or four times I would read you the ends
again<00:04:08.850> so<00:04:09.300> I<00:04:09.330> do<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.050> reak<00:04:10.230> looing<00:04:10.590> about

again so I do the reak looing about
three<00:04:11.130> times<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:11.760> put<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.269> microwave<00:04:12.390> on

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
three times I put it in the microwave on

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.289 
three times I put it in the microwave on
defrost<00:04:14.040> anywhere<00:04:14.700> from

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
defrost anywhere from

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.659 
defrost anywhere from
three<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.900> eight<00:04:17.019> times<00:04:17.370> depending<00:04:18.370> on<00:04:18.489> the

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
three to eight times depending on the

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.629 
three to eight times depending on the
piece<00:04:19.319> like<00:04:20.319> I<00:04:20.500> said<00:04:20.769> and<00:04:21.039> every<00:04:21.370> time<00:04:21.519> you<00:04:21.609> put

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
piece like I said and every time you put

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.129 
piece like I said and every time you put
it<00:04:21.909> in<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.180> put<00:04:22.360> it<00:04:22.449> back<00:04:22.569> on<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.870> scale

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
it in you put it back on the scale

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.689 
it in you put it back on the scale
you'll<00:04:23.349> notice<00:04:23.680> it<00:04:23.830> starts<00:04:24.099> losing<00:04:24.280> weight

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
you'll notice it starts losing weight

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.580 
you'll notice it starts losing weight
because<00:04:25.240> with<00:04:25.539> the<00:04:25.659> microwave<00:04:25.990> it's<00:04:26.289> heating

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
because with the microwave it's heating

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.070 
because with the microwave it's heating
from<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:26.889> inside<00:04:27.280> out<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:28.240> it<00:04:28.569> when<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:28.840> feel

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
still cool to touch you can tell that

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.010 
still cool to touch you can tell that
there's<00:04:33.909> water<00:04:34.240> in<00:04:34.599> it

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
there's water in it

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.499

this<00:05:00.250> guy<00:05:00.460> up<00:05:00.669> first<00:05:01.000> but<00:05:01.240> I<00:05:01.300> wanted<00:05:01.659> to<00:05:01.719> dry<00:05:02.080> it

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
this guy up first but I wanted to dry it

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.040 
this guy up first but I wanted to dry it
out<00:05:02.379> a<00:05:02.620> bit<00:05:03.400> more<00:05:03.759> before<00:05:04.030> I<00:05:04.300> started<00:05:04.780> carving

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
out a bit more before I started carving

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.589 
out a bit more before I started carving
it<00:05:05.319> because<00:05:05.590> I<00:05:05.680> didn't<00:05:05.919> want<00:05:06.099> splits<00:05:06.550> all<00:05:07.240> over

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:07.599 
it because I didn't want splits all over

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.809 
it because I didn't want splits all over
the<00:05:07.719> place<00:05:07.930> so<00:05:08.229> that's<00:05:08.710> the<00:05:08.860> way<00:05:09.039> I'm<00:05:09.190> doing<00:05:09.639> it

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
the place so that's the way I'm doing it

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:11.820 
the place so that's the way I'm doing it
I<00:05:10.000> don't<00:05:10.509> know<00:05:10.690> what<00:05:10.900> they<00:05:11.050> look<00:05:11.259> like<00:05:11.289> a<00:05:11.500> year

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
I don't know what they look like a year

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.510 
I don't know what they look like a year
from<00:05:11.889> now<00:05:12.270> I<00:05:13.270> think<00:05:13.479> they'll<00:05:13.930> be<00:05:14.080> fine<00:05:14.520> from

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
from now I think they'll be fine from

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.839 
from now I think they'll be fine from
what<00:05:16.150> I<00:05:16.180> gather<00:05:16.509> but<00:05:16.810> keep<00:05:17.560> reglue<00:05:18.009> in<00:05:18.219> it<00:05:18.370> get

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
what I gather but keep reglue in it get

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.519 
what I gather but keep reglue in it get
on<00:05:19.030> the<00:05:19.210> ends<00:05:19.599> it<00:05:19.750> doesn't<00:05:20.169> hurt<00:05:20.259> to<00:05:20.319> put

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:20.529 
on the ends it doesn't hurt to put

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:23.939 
on the ends it doesn't hurt to put
another<00:05:20.830> layer<00:05:21.039> of<00:05:21.310> glue<00:05:21.639> after<00:05:22.300> you<00:05:22.770> seal<00:05:23.770> it

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
another layer of glue after you seal it

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.580 
another layer of glue after you seal it
because<00:05:24.310> when<00:05:24.520> you<00:05:24.639> seal<00:05:24.969> it<00:05:25.229> you<00:05:26.229> put<00:05:26.469> it<00:05:26.529> in

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
because when you seal it you put it in

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.300 
because when you seal it you put it in
the<00:05:26.740> microwave

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
the microwave

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.640 
the microwave
you'll<00:05:27.909> see<00:05:28.150> little<00:05:28.360> beads<00:05:28.810> once<00:05:29.199> in<00:05:29.349> a<00:05:29.440> while

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
you'll see little beads once in a while

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.459 
you'll see little beads once in a while
coming<00:05:30.099> out<00:05:30.960> you<00:05:31.960> know<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:32.199> it's<00:05:32.380> still

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 
coming out you know and it's still

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.990 
coming out you know and it's still
drying<00:05:32.979> from<00:05:33.909> there's<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.479> water<00:05:34.779> inside<00:05:35.380> and

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
drying from there's the water inside and

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.089 
drying from there's the water inside and
you're<00:05:37.000> cooking<00:05:37.300> it<00:05:37.719> you're<00:05:37.990> heating<00:05:38.229> it<00:05:38.469> to

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
you're cooking it you're heating it to

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.980 
you're cooking it you're heating it to
dry<00:05:39.370> it<00:05:39.430> out<00:05:39.669> so<00:05:40.590> that's<00:05:41.590> my<00:05:41.949> tip<00:05:42.009> for<00:05:42.460> the<00:05:42.550> day
