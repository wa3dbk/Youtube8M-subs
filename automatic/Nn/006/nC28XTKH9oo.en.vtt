00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.340
 Hello, my name is Alexander 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:10.759
 today I want to show you what is myself 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.269
 represents tackle 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:18.439
 called killer carp sounds 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.140
 loud but really 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.480
 this gear is gorgeous she deserves 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.670
 this name is very catchy 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.670
 for making we need 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:38.960
 fishing line 03 RF thickness 0 35 50 centimeters 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:49.969
 for leads I use thread break 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.969
 somewhere kilo 1820 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.760
 snap hook 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.479
 2 3 there are no such feeders 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.850
 the difference is 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.850
 cylindrical or oval 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.180
 with an ax bead that's this size or 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.970
 slightly less 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:31.259
 also does not matter well and hook it 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:31.259
 me hooks shesterochka yes and weights 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.610
 mean to save time and not 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.610
 terrorize you for a very long time 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:47.540
 making all the gear because it's 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:56.570
 laborious process and very laboriously 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:02:00.510
 I'll show you now I'll show you now 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.890
 ready gear and try quickly 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.890
 tell what it is 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.670
 this is already ready tackle means 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.900
 here 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.470
 snap hook this is already 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.239
 to fasten to the main gear 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.620
 to the main fishing line which is wound on 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:38.439
 spinning reel 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:41.019
 further goes here is 50 centimeters of this cutting 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:46.090
 on which all installation with 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:49.450
 Nastya and ends with a load of cargo 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.370
 already an amateur may be harder 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:58.500
 to be easier at certain intervals 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:02.590
 i did feed the bumps dress up 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.700
 consistently 1 feeding trough 2 stopper 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:11.530
 rings 22 100 a couple with one of the other 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:15.790
 you see the sides, then the second 2 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:19.420
 manger with two axes and 3 manger 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:24.639
 can be 2 trough can be at all one 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.870
 feeder to do but in my opinion the 3 most 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.750
 best option 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:34.090
 when we here it is all produced 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:39.099
 secured tying leashes 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.099
 I took the leashes from the thread 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:49.480
 tied a hook and cut off the entire leash 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:53.620
 it's 5 centimeters long is no longer necessary 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:57.120
 Well, in short, too, is not desirable every 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.930
 leash corresponds to one trough 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.829
 here 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.520
 that's what this one represents 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:09.300
 tackle assembly 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.300
 you are welcome 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.550
 I'll show you again 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.860
 here 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.960
 everything 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.960
 good fishing to you
