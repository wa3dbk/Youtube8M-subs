00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.600
 the coach of the Honduran national team 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.730
 the tico hernán medford offered a 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.259
 peculiar press conference after 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.599
 of practicing your team in the 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.060
 Victor Manuel Reyna Stadium 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.250
 first criticized miguel herrera and 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.200
 he referred to him as lacking in education 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.970
 although he later clarified that if the 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.160
 louse statements had been 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.919
 taken out of context in the press 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.140
 Honduran I offered apologies I think 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:33.500
 that the closure with respect to the selection 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.109
 Honduran but as we are one 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.480
 different we did teach us to the 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:40.789
 education house and they taught us that there 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.100
 to respect and we do respect 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.179
 mexico this is the problem and when 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.980
 sent this message is when the 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.379
 players come in and angry and we do not 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.260
 we are going to kick because sometimes he insinuates 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.179
 that Central America only kicks and that's not 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.890
 is right I think that we want 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.249
 respect for elections be who 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.010
 either because it's ugly that's ugly that he 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.569
 leave saying nobody is going to see this 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.350
 match and is playing with a selection 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:08.480
 mundialista we have played a game and I 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.600
 he already wins one 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.600
 so if there I'm winning a 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:21.240
 10 let's get something out there that's not 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.860
 it's just difficult to remove what's happening 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.110
 when it is sometimes spoken that Mexico does not 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.509
 is the big giant is at the moment 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.610
 last qualifying was not legal 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.840
 finish qualifying and today mexico continues 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.939
 being the giant after the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.180
 eliminator then because of a 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.850
 edition and if I went if he did not say that I 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.310
 I publicly apologize to the louse 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.530
 because I'm going to what he did then 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.759
 if I have to ask for an apology if yes 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.450
 he does not say it I think that one has to 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.729
 be old man 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.710
 Medford clarified that the call for 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.270
 this match is very different from the one 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.360
 used for the Central American Cup 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.130
 where they were painfully fifth place already 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.289
 that looks like the competition played 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.179
 practically with a majority of 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.450
 elements of the local league unlike 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:10.060
 of this occasion when it has several 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.890
 of his legionaries in the city of 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.900

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.220
