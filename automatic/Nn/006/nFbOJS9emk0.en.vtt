silence<00:03:19.910> completely<00:03:20.480> silent<00:03:20.900> for<00:03:21.050> the<00:03:21.110> things

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
silence completely silent for the things

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.110 
silence completely silent for the things
that<00:03:21.470> had<00:03:21.740> been<00:03:21.920> in<00:03:22.010> every<00:03:22.220> other<00:03:22.340> game<00:03:22.640> like

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
that had been in every other game like

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.270 
that had been in every other game like
equipment<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.840> now<00:03:24.050> sliding<00:03:24.500> amplify

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
equipment and now sliding amplify

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.460

a blog post on changes to snipers but of
course<00:03:46.370> we<00:03:46.550> didn't<00:03:46.850> do<00:03:46.970> any<00:03:47.150> of<00:03:47.420> them<00:03:47.630> we<00:03:48.080> were

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
course we didn't do any of them we were

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.020 
course we didn't do any of them we were
too<00:03:48.470> afraid<00:03:48.620> of<00:03:48.980> getting<00:03:49.250> death<00:03:49.460> threats<00:03:49.490> just

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
too afraid of getting death threats just

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.610 
too afraid of getting death threats just
like<00:03:50.180> david<00:03:50.480> vonderhaar<00:03:50.690> when<00:03:51.170> he<00:03:51.260> nerf<00:03:51.440> the

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
like david vonderhaar when he nerf the

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.010 
like david vonderhaar when he nerf the
dsr<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.610> only<00:03:52.820> thing<00:03:52.970> we<00:03:53.060> actually<00:03:53.660> did<00:03:53.870> to

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
dsr the only thing we actually did to

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.900 
dsr the only thing we actually did to
the<00:03:54.140> snipers<00:03:54.620> was<00:03:54.770> adjust<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:55.250> reload<00:03:55.670> time

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
the snipers was adjust the reload time

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.910 
the snipers was adjust the reload time
which<00:03:56.330> is<00:03:56.360> nothing<00:03:56.960> to<00:03:57.110> do<00:03:57.260> with<00:03:57.410> combating

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
which is nothing to do with combating

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.410 
which is nothing to do with combating
any<00:03:58.100> quickscoping<00:03:58.790> even<00:03:59.030> though<00:03:59.120> we<00:03:59.240> said

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
any quickscoping even though we said

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.000 
any quickscoping even though we said
there<00:03:59.570> wasn't<00:03:59.810> gonna<00:03:59.960> be<00:04:00.080> in<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.410> game<00:04:00.620> we

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
there wasn't gonna be in the game we

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.440 
there wasn't gonna be in the game we
didn't<00:04:01.250> actually<00:04:01.370> change<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.850> game<00:04:02.090> engine

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
didn't actually change the game engine

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.840 
didn't actually change the game engine
so<00:04:02.630> therefore<00:04:03.050> quick<00:04:03.320> scoping<00:04:03.740> is<00:04:03.950> still<00:04:04.550> in

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
so therefore quick scoping is still in

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.390
