00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.769
 the optional automated transmission to 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.590
 This g meets the comfort of a car 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.730
 automatic and the sportsmanship of 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.740
 manuals 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.180
 with it you can choose the best 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.210
 between two worlds 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.550
 the gears automatically switched or 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.039
 manually which provides 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.859
 even more sporty driving 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.230
 engine starting only occurs with the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.800
 the brake lever and the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.660
 exchange in position n neutral when the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.610
 starting motor is started 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.430
 this action is supported by a device 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.399
 power-assisted start-up 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.730
 of the vehicle giving safety to the user 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.670
 In these operations, this system 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.980
 novelty of comfort to the user the engine 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.680
 start-up is triggered after the driver 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.350
 only turn the key to the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.890
 without the need to hold the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.799
 in this position until the engine starts to 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.360
 the first gear is engaged 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.700
 automatically by placing the vehicle in 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.909
 movement of a soft touch to the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.030
 on the selector lever 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.970
 the position just after releasing the brake 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.790
 and step on the accelerator to gain 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.470
 speed for selecting gear selections. 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.720
 manual driving program 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.140
 just give another laptop to the left 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.329
 triggering the position on the exchange is very 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.329
 simple with touches forward in the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.909
 gear shift lever advances and 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.020
 with fox behind the gears are 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.390
 reduced 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.040
 even when the car is moving it is 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.549
 you can switch 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.590
 driving between automatic and manual is only 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.340
 move the lever gently to the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.530
 left where are the positions of owen 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.509
 in the case of the model equipped with 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.869
 Drive optional type exchange 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.990
 butterflies on the steering wheel with soft 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.340
 screen taps more marches and advances 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.290
 key - they are reduced 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.080
 unlike traditional automatic to 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.069
 transmission to sg allows you to 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.400
 car engine with the fifth and nato 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.409
 releasing the key withdrawal however 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.909
 if the gearshift lever is still in 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.370
 one of these positions 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.829
 the car does not turn back on a 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.930
 message on the panel will inform you that 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.989
 I need to put it in yen to give 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.060
 start at stop or park 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.609
 it is important to always keep your foot on the brake 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.780
 drive or brake the brake 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.760
 parking 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.010
 this applies to local plans or 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.569
 sloping 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.680
 in such cases never place the lever 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.019
 yen 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.750
 I use the accelerator to hold the car 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.060
 because this can overheat the 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.639
 clutch and reduce the service life of 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.549
 components of the transmission function 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:57.829
 in automatic mode for 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.019
 improve car performance 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.199
 to activate it just press the key 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.019
 s with this sports mode 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:08.419
 exchanges are made in a more 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.290
 high power consumption 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.569
 motor 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.659
 despite appreciably increasing the 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.969
 fuel consumption to preserve the 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:20.750
 durability of the system prevents the 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:23.359
 speed limit is exceeded if the 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.189
 try to reduce abruptly or to engage 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.680
 a higher gear at a faster 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:30.849
 not compatible with the system 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.849
 allow itself
