front raise your work in the front head
of<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.570> deltoid<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.230> shoulder<00:00:19.590> muscle<00:00:19.920> if

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
of the deltoid the shoulder muscle if

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.710 
of the deltoid the shoulder muscle if
you're<00:00:20.490> weak<00:00:20.670> here<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.090> area<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.510> maybe

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
you're weak here in this area and maybe

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.200 
you're weak here in this area and maybe
start<00:00:22.080> with<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.470> exercise<00:00:22.890> first<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:24.119> outer

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
start with this exercise first the outer

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.689 
start with this exercise first the outer
delts<00:00:24.689> are<00:00:24.810> worked<00:00:25.170> with<00:00:25.740> outer<00:00:25.980> side<00:00:26.400> raises

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
delts are worked with outer side raises

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.120 
delts are worked with outer side raises
this<00:00:27.510> will<00:00:27.689> give<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> wick<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.470> I'll<00:00:28.920> put

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
this will give you a wick and I'll put

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.160 
this will give you a wick and I'll put
caps<00:00:29.400> onto<00:00:30.000> your<00:00:30.119> shoulders<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.869> will<00:00:31.019> give

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
caps onto your shoulders that will give

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.590 
caps onto your shoulders that will give
you<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.380> illusion<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.219> smaller<00:00:32.489> waist<00:00:32.820> then

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
you the illusion of a smaller waist then

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.750 
you the illusion of a smaller waist then
finally<00:00:34.230> you've<00:00:34.620> got<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.890> rear<00:00:35.100> head<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
finally you've got the rear head of the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.240 
finally you've got the rear head of the
deltoid<00:00:36.120> muscle<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> hard<00:00:37.680> muscle<00:00:38.129> to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
deltoid muscle this is a hard muscle to

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.860 
deltoid muscle this is a hard muscle to
really<00:00:38.579> isolate<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.149> make<00:00:39.360> sure<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.690> go<00:00:39.840> a

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
really isolate so make sure you go a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.290 
really isolate so make sure you go a
little<00:00:40.290> bit<00:00:40.410> lighter<00:00:40.649> keep<00:00:41.129> strict<00:00:41.520> form<00:00:41.790> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
little bit lighter keep strict form and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.330 
little bit lighter keep strict form and
get<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.660> mind-muscle<00:00:43.170> connection<00:00:43.340> now

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
get that mind-muscle connection now

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.610 
get that mind-muscle connection now
these<00:00:44.489> are<00:00:44.670> isolation<00:00:45.270> exercises<00:00:45.780> so

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
these are isolation exercises so

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.440 
these are isolation exercises so
isolation<00:00:47.309> means<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.210> working

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
isolation means that it's just working

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.119 
isolation means that it's just working
with<00:00:48.719> one<00:00:48.899> particular<00:00:49.200> muscle<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.010> you're

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
with one particular muscle that you're

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.250 
with one particular muscle that you're
trying<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> focus<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.210> compound<00:00:51.840> movement

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
trying to focus on a compound movement

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.779 
trying to focus on a compound movement
is<00:00:52.410> going<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> bring<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.010> several<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.640> those

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
is going to bring in several of those

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.970 
is going to bring in several of those
muscles<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.690> compound<00:00:55.260> movements<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
muscles so compound movements of the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.229 
muscles so compound movements of the
shoulder<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> be<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
shoulder is going to be like the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.880 
shoulder is going to be like the
shoulder<00:00:57.660> press<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.500> you're<00:00:58.649> doing<00:00:58.770> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
shoulder press so if you're doing a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.830 
shoulder press so if you're doing a
straight<00:00:59.219> up<00:00:59.399> press<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:00.750> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
straight up press this is going to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.810 
straight up press this is going to
incorporate<00:01:01.170> predominantly<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> front<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
incorporate predominantly the front and

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.479 
incorporate predominantly the front and
outer<00:01:03.059> head<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.989> deltoid<00:01:04.409> muscle<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.369> it's

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
outer head of the deltoid muscle so it's

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.920 
outer head of the deltoid muscle so it's
gonna<00:01:05.640> work<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.970> front<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.840> to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
gonna work the front and it's going to

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.899 
gonna work the front and it's going to
work<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> side<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> shoulder<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.220> well<00:01:08.400> so

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
work the side of the shoulder as well so

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.789 
work the side of the shoulder as well so
now<00:01:09.030> we're<00:01:09.210> moving<00:01:09.360> onto<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.049> triceps<00:01:10.560> which

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
now we're moving onto the triceps which

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.859 
now we're moving onto the triceps which
is<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> back<00:01:11.070> your<00:01:11.520> arms<00:01:11.880> you've<00:01:12.390> got<00:01:12.570> three

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
is the back your arms you've got three

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.280 
is the back your arms you've got three
muscles<00:01:13.290> there<00:01:13.530> hence<00:01:13.890> try<00:01:14.490> triceps<00:01:15.390> pushing

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
muscles there hence try triceps pushing

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.830 
muscles there hence try triceps pushing
down<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.369> gonna<00:01:17.549> work<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.210> outer<00:01:18.450> head

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
down this is gonna work the outer head

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.219 
down this is gonna work the outer head
to<00:01:19.020> copy<00:01:19.200> tricep<00:01:19.680> muscle<00:01:20.270> if<00:01:21.270> you're<00:01:21.810> pushing

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
to copy tricep muscle if you're pushing

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.510 
to copy tricep muscle if you're pushing
like<00:01:22.560> you're<00:01:22.740> doing<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> close<00:01:23.189> grip<00:01:23.460> bench

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
like you're doing a close grip bench

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.030 
like you're doing a close grip bench
press<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:24.420> instance<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.009> work

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
press for instance this is going to work

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.460 
press for instance this is going to work
the<00:01:26.369> middle<00:01:26.640> head<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.450> extending<00:01:28.049> your<00:01:28.140> arms

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
the middle head so extending your arms

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.499 
the middle head so extending your arms
overhead<00:01:28.770> while<00:01:29.100> using<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.520> rope<00:01:29.729> or<00:01:30.000> dumbbell

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
overhead while using a rope or dumbbell

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.960 
overhead while using a rope or dumbbell
will<00:01:30.960> really<00:01:31.350> work<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.770> rear<00:01:31.979> head<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.729> give

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
will really work the rear head to give

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.899 
will really work the rear head to give
you<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.810> fullness<00:01:34.430> 70%<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.549> your<00:01:35.670> arm

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
you that out of fullness 70% of your arm

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.880 
you that out of fullness 70% of your arm
is<00:01:36.030> made<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.509> from<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> tricep<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.770> it's

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
is made up from the tricep so it's

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.230 
is made up from the tricep so it's
something<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.460> should<00:01:38.640> really<00:01:38.909> focus

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
something that you should really focus

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.060 
something that you should really focus
on<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.750> lot<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.020> people<00:01:40.350> train<00:01:40.650> their<00:01:40.860> bigger

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
on a lot of people train their bigger

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.460 
on a lot of people train their bigger
muscles<00:01:41.610> they<00:01:42.240> hit<00:01:42.479> their<00:01:42.630> biceps<00:01:43.170> when<00:01:43.350> in

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
muscles they hit their biceps when in

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.679 
muscles they hit their biceps when in
fact<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:44.100> only<00:01:44.310> thirty<00:01:44.939> percent<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
fact it's only thirty percent of the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.550 
fact it's only thirty percent of the

neutral grip now on to back muscles the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.960 
neutral grip now on to back muscles the
back<00:02:07.080> is<00:02:07.289> very<00:02:07.560> complex<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.550> got<00:02:08.729> different

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
back is very complex it's got different

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.460

direction so you have to work you from

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.210 
direction so you have to work you from
different<00:02:12.330> angles<00:02:12.870> your<00:02:13.349> traps<00:02:13.709> are<00:02:13.920> actually

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
different angles your traps are actually

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.160

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
part of the back muscle so when you're

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.630 
part of the back muscle so when you're
working<00:02:16.560> your<00:02:16.680> trap<00:02:16.920> muscles<00:02:17.160> you're<00:02:17.519> gonna

I don't bother really hitting obliques

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.420 
I don't bother really hitting obliques
directly<00:03:48.780> because<00:03:49.109> I<00:03:49.200> find<00:03:49.500> they<00:03:49.980> get<00:03:50.160> worked

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
directly because I find they get worked

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
to Train ABS once a week but I go really

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.309 
to Train ABS once a week but I go really
hard<00:03:55.319> sometimes<00:03:55.769> heavy<00:03:56.340> on<00:03:56.519> those<00:03:56.640> days

calves make up the legs your quads are
going<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.150> be<00:04:02.239> really<00:04:02.629> isolated<00:04:03.349> when<00:04:03.799> you

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
going to be really isolated when you

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.309 
going to be really isolated when you
perform<00:04:04.400> in<00:04:04.549> a<00:04:04.700> leg<00:04:04.909> extending<00:04:05.629> movement<00:04:06.079> like

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
perform in a leg extending movement like

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.709 
perform in a leg extending movement like
leg<00:04:06.560> extensions<00:04:07.219> on<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:07.549> machine<00:04:08.269> that's

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:08.719 
leg extensions on the machine that's

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.440 
leg extensions on the machine that's
gonna<00:04:08.930> hit<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.530> for<00:04:09.859> quadricep<00:04:10.760> muscles<00:04:11.180> and

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
gonna hit the for quadricep muscles and

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.390 
gonna hit the for quadricep muscles and
that's<00:04:11.659> it<00:04:11.870> it's<00:04:12.439> not<00:04:12.620> gonna<00:04:12.769> bring<00:04:12.980> in<00:04:13.099> any

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
that's it it's not gonna bring in any

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.009 
that's it it's not gonna bring in any
other<00:04:13.609> muscle<00:04:13.849> group<00:04:14.180> so<00:04:14.569> that's<00:04:14.629> a<00:04:14.810> great

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
other muscle group so that's a great

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.560 
other muscle group so that's a great
exercise<00:04:15.349> to<00:04:15.769> start<00:04:16.070> on<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.729> really<00:04:17.120> warms<00:04:17.419> up

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
exercise to start on it really warms up

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.509 
exercise to start on it really warms up
your<00:04:17.599> knees<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.169> pre<00:04:18.799> fatigues<00:04:19.310> your

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
your knees and pre fatigues your

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.580 
your knees and pre fatigues your
quadriceps<00:04:20.180> before<00:04:20.900> going<00:04:21.109> into<00:04:21.320> some

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
quadriceps before going into some

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.650 
quadriceps before going into some
compound<00:04:22.099> movements<00:04:22.550> so<00:04:22.880> a<00:04:22.910> compound

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
compound movements so a compound

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.689 
compound movements so a compound
movement<00:04:24.080> for<00:04:24.229> your<00:04:24.320> legs<00:04:24.620> is<00:04:24.949> gonna<00:04:25.580> be

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
movement for your legs is gonna be

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.040 
movement for your legs is gonna be
predominately<00:04:26.210> for<00:04:26.419> your<00:04:26.570> quads

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
predominately for your quads

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.469 
predominately for your quads
this<00:04:27.380> would<00:04:27.530> include<00:04:27.830> squats<00:04:28.520> and<00:04:28.820> leg

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
this would include squats and leg

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.420 
this would include squats and leg
presses<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:30.410> further<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:30.889> have<00:04:31.070> your<00:04:31.250> legs

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
presses the further you have your legs

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.850 
presses the further you have your legs
up<00:04:31.729> on<00:04:31.880> a<00:04:31.910> leg<00:04:32.150> press<00:04:32.389> platform<00:04:32.720> is<00:04:33.349> going<00:04:33.800> to

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
up on a leg press platform is going to

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.890 
up on a leg press platform is going to
hit<00:04:33.979> more<00:04:34.190> hamstrings<00:04:34.759> so<00:04:35.180> if<00:04:35.330> you<00:04:35.449> have<00:04:35.660> it<00:04:35.810> in

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
hit more hamstrings so if you have it in

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.960 
hit more hamstrings so if you have it in
a<00:04:35.990> neutral<00:04:36.410> position<00:04:36.560> it's<00:04:37.160> gonna<00:04:37.460> really<00:04:37.729> hit

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
a neutral position it's gonna really hit

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.330 
a neutral position it's gonna really hit
more<00:04:38.330> of<00:04:38.539> your<00:04:38.810> quadricep<00:04:39.410> muscles<00:04:39.830> you've

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
more of your quadricep muscles you've

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.710 
more of your quadricep muscles you've
also<00:04:40.490> got<00:04:40.759> lunges<00:04:41.180> but<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:41.449> works

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
also got lunges but that works

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.659 
also got lunges but that works
everything<00:04:42.320> that<00:04:42.440> works<00:04:42.650> your<00:04:42.800> glutes<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:43.460> it

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
everything that works your glutes and it

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.249 
everything that works your glutes and it
works<00:04:43.880> your<00:04:44.030> hamstrings<00:04:44.509> as<00:04:44.750> well<00:04:44.780> as<00:04:45.139> your

be<00:04:49.130> leg<00:04:49.370> curling<00:04:49.970> so<00:04:50.330> this<00:04:50.479> is<00:04:50.599> a<00:04:50.630> really<00:04:50.960> good

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
be leg curling so this is a really good

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.930 
be leg curling so this is a really good
movement<00:04:51.560> to<00:04:52.130> do<00:04:52.310> if<00:04:52.430> you<00:04:52.520> want<00:04:52.699> to<00:04:52.759> isolate

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
then your work that was standing calf

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.560 
then your work that was standing calf
presses<00:05:20.960> so<00:05:21.650> legs<00:05:21.949> calves<00:05:22.550> hamstrings<00:05:23.210> quads

presses so legs calves hamstrings quads

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.230 
presses so legs calves hamstrings quads
and<00:05:23.960> find<00:05:24.229> work<00:05:24.979> really<00:05:25.520> well<00:05:25.789> with<00:05:25.970> high

and find work really well with high

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.480 
and find work really well with high
repetitions<00:05:27.020> so<00:05:27.259> that's<00:05:27.830> why<00:05:27.979> I<00:05:28.009> always<00:05:28.340> do

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
repetitions so that's why I always do

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.289 
repetitions so that's why I always do
around<00:05:28.669> 20<00:05:29.150> repetitions<00:05:29.360> as<00:05:29.930> a<00:05:29.960> minimum
