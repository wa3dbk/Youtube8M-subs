just<00:01:25.470> devoting<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:26.939> gutter<00:01:27.150> okay<00:01:27.420> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
just devoting like the one gutter okay I

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.740 
just devoting like the one gutter okay I

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
think so I think has to go a lot there's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.260 
think so I think has to go a lot there's
just<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> commander<00:01:31.500> driver<00:01:32.130> into<00:01:32.610> radio<00:01:32.939> so

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
just a commander driver into radio so

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.700 
just a commander driver into radio so
who<00:01:33.420> do<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.570> rest<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.490> commander<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.520> guess

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
as well so there are a bit less likely

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.940
