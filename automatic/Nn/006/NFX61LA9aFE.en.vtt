various bits of work which necessitated
removing<00:00:25.060> these<00:00:25.680> pounds<00:00:26.680> which<00:00:26.800> covered<00:00:27.160> the

ram air intakes and I've been doing and

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.429 
ram air intakes and I've been doing and
undoing<00:00:30.609> the<00:00:30.789> screws<00:00:30.939> quite<00:00:31.420> a<00:00:31.449> bit<00:00:31.660> lots<00:00:32.290> of

bikes<00:00:32.680> about<00:00:32.920> five<00:00:33.160> years<00:00:33.400> old<00:00:33.580> so<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:35.230> can

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
bikes about five years old so you can

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.259 
bikes about five years old so you can
see<00:00:35.559> here<00:00:35.800> that<00:00:36.010> this<00:00:36.580> is<00:00:36.640> actually<00:00:37.239> just

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
see here that this is actually just

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.720 
see here that this is actually just
shattered<00:00:37.750> it's<00:00:37.930> old<00:00:38.080> plastic<00:00:38.640> probably<00:00:39.640> been

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
shattered it's old plastic probably been

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.729 
shattered it's old plastic probably been
done<00:00:39.850> up<00:00:39.970> a<00:00:40.059> bit<00:00:40.210> too<00:00:40.360> tight<00:00:40.600> so<00:00:41.199> I<00:00:41.260> had<00:00:41.379> a<00:00:41.409> great

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
done up a bit too tight so I had a great

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.039 
done up a bit too tight so I had a great
excuse<00:00:42.220> for<00:00:43.000> going<00:00:43.150> out<00:00:43.360> and<00:00:43.570> buying<00:00:43.720> some

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:44.049 
excuse for going out and buying some

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:46.439 
excuse for going out and buying some
replacements<00:00:44.680> but<00:00:44.909> thing<00:00:45.909> is<00:00:46.089> you<00:00:46.330> know

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
replacements but thing is you know

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.329 
replacements but thing is you know
standard<00:00:46.809> parts<00:00:47.080> are<00:00:47.170> quite<00:00:47.290> expensive<00:00:47.470> you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
standard parts are quite expensive you

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.210 
standard parts are quite expensive you
can<00:00:48.640> get<00:00:49.290> obviously<00:00:50.290> you<00:00:50.559> know<00:00:50.680> second-hand

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
can get obviously you know second-hand

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.609 
can get obviously you know second-hand
parts<00:00:51.549> but<00:00:51.760> then<00:00:52.019> might<00:00:53.019> well<00:00:53.199> get<00:00:53.409> the<00:00:53.470> same

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:53.619 
parts but then might well get the same

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.320 
parts but then might well get the same
problem<00:00:53.979> very<00:00:54.159> very<00:00:54.369> quickly<00:00:54.549> so<00:00:54.879> I<00:00:54.909> thought

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
problem very very quickly so I thought

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.289 
problem very very quickly so I thought
of<00:00:55.600> power<00:00:56.110> Bron<00:00:56.379> and<00:00:56.559> in<00:00:56.739> fact<00:00:56.979> on<00:00:57.940> here<00:00:58.180> you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
of power Bron and in fact on here you

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.789 
of power Bron and in fact on here you
can<00:00:58.479> see<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:59.320> very<00:00:59.530> nice<00:01:00.780> extra<00:01:01.780> light<00:01:01.989> you

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
can see the very nice extra light you

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.120 
can see the very nice extra light you
can<00:01:02.979> see<00:01:03.159> a<00:01:03.369> very<00:01:03.670> nice<00:01:03.909> carbon<00:01:04.570> fiber<00:01:05.130> hugger

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
can see a very nice carbon fiber hugger

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.480 
can see a very nice carbon fiber hugger
on<00:01:06.460> there<00:01:07.030> with<00:01:07.180> a<00:01:07.210> gold<00:01:07.479> mesh<00:01:07.950> which<00:01:08.950> performs

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
on there with a gold mesh which performs

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.760 
on there with a gold mesh which performs
very<00:01:09.729> useful<00:01:10.119> function<00:01:10.299> in<00:01:10.600> keeping<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.049> crud

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
very useful function in keeping the crud

very useful function in keeping the crud
off<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.040> back<00:01:12.220> of<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.400> bike<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:13.090> but<00:01:13.750> also

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
off the back of the bike and but also

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.230 
off the back of the bike and but also
looks<00:01:14.260> good<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:15.370> I<00:01:15.580> thought<00:01:15.760> well<00:01:15.970> I'll<00:01:16.060> see

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
looks good and I thought well I'll see

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.620 
looks good and I thought well I'll see
what<00:01:16.270> they've<00:01:16.510> got<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:17.140> end<00:01:17.290> result<00:01:17.620> was<00:01:18.630> this

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
what they've got the end result was this

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.480 
what they've got the end result was this
box<00:01:19.930> arriving<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:25.150> very<00:01:25.570> very<00:01:25.960> nice

actually found that this one it's ever
so<00:02:11.170> slightly<00:02:11.650> too<00:02:11.980> small<00:02:12.280> for<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.180> bolt<00:02:13.930> to

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
so slightly too small for the bolt to

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.089 
so slightly too small for the bolt to
pass<00:02:14.260> through<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:14.590> I'm<00:02:14.680> just<00:02:14.769> going<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.950> have

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
pass through so I'm just going to have

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.490 
pass through so I'm just going to have
to<00:02:15.220> run<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.730> drill<00:02:16.299> very<00:02:16.569> gently<00:02:17.019> through<00:02:17.290> that

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
to run a drill very gently through that

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.020 
to run a drill very gently through that
just<00:02:17.709> take<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.160> out<00:02:18.280> by<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.459> fraction<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.940> a

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
just take it out by a fraction of a

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.390 
just take it out by a fraction of a
millimeter<00:02:19.380> it's<00:02:20.380> very<00:02:20.560> close<00:02:20.799> but<00:02:21.130> it's<00:02:21.310> not

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
millimeter it's very close but it's not

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.039 
millimeter it's very close but it's not
quite<00:02:21.989> right<00:02:22.989> it's<00:02:23.500> all<00:02:23.650> screwed<00:02:23.920> on<00:02:24.130> now<00:02:24.370> and

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
quite right it's all screwed on now and

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.890 
quite right it's all screwed on now and
the<00:02:26.049> one<00:02:26.230> up<00:02:26.349> here<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.650> we've<00:02:27.599> get<00:02:28.599> a<00:02:28.630> light

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
the one up here that we've get a light

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.030 
the one up here that we've get a light
the<00:02:29.890> one<00:02:30.069> up<00:02:30.190> here<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.489> was<00:02:30.880> slightly<00:02:31.569> tight

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
the one up here that was slightly tight

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.039 
the one up here that was slightly tight
turned<00:02:33.040> out<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.370> be<00:02:33.519> holes<00:02:34.269> partly<00:02:34.720> full<00:02:34.900> of

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
turned out to be holes partly full of

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.259 
turned out to be holes partly full of
lacquer<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.590> stuff<00:02:35.890> say<00:02:36.220> probably<00:02:37.090> was

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
lacquer and stuff say probably was

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.360 
lacquer and stuff say probably was
originally<00:02:37.780> drilled<00:02:38.049> correct<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.890> got<00:02:39.069> filled

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
originally drilled correct it got filled

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.759 
originally drilled correct it got filled
up<00:02:39.519> with<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.700> final<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.120> curing<00:02:40.390> process<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:41.590> that

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
up with a final a curing process so that

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.460 
up with a final a curing process so that
had<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.069> be<00:02:42.220> sort<00:02:42.489> of<00:02:42.579> been<00:02:43.230> cleaned<00:02:44.230> through

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
had to be sort of been cleaned through

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.949 
had to be sort of been cleaned through
but<00:02:44.650> it's<00:02:44.769> quite<00:02:44.920> easy<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.599> deliberately<00:02:46.599> have

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
but it's quite easy I deliberately have

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.960 
but it's quite easy I deliberately have
not<00:02:47.230> done<00:02:47.590> these<00:02:47.769> up<00:02:47.980> too<00:02:48.190> tight<00:02:48.489> I<00:02:48.700> don't<00:02:48.849> want

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
not done these up too tight I don't want

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.520 
not done these up too tight I don't want
a<00:02:49.000> repeat<00:02:49.299> of<00:02:49.360> what<00:02:49.480> happened<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.109> plastic

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
a repeat of what happened to the plastic

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.629 
a repeat of what happened to the plastic
on<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.799> other<00:02:50.920> side<00:02:51.130> although<00:02:51.340> cause

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
on the other side although cause

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.780 
on the other side although cause
karpin's<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.150> lot<00:02:52.239> stronger<00:02:53.340> that's<00:02:54.340> good<00:02:54.609> I

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
karpin's a lot stronger that's good I

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.190 
karpin's a lot stronger that's good I
think<00:02:55.090> now<00:02:55.630> these<00:02:56.500> old<00:02:57.269> original<00:02:58.269> bolts<00:02:59.049> look

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
think now these old original bolts look

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.670 
think now these old original bolts look
a<00:02:59.319> bit<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:01.510> worse<00:03:01.690> for<00:03:01.720> wear<00:03:01.930> so<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.290> think<00:03:02.350> some

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
a bit the worse for wear so I think some

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.559 
a bit the worse for wear so I think some
nice<00:03:02.859> new<00:03:03.040> shiny<00:03:03.280> ones<00:03:03.579> and<00:03:03.790> there<00:03:03.970> might<00:03:04.180> be<00:03:04.209> a

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
nice new shiny ones and there might be a

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.599 
nice new shiny ones and there might be a
good<00:03:05.049> idea<00:03:05.170> perhaps<00:03:05.410> black<00:03:05.739> ones<00:03:06.030> in<00:03:07.030> our<00:03:07.120> site

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
good idea perhaps black ones in our site

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.729 
good idea perhaps black ones in our site
there's<00:03:09.609> a<00:03:09.670> little<00:03:09.910> bit<00:03:10.000> different<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:10.930> I

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
there's a little bit different and I

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.949 
there's a little bit different and I
will<00:03:12.459> switch<00:03:12.760> in<00:03:13.000> here<00:03:13.180> waterproof<00:03:13.660> switch

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
will switch in here waterproof switch

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.629 
will switch in here waterproof switch
which<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:15.150> for<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.239> excellent<00:03:16.840> lights<00:03:17.639> good

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
which is for the excellent lights good

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.539 
which is for the excellent lights good
on<00:03:18.760> their<00:03:18.970> most<00:03:19.750> powerful<00:03:19.930> LEDs<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:21.310> there's

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
on their most powerful LEDs and there's

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.580 
on their most powerful LEDs and there's
also<00:03:21.670> an<00:03:22.150> indicator<00:03:22.660> warning<00:03:23.109> bleeper<00:03:23.470> which

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
also an indicator warning bleeper which

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.920 
also an indicator warning bleeper which
is<00:03:23.739> just<00:03:23.980> velcroed<00:03:24.849> on<00:03:25.030> but<00:03:25.480> i<00:03:25.510> am<00:03:25.660> going<00:03:25.870> to

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
is the switch drilled through quite

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.520 
is the switch drilled through quite
