how many megabytes are free so it's

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.339 
how many megabytes are free so it's
nearly<00:02:25.760> three<00:02:25.940> gigabytes<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:26.540> space<00:02:26.989> that<00:02:27.290> we

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
nearly three gigabytes of space that we

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.410 
nearly three gigabytes of space that we

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
here so we can change our primary

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.869 
here so we can change our primary
dictionary<00:02:33.980> depending<00:02:34.489> on<00:02:34.580> what<00:02:34.730> we<00:02:34.849> want
