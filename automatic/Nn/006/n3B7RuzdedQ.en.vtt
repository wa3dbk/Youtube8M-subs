00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.220 
exactly what set it's from like I said
black<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.550> white<00:02:53.670> eight<00:02:53.989> but<00:02:54.989> i'm<00:02:55.080> guessing

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
black and white eight but i'm guessing

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.330 
black and white eight but i'm guessing
as<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.530> korean<00:02:56.160> card<00:02:56.550> I've<00:02:56.850> had<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.780> couple<00:02:58.019> of

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
as a korean card I've had a couple of

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.720 
as a korean card I've had a couple of
Korean<00:02:59.340> cards<00:02:59.640> in<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.850> past<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:01.580> that's<00:03:02.580> why

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
Korean cards in the past and that's why

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.550 
Korean cards in the past and that's why
the<00:03:02.790> back<00:03:03.060> doesn't<00:03:03.330> say<00:03:03.540> Pocket<00:03:03.989> Monsters<00:03:04.110> is

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
the back doesn't say Pocket Monsters is

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.110 
the back doesn't say Pocket Monsters is
because<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:05.070> not<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> Japanese<00:03:05.790> cards

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
because it's not a Japanese cards

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.199 
because it's not a Japanese cards
