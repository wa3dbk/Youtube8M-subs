paranoia it's a short film it's short
film<00:00:35.520> um<00:00:36.260> based<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> Ministry<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.860> Health

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
and it's mainly based around the idea of

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.670 
and it's mainly based around the idea of
paranoia<00:00:42.360> making<00:00:42.809> people<00:00:43.110> take<00:00:43.290> things<00:00:43.469> too

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680

paranoia making people take things too
far<00:00:44.510> basically<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.629> about<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.320> health

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
far basically it's about the health

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.040

minister and myself along with Bucky's I
now<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.980> decide<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.960> pitch<00:00:51.960> some<00:00:52.260> new<00:00:52.440> idea<00:00:52.890> to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
now we decide to pitch some new idea to

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.639 
now we decide to pitch some new idea to
our<00:00:53.370> health<00:00:53.550> minister<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:55.110> idea<00:00:55.469> was

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
our health minister the idea was

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.200 
our health minister the idea was
actually<00:00:55.800> from<00:00:56.219> friend<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.730> mine<00:00:56.850> Sri<00:00:57.180> Hari

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
actually from friend of mine Sri Hari

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.040 
actually from friend of mine Sri Hari
and<00:00:58.730> it<00:00:59.730> kicks<00:00:59.969> off<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:00.840> just

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and it kicks off on that and it's just

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.369 
and it kicks off on that and it's just
about<00:01:01.260> paranoia<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:02.039> general<00:01:02.489> because<00:01:03.379> you

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
about paranoia in general because you

tripod and he sees lines just say a line

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.010 
tripod and he sees lines just say a line
saying<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.689> lie

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
saying is a lie

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.169

let<00:01:31.920> him<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.189> his<00:01:32.219> thing<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.670> then<00:01:32.850> they<00:01:32.969> try

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
let him do his thing and then they try

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.510 
let him do his thing and then they try
not<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.450> shoot<00:01:33.659> Bucky<00:01:34.649> and<00:01:34.740> Nick<00:01:34.920> doing<00:01:35.340> their

lines<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> black<00:01:36.600> chair<00:01:37.039> he<00:01:38.039> was<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> one

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
lines to a black chair he was the one

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.090 
lines to a black chair he was the one
that<00:01:38.490> suggested<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.560> we<00:01:40.560> improvise<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> scene

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that suggested that we improvise a scene

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.209 
that suggested that we improvise a scene
which<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.549> prefer<00:01:41.750> he<00:01:42.750> actually<00:01:43.079> improvised<00:01:44.039> a

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
which I prefer he actually improvised a

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:45.559 
which I prefer he actually improvised a
couple<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> scenes<00:01:45.030> which<00:01:45.329> was

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
couple of the scenes which was

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.569 
couple of the scenes which was
surprising<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.079> both<00:01:46.350> me<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.590> Bucky<00:01:47.100> because

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
surprising to both me and Bucky because

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.039 
surprising to both me and Bucky because
we<00:01:47.700> did<00:01:47.850> not<00:01:47.880> expect<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.329> from<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.600> minister

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
we did not expect that from a minister

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.899 
we did not expect that from a minister
and<00:01:49.289> he<00:01:49.950> was<00:01:50.069> the<00:01:50.159> one<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.459> suggested<00:01:50.549> that

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
and he was the one that suggested that

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.029 
and he was the one that suggested that
which<00:01:51.240> freed<00:01:51.840> me<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:52.170> completely<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.709> mean<00:01:52.770> we

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
which freed me up completely I mean we

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.590 
which freed me up completely I mean we
were<00:01:53.159> glad<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.880> were<00:01:53.969> done<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.240> about<00:01:54.329> we

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
were glad we were done in about we

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.209 
were glad we were done in about we
scheduled<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.200> about<00:01:55.409> three<00:01:55.709> hours<00:01:55.740> we've

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
scheduled it for about three hours we've

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.830 
scheduled it for about three hours we've
been<00:01:56.310> done<00:01:56.429> in<00:01:56.549> one<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.850> half<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.509> made<00:01:57.689> me

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
been done in one and a half it made me

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.410 
been done in one and a half it made me
get<00:01:57.990> natural<00:01:58.409> yes<00:01:58.829> does<00:01:59.399> he<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.700> good<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
get natural yes does he like good just a

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.149 
get natural yes does he like good just a
low-key<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.750> delivered<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.289> the<00:02:01.409> suite<00:02:01.679> it<00:02:02.009> was

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
low-key on delivered to the suite it was

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.800 
low-key on delivered to the suite it was
very<00:02:02.189> surprising<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:03.030> we<00:02:03.179> could<00:02:03.329> get<00:02:03.509> things

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
very surprising that we could get things

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.779 
very surprising that we could get things
done<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.319> very<00:02:04.439> quick<00:02:04.770> process<00:02:04.950> because

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
done in a very quick process because

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.960 
done in a very quick process because
usually<00:02:06.090> we'd<00:02:07.049> be<00:02:07.170> there<00:02:07.349> we<00:02:07.709> had<00:02:07.829> set<00:02:08.160> up<00:02:08.399> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
usually we'd be there we had set up and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.940 
usually we'd be there we had set up and
all<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.329> but<00:02:09.539> not<00:02:10.019> this<00:02:10.229> we<00:02:10.500> just<00:02:10.679> had<00:02:10.829> the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
all that but not this we just had the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.190 
all that but not this we just had the
