design what makes simple really good is
that<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.110> allows<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.680> path<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.520> open<00:01:38.820> play<00:01:42.350> when

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
own child or for somebody else it's a

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.510 
own child or for somebody else it's a
reflection<00:01:46.800> on<00:01:47.009> yourself

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
reflection on yourself

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.130 
reflection on yourself
and<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.360> give<00:01:48.540> something<00:01:48.990> that

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and so if you can give something that

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.080 
and so if you can give something that
you<00:01:49.229> know<00:01:49.410> is<00:01:49.590> safer<00:01:50.100> better<00:01:50.759> for<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
you know is safer better for the
