00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.509
 [Music] 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.509
 6 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:22.580
 [Music] 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:25.130
 so we stabilized speed at the level of 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.050
 two as one brakes only from the back in 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.160
 replacing the bs ie we do not 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.739
 do not block the rear wheel 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.759
 we have fresnes in real ones of course we 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.190
 brakes the rear wheel 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.110
 we try furniture that did 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.470
 turn around three causes even 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.470
 exercise opposite we return to the pediment 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.760
 adductors go it's gone 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.230
 this exercise is excellent if you 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.429
 get on the road that gravel 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.679
 dead leaves 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.809
 one really slippery without the decline 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.289
 like that you do not have to block the 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.960
 rear wheel 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.329
 we arrive with the rear wheel we come 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.980
 put a little slap on the tires for 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.589
 move it to say we're going to do 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.790
 the exercise left side still where we have 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.409
 always the left foot in security etc 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.280
 to start learning to do 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.280
 slip his motorcycle 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.060
 maybe you put gas in 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.370
 a bit earlier but more smoothly 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.350
 the a7 therefore programs their souls to 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.270
 slip lose balance so you cut 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.250
 while they will not make speed 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.740
 the goal is a departing sheep slips 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.210
 but that you take speed then 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.190
 that this is a throttle is 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.820
 on motorcycle he goes sideways so in addition to 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.820
 its flora of the blow 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:58.090
 forward frankly forward the body 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.740
 and three en route a chord at the beginning I 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.990
 did not feel the buttocks I did not 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:13.840
 I'm not surprised at all what's better 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:15.459
 lol so here we will work on this 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.980
 small pitch just a little 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.590
 sorting for with big trail 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.590
 get to do little rups of 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.269
 downhill climbs descents in 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.870
 the dancing grass pretty slippery ago 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.930
 ruts 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.160
 so it really happened to turn 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.160
 when one finds on tracks of 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.680
 small difficulties or in mountains in 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.540
 on the tracks of course everything that is 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.340
 really realizing okay but when 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.170
 looking at us as its currency has not 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.459
 looks impressive and yet is this 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.790
 that the trainee tea meets 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.069
 troubles 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.069
 yes then worries and then it becomes 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.049
 pretty physical after 15 minutes there 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.530
 in without stop it's really very 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.530
 very physical 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.880
 so the exercise will launch an approach 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.520
 driving in the sand so I 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.780
 traced in French slalom which will associate 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.660
 the cant plus the first turns 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.780
 sand so the goal is that the front 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.520
 do not leave hard so you always come 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.680
 gas net so your rear wheel she 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.090
 stalking all the time in the sand but 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.440
 on the other hand there the handlebars he will have to 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.240
 still hold it what are you going to see 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.490
 she's going to leave and if you do not want your 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.160
 handlebars her to the wheel once twice 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:35.800
 she from under 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:48.640
 [Applause] 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:51.220
 [Music] 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.690
 France have all the turns it's a 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.920
 difficulty because are obscured 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.570
 powered hassin then becomes obvious 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.310
 this intermediate position or a 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:05.690
 first thing after when you arrive 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.580
 here you see the rut there if you want 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.850
 this rut ​​if you put yourself there king band 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.790
 in l is too short and it's you 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.280
 tournes hand and walks which will block 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.489
 l your front wheel is going to jump and it's not 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.890
 good 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.770
 this is the same you have to think 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.110
 also to pilot that your rear wheel for 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.820
 that you know and that you see in your 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.820
 eyes or your rear wheel 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:05:00.149
 [Music] 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.450
 with a little bit of speed then you have 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.930
 tendency to admit over the 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.310
 sand yeah have you seen we're always at 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.250
 whenever the rear wheel touches 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.040
 you have to put gas is that snow 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.220
 is at sight there we come to have a good 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.270
 speed without taking risks it goes 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:42.509
 easy 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:42.509
