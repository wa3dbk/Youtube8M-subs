00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:37.739

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.870

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.590

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.789

 and has several sizes also the size 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:06.210
 It's very easy to have me do the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.280
 I'm going to use today, I already painted the nail. 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.630
 How I'm going to come down here now? 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.260
 You can see the step by step better. 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.759

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:23.220
 Look, mine is already painted. 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:27.240
 I liked kiss I deserved from coller. 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:33.869
 try i love these bad 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:36.140
 I love this thing ok I'll apply the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.560
 black over 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:45.329
 How can you see a little bit of paint? 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:48.899
 To paint I used an Ana Enamel 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.090
 Black hickmann is pearly number of laws 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.399
 it's okay 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:02:04.460
 I love this nail polish and it's very simple. 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:04.460
 worse the enamel leave it very wet 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:16.910
 and go paint the tulle it dries a lot 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:20.080
 fast does not create does not make good use 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.739
 You just have to take care of yourself because sometimes. 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.690
 may be some excess can cover 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.580
 some ball and then it's time to 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:35.390
 apply will not be okay 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:37.900
 It's good in about 12 minutes and already 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.900
 it's dry 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.840
 I'm going to cut a little more or 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.840
 minus the size of the nail 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:04.540
 Look at him and stick it together. 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:09.640
 I will use this here're sabrina sato 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:16.019
 look is a very proud gorgeous glitter 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.019
 How do I want happiness in the name? 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.230
 a layer of it 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:41.490
 you can go then also passes 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:44.520
 apply the rent or use 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.310
 glitter any one of you can pass 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:52.950
 twitter then over instead of 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:57.510
 put it this way then just put it 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.220
 press a little bit on the 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:06.380
 my property from below he was not well 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:10.880
 dry with the toothpick 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.880
 I'll press on the nooks and crannies. 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:24.730
 The pope has no practice these people and 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.960
 do tutorials 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.960
 It's my first time. 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:38.740
 very well now with the nail pliers 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.380
 I'm taking these excesses away 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.380
 they stayed 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:49.630
 I find it easier this way because it is 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:52.180
 very difficult to cut exactly the 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.139
 nail size 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.139
 fine 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.930
 People, he just looked, it was good, right? 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:24.800
 You can pass a base over to 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:27.540
 to avoid that point of serve loosen up 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:33.110
 Or you can do as I will. 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.110
 other glitter glitter layer 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.750
 O 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:06:00.580
 rain now yes it was that 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:03.759
 I hope you have enjoyed my 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.279
 you can abuse the 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:10.840
 creativity and use in an urn and all 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:12.180
 the colored nails paint lace of several 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.150
 Colors 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:19.090
 this nail that it has a characteristic 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:23.919
 a very good advantage it lasts a lot 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:28.000
 time the enamel takes a lot to get out and 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:30.819
