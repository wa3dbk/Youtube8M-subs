00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.920
 I was surprised to discover 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.310
 even though my father's main nobility title had been 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.679
 Denied the greatest of my half brothers 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:11.449
 and most of his fortune 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:15.059
 I had been assigned to the uc to the Duchess and those children my mother and I 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.130
 we had been considered in the will 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.720
 it is necessary to mention 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.980
 that what was even more annoying 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.739
 but my father had closed his business 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.709
 in a way almost impossible for them to start a legal process to claim 

00:00:28.709 --> 00:00:31.709
 what my father had left for my mother for me 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.650
 it was then 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.330
 I'll check in overnight 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
 I found myself as the owner of a modest fortune 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.050
 the title of count 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.670
 and the villa of Nymburk or 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.670
 a property that my father had insisted that it was time 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.590
 as the strictly established area your will 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.680
 fbc of the home in quillón had been conceived 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.440
 and he had thought that he throw 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.589
 It gave me natural rights over the property and the manor house 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.760
 my first impulse which to decline in its privileges and positions 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.629
 but this good 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.260
 he convinced me that he should be conservative 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.640
 I would have pleased my father 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.270
 the lawyer guaranteed me 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.530
 that I will not have to take part in the parliament if I wanted it 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.500
 the money could be transferred phase 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.350
 the chin bench the united states 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.340
 I could keep the residence 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.910
 giles lands under the care of protest euros 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.730
 and use it as a summer house 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.970
 for occasional vacations 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.090
 everything seemed to sound very accurate 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.990
 but I still night a bit against the idea of ​​conserving the villa 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.010
 I was not sure if I could face the agreements 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.100
 pieces look like date 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.220
 for that reason 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.690
 and before deciding 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.840
 trip to scotland 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.530
 for the purpose of trying out month 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.550
 and see if he could resist an encounter with the past 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.520
 but also 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.040
 with the secret intention 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.590
 they give him a little time 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.700
 to think and the measurement is true 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.360
 after the death of susana 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.790
 I expected the old building that I drowned 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.360
 enclosed between its large wooden doors 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.050
 a little bit of street magic 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.380
 what space wherever it goes 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.730
 in those days 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.170
 tell them since susana already dead 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.170
 impossible for me to be with the woman I really love 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.559
 I married conadi 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:15.789
 instead I will have to look for a new crusade to make sense of my 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:18.789
 life something that I could feel proud of 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.719
 after those days the nymburk 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.329
 I decided to accept my father's posthumous gift 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.229
 and leaves the way in the hands of this theft 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:31.429
 the cause I was looking for was waiting for me just take medical 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.849
 a couple of months after the death of my father 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.949
 united states enter the war 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.239
 and I felt the need to join melexis sica 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.959
 in a romantic impulse 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.399
 who did not suspect then 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:45.399
 that it would take me to find this one with k 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.509
 have to see it again 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:49.829
 they have to confirm 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.209
 that effectively she 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.129
 abandoned the chrysalis of his child body 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.629
 and has become a dazzling woman 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.139
 he has to live with her 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.589
 is intimidating spiritually in those provided seconds inside the truck 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.100
 there you have to see them 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.129
 faint in my arms again 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.319
 and prove that the heat of your body unconscious 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.679
 you have to discover 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:12.139
 if there was an opportunity to regain his love 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.639
 but that I did not realize 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.889
 so it was too late 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.109
 that someone had found a way to separate them again 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.389
 and finally 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:21.549
 have to live 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.169
 to meet man 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:27.039
 who can maybe have the home that I did not know at prices 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:29.749
 now my nightmares 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:32.049
 and I can not even afford to daily 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.049
 because I have not tried to be 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.159
 I thought that time can extinguish this fire inside of me 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.589
 as the days go by 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:44.979
 only one hundred 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:46.729
 how they increase their plots 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.899
 without finding the way to control my heart restlessness 

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:51.209
 the years go by 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.209
 and I do not get betis as a sweet memory of my adolescence 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.159
 I can not think of you as one 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:58.959
 kennedy that in a long time 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.369
 joined by you as the first day 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:05.369
 this brand new consume and heart without waiting 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.119
 because you have to assume 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:08.599
 can you Tunisian 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.599
 because we are faithful what I proposed to you 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.079
 the clock struck midnight 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.120
 and as if the young man had woken up from a long sleep 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.300
 or as if he had been released from an enchantment 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.869
 he suddenly stood up and headed towards the change 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.600
 had before him a long journey 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.309
 to be able to return to the place 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:31.749
 In the middle of the forest 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:33.809
 so from your squad the expected 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:35.389
 and one last look 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.689
 to the gothic girls of notre dame 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.219
 somewhat blurred in the foggy night 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:41.160
 and said goodbye 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.650
 I am very loved 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.969
 franklin his prayers 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:50.020
 the bera bera bera 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.039
 they set fire to cars 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.300
 after a while 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.669
 the truck disappeared the snow 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.259
 the man inside him did not know he was about to meet one 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.539
 that would play an important role in his life 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:03.919
 upon his return to the camp
