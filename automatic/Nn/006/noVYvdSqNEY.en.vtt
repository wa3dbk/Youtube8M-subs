00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.679 
so what are the uncommon numbers like
let's<00:01:28.140> do<00:01:28.259> wonder<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.700> 70,000<00:01:29.700> right<00:01:30.390> because

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
let's do wonder the 70,000 right because

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.440 
let's do wonder the 70,000 right because
we<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:30.960> go<00:01:31.079> three<00:01:31.380> times<00:01:31.590> 90,000<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:32.610> 270

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
we just go three times 90,000 to get 270

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.140 
we just go three times 90,000 to get 270
then<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:35.130> rare<00:01:35.490> cards<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
then we get to the rare cards and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.030 
then we get to the rare cards and
usually<00:01:36.570> when<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:36.780> talk<00:01:36.990> about<00:01:37.020> rares<00:01:37.560> they're

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.819 
usually when we talk about rares they're

you'll see them

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.210 
you'll see them
but<00:02:00.870> we'll<00:02:01.290> we'll<00:02:01.470> just<00:02:01.650> lump<00:02:01.830> them<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.040> with

but we'll we'll just lump them in with
the<00:02:02.250> errors<00:02:02.580> for<00:02:02.760> now<00:02:02.880> all<00:02:03.450> right<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.320> now

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
the errors for now all right so now

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.920 
the errors for now all right so now
comes<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> question<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.970> was<00:02:06.210> hoping<00:02:06.659> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
comes the question if I was hoping to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.980 
comes the question if I was hoping to
let's<00:02:07.350> say<00:02:07.470> really<00:02:08.070> look<00:02:08.550> for<00:02:08.910> all<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.240> copies

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
let's say really look for all the copies

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.470 
let's say really look for all the copies
of<00:02:10.020> all<00:02:10.860> amongst<00:02:11.220> crusher<00:02:11.490> for<00:02:11.850> example<00:02:12.330> or

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
of all amongst crusher for example or

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.000 
of all amongst crusher for example or
instill<00:02:13.170> infection<00:02:13.830> one<00:02:14.400> particular<00:02:14.880> common

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
instill infection one particular common

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.920 
instill infection one particular common
well<00:02:17.010> how<00:02:17.790> many<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.150> those<00:02:18.360> are<00:02:18.420> going<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.780> get

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
well how many of those are going to get

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.560 
well how many of those are going to get
open<00:02:19.070> yeah<00:02:20.070> there<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.700> over<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.360> hundred

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
open yeah there is little over a hundred

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.720 
open yeah there is little over a hundred
comments<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.290> total<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.740> set<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:23.640> you

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
comments a total in the set so if you

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.030 
comments a total in the set so if you
divide<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.150> number<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.780> comments<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.530> total

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
divide the number of comments in total

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.860 
divide the number of comments in total
that<00:02:26.130> will<00:02:26.280> be<00:02:26.370> opened<00:02:26.730> by<00:02:26.790> by<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.540> number<00:02:27.840> of

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
that will be opened by by the number of

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.050 
that will be opened by by the number of
different<00:02:28.290> ones<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:29.130> would<00:02:29.250> expect<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.790> see

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
different ones you would expect to see

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.949 
different ones you would expect to see
on<00:02:30.270> average<00:02:31.050> about<00:02:31.530> eight<00:02:32.030> thousand<00:02:33.030> nine

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
on average about eight thousand nine

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.460 
on average about eight thousand nine
hundred<00:02:34.459> copies<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.610> any<00:02:35.850> single<00:02:36.120> gum

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
hundred copies of any single gum

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.250 
hundred copies of any single gum
so<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:38.460> put<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.670> into<00:02:38.850> perspective<00:02:39.480> little<00:02:40.140> bit

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
so to put it into perspective little bit

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.470 
so to put it into perspective little bit
if<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:40.770> like<00:02:40.920> one<00:02:41.580> specific<00:02:42.180> comment

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
if you have like one specific comment

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.110 
if you have like one specific comment
coming<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.200> ancient<00:02:43.590> law<00:02:43.740> for<00:02:44.190> example<00:02:44.640> and

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
coming of ancient law for example and

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.060 
coming of ancient law for example and
you<00:02:45.210> would<00:02:45.330> stick<00:02:45.600> all<00:02:46.320> of<00:02:46.470> them<00:02:46.590> up<00:02:46.740> so<00:02:47.010> you

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
you would stick all of them up so you

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.520 
you would stick all of them up so you
went<00:02:47.820> all<00:02:48.090> over<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.510> place<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.960> went<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.230> chi

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
went all over the place you went to chi

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.350 
went all over the place you went to chi
value<00:02:49.860> into<00:02:50.010> vegas<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.610> went<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.090> jacked

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
value into vegas you went to you jacked

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.330 
value into vegas you went to you jacked
you<00:02:51.450> collected<00:02:51.840> every<00:02:52.470> single<00:02:52.890> one<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.130> them

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
you collected every single one of them

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.450 
you collected every single one of them
and<00:02:53.940> we<00:02:54.060> just<00:02:54.270> stack<00:02:54.540> them<00:02:54.570> up<00:02:54.780> here<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.460> mean

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
and we just stack them up here I mean

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.340 
and we just stack them up here I mean
like<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.640> commander<00:02:57.090> deck<00:02:57.270> that's<00:02:57.720> like<00:02:57.870> 100

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
like a commander deck that's like 100

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.310 
like a commander deck that's like 100
cards<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.830> goes<00:02:59.010> through<00:02:59.250> here<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:01.200> have

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
cards that goes through here if you have

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.880 
cards that goes through here if you have
1,000<00:03:02.130> cards<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.730> goes<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.240> hear<00:03:03.840> if<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.710> have

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
1,000 cards it goes to hear if you have

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.370 
1,000 cards it goes to hear if you have
well<00:03:05.670> it's<00:03:05.850> not<00:03:05.940> actually<00:03:06.090> over<00:03:06.600> 9000<00:03:07.290> but

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
well it's not actually over 9000 but

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.170 
well it's not actually over 9000 but
almost<00:03:07.740> nine<00:03:08.070> thousand<00:03:08.580> copies<00:03:08.820> of<00:03:09.060> that

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
almost nine thousand copies of that

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.630 
almost nine thousand copies of that
common<00:03:09.890> well<00:03:10.890> I'm<00:03:11.010> looking<00:03:11.280> at<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.459> ceiling

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
common well I'm looking at the ceiling

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.370 
common well I'm looking at the ceiling
here<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.240> a<00:03:12.270> huge<00:03:12.540> convention<00:03:12.780> center

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
here this is a huge convention center

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.140 
here this is a huge convention center
but<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.680> may<00:03:13.830> actually<00:03:13.980> break<00:03:14.280> through<00:03:14.640> the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
but it may actually break through the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.360 
but it may actually break through the
ceiling<00:03:15.570> I<00:03:15.750> mean<00:03:16.650> maybe<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.040> stack<00:03:17.220> will

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
ceiling I mean maybe the stack will

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.460 
ceiling I mean maybe the stack will
actually<00:03:17.640> double<00:03:17.940> over<00:03:18.209> before<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.750> but<00:03:18.959> you

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
actually double over before that but you

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.130 
actually double over before that but you
know<00:03:19.500> it's<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.280> lot<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.850> Arts<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.900> what<00:03:22.020> you're

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
know it's a lot of Arts so what you're

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.020 
know it's a lot of Arts so what you're
saying<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.740> once<00:03:23.190> I've<00:03:23.370> collected<00:03:23.670> them

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
saying is that once I've collected them

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.520 
saying is that once I've collected them
all<00:03:24.150> I'm<00:03:24.390> gonna<00:03:24.600> have<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.780> real<00:03:24.990> storage

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
all I'm gonna have a real storage

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.870 
all I'm gonna have a real storage
problem<00:03:26.360> yes

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.940 

you
