00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.400
 hello people welcome to another class 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.070
 and the subject in this video 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.170
 still ecological association now we 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.900
 let's talk about the secondary succession 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.960
 whereas that process of successive 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.810
 implementation of species occurring in 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.039
 an environment where one day has had a 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.140
 biome climax 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.849
 only that something happened in this environment that 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.080
 that forest is simply not 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.510
 but do not worry 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.210
 suddenly it was cleared there was 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.980
 some burned it anyway that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.530
 The forest is not there right 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.530
 this type of succession is very common here 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.289
 in agricultural regions 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.110
 okay that farmers do they 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.420
 need to plant to generate food for 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.520
 the human community is not 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.829
 So what will happen to them? 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.079
 get your soy your corn your 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.379
 rice or beans they need terrain 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.690
 and they will not invade town to take away 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.810
 the buildings to take the houses to 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.330
 put there pasture for cattle or for 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.170
 put there plantation area 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.820
 of soybeans 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.619
 they will invade the forest because 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.240
 animal does not know how to defend itself 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.369
 so what do they do something that they 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.320
 they call to clean the land he 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.780
 simply 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.640
 all the trees from there like animals 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.549
 without a place to live and end up 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.350
 dying also in the even this is the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.159
 motive number 1 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.759
 the first reason that leads to 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.640
 species to extinction is not that disappear 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.170
 with habitat of the animals but finally what 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.930
 happens often is that the guy 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.000
 after cleaning the environment is 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.860
 destroy the natural environment 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.869
 he simply think of this environment 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.729
 not more fertile, I'm going to abandon this 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.869
 ground and leaves and he goes away and 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.329
 will clear another place to plant 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.000
 thing he wants to plant this terrain 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.079
 personal he will be able to 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.020
 if god willing and a man will allow 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.710
 to rebuild that forest that existed 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.470
 there she might be able to go back to something 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.020
 like one day she went because 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.860
 because before the guy got there that 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.890
 The forest is 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.080
 there a long time and throughout life 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.300
 of her she had several trees that 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.520
 produced several fruits and within the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.230
 fruits had several seeds, which 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.580
 means that over hundreds of thousands of 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.610
 thousands of years 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.290
 in that soil where it is that soil that 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.840
 that she now wants to pack 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.360
 large forest were stored in the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.760
 several seeds that I am 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.980
 represented here by these balls or 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.600
 not only is there something that people 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.600
 flame of seed bank 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.380
 So yeah, you do not suffer any more. 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.760
 type of degradation did not see another 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.520
 farmer and want to buy some more 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.280
 or not to vote for more fire or not 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.080
 clean the ground 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.470
 these seeds they will have the chance to 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.250
 germinate and gives rise to plants in the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.480
 of the plants that will one day be 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.070
 this environment 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.650
 so the little puppies of those trees 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.100
 they may germinate and become 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.709
 to reconstitute, there is an order 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.060
 which happens right first go 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:26.070
 germinate the seed of the plants and office 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:30.150
 ie germinate first seeds 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.010
 of the grasses of the bushes, and then 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.370
 of a time in seed germination 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.340
 of larger trees, or other trees 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.290
 plants that are a bug bugs do not be 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.230
 need a certain shading 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.360
 to get then survive 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.750
 feeling is a slow process. 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.670
 but since the soil already exists, it is more 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.920
 faster than the primary succession because 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.049
 our primary selection as we saw it 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.650
 there is a process of ecological succession 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:01.560
 which must produce fertile soil and 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.970
 in secondary succession, we no longer 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.030
 has this problem because the soil is already 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.940
 there already exists a seed bank and the 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.750
 over a few decades in 10 and 30 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.519
 years 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.190
 we can regain a biome 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.040
 climax gradually the birds come back 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.660
 gradually returning animals is 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.880
 clear that they were not extinguished by the 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.590
 Agribusiness Negative Activity 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.900
 agribusiness is personal is a business 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.419
 important is a business that 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.759
 we need it, for the few to 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.580
 food is subsistence, right? 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:38.580
 only that still personal business is made of 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.110
 a way yes very interested 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.310
 need the person simply arrives at the 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.190
 natural environment as if it were 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.930
 nothing and says that it will clean the 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.000
 is cleaning the ground is destroying 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.900
 living beings and is killing the beings 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.550
 alive 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:56.090
 then for the deployment of any 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:59.280
 farm of any hectare of 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.160
 Planting for me anyway, for me, who wants 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.620
 cut grass for the cow to eat needs 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.750
 of a large environmental impact study 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.610
 to see what will happen there you need 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.639
 study to see how you can 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.710
 to correct the environmental damage that you did 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.300
 or at least I do not do anything 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.669
 to compensate for the environmental damage 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.840
 for a crop 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.490
 unfortunately none of this is done today in 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.630
 day and the new forest code 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.510
 Brazilian 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:30.840
 supports environmental crimes, does he mean 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:33.210
 which legalized some forms of finally 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.599
 environmental maintenance is not to say 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.669
 so didi agribusiness that are 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:41.070
 extremely harmful to the environment 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:44.720
 ok so all of this needs to be well 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:49.080
 thought so that we can always achieve 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:52.130
 You sure forest people kiss to you 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.130
 and until the next video
