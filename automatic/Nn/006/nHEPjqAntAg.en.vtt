 grabs the surface and accounts for none 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.849
 just go where you could go 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.869
 again 1 7 6 inches to here too 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.170
 enough to go a long time but you need that is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.600
 Grooming scissors correctly and that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.510
 when working canvas matches 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.969
 worker painting a comb in other words at 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.559
 us while working the bottom by-catch we 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.260
 fixed still eight and when 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.329
 we are doing right this one 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.840
 all space the blade should here 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.539
 ends and then naturally 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.760
 factory in the people 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.190
 minutes i remember i did without applicable 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.129
 why because I had a pair of scissors 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.920
 long-long hairbrush and i set and 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.439
 Immediately spent that is, I immediately 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.200
 it turned out this canvas that is diagonal 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.939
 there must be scissors 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.729
 Well, such scissors works if 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.290
 just do not get to take the necessary 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:26.090
 train muscles 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:29.009
 that's professional so guys and 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.240
 better to be shocked by heard about what how 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.259
 happening everything has become possible to learn 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.360
 hold the scissors and comb 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:43.259
 buy a good expensive normal 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.009
 typewriter and then learn well at all 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.680
 worth learning to do haircuts 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.450
 naturally correct when master 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.670
 the instructor should put the rub like 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.369
 a musician but no masters now 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.070
 there are some instructors 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.990
 charlatans who collect a room for themselves 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.290
 20 50 people show 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.349
 here's a demo haircut 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.810
 there are three days of such seminars there 15 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.630
 Thousands of guys do not need to be assholes buy 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.530

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.160
 scissors and you're faster on videos from 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.550
 youtube and there are thousands of thousands 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:29.280
 learn to meet no cheating no charlatan 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.120
 remember only when offered 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.400
 skills training 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.860
 tool or speaking technical 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.500
 language on the art of working with tools 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.890
 production comes all his shilka and 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.870
 scissors and hairdryer and brasings that's all 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.330
 the rest is obtained by itself on bye 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.519
 you will go to these workshops with 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.860
 diplomas get some kind of incomprehensibility 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.160
 here then you never learn anything 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.299
 so and will break save money 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.930
 buy and good money 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.680
 tool and look for someone who will not be you 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.080
 deceive 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.890
 the author really shows what I 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:13.780
 although I've shown it all 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:16.000
 so whoever wants 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.000
 will train and learn himself 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.170
 quickly will not work naturally here 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.019
 everything is very good 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.900
 on white combs we see those hair 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:29.350
 that need to be clipped but remember again 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.450
 white color white tone happens 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.269
 White then on a comb such that rejoices 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.459
 3 rolls of lighting and this is ivory 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:40.500
 no blue and no glare for any 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:44.140
 lighting and we see that you need to cut 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:49.780
 Well, somehow there is nothing complicated 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:53.200
 as you can see the whole secret is good 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:57.160
 tool depend man is what they give 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.459
 when teaching in schools shitty 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.680
 dough tool master nothing 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.630
 receive for what it is necessary only for 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.069
 order to continue your studies 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.499
 so that even with him 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.909
 and money for refresher courses 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:15.249
 etc. etc. You will be given 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:17.590
 yourself bad certificates kiss pro 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:20.109
 ass got a different compliment just to 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.030
 come but never give good 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.940
 scissors is a good typewriter just because 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.770
 then a freebie will speed you up more 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.080
 why I do not spend the flanks 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.539
 workshops and seminars because i 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.750
 didn't want me a contribution was untwisted or 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.430
 humpback but I now say what is 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.530
 full 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.800
 dry it makes conclusions well so 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:49.090
 will stay with their comes to the road 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.520
 It did not exist as a certain asshole 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.630
 it would spin that's something like 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.210
 further what else is interesting when I teach 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.199
 I 'll see you look 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:05.169
 mask fits like don't start right this 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:08.169
 right there is something pretty here if 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:11.259
 Now here is such a try and now 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:13.180
 so here each is exactly what to do 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.900
 everything will lie will not lie strand 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.780
 heavy 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.419
 in other words, one cut economy class 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.520
 you sauce a visa and come wives even lower before 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.220
 the sky and will keep only 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.699
 If we have made it easier for the hair 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:31.690
 voice clung to hair you can do 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:33.669
 so long that really good worn 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.490
 when the bottom queen of breed and gun 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:39.460
 Damage hair cuts can be added can be 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.370
 on a comb, that's all we need to do 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.220
 take and ease the ends then the hair only 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.830
 one lines another shorter clings to each 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.139
 for a friend and no longer need any styling 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.250
 paid funds 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:57.099
 all as here lies that is here federation 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.409
 will be completely different than those that we 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.940
 so they tried to shave 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.990
 get good 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:08.139
 sending a pair or fence up as per brand 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:11.050
 not a damn thing and start fusion 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.699
 your noise is no your trap here 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.240
 buy normal tools myself 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.240
 shears 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:21.860
 that's the whole alignment 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:27.430
 frets but it seems velv our 6 hung on 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.430
 this lesson is over for now
