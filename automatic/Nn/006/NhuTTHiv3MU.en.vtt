today about partial ligament tears and
in<00:00:22.660> particular<00:00:23.050> using<00:00:23.740> adult<00:00:23.980> stem<00:00:24.100> cells<00:00:24.609> to

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730

in particular using adult stem cells to
treat<00:00:25.029> those<00:00:28.439> first<00:00:29.439> let's<00:00:29.650> discuss<00:00:29.800> what<00:00:30.279> a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
treat those first let's discuss what a

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.759 
treat those first let's discuss what a
ligament<00:00:30.699> is<00:00:31.029> a<00:00:31.539> ligament<00:00:31.900> is<00:00:32.140> nothing<00:00:32.559> more

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:32.769 
ligament is a ligament is nothing more

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.799 
ligament is a ligament is nothing more
than<00:00:32.829> the<00:00:33.219> duct<00:00:33.579> tape<00:00:33.850> that<00:00:34.089> holds<00:00:34.539> bones

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
than the duct tape that holds bones

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.979 
than the duct tape that holds bones
together<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.460> we<00:00:36.609> have<00:00:36.729> a<00:00:36.760> lot<00:00:37.149> of<00:00:37.179> bones<00:00:37.569> as

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
together so we have a lot of bones as

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.599 
together so we have a lot of bones as
you<00:00:38.109> might<00:00:38.260> imagine<00:00:38.379> we<00:00:38.769> have<00:00:38.799> a<00:00:38.920> lot<00:00:39.219> of<00:00:39.249> duct

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
you might imagine we have a lot of duct

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:41.399 
you might imagine we have a lot of duct
tape<00:00:39.699> or<00:00:40.059> a<00:00:40.089> lot<00:00:40.329> of<00:00:40.449> ligaments<00:00:40.960> that<00:00:41.019> hold

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:41.409 
tape or a lot of ligaments that hold

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:46.279 
tape or a lot of ligaments that hold
them<00:00:41.739> together<00:00:42.449> ligaments<00:00:43.449> allow<00:00:43.899> us<00:00:44.289> to<00:00:44.829> have

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
them together ligaments allow us to have

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.979 
them together ligaments allow us to have
sort<00:00:47.289> of<00:00:47.350> a<00:00:47.469> final<00:00:47.889> endpoint<00:00:48.819> of<00:00:49.059> stability<00:00:49.569> in

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
sort of a final endpoint of stability in

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.379 
sort of a final endpoint of stability in
that<00:00:50.170> joint<00:00:50.530> before<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.729> joint<00:00:51.969> would<00:00:52.149> fall

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:52.389 
that joint before the joint would fall

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:54.539 
that joint before the joint would fall
apart<00:00:52.809> so<00:00:53.440> ligaments<00:00:53.829> are<00:00:53.920> very<00:00:54.249> very

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:54.549 
apart so ligaments are very very

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:57.329 
apart so ligaments are very very
important<00:00:55.149> we<00:00:55.329> use<00:00:55.539> them<00:00:55.719> all<00:00:55.899> the<00:00:55.929> time<00:00:56.139> as<00:00:56.739> we

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
important we use them all the time as we

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.059 
important we use them all the time as we
stress<00:00:57.639> our<00:00:57.819> joints<00:00:58.209> and<00:00:58.359> do<00:00:58.449> various<00:00:58.779> things

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069 
stress our joints and do various things

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:01.590 
stress our joints and do various things
there's<00:01:00.069> sort<00:01:00.190> of<00:01:00.249> a<00:01:00.369> last<00:01:00.609> line<00:01:00.999> of<00:01:01.059> defense

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
there's sort of a last line of defense

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.320 
there's sort of a last line of defense
and<00:01:01.959> also<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:02.589> way<00:01:02.859> for<00:01:02.889> the<00:01:03.190> joint<00:01:03.489> to<00:01:03.760> align

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
and also a way for the joint to align

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.709 
and also a way for the joint to align

itself passively going to talk today
about<00:01:10.840> ankle<00:01:11.590> ligaments<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.189> a<00:01:12.280> partial<00:01:12.729> tear

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
about ankle ligaments and a partial tear

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.410 
about ankle ligaments and a partial tear
in<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.149> ankle<00:01:13.479> ligaments<00:01:13.930> as<00:01:14.049> an<00:01:14.170> example<00:01:14.680> of

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
in the ankle ligaments as an example of

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.149 
in the ankle ligaments as an example of
how<00:01:16.420> ligament<00:01:16.899> tears<00:01:17.140> can<00:01:17.439> be<00:01:17.530> healed<00:01:17.950> without

how ligament tears can be healed without

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.569 
how ligament tears can be healed without
surgery<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:20.380> there's<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:20.649> 32<00:01:21.100> year<00:01:21.250> old<00:01:21.310> white

used to localize the exact area that we

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.430 
used to localize the exact area that we
were<00:02:32.920> going<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.280> treat<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.880> then<00:02:34.630> an<00:02:34.959> x-ray

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
were going to treat and then an x-ray

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.920 
were going to treat and then an x-ray
was<00:02:35.650> used<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.220> guide<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.910> needle<00:02:37.330> into<00:02:37.630> that

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
a walking boot that did not occur here

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.110 
a walking boot that did not occur here
this<00:03:14.170> was<00:03:14.350> simply<00:03:14.560> an<00:03:14.799> injection<00:03:15.459> of<00:03:15.610> her<00:03:15.850> own

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
this was simply an injection of her own

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.720 
this was simply an injection of her own
adult<00:03:16.600> stem<00:03:16.900> cells<00:03:17.260> into<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:18.340> ligament

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
adult stem cells into this ligament

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.990 
adult stem cells into this ligament
under<00:03:19.769> fluoroscopy<00:03:20.769> so<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.459> very<00:03:21.700> specific

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
under fluoroscopy so a very specific

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.160 
under fluoroscopy so a very specific
placement<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:23.079> those<00:03:23.230> cells

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.300 

so<00:03:29.170> you<00:03:29.260> can<00:03:29.409> see<00:03:29.650> here<00:03:30.099> picture<00:03:31.560> this<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:33.129> is

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
so you can see here picture this this is

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.039 
so you can see here picture this this is
the<00:03:33.459> side<00:03:33.879> of<00:03:33.909> the<00:03:34.150> ankle<00:03:34.480> we're<00:03:34.629> talking

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
the side of the ankle we're talking

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.319 
the side of the ankle we're talking
about<00:03:35.290> I've<00:03:35.590> drawn<00:03:36.340> in<00:03:36.549> there<00:03:36.819> the<00:03:37.060> side<00:03:37.299> of

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
about I've drawn in there the side of

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.569 
about I've drawn in there the side of
the<00:03:37.510> ankle<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:38.650> is<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.980> ligament<00:03:39.459> we're

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
the ankle this is the ligament we're

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.119 
the ankle this is the ligament we're
talking<00:03:40.030> about<00:03:40.120> that<00:03:40.959> I've<00:03:41.049> highlighted<00:03:41.470> here

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
talking about that I've highlighted here

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.630 
talking about that I've highlighted here
in<00:03:42.159> yellow<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:43.709> that's<00:03:44.709> called<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.310> tail<00:03:45.610> of

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
in yellow and that's called the tail of

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.430 
in yellow and that's called the tail of
fibrillar<00:03:46.090> ligament<00:03:46.780> it's<00:03:46.930> one<00:03:47.079> of<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.200> major

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
fibrillar ligament it's one of the major

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.009 
fibrillar ligament it's one of the major
ligaments<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.159> helps<00:03:48.579> to<00:03:48.730> hold<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.690> side<00:03:49.989> of

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
ligaments that helps to hold the side of

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:56.190 
ligaments that helps to hold the side of
the<00:03:50.349> ankle<00:03:50.530> together<00:03:54.090> so<00:03:55.090> we<00:03:55.209> can<00:03:55.359> see<00:03:55.599> here

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
the ankle together so we can see here

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.679 
the ankle together so we can see here
the<00:03:56.560> regenexx<00:03:56.980> procedure<00:03:57.459> was<00:03:57.760> used<00:03:58.150> to<00:03:58.359> treat

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:58.689 
the regenexx procedure was used to treat

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:04.470 
the regenexx procedure was used to treat
this<00:04:00.090> terror<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.890> white<00:04:03.700> dashed<00:04:04.090> circle

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
this terror and the white dashed circle

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.210 
this terror and the white dashed circle
there<00:04:04.930> shows<00:04:05.379> the<00:04:05.620> tail<00:04:05.859> of<00:04:05.889> fibrillar

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
there shows the tail of fibrillar

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.309 
there shows the tail of fibrillar
ligament<00:04:06.909> now<00:04:07.389> what<00:04:07.569> you<00:04:07.659> can<00:04:07.690> see<00:04:08.079> is<00:04:08.200> the

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
ligament now what you can see is the

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.770 
ligament now what you can see is the
ligament<00:04:08.799> fibers<00:04:09.340> are<00:04:09.549> bent<00:04:09.849> they<00:04:10.120> form<00:04:10.510> sort

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
ligament fibers are bent they form sort

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.289 
ligament fibers are bent they form sort
of<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.900> shallow<00:04:11.170> V<00:04:11.620> there<00:04:11.950> you<00:04:12.579> can<00:04:12.730> see<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:13.000> top

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
of a shallow V there you can see the top

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.930 
of a shallow V there you can see the top
row<00:04:13.599> of<00:04:13.629> fibers<00:04:14.319> really<00:04:14.620> doesn't<00:04:14.980> exist<00:04:15.430> it's

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
row of fibers really doesn't exist it's

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.719 
row of fibers really doesn't exist it's
been<00:04:16.209> torn<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:17.590> can<00:04:17.739> see<00:04:17.889> three<00:04:18.160> months<00:04:18.430> after

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
been torn you can see three months after

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.430 
been torn you can see three months after
the<00:04:18.820> procedure<00:04:18.970> here<00:04:19.630> on<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.870> picture<00:04:20.229> on<00:04:20.380> the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
the procedure here on the picture on the

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.640 
the procedure here on the picture on the
right<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:22.000> top<00:04:22.270> row<00:04:22.720> of<00:04:23.080> that<00:04:23.410> has

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
right that the top row of that has

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.200 
right that the top row of that has
regrown<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:26.220> lower<00:04:27.220> fibers<00:04:27.970> are<00:04:28.090> no

regrown and the lower fibers are no

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.409 
regrown and the lower fibers are no
longer<00:04:28.449> like<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:28.780> V<00:04:29.139> which<00:04:29.470> is<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:29.650> good<00:04:29.889> thing<00:04:30.419> so

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
longer like a V which is a good thing so

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.689 
longer like a V which is a good thing so
essentially<00:04:31.990> MRI<00:04:32.590> evidence<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:33.430> this

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
essentially MRI evidence that this

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.990 
essentially MRI evidence that this
ligament<00:04:34.349> partial<00:04:35.349> tear<00:04:35.680> have<00:04:36.310> been<00:04:36.520> repaired

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
ligament partial tear have been repaired

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.270 
ligament partial tear have been repaired
by<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.240> stem<00:04:37.539> cells<00:04:37.840> she<00:04:38.560> also<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.830> complete

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
by the stem cells she also a complete

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.820 
by the stem cells she also a complete
relief<00:04:39.669> of<00:04:39.970> her<00:04:40.360> lateral<00:04:40.780> ankle<00:04:41.050> pain<00:04:41.440> and

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
relief of her lateral ankle pain and

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.760 
relief of her lateral ankle pain and
regained<00:04:42.419> much<00:04:43.419> reactivity<00:04:44.110> start<00:04:44.410> working

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
regained much reactivity start working

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.500 
regained much reactivity start working
out<00:04:44.919> again<00:04:44.949> and<00:04:45.580> doing<00:04:45.699> a<00:04:45.849> lot<00:04:45.940> of<00:04:46.060> things<00:04:46.270> that

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
out again and doing a lot of things that

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.620 
out again and doing a lot of things that
used<00:04:46.750> to<00:04:46.810> enjoy<00:04:47.400> previously<00:04:51.030> so<00:04:52.030> this<00:04:52.510> is<00:04:52.599> a

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
used to enjoy previously so this is a

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.560 
used to enjoy previously so this is a
good<00:04:52.780> example<00:04:52.870> how<00:04:53.710> adult<00:04:54.220> stem<00:04:54.520> cells<00:04:54.849> can<00:04:55.389> be

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
good example how adult stem cells can be

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.820 
good example how adult stem cells can be
used<00:04:56.080> to<00:04:56.830> repair<00:04:57.310> partial<00:04:58.060> ligament<00:04:58.479> tears

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
used to repair partial ligament tears

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.960 
used to repair partial ligament tears
probably<00:04:59.830> the<00:04:59.889> most<00:05:00.010> important<00:05:00.580> thing<00:05:00.729> about

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
probably the most important thing about

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.879 
probably the most important thing about
this<00:05:01.270> is<00:05:01.539> that<00:05:01.630> we're<00:05:01.960> not<00:05:01.990> just<00:05:02.289> discussing

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
this is that we're not just discussing

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.980 
this is that we're not just discussing
ankle<00:05:03.220> ligaments<00:05:03.699> here<00:05:03.970> we're<00:05:04.510> also<00:05:04.630> talking

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
ankle ligaments here we're also talking

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.370 
ankle ligaments here we're also talking
about<00:05:05.229> partial<00:05:05.770> ACL<00:05:06.400> tears<00:05:06.729> and<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.030> knee<00:05:07.380> AC

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
about partial ACL tears and the knee AC

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.370 
about partial ACL tears and the knee AC
joint<00:05:09.150> ligament<00:05:10.150> tears<00:05:10.449> in<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.870> shoulder

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
joint ligament tears in the shoulder

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.189 
joint ligament tears in the shoulder
elbow<00:05:12.130> ligament<00:05:12.610> tears<00:05:13.120> and<00:05:13.419> other<00:05:13.570> ligaments

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
elbow ligament tears and other ligaments

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.760 
elbow ligament tears and other ligaments
so<00:05:14.440> where<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.550> ligament<00:05:15.909> is<00:05:16.000> located<00:05:16.479> is<00:05:16.539> not

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
so where the ligament is located is not

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.270 
so where the ligament is located is not
as<00:05:17.770> important<00:05:18.580> as<00:05:19.020> how<00:05:20.020> we<00:05:20.080> get<00:05:20.470> cells<00:05:20.889> to<00:05:21.130> that

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
as important as how we get cells to that

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.360 
as important as how we get cells to that
