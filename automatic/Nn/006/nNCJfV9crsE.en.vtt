 subscribers 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.470
 today there are very fine indeed 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.660
 I show here how to got a nice 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.740
 a game in run or maintain or 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.630
 anything else can play 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.450
 But today I will show this first 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.720
 horny it is then actually plays 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.340
 This horny one in running mode is that 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.170
 then 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.870
 then there are the alternative modes and there 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.690
 one finds that then plays one week 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.370
 in the running so there one can under options 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.920
 then also choose the weapon who 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.870
 one in the loft does not know one is fast 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.930
 the corner data out again works 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.480
 everyone has a ball in the running was the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.560
 name already says down there knife 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.760
 no grenades no extras janisch and 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.770
 of course you have to use this weapon 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.720
 try to tell the opponents if you 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.180
 the enemy shoots you get one 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.729
 new ball if you have the opponent mesz 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.770
 Do you still have the first ball from the beginning? 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.320
 and get one more to speak to her 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.329
 have two if you have your one google 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.100
 you have no other 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.859
 you have to dial so you can do it again 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.810
 you can still get a ball here 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:22.810
 Setting different life 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.740
 who survives last and most 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:32.689
 you get points per child 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.139
 and afterwards a survival bonus 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.780
 Blablabla tries it out 

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:39.710
 who wins what it looks like now is 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.880
 long chat 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.700
 here you can get all the weapons 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.689
 choose totally cool I have a yes 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.240
 a few different things 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.539
 put together just look at you 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.130
 and have fun with it 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.990
 I hope everyone has the weir 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.549
 reasonably we would like to lay too 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.380
 Immediately going on that's about here 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.279
 standard as I said there can be 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.020
 choose weapons 

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:01.520
 I have now taken a python 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.990
 instead of hailing the sand that is the case 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.170
 the standard weapon is good for me 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.399
 a bit braver says I want too 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.300
 already improved again already runs 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.399
 back home astra 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.610
 I do not have a whole game here now 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.080
 uploaded but just just like that 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.280
 a few moments 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.380
 yes yes both shot the bullets 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.560
 have to knife so I do not know if you 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.470
 the game knows in black ops, there was the 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.840
 you could just play it online 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.270
 Unfortunately, this is no longer possible 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.830
 So to play it against strangers 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.240
 I do not want to go that often anymore 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.250
 here you have to be against friends 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.800
 play but that's cool you can do that 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.410
 do with action and play as well 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.950
 and you can set it all free 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.790
 I think that's how it looks now 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.600
 that's already on 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.150
 here is our current one in progress 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.550
 the javelin will make them rain 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.820
 and people, I made you real 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.280
 Giant without so if you somehow 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.060
 Healthy used channel comments around you 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.980
 to find here 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.240
 on the different platforms it 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.450
 makes really bock 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.450
 they have since yesterday who believes 99 or 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.370
 played eight people and we knew each other 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.690
 not everyone, not everyone 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.100
 can you have a few and then we have 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.530
 Just hang out here together 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.570
 met and did cate under it 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.850
 really fun 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.700
 believe it or not have next week 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.410
 we'll soon see the rocket launcher smb or 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.640
 something like that hattingen 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.040
 you see , I would go all the way 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.250
 strip munich fly this little 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.980
 plane as I said makes right 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.500
 I can only really make a mood 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.290
 Recommend 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:51.100
 yes funny pants and get discount 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:54.310
 yes, well, every time so the weapons 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.260
 are a bit stronger than in 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.880
 normal mode I say except the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.800
 rocket launcher this relatively weak 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.850
 I have a whole lot left 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.900
 play a whole one in running play 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:10.330
 with the good pump model 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.220
 already since 1987 or something like that 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.320
 well you will know how the 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.030
 old threshing machine means so has 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.920
 here in the incredible reach i 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.560
 do not know why they did that 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.270
 but you can go right through it 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.730
 the defy against we have the way, the 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.840
 hardcore mode set as you can see 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.280
 one does not hold a radar and nothing that can 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.470
 you can also choose one 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.470
 Although has a lot of choices 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.590
 So I can only really do that for you 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.380
 recommend to load each other 1 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.680

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.680

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.920

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.330

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.920
 subscribers are now 42 at night 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.540
 properly word of mouth here 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.110
 I do not write on the 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.220
 all other channels of commercials that 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.930
 people do not want that when with me 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.670
 a commercial wants to write on it makes 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.890
 the does not bother me as much as the out 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.150
 so thanks again for the whole 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.050
 Praise you can say that 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.580
 Praise possibilities 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.260
 yes, I already have a few new ones 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.580
 questions but I believe I do 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:50.130
 of it days of day two videos are already 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.660
 good things here 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.080
 that's how we see it here, by the way 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.750
 this game I said another six 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.860
 play her with new life 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.390
 Of course I have here now, unfortunately 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.190
 not the indication how much lives however 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.320
 it is over betrayed 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.530
 will relax afterwards after two fight 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.910
 between me and the lohkamp tobias the 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.930
 not every whole game quite nice 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.980
 Annoyed it will be exciting I will 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.900
 later 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.550
 turn into the third perspective 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:23.170
 so you can see each other like us 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:26.860
 hunt because you are shooting your new life 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.450
 yes, then you can only 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.700
 Every poor armor has me watching 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.560
 they really do see part of it 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.570
 formula starts but he has seen me 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.310
 I'm already being followed but says 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.680
 nothing to refuse in the bunker from the 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.270
 bunker he in the bunker I think 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.560
 Are you waiting for him ? 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:46.870
 I thought I was fine 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.180
 very much wish story but that is 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.830
 not so much my last life yet 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.200
 Of course I take everything for that now 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.920
 again anticipate you come spectators booms 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:59.290
 the episode shoots over so now 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.970
 we both still have a life completely or 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:04.630
 I think I even came after two 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:06.820
 So it's completely buddy in any case 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:10.530
 is it really great i can only 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:13.960
 Repeated warned Martin Klett AG 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.700
 here it comes to the showdown you can see the 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.920
 Of course, pump has a completely different one 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:23.110
 reach as in normal game but yes 

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.370
 scalzo no need to pull a piece 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.530
 Just follow the snout 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.600
 shoot around somehow you meet there 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.070
 always so it makes really bock people if 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.360
 you like this maximum yet 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.360
 simple game video skin 3
