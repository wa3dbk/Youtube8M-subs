would hope a saudi-led flashes kind of
dim<00:06:48.210> and<00:06:48.509> it<00:06:48.930> doesn't<00:06:49.169> really<00:06:49.289> provide<00:06:49.560> as

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
dim and it doesn't really provide as

dim and it doesn't really provide as
much<00:06:50.789> light<00:06:51.090> output<00:06:51.570> as<00:06:51.780> we<00:06:52.259> would<00:06:52.440> like<00:06:52.650> but

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
much light output as we would like but

much light output as we would like but
overall<00:06:53.190> it's<00:06:53.400> a<00:06:53.520> pretty<00:06:53.550> decent<00:06:54.180> update<00:06:54.509> from
