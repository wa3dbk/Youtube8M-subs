00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the camera on and working first thing

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.749 
the camera on and working first thing
you<00:01:28.080> will<00:01:28.170> need<00:01:28.289> to<00:01:28.440> do<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.890> decide<00:01:29.550> what

recording format you want to use there

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.680 
recording format you want to use there
are<00:01:32.490> three<00:01:32.700> things<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.090> consider<00:01:33.479> when

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
are three things to consider when

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.109 
are three things to consider when
choosing<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:34.140> recording<00:01:34.649> format

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
choosing your recording format

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.130 
choosing your recording format
frames-per-second<00:01:36.149> resolution<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
frames-per-second resolution and

what does all that mean

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.969 
what does all that mean
well<00:01:42.479> frames<00:01:42.810> per<00:01:43.049> second<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.650> amount<00:01:43.710> of

next thing that you want to set is the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.130 
next thing that you want to set is the
shutter<00:02:38.610> speed<00:02:38.790> press<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.780> shutter<00:02:39.930> speed

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
shutter speed press the shutter speed

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.470 
shutter speed press the shutter speed
plus<00:02:40.590> or<00:02:40.860> minus<00:02:41.190> button<00:02:41.489> until<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.030> camera<00:02:42.360> is

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
at the shutter speed you want keep in

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.220 
at the shutter speed you want keep in
mind<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.150> shutter<00:02:45.360> speed<00:02:45.510> has<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> direct

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
mind that the shutter speed has a direct

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.900 
mind that the shutter speed has a direct
relation<00:02:46.680> with<00:02:46.709> how<00:02:47.100> much<00:02:47.250> light<00:02:47.519> is<00:02:47.699> went

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
relation with how much light is went

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.650 
relation with how much light is went
into<00:02:48.120> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
into the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.420 
into the
so<00:02:48.960> if<00:02:49.080> you're<00:02:49.230> using<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.650> fast<00:02:49.890> shutter<00:02:50.100> speed

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
so if you're using a fast shutter speed

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.490 
so if you're using a fast shutter speed
you<00:02:50.850> will<00:02:50.970> have<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.300> make<00:02:51.450> up<00:02:51.630> for<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.960> by<00:02:52.290> using

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
you will have to make up for it by using

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.490 
you will have to make up for it by using
a<00:02:52.770> wider<00:02:53.040> f-stop<00:02:53.550> later<00:02:53.870> are<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.080> ready<00:02:55.290> to

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500
