00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
look sure what it does are they go see

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.170 
look sure what it does are they go see
see<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.770> distracts<00:03:00.370> them<00:03:00.520> if<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.760> go<00:03:00.910> near<00:03:01.120> it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
see it distracts them if you go near it

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.430 
see it distracts them if you go near it
they<00:03:01.390> start<00:03:01.630> attacking<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:02.110> instead<00:03:02.350> of

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
they start attacking that instead of

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.170 
they start attacking that instead of
attacking<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.980> so<00:03:03.520> it's<00:03:03.640> kind<00:03:03.880> of<00:03:04.000> like<00:03:04.060> a

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
attacking you so it's kind of like a

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.690 
attacking you so it's kind of like a
lifeline<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.050> then<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.100> get<00:03:06.250> something<00:03:06.550> like

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
lifeline and then you get something like

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.730 
lifeline and then you get something like
this<00:03:06.850> by<00:03:07.390> destroying<00:03:07.600> them<00:03:08.080> but<00:03:08.590> that's

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
this by destroying them but that's

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.730 
this by destroying them but that's
basically<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:09.480> I'm<00:03:10.480> gonna<00:03:10.660> do<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.900> few<00:03:11.260> more<00:03:11.440> or

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
basically it I'm gonna do a few more or

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.200 
basically it I'm gonna do a few more or
