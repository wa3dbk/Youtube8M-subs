00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
hey everyone today we're going to talk

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.290 
hey everyone today we're going to talk
about<00:00:08.940> how<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.840> change<00:00:10.770> chords<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:12.180> is

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
about how to change chords and this is

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.310 
about how to change chords and this is
more<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.510> a<00:00:12.660> lesson<00:00:13.020> for<00:00:13.290> beginners<00:00:14.330> who<00:00:15.330> have

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
more of a lesson for beginners who have

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.460 
more of a lesson for beginners who have
just<00:00:16.619> learned<00:00:16.890> how<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.580> play<00:00:18.110> G<00:00:19.550> C<00:00:20.550> D<00:00:21.259> a<00:00:22.880> minor<00:00:23.880> a

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
just learned how to play G C D a minor a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.950 
just learned how to play G C D a minor a
major<00:00:26.060> e-minor<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:28.310> in<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.820> lot<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.000> cases<00:00:30.270> what

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
major e-minor and in a lot of cases what

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.870 
major e-minor and in a lot of cases what
I<00:00:30.989> see<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.590> with<00:00:32.070> students<00:00:32.460> who<00:00:32.550> are<00:00:32.669> just

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
I see with with students who are just

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.850 
I see with with students who are just
learning<00:00:33.090> some<00:00:33.450> chords<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.200> they<00:00:34.800> can

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
learning some chords is that they can

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.160 
learning some chords is that they can
play<00:00:35.130> each<00:00:35.310> chord<00:00:35.610> individually<00:00:36.239> but

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
play each chord individually but

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.590 
play each chord individually but
changing<00:00:37.649> between<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.129> chords<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.850> difficult

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
changing between the chords is difficult

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.830 
changing between the chords is difficult
and<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.410> makes<00:00:40.590> sense<00:00:40.739> because<00:00:41.629> most<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.719> these

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
and it makes sense because most of these

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.750 
and it makes sense because most of these
chords<00:00:43.260> require<00:00:43.739> us<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.039> be<00:00:44.280> doing<00:00:44.550> something

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
chords require us to be doing something

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.119 
chords require us to be doing something
with<00:00:45.059> three<00:00:45.539> fingers<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.500> change<00:00:46.739> from<00:00:46.980> one

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
with three fingers so to change from one

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.950 
with three fingers so to change from one
chord<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.399> another<00:00:47.539> means<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.839> to

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
chord to another means that we have to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.380 
chord to another means that we have to
have<00:00:49.559> three<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.070> our<00:00:50.190> fingers<00:00:50.460> going<00:00:51.179> in

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
have three of our fingers going in

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.479 
have three of our fingers going in
different<00:00:51.539> directions<00:00:51.750> at<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.949> same<00:00:53.100> time

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
different directions at the same time

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.599 
different directions at the same time
and<00:00:53.730> that's<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.750> very<00:00:55.050> easy<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:56.550> I'm

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
and that's not very easy but what I'm

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.569 
and that's not very easy but what I'm
going<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.760> show<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:56.999> here<00:00:57.269> is<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.480> way<00:00:57.839> to<00:00:58.579> break

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
going to show you here is a way to break

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.669 
going to show you here is a way to break
down<00:00:59.789> these<00:00:59.999> chord<00:01:00.300> changes<00:01:00.749> into<00:01:01.530> their

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
down these chord changes into their

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.560 
down these chord changes into their
individual<00:01:02.219> parts<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.699> then<00:01:02.789> build<00:01:03.120> each<00:01:03.329> one

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
individual parts and then build each one

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.380 
individual parts and then build each one
of<00:01:03.600> them<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.989> into<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:05.190> full<00:01:05.850> chord<00:01:06.120> change

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
of them up into a full chord change

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.380 
of them up into a full chord change
which<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.170> help<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> get<00:01:07.710> better<00:01:08.390> very

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
which can help you to get better very

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.170 
which can help you to get better very
very<00:01:09.630> quickly<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.250> not<00:01:11.250> get<00:01:11.580> yourself<00:01:11.910> into<00:01:12.090> a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
very quickly and not get yourself into a

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.970 
very quickly and not get yourself into a
situation<00:01:12.360> where<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.410> try<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.770> change

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
situation where you try and change

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.250 
situation where you try and change
chords<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.820> lift<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.240> up<00:01:15.300> and<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:15.810> your

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
chords and you lift one up and then your

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.780 
chords and you lift one up and then your
hand<00:01:16.440> freaks<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:16.890> because<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.490> really

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
hand freaks out because it really

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.450 
hand freaks out because it really
doesn't<00:01:18.270> know<00:01:18.390> where<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.110> going<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.740> let's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
doesn't know where it's going so let's

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.760 
doesn't know where it's going so let's
take<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.760> look<00:01:21.060> at<00:01:22.310> switching<00:01:23.310> from<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.030> G<00:01:24.270> chord

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
take a look at switching from a G chord

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.950 
take a look at switching from a G chord
to<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:26.100> D<00:01:26.820> chord<00:01:29.120> so<00:01:30.120> this<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.870> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
to a D chord so this is one of the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.610 
to a D chord so this is one of the
fingerings<00:01:31.440> of<00:01:31.650> G<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.140> do<00:01:34.260> with<00:01:34.440> any

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
fingerings of G and you can do with any

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.140 
fingerings of G and you can do with any
eat<00:01:34.800> anything<00:01:35.190> green<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.610> want<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.910> can<00:01:36.030> do

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
eat anything green you want you can do

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.540 
eat anything green you want you can do
with<00:01:36.330> this<00:01:36.450> one<00:01:36.690> if<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.930> want<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.430> with<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
third finger and the pinkie but most

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.050 
third finger and the pinkie but most
people<00:01:42.630> start<00:01:42.780> out<00:01:42.930> learning<00:01:43.620> this<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:44.130> where

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
people start out learning this one where

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.270 
people start out learning this one where
we've<00:01:45.210> got<00:01:45.390> our<00:01:45.630> second<00:01:46.200> finger<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.010> third

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
first string and then we want to go to a

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.150 
first string and then we want to go to a
D<00:01:59.610> chord<00:01:59.910> which<00:02:00.720> is<00:02:00.900> first<00:02:01.170> finger<00:02:01.470> finger<00:02:01.950> on

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
D chord which is first finger finger on

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.000 
D chord which is first finger finger on
the<00:02:02.370> second<00:02:03.030> fret<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.390> 3rd<00:02:03.690> string<00:02:04.010> third

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
the second fret of the 3rd string third

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.340 
the second fret of the 3rd string third
finger<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.880> third<00:02:06.120> fret<00:02:06.150> of<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.690> second

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
finger on the third fret of the second

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.130 
finger on the third fret of the second

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.220 

so<00:02:15.060> that's<00:02:15.239> what<00:02:15.390> going<00:02:15.540> back<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:15.959> forth

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
so that's what going back and forth

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.070 
so that's what going back and forth
between<00:02:16.440> these<00:02:16.739> two<00:02:16.950> chords<00:02:17.280> looks<00:02:17.489> like<00:02:18.080> but

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
between these two chords looks like but

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.420 
between these two chords looks like but
if<00:02:19.200> we<00:02:19.290> want<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.590> break<00:02:19.739> it<00:02:19.770> down<00:02:20.069> especially

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
if we want to break it down especially

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.229 
if we want to break it down especially
for<00:02:21.390> beginners<00:02:22.230> who<00:02:22.709> want<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.970> learn<00:02:23.970> how<00:02:24.030> to

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
for beginners who want to learn how to

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.360 
for beginners who want to learn how to
start<00:02:24.510> getting<00:02:24.660> from<00:02:24.959> chord<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.260> chord<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.739> to

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
start getting from chord to chord is to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.699 
start getting from chord to chord is to
look<00:02:26.520> at<00:02:26.760> where<00:02:27.209> each<00:02:27.510> individual<00:02:28.260> finger

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
look at where each individual finger

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.300 
look at where each individual finger
needs<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.700> go<00:02:29.849> so<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:31.080> start<00:02:31.920> with<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.160> first

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
needs to go so I start with the first

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.740 
needs to go so I start with the first
finger<00:02:33.410> it's<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.739> second<00:02:35.099> fret<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.459> the

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
finger it's on the second fret of the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.800 
finger it's on the second fret of the
fifth<00:02:36.750> string<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.230> if<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.160> want<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.519> change

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
fifth string and if I want to change

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.240 
fifth string and if I want to change
just<00:02:39.810> my<00:02:39.959> first<00:02:40.230> finger<00:02:40.500> from<00:02:40.830> where<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.099> needs

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
just my first finger from where it needs

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.830 
just my first finger from where it needs
to<00:02:41.340> be<00:02:41.430> for<00:02:41.670> G<00:02:41.880> chord<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.390> where<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.599> needs<00:02:42.660> to

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
to be for G chord to where it needs to

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.870 
to be for G chord to where it needs to

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.760 
second string for a D chord and you
don't<00:03:41.640> have<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.880> put<00:03:42.030> your<00:03:42.180> fingers<00:03:42.510> away<00:03:42.810> I'm

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
don't have to put your fingers away I'm

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.590 
don't have to put your fingers away I'm
kind<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.490> putting<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.820> place<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.210> can<00:03:45.390> see

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
kind of putting the place you can see

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.960 
kind of putting the place you can see
what<00:03:45.810> what<00:03:46.800> might<00:03:46.980> what<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.550> individual

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
what what might what the individual

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.570 
what what might what the individual
fingers<00:03:48.180> doing<00:03:48.660> that's<00:03:48.810> spreading<00:03:49.050> the<00:03:49.200> notes

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
fingers doing that's spreading the notes

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.250 
fingers doing that's spreading the notes
so<00:03:50.580> your<00:03:51.150> hand<00:03:51.510> would<00:03:51.630> probably<00:03:51.930> look<00:03:52.020> more

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
so your hand would probably look more

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:01.790 
so your hand would probably look more
like<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:58.940> so<00:03:59.940> here<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.240> is<00:04:00.530> within<00:04:01.530> the

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
like this so here it is within the

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.040 
like this so here it is within the
chords<00:04:05.000> now<00:04:06.000> once<00:04:06.480> you're<00:04:06.630> comfortable<00:04:06.750> with

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
that you can move up to combinations of

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.590 
that you can move up to combinations of
two<00:04:09.510> fingers<00:04:10.170> at<00:04:10.320> a<00:04:10.350> time<00:04:10.590> so<00:04:11.430> my<00:04:12.000> first<00:04:12.300> and

gets most people because you have to
move<00:05:05.969> your<00:05:06.029> fingers<00:05:06.539> in<00:05:06.810> opposite<00:05:07.590> directions

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
move your fingers in opposite directions

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.769 
move your fingers in opposite directions
so<00:05:09.090> my<00:05:09.210> third<00:05:09.479> finger<00:05:09.779> needs<00:05:10.469> to<00:05:10.650> extend<00:05:11.159> my

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:11.779 
so my third finger needs to extend my

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:15.860 
so my third finger needs to extend my
second<00:05:12.779> finger<00:05:12.960> needs<00:05:13.889> to<00:05:14.069> flex<00:05:14.749> so<00:05:15.749> I'm

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
second finger needs to flex so I'm

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.510 
second finger needs to flex so I'm
really<00:05:16.020> going<00:05:16.439> from<00:05:16.770> this<00:05:17.430> to<00:05:17.759> this<00:05:18.569> and

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
really going from this to this and

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.459 
really going from this to this and
that's<00:05:20.520> that's<00:05:21.270> kind<00:05:21.539> of<00:05:21.599> a<00:05:21.689> difficult<00:05:21.870> motion

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:22.469 
that's that's kind of a difficult motion

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:24.140 
that's that's kind of a difficult motion
for<00:05:23.159> people<00:05:23.520> who<00:05:23.610> have<00:05:23.699> never<00:05:23.789> played<00:05:23.969> the

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
for people who have never played the

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.709 
for people who have never played the
guitar<00:05:24.240> before<00:05:24.539> but<00:05:25.409> if<00:05:25.650> you<00:05:26.039> take<00:05:26.330> the<00:05:27.330> extra

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719 
guitar before but if you take the extra

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:30.439 
guitar before but if you take the extra
finger<00:05:28.229> out<00:05:28.979> of<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.490> equation<00:05:29.759> for<00:05:29.999> a<00:05:30.210> while

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
finger out of the equation for a while

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:37.089 
finger out of the equation for a while
at<00:05:30.689> least<00:05:30.719> you<00:05:31.110> can<00:05:31.289> isolate<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:32.729> motion<00:05:34.789> and

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
at least you can isolate the motion and

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:39.649 
at least you can isolate the motion and
you<00:05:38.099> can<00:05:38.219> even<00:05:38.339> go<00:05:38.550> so<00:05:38.729> far<00:05:38.759> as<00:05:38.999> to<00:05:39.120> move<00:05:39.419> one

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
you can even go so far as to move one

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.929 
you can even go so far as to move one
finger<00:05:39.839> at<00:05:40.020> a<00:05:40.139> time<00:05:40.400> so<00:05:41.400> I'm<00:05:41.490> going<00:05:41.520> to<00:05:41.639> take<00:05:41.759> my

00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:41.939 
finger at a time so I'm going to take my

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:43.249 
finger at a time so I'm going to take my
second<00:05:42.300> finger<00:05:42.419> and<00:05:42.629> move<00:05:42.749> it<00:05:42.900> and<00:05:43.050> then<00:05:43.169> i'm

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
second finger and move it and then i'm

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.040 
second finger and move it and then i'm
taking<00:05:43.289> my<00:05:43.529> third<00:05:43.710> finger<00:05:43.889> and<00:05:44.099> move<00:05:44.219> it<00:05:44.400> i<00:05:45.050> can

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
taking my third finger and move it i can

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.360 
taking my third finger and move it i can
reverse<00:05:46.289> it<00:05:46.439> if<00:05:46.499> i<00:05:46.620> want<00:05:46.800> to<00:05:46.919> i'm<00:05:47.069> taking<00:05:47.310> my

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
reverse it if i want to i'm taking my

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.469 
reverse it if i want to i'm taking my
third<00:05:47.550> finger<00:05:47.759> and<00:05:47.969> move<00:05:48.089> it<00:05:48.240> then<00:05:48.360> i'm<00:05:48.449> taking

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
third finger and move it then i'm taking

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.129 
third finger and move it then i'm taking
my<00:05:48.719> second<00:05:49.050> finger<00:05:49.169> and<00:05:49.379> move<00:05:49.529> it<00:05:49.650> and<00:05:51.020> as<00:05:52.020> you

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
my second finger and move it and as you

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:53.779 
my second finger and move it and as you
get<00:05:52.289> better<00:05:52.439> at<00:05:52.589> doing<00:05:52.830> those<00:05:53.099> things<00:05:53.370> one<00:05:53.669> at

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
get better at doing those things one at

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.489 
get better at doing those things one at
a<00:05:53.849> time<00:05:54.439> your<00:05:55.439> body<00:05:55.620> will<00:05:55.830> kind<00:05:56.580> of<00:05:56.639> by<00:05:56.819> itself

00:05:57.489 --> 00:05:57.499 
a time your body will kind of by itself

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:03.309 
a time your body will kind of by itself
learn<00:05:58.499> how<00:05:58.680> to<00:05:58.740> do<00:05:58.949> them<00:05:59.099> simultaneously<00:06:01.069> and

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:03.319 
learn how to do them simultaneously and

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:08.269 
learn how to do them simultaneously and
then<00:06:04.759> once<00:06:05.759> you're<00:06:05.909> comfortable<00:06:06.029> with<00:06:07.099> all<00:06:08.099> of

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:08.279 
then once you're comfortable with all of

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:10.159 
then once you're comfortable with all of
those<00:06:08.430> one<00:06:09.000> finger<00:06:09.330> movements<00:06:09.810> all<00:06:09.899> of<00:06:10.080> the

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
those one finger movements all of the

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.480 
those one finger movements all of the
two<00:06:10.289> finger<00:06:10.589> movements<00:06:10.949> and<00:06:11.039> you<00:06:11.099> can<00:06:11.250> put<00:06:11.399> it

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
two finger movements and you can put it

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.749 
two finger movements and you can put it
all<00:06:11.550> together<00:06:12.919> try<00:06:13.919> to<00:06:13.979> move<00:06:14.159> all<00:06:14.370> three<00:06:14.729> of

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
all together try to move all three of

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.490 
all together try to move all three of
your<00:06:14.939> fingers<00:06:15.210> at<00:06:15.360> the<00:06:15.389> same<00:06:15.599> time<00:06:18.379> this<00:06:19.379> is<00:06:19.439> a

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
your fingers at the same time this is a

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.019 
your fingers at the same time this is a
great<00:06:19.740> way<00:06:19.770> to<00:06:19.979> learn<00:06:20.310> how<00:06:20.370> to<00:06:20.550> change<00:06:20.789> from

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
great way to learn how to change from

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:22.939 
great way to learn how to change from
any<00:06:21.240> chord<00:06:21.569> to<00:06:21.719> any<00:06:21.899> chord<00:06:22.199> so<00:06:22.589> you<00:06:22.680> can<00:06:22.800> go

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:22.949 
any chord to any chord so you can go

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:29.749 
any chord to any chord so you can go
from<00:06:23.310> D<00:06:24.089> to<00:06:24.120> C<00:06:25.969> C<00:06:26.969> to<00:06:27.089> a<00:06:27.120> minor<00:06:28.339> this<00:06:29.339> can<00:06:29.520> apply

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
from D to C C to a minor this can apply

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.189 
from D to C C to a minor this can apply
to<00:06:29.819> any<00:06:30.120> change<00:06:30.449> it<00:06:30.629> doesn't<00:06:30.839> even<00:06:30.899> have<00:06:31.050> to<00:06:31.110> be

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
to any change it doesn't even have to be

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:33.320 
to any change it doesn't even have to be
chords<00:06:31.649> anywhere<00:06:32.129> on<00:06:32.189> the<00:06:32.279> neck<00:06:32.460> for<00:06:32.909> any<00:06:33.060> song

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
chords anywhere on the neck for any song

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.700 
chords anywhere on the neck for any song
that<00:06:33.360> you're<00:06:33.689> learning<00:06:34.020> if<00:06:34.139> you've<00:06:34.259> got<00:06:34.439> to<00:06:34.560> do

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
that you're learning if you've got to do

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.459 
that you're learning if you've got to do
more<00:06:35.339> than<00:06:35.490> one<00:06:35.699> thing<00:06:35.909> at<00:06:35.969> a<00:06:36.149> time<00:06:36.349> break<00:06:37.349> it

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:37.469 
more than one thing at a time break it

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:39.800 
more than one thing at a time break it
down<00:06:37.620> do<00:06:38.399> one<00:06:38.639> finger<00:06:38.999> and<00:06:39.180> do<00:06:39.629> the<00:06:39.779> other

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
down do one finger and do the other

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.829 
down do one finger and do the other
finger<00:06:40.669> do<00:06:41.669> a<00:06:41.699> third<00:06:41.939> finger<00:06:42.300> if<00:06:42.389> you<00:06:42.509> need<00:06:42.689> to

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:42.839 
finger do a third finger if you need to

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:45.379 
finger do a third finger if you need to
and<00:06:43.020> then<00:06:43.789> start<00:06:44.789> putting<00:06:45.060> it<00:06:45.120> all<00:06:45.270> together

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:45.389 
and then start putting it all together

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:48.800 
and then start putting it all together
now<00:06:46.669> if<00:06:47.669> you<00:06:47.789> want<00:06:47.939> to<00:06:47.999> do<00:06:48.060> the<00:06:48.210> alternate<00:06:48.629> G

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
now if you want to do the alternate G

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.469 
now if you want to do the alternate G
fingering<00:06:49.550> this<00:06:50.550> one's<00:06:50.789> actually<00:06:50.969> even

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 
fingering this one's actually even

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:52.999 
fingering this one's actually even
easier<00:06:51.659> for<00:06:51.990> some<00:06:52.139> people<00:06:52.169> because<00:06:52.560> there's<00:06:52.949> a

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:53.009 
easier for some people because there's a

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:55.369 
easier for some people because there's a
finger<00:06:53.430> that<00:06:53.580> you<00:06:53.699> don't<00:06:53.939> have<00:06:54.060> to<00:06:54.120> move<00:06:54.449> so<00:06:55.319> if

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:55.379 
finger that you don't have to move so if

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:58.850 
finger that you don't have to move so if
I've<00:06:55.499> got<00:06:55.710> this<00:06:56.339> fingering<00:06:57.089> where<00:06:57.360> I've<00:06:58.229> got

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
I've got this fingering where I've got

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.499 
I've got this fingering where I've got
both<00:06:59.099> of<00:06:59.129> these<00:06:59.370> fingers<00:06:59.789> up<00:07:00.029> here<00:07:00.360> I've<00:07:00.449> got

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:00.509 
both of these fingers up here I've got

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:03.409 
both of these fingers up here I've got
my<00:07:00.839> third<00:07:01.319> finger<00:07:01.589> on<00:07:01.860> the<00:07:02.789> third<00:07:02.999> fret<00:07:03.029> of<00:07:03.300> the

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 
my third finger on the third fret of the

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.029 
my third finger on the third fret of the
second<00:07:04.020> string<00:07:04.229> and<00:07:04.439> then<00:07:04.560> I've<00:07:04.649> got<00:07:04.680> my

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 
second string and then I've got my
