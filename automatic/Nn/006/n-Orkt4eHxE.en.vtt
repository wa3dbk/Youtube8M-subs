00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
just kind of spraying with this assault

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.120 
just kind of spraying with this assault
rifle<00:01:28.870> there's<00:01:29.870> quite<00:01:30.020> a<00:01:30.050> bit<00:01:30.200> of<00:01:30.290> recoil<00:01:30.860> and

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
rifle there's quite a bit of recoil and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.580 
rifle there's quite a bit of recoil and
saw<00:01:31.400> rifle<00:01:31.790> as<00:01:31.910> well<00:01:31.940> so<00:01:32.480> it<00:01:32.600> is<00:01:32.660> gonna<00:01:32.870> don't

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
saw rifle as well so it is gonna don't

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.440 
saw rifle as well so it is gonna don't
just<00:01:33.920> hold<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.520> trigger<00:01:34.730> down<00:01:34.880> you<00:01:35.330> really

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
just hold the trigger down you really

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.960 
just hold the trigger down you really
need<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.720> kind<00:01:35.900> of<00:01:36.020> pulse<00:01:36.410> it<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:37.460> just<00:01:37.760> you

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
need to kind of pulse it and just you

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.400 
need to kind of pulse it and just you
know<00:01:38.000> pay<00:01:38.210> attention<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.750> that<00:01:38.870> reticule<00:01:39.200> in

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
know pay attention to that reticule in

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.170 
know pay attention to that reticule in
the<00:01:39.500> middle<00:01:39.770> like<00:01:40.010> it<00:01:40.190> expands<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.910> longer

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
the middle like it expands the longer

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.940 
the middle like it expands the longer
you<00:01:41.270> hold<00:01:41.390> it<00:01:41.540> down<00:01:41.660> which<00:01:41.900> means<00:01:42.080> getting

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
you hold it down which means getting

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.670 
you hold it down which means getting
less<00:01:43.100> accurate<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.480> I<00:01:44.780> guess<00:01:44.990> if<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:45.230> can't

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
less accurate so I guess if you can't

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.110 
less accurate so I guess if you can't

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
beta so I knew the layout of it pretty

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.740 
beta so I knew the layout of it pretty
well<00:02:18.440> I<00:02:18.740> was<00:02:19.130> looking<00:02:19.490> for<00:02:19.790> hidden<00:02:20.090> ammo<00:02:20.600> in

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
well I was looking for hidden ammo in

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.200 
well I was looking for hidden ammo in
places<00:02:21.170> that<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.680> knew<00:02:22.430> where<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.610> was<00:02:22.820> which

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
places that I knew where it was which

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.610 
places that I knew where it was which
actually<00:02:23.570> came<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.840> handy<00:02:23.960> on<00:02:24.290> one<00:02:24.470> of<00:02:24.500> the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
actually came in handy on one of the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.130 
actually came in handy on one of the
later<00:02:24.860> levels<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.520> think<00:02:25.970> on<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.690> nighttime

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
later levels I think on the nighttime

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.229 
later levels I think on the nighttime
sniper<00:02:27.530> low<00:02:27.710> level<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.580> don't<00:02:29.030> think<00:02:29.150> you've

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
sniper low level I don't think you've

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.330 
sniper low level I don't think you've
done<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:29.510> one<00:02:29.630> yet<00:02:29.800> there's<00:02:30.800> an<00:02:30.920> area<00:02:31.190> where

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
done that one yet there's an area where

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.580 
done that one yet there's an area where
I<00:02:31.370> knew<00:02:31.670> where<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.420> rocket<00:02:32.810> launcher<00:02:33.170> was<00:02:33.410> hid

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
I knew where a rocket launcher was hid

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.560 
I knew where a rocket launcher was hid
that's<00:02:34.370> where<00:02:34.520> it<00:02:34.610> was<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.730> multiplayer<00:02:35.300> for

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
that's where it was a multiplayer for

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.320 
that's where it was a multiplayer for
the<00:02:35.660> beta<00:02:35.840> Wow<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.950> though<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:38.030> was<00:02:38.090> very

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
the beta Wow and though it was very

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.610 
the beta Wow and though it was very
helpful<00:02:38.480> because<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:39.020> helped<00:02:39.140> me<00:02:39.260> kill<00:02:39.410> some

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
helpful because it helped me kill some

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.100 
helpful because it helped me kill some
hunters<00:02:39.920> nice<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:43.220> Vegas<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:44.360> ammo<00:02:44.840> isn't

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
hunters nice so the Vegas the ammo isn't

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.840 
hunters nice so the Vegas the ammo isn't
the<00:02:45.170> same<00:02:45.350> placement<00:02:45.650> but<00:02:46.160> like<00:02:46.580> throwing

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
the same placement but like throwing

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.190

keep aiming at that dropship to kind of
lock<00:03:48.810> on<00:03:49.049> them<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.379> the<00:03:49.470> rocket<00:03:49.829> will<00:03:49.950> follow

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
lock on them and the rocket will follow

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.449 
lock on them and the rocket will follow

shots<00:03:53.639> before<00:03:53.939> and<00:03:54.359> I've<00:03:54.420> taken<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.720> out<00:03:54.840> in

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
shots before and I've taken it out in

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.069 
shots before and I've taken it out in
six<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:55.799> don't<00:03:56.099> know<00:03:56.359> why<00:03:57.359> sometimes<00:03:57.930> it

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
six so I don't know why sometimes it

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.449 
six so I don't know why sometimes it
would<00:03:58.170> lock<00:03:58.379> on<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:58.859> better<00:03:59.099> spot<00:03:59.310> than

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
would lock on to a better spot than

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.990 
would lock on to a better spot than
others<00:03:59.849> but<00:04:00.650> anyway<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:01.709> you<00:04:01.829> gotta<00:04:01.950> kill<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
others but anyway so you gotta kill the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.670 
others but anyway so you gotta kill the
camo<00:04:03.239> elites<00:04:03.629> which<00:04:03.840> when<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.139> tough<00:04:04.319> to<00:04:04.470> see

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680
