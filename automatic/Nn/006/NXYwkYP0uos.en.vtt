00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:10.899
 the smell was beauty 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:15.649
 As you know, I've been through a lot of questions about people in these 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.579
 automatic stops 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.619
 but many people david heyman who understands very well 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.260
 so today has a special series on internet explorer 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.269
 another motion for you if you had how it works 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.269
 there is nothing left but a power wire 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.630
 on passing 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.090
 the extension of energy to normal advances as size in the treasuries 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.910
 anything 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.250
 he goes 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.750
 make this movie 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.360
 similar driven and that bravas thing for example if you friend a great 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.570
 bang 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.170
 on a lever in a door 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.170
 pressing partial toggle 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.170
 au 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.890
 release leverage to physical part 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.380
 the gate button 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.460
 it's nothing more than a 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.290
 energy and the temporary you should know when it impressed him to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.290
 portability should be stopped around 13 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.140
 then the French Senate 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.860
 although pleading the same thing you think about however the area 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.690
 if you get off the top 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.590
 valdeci but can see that it works also says aliens issues issues 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.140
 who need a strength of mind 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.530
 even if it's only two months 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.280
 with the same concept that is 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.390
 the door art you cecília sosa 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.390
 This issue here is excellent. 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.500
 which is normal without using the green tip as it works 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.909
 lifted object the hour that you miss some object is up there 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.979
 now every time with that race when you press he lifted object the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.250
 Commissioner is spoiled 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.250
 I put object up but the time that you 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.470
 loose he came back with the stocking twists 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.379
 there were no unpleasant 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.669
 Now I'll show you a little bit 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:15.099
 how it works because it's the future of the rest 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.010
 do not build a transport 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.410
 carrier as built in a video passes well you need to have the 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.059
 time is only that extra spending it 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:26.200
 without these health drivers 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.509
 ie they comprise ten days 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:31.819
 Are you okay? 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.039
 this one 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.329
 clearly clear this local team home object 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.739
 so we have to be active in the country 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.030
 see who it is that has several almost like it was a mix of 1 2 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.969
 if you leave the first phase it would make faster 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.739
 here if you leave nothing in the last phase 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.930
 it will take a little more and then see how it works looks caprice 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.179
 on the levers I had connected by road 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:59.080
 that will be the first of the quiet days 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.599
 inspired 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.429
 many companies 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:05.339
 The club when you want it here. 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.050
 take a little longer you can put 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.900
 it's wrong 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.889
 for example you could spend their time just putting 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.529
 the defenders will press a very well the time 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.759
 let it down 2 83 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.409
 clearly the one that will take more weight in it 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.829
 and this is going to be one more 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.540
 keep firm 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.650
 the delegate made no energy decisions 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:29.939
 setubal 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.959
 dir rails I'll show you why this is 30ºc 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.869
 yea 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:38.909
 - now it's official 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.269
 disney with the rest of the team 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.669
 they set fire to the region on it it works as a brake that crime 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.960
 or when you arrive with affection here 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.079
 the pec is off the carlinhos will not work 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.779
 little this energy can be trapped perfect by levers power and when 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:59.349
 realized the advantage balanced 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.409
 Here you have the skin affection including the debut 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.500
 exhibitors may be more like starting the cart even though 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:11.349
 when you're in the cart and until the button the way goes the 110 million 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:12.089
 ef 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:13.919
 this works as situation 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.029
 the starting point 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.029
 Fuck me now, what am I going to do? 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.849
 to adapt the format of the body in which they are detected this year 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:25.949
 not right 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.189
 first you talk to the block 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:31.749
 if it is going to put a part of it becomes a side only and hamas 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:37.159
 you will need to control or download 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:38.789
 power 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.930
 if not from biomass percent 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.930
 if you put it straight like that 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:52.249
 it will get good but the sim fee 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.409
 and to do more what the filmmaker james cameron 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:59.159
 Are you going to use the Bernard driver? 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.430
 by making a complaint here we lose ugly for you guys 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.699
 soft 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.699
 the left-leaning months 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:14.559
 according to the league, but he said that in the last phase we are well 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:18.639
 he will stay 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.409
 if the rate will never burn 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:24.499
 so if you plug in a piston with other teams the piston salt tomato 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.250
 Okay, I hope you've got a little understanding of it. 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.169
 because I have to show you 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.180
 Here we go, by the way.
