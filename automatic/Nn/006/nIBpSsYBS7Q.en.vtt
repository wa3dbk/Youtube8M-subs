00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.519 
future i think this is kind of the
future<00:00:25.009> i<00:00:25.039> think<00:00:25.099> if<00:00:25.400> you<00:00:25.519> think<00:00:26.079> the<00:00:27.079> youth

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529

on the women system the men's system

on the women system the men's system
it's<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.329> bit<00:01:47.509> different<00:01:47.750> I<00:01:48.110> think<00:01:48.649> Klinsmann's

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
it's a bit different I think Klinsmann's

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.420 
it's a bit different I think Klinsmann's
doing<00:01:49.789> a<00:01:49.820> lot<00:01:50.000> better<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.479> job<00:01:51.430> starting

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
doing a lot better of a job starting

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.620 
doing a lot better of a job starting
with<00:01:52.579> the<00:01:52.700> youth<00:01:52.939> but<00:01:53.240> it's<00:01:53.360> going<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.539> take

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
with the youth but it's going to take

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.870 
with the youth but it's going to take
time<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.649> better<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.950> Academy<00:01:55.460> does<00:01:55.700> the

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
time the better the Academy does the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.700 
time the better the Academy does the
better<00:01:56.060> our<00:01:56.149> youth<00:01:56.689> coaches<00:01:56.960> do<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.320> producing

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
better our youth coaches do of producing

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.120 
better our youth coaches do of producing
players<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:58.189> better<00:01:58.340> on<00:01:58.460> national<00:01:58.820> team

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
players the better on national team

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.859 
players the better on national team
do<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.490> think<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.270> going<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.420> continue<00:02:00.659> to

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
do I think it's going to continue to

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.310 
do I think it's going to continue to
take<00:02:01.110> time<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:01.530> there<00:02:01.680> has<00:02:01.799> been<00:02:01.979> improved
