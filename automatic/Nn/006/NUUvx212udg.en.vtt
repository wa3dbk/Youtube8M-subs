that<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.700> dig<00:00:41.850> through<00:00:42.140> so<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.260> can

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
that we have to dig through so you can

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.990 
that we have to dig through so you can
see<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> old<00:00:43.980> pond<00:00:44.250> with<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> pond<00:00:44.789> liner

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
removed and the new part there what we

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.029 
removed and the new part there what we
tend<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.879> double<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.829> size<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
tend to do is double the size of the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.850 
tend to do is double the size of the
pond<00:00:53.340> by<00:00:54.210> digging<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.809> out<00:00:54.870> twice<00:00:55.140> as<00:00:55.350> big<00:00:55.530> and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
pond by digging it out twice as big and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.740 
pond by digging it out twice as big and
actually<00:00:56.520> bringing<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:56.940> over<00:00:57.120> onto<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
actually bringing it up over onto the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.450 
actually bringing it up over onto the
patio<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.410> create<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> nice<00:00:58.859> little<00:00:59.039> ledge<00:00:59.280> for

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
patio to create a nice little ledge for

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.960 
patio to create a nice little ledge for
plants<00:01:03.680> there<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.860> another<00:01:05.220> shot<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.670> hole

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
plants there is another shot of the hole

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.600 
plants there is another shot of the hole
in<00:01:06.210> progress<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.590> every<00:01:07.799> time<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.100> fades<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
in progress and every time it fades to a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.130 
in progress and every time it fades to a
new<00:01:08.790> shot<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.390> actually<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> new<00:01:09.960> day<00:01:10.490> so

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
new shot it's actually a new day so

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.530 
new shot it's actually a new day so
there<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.409> again<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:14.070> few<00:01:14.790> days<00:01:14.970> later<00:01:15.270> with

there it is again a few days later with
a<00:01:15.869> little<00:01:16.229> bit<00:01:16.350> deeper<00:01:16.650> hole<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:17.820> um

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
a little bit deeper hole you can see um

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.940 
a little bit deeper hole you can see um
we<00:01:18.570> don't<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.900> shovel<00:01:19.140> really<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.680> have

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
hammers and chisels and sledgehammers to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.240 
hammers and chisels and sledgehammers to
dig<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> pond<00:01:24.119> there<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:25.710> again<00:01:25.979> another

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
dig out the pond there and again another

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.270 
dig out the pond there and again another
couple<00:01:26.939> days<00:01:27.090> has<00:01:27.360> passed<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.350> hole<00:01:29.070> just

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
couple days has passed and hole just

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.020 
couple days has passed and hole just
keeps<00:01:29.460> getting<00:01:29.700> bigger<00:01:29.820> bigger<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:32.640> goal<00:01:32.850> is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
keeps getting bigger bigger the goal is

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.660 
keeps getting bigger bigger the goal is
to<00:01:33.060> get<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.450> pond<00:01:33.630> 3<00:01:33.990> feet<00:01:34.170> deep<00:01:34.200> by<00:01:34.829> 14<00:01:35.400> feet

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
to get the pond 3 feet deep by 14 feet

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.230 
to get the pond 3 feet deep by 14 feet
wide<00:01:35.700> by<00:01:36.570> about<00:01:36.780> 14<00:01:37.200> feet<00:01:37.409> long<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.759> it's

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
wide by about 14 feet long and that it's

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.380 
wide by about 14 feet long and that it's
going<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.600> equal<00:01:39.869> about<00:01:40.229> 4000<00:01:40.920> gallons<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:42.270> now

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
going to equal about 4000 gallons so now

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.460 
going to equal about 4000 gallons so now
it's<00:01:42.540> not<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> perfect<00:01:43.350> square

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
it's not going to be a perfect square

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.249 
it's not going to be a perfect square
pond<00:01:44.180> it<00:01:45.180> does<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.960> corners

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
pond it does have one of the corners

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.499 
pond it does have one of the corners
slightly<00:01:46.470> removed<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.939> pond<00:01:48.119> might<00:01:48.329> end

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
slightly removed so this pond might end

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.899 
slightly removed so this pond might end
up<00:01:48.570> being<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:49.470> under<00:01:50.000> 4,000<00:01:51.000> gallons<00:01:51.270> now

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
up being just under 4,000 gallons now

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.490 
up being just under 4,000 gallons now
and<00:01:53.909> we're<00:01:54.119> getting<00:01:54.180> close<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.540> them<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
and we're getting close to them the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.469 
and we're getting close to them the
total<00:01:56.009> depth<00:01:56.250> now<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> pond<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.270> kind<00:01:57.450> of

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
total depth now of the pond it's kind of

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.740 
total depth now of the pond it's kind of
even<00:01:57.780> all<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> way<00:01:58.079> across<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.090> will<00:02:00.479> just

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
even all the way across so I will just

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.660 
even all the way across so I will just
climb<00:02:01.140> down<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.159> show<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.340> what<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.520> looks

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
climb down in and show you what it looks

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.209 
climb down in and show you what it looks
like<00:02:02.790> from<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.299> hole<00:02:03.799> you<00:02:04.799> can<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.130> see

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
like from in the hole you can just see

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.010 
like from in the hole you can just see
the<00:02:05.340> layers<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.939> rock<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.630> we've<00:02:06.750> had<00:02:06.899> to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
the layers of rock that we've had to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.229 
the layers of rock that we've had to
remove<00:02:07.310> it's<00:02:08.310> actually<00:02:08.580> getting<00:02:08.640> wet<00:02:09.060> with

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
remove it's actually getting wet with

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.930 
remove it's actually getting wet with
the<00:02:09.300> groundwater<00:02:09.840> down<00:02:10.170> there<00:02:10.349> now

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
the groundwater down there now

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.680 
the groundwater down there now
and<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:12.080> what<00:02:12.230> we<00:02:12.320> want<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.620> do<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.420> cover<00:02:14.420> that

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
and so what we want to do is cover that

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.840 
and so what we want to do is cover that
all<00:02:14.870> up<00:02:15.050> we<00:02:15.470> use<00:02:15.710> a<00:02:15.740> felt<00:02:16.100> matting<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.670> cover

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
all up we use a felt matting to cover

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.840 
all up we use a felt matting to cover
all<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.120> sharp<00:02:17.360> rocks<00:02:17.660> after<00:02:18.140> we<00:02:18.850> take

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
all the sharp rocks after we take

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.400 
all the sharp rocks after we take
everything<00:02:20.240> that<00:02:20.270> we<00:02:20.450> can<00:02:20.600> out<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.960> make<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.290> as

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
everything that we can out to make it as

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.170 
everything that we can out to make it as
smooth<00:02:21.920> as<00:02:22.040> possible<00:02:22.550> we<00:02:22.640> use<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.940> sort<00:02:23.120> of

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
smooth as possible we use that sort of

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.060 
smooth as possible we use that sort of
felt<00:02:23.420> over<00:02:23.720> there<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.560> we<00:02:24.650> cover<00:02:24.860> all<00:02:25.040> the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
felt over there and we cover all the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.590 
felt over there and we cover all the
rocks<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.700> felt<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.030> nice<00:02:26.240> because<00:02:26.450> it

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
rocks the felt is nice because it

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.380 
rocks the felt is nice because it
doesn't<00:02:26.750> break<00:02:26.960> down<00:02:26.990> very<00:02:27.380> easily<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:29.150> there

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
doesn't break down very easily and there

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.200 
doesn't break down very easily and there
it<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.600> covered<00:02:30.050> up<00:02:30.520> we<00:02:31.520> use<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.670> few<00:02:31.910> pieces<00:02:32.030> of

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
it is covered up we use a few pieces of

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.650 
it is covered up we use a few pieces of
old<00:02:32.480> pond<00:02:32.690> liner<00:02:32.930> we<00:02:33.110> threw<00:02:33.290> down<00:02:33.440> as<00:02:33.650> well<00:02:33.860> and

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
old pond liner we threw down as well and

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.150 
old pond liner we threw down as well and
that<00:02:35.660> just<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.200> make<00:02:36.530> sure<00:02:36.560> there's<00:02:36.830> some<00:02:36.980> sort

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
that just to make sure there's some sort

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.760 
that just to make sure there's some sort
of<00:02:37.220> underlay<00:02:37.640> 100<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.330> liner<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.650> liner

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
of underlay 100 of the liner the liner

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.580 
of underlay 100 of the liner the liner
we're<00:02:40.100> using<00:02:40.280> is<00:02:40.520> a<00:02:40.550> 45<00:02:41.150> mil<00:02:41.510> edpm<00:02:42.500> liner<00:02:44.590> great

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
we're using is a 45 mil edpm liner great

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.110 
we're using is a 45 mil edpm liner great
liner<00:02:45.800> a<00:02:46.160> very<00:02:46.670> very<00:02:46.910> heavy<00:02:47.090> hard<00:02:47.810> dragon

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
liner a very very heavy hard dragon

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.190 
liner a very very heavy hard dragon
couldn't<00:02:50.120> film<00:02:50.330> while<00:02:50.540> we're<00:02:50.660> dragging<00:02:51.110> in

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
couldn't film while we're dragging in

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.020 
couldn't film while we're dragging in
but<00:02:51.500> there<00:02:52.070> it<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.280> starting<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.730> fill<00:02:52.940> with

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
but there it is starting to fill with

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.090 
but there it is starting to fill with
water<00:02:53.290> we<00:02:54.290> have<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.530> about<00:02:54.710> half<00:02:54.950> full<00:02:56.980> so<00:02:57.980> the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
water we have it about half full so the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.470 
water we have it about half full so the
idea<00:02:58.310> is<00:02:58.550> draping<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.970> liner<00:02:59.120> up<00:02:59.300> on<00:02:59.390> the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
idea is draping the liner up on the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.690 
idea is draping the liner up on the
sides<00:02:59.750> make<00:03:00.500> sure<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.800> fill<00:03:01.070> it<00:03:01.190> first<00:03:01.460> before

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
sides make sure you fill it first before

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.410 
sides make sure you fill it first before
you<00:03:01.880> cut<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:03.430> we<00:03:04.430> already<00:03:04.700> had<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:04.970> existing

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
you cut it we already had the existing

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.030 
you cut it we already had the existing
stream<00:03:05.720> so<00:03:05.930> once<00:03:06.110> it<00:03:06.260> was<00:03:06.350> pretty<00:03:06.590> much<00:03:06.740> full

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
stream so once it was pretty much full

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.310 
stream so once it was pretty much full
we<00:03:07.220> just<00:03:07.370> turned<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.670> stream<00:03:07.910> back<00:03:08.060> on<00:03:08.240> to<00:03:08.450> see

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
we just turned the stream back on to see

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.430 
we just turned the stream back on to see
what<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.500> was<00:03:09.590> gonna<00:03:09.680> look<00:03:09.890> like<00:03:10.180> but<00:03:11.290> our<00:03:12.290> old

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
what it was gonna look like but our old

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.900 
what it was gonna look like but our old
pond<00:03:12.710> would<00:03:12.890> take<00:03:13.040> probably<00:03:13.190> two<00:03:13.490> hours<00:03:13.520> to

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
pond would take probably two hours to

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.610 
pond would take probably two hours to
fill<00:03:14.060> with<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.240> hose<00:03:14.390> this<00:03:14.810> one<00:03:14.990> took<00:03:15.140> closer

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
fill with the hose this one took closer

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.949 
fill with the hose this one took closer
to<00:03:15.830> eight<00:03:16.040> hours<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.520> fill<00:03:16.670> with<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.880> hose<00:03:19.959> we

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
to eight hours to fill with the hose we

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.360 
to eight hours to fill with the hose we
will<00:03:21.110> be<00:03:21.230> cutting<00:03:21.440> in<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.709> liner<00:03:21.920> of<00:03:22.130> course

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
will be cutting in the liner of course

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.140 
will be cutting in the liner of course
at<00:03:22.520> the<00:03:22.610> edges<00:03:22.880> of<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.150> banks<00:03:23.480> there<00:03:25.030> there<00:03:26.030> it

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
at the edges of the banks there there it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.630 
at the edges of the banks there there it
is<00:03:26.240> completely<00:03:26.750> full<00:03:27.100> we<00:03:28.100> still<00:03:28.340> we're<00:03:28.610> not

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
is completely full we still we're not

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.860 
is completely full we still we're not
cutting<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.060> liner<00:03:29.270> for<00:03:29.480> a<00:03:29.570> little<00:03:29.720> while

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
cutting the liner for a little while

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.720 
cutting the liner for a little while
we're<00:03:30.080> gonna<00:03:30.140> let<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.500> kind<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.680> settle<00:03:30.980> in<00:03:31.130> you

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
we're gonna let it kind of settle in you

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.720 
we're gonna let it kind of settle in you
don't<00:03:31.880> want<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.060> cut<00:03:32.209> anything<00:03:32.420> too<00:03:32.660> fast<00:03:33.730> once

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
don't want to cut anything too fast once

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.280 
don't want to cut anything too fast once
you<00:03:34.850> make<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.030> cut<00:03:35.270> that's<00:03:35.450> too<00:03:35.600> short<00:03:35.630> it's

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
you make a cut that's too short it's

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.840 
you make a cut that's too short it's
really<00:03:36.680> hard<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:37.070> UM<00:03:37.250> fix<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.930> that<00:03:39.800> was<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.190> we

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
really hard to UM fix and that was it we

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.180 
really hard to UM fix and that was it we
survived<00:03:41.300> the<00:03:41.540> first<00:03:41.660> night<00:03:42.020> the<00:03:42.650> water<00:03:42.860> level

survived the first night the water level

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.500 
survived the first night the water level
didn't<00:03:43.430> change<00:03:43.670> so<00:03:43.820> we<00:03:44.060> know<00:03:44.180> there's<00:03:44.360> no

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
didn't change so we know there's no
