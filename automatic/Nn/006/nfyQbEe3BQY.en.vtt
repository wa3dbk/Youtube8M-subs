shrink<00:00:03.689> plastic<00:00:03.870> charms<00:00:05.390> I'm<00:00:06.390> going<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.750> be<00:00:06.839> a

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
shrink plastic charms I'm going to be a

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.410 
shrink plastic charms I'm going to be a
little<00:00:07.020> bit<00:00:07.230> noisy<00:00:07.529> right<00:00:07.770> now<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.130> just<00:00:08.420> pay

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
little bit noisy right now so just pay

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:42.570 
little bit noisy right now so just pay
attention<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.139> one

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.680 

and<00:00:43.580> just<00:00:43.880> keep<00:00:44.150> a<00:00:44.390> clear<00:00:45.140> block<00:00:45.550> ready<00:00:46.690> to

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
and just keep a clear block ready to

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.450 
and just keep a clear block ready to
flatten<00:00:48.140> out<00:00:48.440> that's<00:00:48.830> a<00:00:49.130> charm<00:00:50.710> so<00:00:51.710> this<00:00:52.160> is<00:00:52.280> it

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
flatten out that's a charm so this is it

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.000 
flatten out that's a charm so this is it
and<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:53.480> could<00:00:53.630> imagine<00:00:53.870> imagine<00:00:54.560> having<00:00:54.800> it

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
and you could imagine imagine having it

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.480 
and you could imagine imagine having it
from<00:00:55.550> this<00:00:55.730> size<00:00:56.000> up<00:00:56.180> fast<00:00:56.830> so<00:00:57.830> now<00:00:58.040> you<00:00:58.100> see<00:00:58.340> it

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
from this size up fast so now you see it

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.370 
from this size up fast so now you see it
shrinks<00:00:58.850> to<00:00:59.000> almost<00:00:59.330> a<00:00:59.630> third<00:00:59.870> or<00:01:00.110> perhaps

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
shrinks to almost a third or perhaps

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.610 
shrinks to almost a third or perhaps
even<00:01:00.560> a<00:01:00.770> quarter<00:01:01.250> of<00:01:01.400> a<00:01:01.520> part<00:01:02.230> let's<00:01:03.230> go<00:01:03.440> for

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
even a quarter of a part let's go for

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:32.490 
even a quarter of a part let's go for
another<00:01:03.740> one

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.660 

this<00:01:33.500> one<00:01:33.710> actually<00:01:33.800> turned<00:01:34.280> out<00:01:34.400> pretty

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
this one actually turned out pretty

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.750 
this one actually turned out pretty
nicely<00:01:35.450> I<00:01:36.110> almost<00:01:36.650> had<00:01:36.950> to<00:01:37.479> cut<00:01:38.479> her<00:01:38.750> throat

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
nicely I almost had to cut her throat

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.359 
nicely I almost had to cut her throat

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
button I'm hoping much she'll stay home

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.480

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
here's this lovely ebony so it's easy

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.160 
here's this lovely ebony so it's easy
peasy<00:01:49.640> really<00:01:50.210> if<00:01:50.360> you<00:01:50.509> want<00:01:50.690> you<00:01:50.900> could<00:01:51.050> of

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
peasy really if you want you could of

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.380 
peasy really if you want you could of
course<00:01:51.350> bake<00:01:51.650> these<00:01:51.860> in<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.220> oven<00:01:52.390> but

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
course bake these in the oven but

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.660 
course bake these in the oven but
there's<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.229> difficulty<00:01:54.890> in<00:01:55.100> making<00:01:55.340> all<00:01:55.640> of

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
there's a difficulty in making all of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.820 
there's a difficulty in making all of
these<00:01:55.940> fats<00:01:56.270> at<00:01:56.390> once<00:01:56.600> if<00:01:56.810> they<00:01:57.080> don't<00:01:57.320> turn<00:01:57.619> up

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
these fats at once if they don't turn up

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.010 
these fats at once if they don't turn up
flat<00:01:58.040> out<00:01:58.220> at<00:01:58.369> once<00:01:58.550> I<00:01:58.850> think<00:01:59.570> I'll<00:01:59.659> just<00:01:59.780> try

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
flat out at once I think I'll just try

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.520 
flat out at once I think I'll just try
this<00:02:00.080> thursday<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:01.190> well<00:02:01.369> as<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.090> third<00:02:02.300> one

thursday and what i have done is that i
have<00:03:10.370> stamped<00:03:10.970> these<00:03:11.090> at<00:03:11.420> first<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:12.140> then<00:03:12.440> i

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
have stamped these at first and then i

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.710 
have stamped these at first and then i
have<00:03:12.560> colored<00:03:13.070> them<00:03:13.250> with<00:03:13.460> Copic<00:03:13.820> marker

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
have colored them with Copic marker

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.320

markers<00:03:15.320> pop<00:03:16.250> its<00:03:16.400> shell<00:03:16.610> markers<00:03:16.970> actually

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
markers pop its shell markers actually

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.160 
markers pop its shell markers actually
and<00:03:17.630> as<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:18.740> can<00:03:18.890> see<00:03:18.920> it's<00:03:19.340> quite<00:03:19.810> paying<00:03:20.810> the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
and as you can see it's quite paying the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.050 
and as you can see it's quite paying the
colors<00:03:21.470> there<00:03:21.680> but<00:03:22.220> when<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:22.520> start

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
colors there but when you start

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.360 
colors there but when you start
shrinking<00:03:23.360> these<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:24.200> colors<00:03:24.500> increase<00:03:24.950> and

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
shrinking these the colors increase and

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.820 
shrinking these the colors increase and
they<00:03:25.820> become<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.120> little<00:03:26.360> bit<00:03:26.450> stronger<00:03:26.830> I've

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
they become a little bit stronger I've

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.340 
they become a little bit stronger I've
also<00:03:28.160> gone<00:03:28.970> down<00:03:29.240> punched<00:03:29.780> out<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.080> hole

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
also gone down punched out that hole

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.850 
also gone down punched out that hole
before<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:31.840> that<00:03:32.840> more<00:03:32.990> shrinks<00:03:33.350> as<00:03:33.470> well<00:03:33.650> and

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
before so that more shrinks as well and

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.330 
before so that more shrinks as well and
you're<00:03:34.550> ready<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.850> put<00:03:35.090> that<00:03:35.300> so<00:03:35.540> on<00:03:35.690> your

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
you're ready to put that so on your

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.300 
you're ready to put that so on your
bracelet<00:03:37.340> later<00:03:37.700> on<00:03:38.380> so<00:03:39.380> this<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.590> quite<00:03:39.980> fun

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
bracelet later on so this is quite fun

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.430 
bracelet later on so this is quite fun
of<00:03:40.430> technique<00:03:40.820> directional<00:03:41.300> make<00:03:41.480> these

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
of technique directional make these

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.610 
of technique directional make these
stumps<00:03:42.890> not<00:03:43.490> little<00:03:43.700> bit<00:03:43.820> before<00:03:43.910> more<00:03:44.180> funny

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
stumps not little bit before more funny

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.950 
stumps not little bit before more funny
so<00:03:45.620> I'm<00:03:45.860> hoping<00:03:46.250> you'll<00:03:47.150> have<00:03:47.360> some<00:03:47.570> luck<00:03:47.780> with

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
so I'm hoping you'll have some luck with

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.350 
so I'm hoping you'll have some luck with
these<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:48.500> don't<00:03:48.980> give<00:03:49.160> up<00:03:49.250> if<00:03:49.400> you<00:03:49.610> don't

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
these and don't give up if you don't

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.820 
these and don't give up if you don't
succeed<00:03:50.600> at<00:03:50.960> first<00:03:51.790> all<00:03:52.790> right
