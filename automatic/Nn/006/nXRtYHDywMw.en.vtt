00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.330
 in the public ministry since 

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.180
 we had knowledge 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.599
 yes I of cinema 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.610
 not even say fiscal but the 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.559
 deputy director of common crimes the doctor 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.600
 Carlos Tavares to put him 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.280
 front of this investigation 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.350
 together with a national prosecutor 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.030
 and we are investigating of course already 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.770
 we have some elements but until 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.360
 so much we do not have certainty of how 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.890
 the events happened exactly 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.760
 who are the alleged perpetrators 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.550
 we are not going to make it from the knowledge 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.400
 public so as not to jeopardize the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.290
 investigation but fine what I want 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.239
 is to transmit to the Venezuelan people 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.280
 first trust to the institutions 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.170
 have a lot of confidence in the 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.160
 public ministry and all the investigates and 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.840
 all the 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.100
 organisms institutions 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.730
 members of the justice system 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.430
 criminal because in this case there will be 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.530
 justice there will not be impunity like that 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.270
 nor will there be impunity in 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.940
 all addresses that occur in the 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.309
 country or any crime that occurs here 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.680
 in the country I want to remember that 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.080
 we have had some cases that 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.420
 they have also been impacted the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.790
 collectivity the case of the model 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.860
 the actress mónica esther 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.890
 We have 10 people deprived of freedom 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.560
 and it is already in the process to achieve 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.030
 condemns if the 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.730
 public ministry has the presumption 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.680
 that this is the case of eliécer otaíza 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.100
 where we also have many people 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.100
 private 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.340
 correct of the Caribbean river the case of the 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:42.730
 spiral of the easy model of acosta 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.590
 juan montoya or we have given samples 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.840
 that we want to investigate and that 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.230
 they have certainly been researched and have 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.850
 given to those responsible then the 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.710
 country has to definitely trust 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.870
 in institutions and especially if 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.560
 these have shown signs of seriousness 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:06.900
 responsibility to want to respond 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.900
 to the Venezuelan people response to the country
