rotate with a neighboring grower because

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.450 
rotate with a neighboring grower because
it's<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.869> know<00:00:27.900> when<00:00:28.590> you're<00:00:28.710> raising<00:00:28.949> 200

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
it's you know when you're raising 200

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.130 
it's you know when you're raising 200
acres<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.789> sweet<00:00:29.970> corn<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.359> hard<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.689> rotate

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
acres of sweet corn it's hard to rotate

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.459 
acres of sweet corn it's hard to rotate
on<00:00:31.369> your<00:00:32.369> same<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:32.940> your<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.780> your<00:00:34.020> own<00:00:34.140> farm

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
on your same on your on your own farm

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.590 
on your same on your on your own farm
and<00:00:34.800> still<00:00:35.309> raise<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.730> many<00:00:35.940> acres<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.450> we're

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
and still raise that many acres so we're

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.770 
and still raise that many acres so we're
in<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:37.140> another<00:00:37.320> farmer<00:00:38.300> he<00:00:39.300> goes<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.750> with

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
in with another farmer he goes on with

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.720 
in with another farmer he goes on with
potatoes<00:00:40.350> for<00:00:40.620> two<00:00:40.770> years<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.190> then<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.399> go<00:00:41.550> on

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
potatoes for two years and then I go on

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.600 
potatoes for two years and then I go on
with<00:00:41.910> corn<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:42.690> up<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.379> no<00:00:43.920> more<00:00:44.100> than<00:00:44.160> four

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
with corn for up to no more than four

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:53.270 
with corn for up to no more than four
and<00:00:44.850> then<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.180> back<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> potatoes<00:00:45.960> again<00:00:52.280> we

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and then it's back to potatoes again we

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.790 
and then it's back to potatoes again we
basically<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.850> try<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.329> scout<00:00:54.719> as<00:00:55.320> much<00:00:55.530> as<00:00:55.680> I

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
basically I try and scout as much as I

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.760 
basically I try and scout as much as I
can<00:00:55.860> I'll<00:00:56.789> usually<00:00:57.270> take<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> walk<00:00:58.410> through<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
can I'll usually take a walk through the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.170 
can I'll usually take a walk through the
field<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.370> I'll<00:01:00.149> pull<00:01:00.510> ten<00:01:00.870> tassels<00:01:01.469> and

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
field and I'll pull ten tassels and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.690 
field and I'll pull ten tassels and
check<00:01:03.180> those<00:01:03.390> ten<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.870> see<00:01:03.960> how<00:01:04.110> many<00:01:04.700> how

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
check those ten and see how many how

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.679 
check those ten and see how many how
much<00:01:05.990> corn<00:01:06.990> borer<00:01:07.430> infestation<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
much corn borer infestation I have and

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.469 
much corn borer infestation I have and
then<00:01:09.810> I'll<00:01:09.930> do<00:01:10.770> another<00:01:11.040> ten<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:12.390> I

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
then I'll do another ten and then I

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.570 
then I'll do another ten and then I
probably<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:13.619> around<00:01:13.920> anywhere

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
probably I like to do around anywhere

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.870 
probably I like to do around anywhere
around<00:01:14.670> 100<00:01:15.619> tassels<00:01:16.619> when<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.220> do<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.490> scouting

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
around 100 tassels when I do a scouting

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.670 
around 100 tassels when I do a scouting
of<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.229> good<00:01:19.229> size<00:01:19.439> block<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.820> takes<00:01:21.060> me<00:01:21.270> about

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
of a good size block it takes me about

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.880 
of a good size block it takes me about
an<00:01:22.680> hour<00:01:23.509> to<00:01:24.509> do<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> hundred<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.320> hundred

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
an hour to do a hundred of hundred

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.580 
an hour to do a hundred of hundred
plants<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.460> then<00:01:27.119> from<00:01:27.330> there<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> figure<00:01:28.470> out

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
plants and then from there I figure out

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.730 
plants and then from there I figure out
my<00:01:28.619> percentage<00:01:29.250> if<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:29.640> over<00:01:29.880> 15%

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
my percentage if I get over 15%

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:39.789 
my percentage if I get over 15%
infestation<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.829> corn<00:01:32.040> borer<00:01:32.420> then<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.630> spray

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
European corn borer the nozzles that we

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.330 
European corn borer the nozzles that we
use<00:02:22.830> are<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.130> hollow<00:02:23.460> cone<00:02:23.790> nozzle<00:02:24.390> um<00:02:25.190> we<00:02:26.190> used

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
use are a hollow cone nozzle um we used

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.030 
use are a hollow cone nozzle um we used
to<00:02:26.460> have<00:02:26.820> fan<00:02:27.180> nozzles<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.230> don't<00:02:28.860> know<00:02:28.920> the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
to have fan nozzles and I don't know the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.950 
to have fan nozzles and I don't know the
droplets<00:02:29.520> were<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> little<00:02:29.880> bigger<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.540> I

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
droplets were a little bigger and I

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.380 
droplets were a little bigger and I
think<00:02:31.590> we're<00:02:31.740> getting<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.070> lot<00:02:32.400> more<00:02:32.460> runoff<00:02:32.880> on

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
think we're getting a lot more runoff on

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.060 
think we're getting a lot more runoff on
the<00:02:33.480> ground<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.990> stuff<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.470> we<00:02:34.620> went<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.920> these

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
the ground and stuff so we went to these

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.470 
the ground and stuff so we went to these
gives<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> finer<00:02:37.160> finer<00:02:38.160> mist<00:02:38.670> finer

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
gives you a finer finer mist finer

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.320 
gives you a finer finer mist finer
