00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hey people yes i am the nato after 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.940
 make-up 1 here on youtube and today 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.110
 Let's do a do it yourself 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.670
 windlight of dyed hair so me 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.049
 say to someday how we do that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.539
 I think I do not know how 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.980
 I should someday be the video 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.660
 I'll just show you what you do for it 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.500
 need how it works and me 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.010
 Hope you like it so stay tuned 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.470
 so we need sugar or salt 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.480
 roads chalk times into beautiful colors 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.790
 glue the afterwards 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.860
 I'll show you that or just 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.540
 drinsteht dries clear that is whole 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.840
 important 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.370
 then we need tealights, of course 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.070
 windlight or a glass in the future 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.780
 take an example and a yes such a kind 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.780
 saved but now I have this again 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.370
 Silent taken this ice lolly Sun 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.770
 First and foremost, we take care of that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.219
 windlicht where we later that too 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:12.479
 tealight and we can do it 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:14.330
 something sugar and next to ours 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.640
 chalk 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.750
 what color we take which I take 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.659
 now red then we put the little 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.570
 pure and turn into sugar all the time 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.860
 until the sugar turns from the small one 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.180
 this is true depending on how intense the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.180
 color is relatively fast 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.270
 that's what it looks like now it's a bright one 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.510
 blushed 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:53.500
 had gone forward now, the regulations 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.660
 Of course, from and the longer you here 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.290
 to hear the for never was is then also 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.290
 they have, of course 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.100
 sugar then we do in such a 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.820
 old bowl that if I look 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.950
 use 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.910
 then we take our ears bosque 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.680
 Klever make such a streak of 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:25.220
 on it and then take us one 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:29.900
 spade and try it evenly 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.080
 sometimes very difficult to distribute 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.080
 is 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.900
 if you have such an almost uniform 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.710
 Then I chose that again 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.710
 sugar into it 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.530
 I 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.580
 and then it looks like we can 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.980
 Of course, mostly even take 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:33.269
 if you have no chalk then you do 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:40.620
 you just white sofa in then 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:42.329
 take our glass of our u and 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.450
 distribute the now twice as a 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.450
 little 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.930
 and that can also be done in the 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.930
 local 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:11.269
 so it is again with white sugar 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.010
 so these are the finished tealights and 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.989
 I'll show you this now like the evening 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.989
 looks like that's great 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.819
 With 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.440
 And these are the finished wind lights 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.930
 we can see you have a big one 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.530
 Effect come as if frozen 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.180
 are 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.000
 which of course is great for the cold 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.830
 season fits yes I hope you have 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.419
 liked the do it yourself video and 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.979
