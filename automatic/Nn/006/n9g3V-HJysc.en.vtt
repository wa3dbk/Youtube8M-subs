of<00:01:27.750> road<00:01:28.130> north<00:01:29.130> end<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.640> south<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.150> both

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
of road north end and south and both

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.440 
of road north end and south and both
washed<00:01:30.810> out<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.470> we're<00:01:31.680> stuck<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.400> trying<00:01:33.240> to

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
washed out so we're stuck here trying to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.440 
washed out so we're stuck here trying to
find<00:01:33.720> higher<00:01:33.960> ground<00:01:33.990> at<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.770> point<00:01:34.850> Wow<00:01:35.909> so

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
find higher ground at this point Wow so

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.179 
find higher ground at this point Wow so
the<00:01:36.780> thinking<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.680> wasn't<00:01:37.920> that

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the thinking is that it wasn't that

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.890 
the thinking is that it wasn't that
there<00:01:38.340> was<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> compromise<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.390> dam<00:01:39.600> not

that the dam was breached or broken

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.789 
that the dam was breached or broken
anyway<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> lot<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.079> water<00:01:43.290> went<00:01:43.590> over

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
anyway but that a lot of water went over

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.350 
anyway but that a lot of water went over
the<00:01:43.920> spillway<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.299> the

that area the roads are washing out and

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.060 
that area the roads are washing out and
it's<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.009> mess<00:01:50.570> it<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.079> completely<00:01:52.710> mess

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.620 
know they are concerned with this amount
of<00:01:59.310> water<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.790> something<00:02:00.210> could<00:02:00.420> happen

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
of water that something could happen

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.450 
of water that something could happen
with<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.079> dam<00:02:01.380> if<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.100> were<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.399> happen

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
with this dam if that were to happen

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.580 
with this dam if that were to happen
where<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.030> am<00:02:03.479> right<00:02:03.780> now<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:05.189> dam<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.880> about<00:02:06.590> 15

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
where I am right now the dam is about 15

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.190 
where I am right now the dam is about 15
miles<00:02:07.920> south<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.789> us<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.660> water<00:02:09.929> would

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
miles south of us and that water would

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.440 
miles south of us and that water would
come<00:02:10.470> rushing<00:02:10.709> north<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.520> would<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:11.879> right

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
come rushing north it would be right

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.190 
come rushing north it would be right
where

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
where

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.190 
where
we<00:02:13.319> are<00:02:13.879> so<00:02:14.879> obviously<00:02:15.390> people<00:02:15.510> here<00:02:16.050> are<00:02:16.140> very

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
we are so obviously people here are very

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.140 
we are so obviously people here are very
scared<00:02:16.860> keeping<00:02:17.580> their<00:02:17.730> fingers<00:02:17.940> crossed

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
scared keeping their fingers crossed

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.509 
scared keeping their fingers crossed
there<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.140> still<00:02:19.440> power<00:02:19.680> here<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.250> they<00:02:20.400> are

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
there is still power here so they are

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.910 
there is still power here so they are
watching<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.060> news<00:02:21.269> and<00:02:21.599> just<00:02:22.290> trying<00:02:22.800> to

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
watching the news and just trying to

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.949 
watching the news and just trying to
figure<00:02:23.250> out<00:02:23.310> when<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.330> know<00:02:24.450> maybe<00:02:24.690> this

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
figure out when you know maybe this

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.170 
figure out when you know maybe this
water<00:02:25.260> will<00:02:25.739> receive<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.700> winds<00:02:27.090> are

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
water will receive the winds are

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.210 
water will receive the winds are
actually<00:02:27.599> picking<00:02:27.870> up<00:02:28.110> but<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.470> rain<00:02:28.739> seems

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
actually picking up but the rain seems

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.160 
actually picking up but the rain seems
to<00:02:29.310> have<00:02:29.550> slowed<00:02:29.819> down<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:30.120> little<00:02:30.420> bit<00:02:30.690> which

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
to have slowed down a little bit which

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.229 
to have slowed down a little bit which
you<00:02:31.860> know<00:02:31.980> we're<00:02:32.160> hoping<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> good<00:02:32.970> sign

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
you know we're hoping is a good sign

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.270 
you know we're hoping is a good sign
where<00:02:33.480> we<00:02:33.660> are<00:02:33.840> Catherine<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.650> water<00:02:35.040> would

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
where we are Catherine the water would

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.699 
where we are Catherine the water would
rush<00:02:35.519> north<00:02:35.940> because<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:37.080> dam<00:02:37.349> is<00:02:37.560> at<00:02:37.680> a

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
rush north because the the dam is at a

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.320 
rush north because the the dam is at a
higher<00:02:37.980> elevation<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.880> water<00:02:39.120> would

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
higher elevation and the water would

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.470 
higher elevation and the water would
come<00:02:39.360> down<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.780> hill<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:41.220> that

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
come down a hill on you in that

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.430 
come down a hill on you in that
unthinkable<00:02:42.480> situation<00:02:43.049> is<00:02:43.170> what<00:02:43.319> you're

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
unthinkable situation is what you're

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.729 
unthinkable situation is what you're
saying<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:44.660> believe<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.989> know<00:02:46.140> what<00:02:46.319> separate

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
saying I believe you know what separate

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.860 
saying I believe you know what separate
I'm<00:02:46.890> not<00:02:47.099> exactly<00:02:47.580> positive<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.360> that's<00:02:48.630> the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
I'm not exactly positive that that's the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.559 
I'm not exactly positive that that's the
case<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.349> believe<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.860> is<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.069> way<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:51.269> water

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
case I believe it is the way the water

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.199 
case I believe it is the way the water
will<00:02:51.989> run<00:02:52.290> toward<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.799> Mohawk<00:02:53.430> River<00:02:53.730> which

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
will run toward the Mohawk River which

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.080 
will run toward the Mohawk River which
is<00:02:54.360> one<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.660> our<00:02:54.780> major<00:02:54.989> rivers<00:02:55.560> over<00:02:55.860> here<00:02:56.190> so

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
is one of our major rivers over here so

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.120 
is one of our major rivers over here so
I'm<00:02:57.269> not<00:02:57.299> sure<00:02:57.690> it's<00:02:58.079> you<00:02:58.500> know<00:02:58.650> matter<00:02:58.920> of

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
I'm not sure it's you know matter of

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.280 
I'm not sure it's you know matter of
elevation<00:02:59.790> but<00:03:00.090> that's<00:03:00.329> exactly<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.989> way<00:03:01.140> the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
elevation but that's exactly the way the

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.800 
elevation but that's exactly the way the
water<00:03:01.500> would<00:03:01.799> flow<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:02.579> we<00:03:02.910> are<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:03.299> that<00:03:03.480> path

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
water would flow and we are in that path

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.140 
water would flow and we are in that path
here<00:03:04.380> in<00:03:04.470> Middleburg<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.130> said<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.579> sirens
