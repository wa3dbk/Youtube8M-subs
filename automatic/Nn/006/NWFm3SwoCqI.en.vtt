00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.300
 with the architect adriana wagner 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.280
 She tells you how to decorate a house. 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.389
 entirely inspired by the style 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.000
 American 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.609
 the detail is that most of the furniture was 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.090
 purchased over the internet and imported from 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.090
 U.S 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.939
 I'll show you today 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.450
 the design of a house that was 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.120
 reviewed this month's development 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.489
 this project was very interesting is I 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.500
 I actively participated here together 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.480
 with my clients since the choice of 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.820
 and my clients were 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.039
 living in the United States and all 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.219
 process were done by e-mail 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.460
 on the front of the house I used a mix of 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.370
 door frames all 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.550
 white to contrast with the color of the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.550
 walls 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.110
 I tried to use the white tones and the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.110
 rusticity some materials 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.300
 the social dining room are part of the 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.270
 same environment 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.980
 It is in the social environment that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.670
 interesting was the detailing of the 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:24.570
 fireplace with American style fireplace 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.210
 It was detailed by me sent to 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.670
 my clients are in the united states 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.070
 to be performed there when it arrived here 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.890
 in brazil it 's a way to the joinery 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.480
 to do the painting part and then 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.820
 to be installed in the room environment 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.840
 I have tried to follow a certain 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.090
 symmetry of large window openings 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.300
 the opening of photos linking the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:57.180
 environments to the detailing of the 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.790
 ceiling a highlight that I gave to the room 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.500
 was to use a paper of 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.840
 chinese wall 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.790
 this wallpaper and was purchased 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.340
 on one of my clients' trips to 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.340
 China and it has a great value 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.600
 in intimate speech we used a couch in 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.750
 natural leather 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.050
 thinking about the practicality at the central table 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.770
 in wood to bring the rusticity 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:32.970
 environment and also some engravings and 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:37.080
 butterflies the rug is with a print 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.300
 animal in the grill room was 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.180
 the environment was extremely pleasant 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.270
 and has an excellent sunshine it was 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.410
 formatted in a way where you receive it 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.340
 would look nice in the 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.740
 washbasin 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.070
 we use a total wall that 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:59.190
 came from England in a dark tone of 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.710
 brown that also gives a warmth the 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.750
 contrast in the rest of the house that is 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.700
 practically all in light tones 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.890
 When we enter the house we have a 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.910
 focal point that the ladder that gives access 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.670
 the upper deck is for 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.320
 characterize with more every American I 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.410
 I tried to follow the lines of 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.430
 wooden bodyguards all stranded 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.730
 in a detail that gave a great key in the 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:31.700
 upper floor are located two 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:35.340
 guest suites and master suite 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.310
 in the guest suites we use the 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.070
 beds and some furniture they already made 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.230
 part of the client's collection 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.630
 the master suite the environment that was 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.810
 very cozy as a main point 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.560
 she has a large fireplace in front of the 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.100
 bed 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.760
 we have a big bed on a head 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.930
 the side tables that make up 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.110
 with the bed 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.420
 highlight of the master suite bathroom is the 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.239
 carved wood bench with top 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.910
 in marble and also the large mirrors 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.530
 who were positioned in front of it 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.830
 This was an extremely 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.769
 pleasurable to be executed from the 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.070

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.470
 up to the interior part and showed how 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.820
 integration is very important.
