 unhooked a rolling metal sphere 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:59.789
 down his sweet road as long as it is 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.739
 thus ended the insignificant short

 career of basil of baker street 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.460
 as much as six stripes 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.070

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:19.240

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.240
 would never fall into similar too 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:04.840
 ahead now torino intent then to brake 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:08.530
 what will be because and I go out and succeed 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.540
 all this was smarter well 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:18.880
 if the typical defeated teased 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.920
 ridiculed at least himself 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.290
