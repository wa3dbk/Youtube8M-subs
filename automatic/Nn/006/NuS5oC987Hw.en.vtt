 we want this project to be 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.960
 in the medium term, since it is really a 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.119

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.540
 to the community 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.979
 to observe this spectacle of nature 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.659
 it is necessary to enter before dawn in the wild terrain of the

 not bad 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.310
 canyon where it was kept 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.860
 one 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.240
 one 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.240
 a future 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.100
 we are at a height of 300 meters 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.759
 we have walked about 1,800 meters or so 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:16.450
 the point of agreement 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.960
 the author we have a 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.759
 deciduous forest 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.839
 p we have some like the white tail deer 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:25.459

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.919
 designated by the pochote flower that the family of homemade bombs 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.739
 we have today as your defense feeding 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.549
 of this animal the walk is heavy the inclement heat but in turn 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.469
 enriching 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:49.309
 I wish I had the opportunity of where not even to know this site that is spectacular 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:51.510
 hence they take a little bit of this 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.500
 the engraving in the mind and in the heart because really it is something that you have left 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.509
 with everyone for life 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:00.869
 tell us what another medicinal plant is here in this 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:03.799
 dt low deciduous forest area as back 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.719
 they measure against a 0 4 dollars p 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.419
 That works for 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:10.159
 Has many 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.459
 this information how you can occupy properties the list 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:20.119
 the gastritis cancer a wound even the powder are very good and are 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:22.729
 recommendable 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:25.509
 therefore they are for the doctors sometimes 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:30.929
 the effort is worth the beauty of the plumage of this adventure from the red 

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:35.120
 crimson on the front to the different shades of green 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.930
 contrasted with the cobalt blue of the auction of their acts in a dance at 800 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.449
 meters of altitude 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.219

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:48.420
 four older than him 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.900
 that here to milan i 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.900
 I think it's very important everything sensitizes everyone with respect 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:58.109
 the importance that the environment plays in our day to day in the 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.069
 as we have the opportunity to experience a site like this I think 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.039
 that we are going to become more aware and really worry about the environment 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:09.999
 environment the macaw is a bird that hardly exceeds a kilo and a half 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:14.290
 his outstretched wings can reach the subway and have a 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:19.819
 length of 75 centimeters is the second largest in mexico after 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:21.329
 of the red mayan coast 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.080
