step<00:02:00.390> further<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:00.900> it's<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.290> why<00:02:01.860> isn't

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
step further and it's like why isn't

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.740 
step further and it's like why isn't
there<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.490> five<00:02:02.850> hundred<00:02:03.030> thousand<00:02:03.570> year

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
there like a five hundred thousand year

thousand years you know well if we know
that<00:02:13.110> how<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.470> couldn't<00:02:13.980> go<00:02:14.130> back<00:02:14.280> farther

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
that how I couldn't go back farther

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.550 
that how I couldn't go back farther
earth<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.570> over<00:02:15.840> four<00:02:16.140> billion<00:02:16.650> years<00:02:17.070> old<00:02:18.560> you

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
earth is over four billion years old you

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.110 
earth is over four billion years old you
know<00:02:19.739> how<00:02:20.370> do<00:02:20.430> we<00:02:20.610> know<00:02:20.790> there<00:02:20.940> wasn't

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
know how do we know there wasn't

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.229 
know how do we know there wasn't

to<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.959> mean<00:02:25.530> everything's<00:02:25.980> buried<00:02:26.310> I

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
to that I mean everything's buried I

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.630 
to that I mean everything's buried I
guess<00:02:27.420> what<00:02:27.570> I'm<00:02:27.690> getting<00:02:27.959> at<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.140> guys<00:02:28.580> why<00:02:29.580> is

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
guess what I'm getting at is guys why is

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.910 
guess what I'm getting at is guys why is
everything<00:02:30.120> buried<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.230> we<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.830> have

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
everything buried so we have to have

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.640 
everything buried so we have to have
archaeologists<00:02:32.610> dig<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.150> up<00:02:33.320> carbon<00:02:34.320> dated

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
archaeologists dig it up carbon dated

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.009 
archaeologists dig it up carbon dated
try<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.700> interpret<00:02:36.330> some<00:02:36.570> of<00:02:36.660> these<00:02:36.750> things

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
try to interpret some of these things

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.190 
try to interpret some of these things
that<00:02:37.260> are<00:02:38.070> discovered<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.850> mean<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.630> took<00:02:40.049> an

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
that are discovered I mean you took an

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.610 
that are discovered I mean you took an
entire<00:02:40.350> villages<00:02:41.280> buried<00:02:42.269> under<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.540> ground

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
entire villages buried under the ground

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.220 
entire villages buried under the ground
and<00:02:45.040> tells<00:02:45.400> me<00:02:45.610> that<00:02:45.819> there<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.239> a<00:02:46.510> repeated

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
and tells me that there is a repeated

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.729 
and tells me that there is a repeated

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
event and a big event that takes place

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.610 
event and a big event that takes place
every<00:02:52.650> X<00:02:53.650> amount<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.159> years<00:02:54.220> whether<00:02:54.819> it<00:02:55.030> be

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
and what causes it it's a question a lot

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.160 
and what causes it it's a question a lot
of<00:03:05.709> us<00:03:05.829> ponder<00:03:06.069> we<00:03:06.400> all<00:03:06.549> ask<00:03:06.879> it<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:08.019> know<00:03:08.140> and

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
of us ponder we all ask it you know and

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.559 
of us ponder we all ask it you know and
you<00:03:08.890> know<00:03:09.129> we<00:03:09.370> take<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.730> angle<00:03:09.849> well<00:03:10.180> is<00:03:10.360> it

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
you know we take the angle well is it

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.309 
you know we take the angle well is it
you<00:03:10.840> know<00:03:10.989> a<00:03:11.290> beer<00:03:12.010> Nibiru<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.700> rogue<00:03:13.090> planet

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
you know a beer Nibiru a rogue planet

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.569 
you know a beer Nibiru a rogue planet
well<00:03:14.319> if<00:03:14.409> it's<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.620> rogue<00:03:14.829> planet<00:03:14.860> it's<00:03:15.370> going

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
well if it's a rogue planet it's going

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.020 
well if it's a rogue planet it's going
to<00:03:15.640> be<00:03:15.730> associated<00:03:16.239> with<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.510> binary<00:03:16.780> star<00:03:18.030> far

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
to be associated with a binary star far

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.210 
to be associated with a binary star far
as<00:03:19.120> I'm<00:03:19.239> concerned<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:20.709> definitely

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
as I'm concerned and I definitely

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.789 
as I'm concerned and I definitely
believe<00:03:21.640> that<00:03:21.879> we<00:03:22.359> have<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.599> binary<00:03:22.930> star<00:03:23.260> I

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
believe that we have a binary star I

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.610 
believe that we have a binary star I
think<00:03:24.099> honestly<00:03:24.519> it's<00:03:25.030> impossible<00:03:25.810> for<00:03:25.989> a

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
think honestly it's impossible for a

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.860 
think honestly it's impossible for a
star<00:03:26.890> system<00:03:27.160> at<00:03:27.760> least<00:03:28.030> not<00:03:28.329> to<00:03:28.540> be<00:03:28.629> binary

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
star system at least not to be binary

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.690 
star system at least not to be binary
some<00:03:29.739> cases<00:03:30.310> try<00:03:31.000> or<00:03:31.269> quad<00:03:31.920> but<00:03:32.920> all<00:03:33.159> the<00:03:33.400> stars

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
some cases try or quad but all the stars

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.640 
some cases try or quad but all the stars
you<00:03:33.970> see<00:03:34.000> at<00:03:34.659> least<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.989> ones<00:03:35.140> that<00:03:35.349> we<00:03:35.470> can

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
you see at least the ones that we can

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.569 
you see at least the ones that we can
locally<00:03:36.069> see<00:03:36.280> they're<00:03:37.150> all<00:03:37.269> interconnected

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
locally see they're all interconnected

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.390 
locally see they're all interconnected
they're<00:03:39.579> they're<00:03:39.819> connected<00:03:40.269> guys<00:03:41.129> but<00:03:42.129> I

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
they're they're connected guys but I

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.050 
they're they're connected guys but I
think<00:03:42.970> that<00:03:43.209> we<00:03:43.959> definitely<00:03:44.109> have<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.530> binary

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
think that we definitely have a binary

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.490 
think that we definitely have a binary
absolutely<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.209> think<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.629> comes<00:03:46.810> through<00:03:47.230> or

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
absolutely I think it comes through or

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.030 
absolutely I think it comes through or
it<00:03:47.680> gets<00:03:47.980> close<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.459> our<00:03:48.880> star<00:03:49.590> every<00:03:50.590> X<00:03:50.799> amount

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
it gets close to our star every X amount

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.849 
it gets close to our star every X amount
of<00:03:51.160> years<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.700> couldn't<00:03:52.599> tell<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.290> don't

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
of years I couldn't tell you I don't

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.460 
of years I couldn't tell you I don't
think<00:03:53.919> anybody<00:03:54.459> really<00:03:54.849> truly<00:03:55.269> knows<00:03:55.510> maybe

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
think anybody really truly knows maybe

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.860 
think anybody really truly knows maybe
they<00:03:56.739> do<00:03:56.799> if<00:03:57.760> they<00:03:58.000> do<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.180> don't<00:03:58.510> think<00:03:58.690> they're

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
they do if they do I don't think they're

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.949 
they do if they do I don't think they're
really<00:03:58.989> truly<00:03:59.799> telling<00:04:00.190> but<00:04:00.720> that's<00:04:01.720> why<00:04:01.930> our

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
really truly telling but that's why our

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.430 
really truly telling but that's why our
past<00:04:02.410> is<00:04:02.680> is<00:04:02.919> all<00:04:03.310> buried<00:04:03.760> underground<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:05.319> we

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
past is is all buried underground and we

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.809 
past is is all buried underground and we
don't<00:04:05.590> have<00:04:05.799> that<00:04:05.859> five<00:04:06.190> hundred<00:04:06.489> thousand

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
don't have that five hundred thousand

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.159 
don't have that five hundred thousand

may<00:04:08.379> be<00:04:08.410> handed<00:04:09.010> down<00:04:09.040> so<00:04:09.400> we<00:04:09.489> can<00:04:09.609> look<00:04:09.819> and

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
may be handed down so we can look and

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.159 
may be handed down so we can look and
say<00:04:10.090> oh<00:04:10.120> yeah<00:04:10.389> this<00:04:10.510> is<00:04:10.569> what<00:04:10.810> happened<00:04:11.109> you

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
say oh yeah this is what happened you

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.839 
say oh yeah this is what happened you
know<00:04:11.290> three<00:04:12.010> hundred<00:04:12.220> thousand<00:04:12.549> years<00:04:12.730> ago

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
know three hundred thousand years ago

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.610 
know three hundred thousand years ago
maybe<00:04:13.629> a<00:04:13.750> little<00:04:13.930> bit<00:04:14.109> difficult<00:04:14.290> to

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
maybe a little bit difficult to

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.680 
maybe a little bit difficult to
interpret<00:04:14.949> but<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:16.239> know<00:04:16.389> you'd<00:04:16.660> have

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
interpret but you know you'd have

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.140 
interpret but you know you'd have
something<00:04:17.169> standing<00:04:17.739> we<00:04:17.889> have<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.760> Mayan

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
something standing we have the the Mayan

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.539 
something standing we have the the Mayan
pyramids<00:04:19.720> and<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.019> Egyptian<00:04:20.500> pyramids<00:04:20.739> and

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
pyramids and the Egyptian pyramids and

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.670 
pyramids and the Egyptian pyramids and
all<00:04:22.000> kinds<00:04:22.419> of<00:04:22.510> cool<00:04:22.690> things<00:04:22.720> like<00:04:23.050> that<00:04:23.380> that

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
all kinds of cool things like that that

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.629 
all kinds of cool things like that that
we<00:04:23.740> see<00:04:24.660> that<00:04:25.660> our<00:04:26.220> incredible<00:04:27.220> engineering

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
we see that our incredible engineering

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.040 
we see that our incredible engineering
feats<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.240> would<00:04:28.449> be<00:04:28.539> hard<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:28.840> even

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
feats that would be hard to even

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.980 
feats that would be hard to even
replicate<00:04:29.560> today<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:31.690> have<00:04:31.780> to<00:04:31.900> ask

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
replicate today and you have to ask

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.120 
replicate today and you have to ask
yourself<00:04:32.139> you<00:04:32.470> know<00:04:32.560> what<00:04:32.740> happened<00:04:32.949> to<00:04:32.979> those

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
yourself you know what happened to those

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.520 
yourself you know what happened to those
civilizations<00:04:33.520> to<00:04:34.150> you<00:04:34.599> know<00:04:34.780> what<00:04:35.440> I'm

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
civilizations to you know what I'm

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.920 
civilizations to you know what I'm
talking<00:04:35.560> about<00:04:35.800> one's<00:04:36.130> way<00:04:36.639> back<00:04:37.030> earth<00:04:37.660> is

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
talking about one's way back earth is

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.070 
talking about one's way back earth is
over<00:04:38.169> four<00:04:38.410> billion<00:04:38.650> years<00:04:38.889> old<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:39.599> it's<00:04:40.599> had

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
over four billion years old and it's had

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.020 
over four billion years old and it's had
to<00:04:41.349> have<00:04:41.440> been<00:04:41.470> home<00:04:41.830> to<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.610> so<00:04:42.849> many

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
to have been home to to so many

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.890 
to have been home to to so many
creatures

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
creatures

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.600 
creatures
and<00:04:45.440> we're<00:04:45.710> finding<00:04:46.100> them<00:04:46.220> buried

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
and we're finding them buried

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.879 
and we're finding them buried
underground<00:04:46.880> but<00:04:47.330> why<00:04:47.509> why<00:04:48.500> do<00:04:48.560> we<00:04:48.770> have

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
underground but why why do we have

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.790 
underground but why why do we have
archaeologists<00:04:49.870> why<00:04:50.870> is<00:04:50.930> all<00:04:51.229> of<00:04:51.259> our<00:04:51.530> past

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
archaeologists why is all of our past

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.840 
archaeologists why is all of our past
buried<00:04:52.580> underground<00:04:53.000> what<00:04:53.660> causes<00:04:54.169> it

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
buried underground what causes it

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.330 
buried underground what causes it
something<00:04:55.850> does<00:04:56.060> and<00:04:56.330> it's<00:04:56.449> big<00:04:57.009> it<00:04:58.009> doesn't

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
something does and it's big it doesn't

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.999 
something does and it's big it doesn't
just<00:04:58.370> affect<00:04:58.610> earth<00:04:59.030> it<00:04:59.419> affects<00:04:59.720> every<00:05:00.080> orb

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
just affect earth it affects every orb

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:06.340 
just affect earth it affects every orb
in<00:05:01.430> this<00:05:01.610> solar<00:05:01.880> system<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.690> Sun<00:05:05.080> so<00:05:06.080> I

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
in this solar system and the Sun so I

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.689 
in this solar system and the Sun so I
don't<00:05:06.650> know<00:05:06.710> guys<00:05:06.889> I'm<00:05:07.130> just<00:05:07.310> thinking<00:05:07.610> out

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
don't know guys I'm just thinking out

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:08.860 
don't know guys I'm just thinking out
loud<00:05:07.759> but<00:05:08.060> those<00:05:08.270> are<00:05:08.419> things<00:05:08.539> that<00:05:08.660> I<00:05:08.810> think

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
about a lot and ever since I saw what I

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.070 
about a lot and ever since I saw what I
saw<00:05:14.750> in<00:05:15.110> hydro<00:05:15.530> back<00:05:16.340> in<00:05:16.490> 2012<00:05:17.300> I<00:05:17.539> am<00:05:17.810> not

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
saw in hydro back in 2012 I am not

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.010 
saw in hydro back in 2012 I am not
backing<00:05:18.350> down<00:05:18.560> from<00:05:18.919> my<00:05:19.130> claim<00:05:19.729> I<00:05:20.030> saw<00:05:20.990> a

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
backing down from my claim I saw a

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.040 
backing down from my claim I saw a
neutron<00:05:21.500> star<00:05:21.530> in<00:05:21.949> Hydra<00:05:22.750> like<00:05:23.750> it<00:05:23.900> or<00:05:24.020> not

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
neutron star in Hydra like it or not

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.180 
neutron star in Hydra like it or not
that's<00:05:24.560> a<00:05:24.770> fact<00:05:25.160> and<00:05:25.720> I<00:05:26.720> begged<00:05:27.110> NASA<00:05:27.650> I<00:05:27.680> begged

was seeing I did my own research what I

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.980 
was seeing I did my own research what I
was<00:05:40.010> seeing<00:05:40.250> was<00:05:40.789> consistent<00:05:41.419> with<00:05:41.449> a<00:05:41.539> neutron

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
was seeing was consistent with a neutron

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.529 
was seeing was consistent with a neutron
star<00:05:42.020> I<00:05:42.590> know<00:05:43.220> it's<00:05:43.639> impossible<00:05:43.910> for<00:05:44.300> a<00:05:44.479> human

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
star I know it's impossible for a human

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.990 
star I know it's impossible for a human
to<00:05:44.930> see<00:05:45.259> it<00:05:45.349> with<00:05:45.500> the<00:05:45.620> naked<00:05:45.650> eye<00:05:46.039> no<00:05:46.610> it's<00:05:46.880> not

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
to see it with the naked eye no it's not

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.839 
to see it with the naked eye no it's not
and<00:05:47.479> I<00:05:48.139> will<00:05:48.380> debate<00:05:48.800> that<00:05:49.099> with<00:05:49.280> anybody<00:05:49.610> on

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
and I will debate that with anybody on

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:53.620 
and I will debate that with anybody on
this<00:05:50.120> globe<00:05:50.449> I<00:05:50.979> saw<00:05:51.979> it<00:05:52.130> 75<00:05:52.789> different<00:05:53.120> times

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
this globe I saw it 75 different times

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.189 
this globe I saw it 75 different times
and<00:05:54.669> it<00:05:55.669> has<00:05:55.849> the<00:05:56.000> personality<00:05:56.240> of<00:05:56.660> a<00:05:56.810> neutron

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
and it has the personality of a neutron

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.290 
and it has the personality of a neutron
star<00:05:57.260> how<00:05:58.010> did<00:05:58.220> I<00:05:58.340> see<00:05:58.580> it<00:05:58.699> I<00:05:58.880> don't<00:05:59.150> know<00:05:59.270> man

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
she waited about three minutes then she

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.580 
she waited about three minutes then she
went<00:06:15.590> oh<00:06:16.330> she<00:06:17.330> then<00:06:17.360> she<00:06:17.870> saw<00:06:18.080> what<00:06:18.320> i<00:06:18.349> was

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
went oh she then she saw what i was

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.710 
went oh she then she saw what i was
looking<00:06:18.620> at<00:06:18.979> she<00:06:19.220> saw<00:06:19.430> two<00:06:19.490> she<00:06:20.210> saw<00:06:20.419> three

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
looking at she saw two she saw three

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.379 
looking at she saw two she saw three
different<00:06:21.050> times<00:06:21.669> it's<00:06:22.669> there<00:06:22.880> guys<00:06:23.060> there's

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
different times it's there guys there's

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:24.760 
different times it's there guys there's
something<00:06:23.720> there<00:06:23.870> i<00:06:23.900> think<00:06:24.199> its<00:06:24.289> associated

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
something there i think its associated

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.510 
something there i think its associated
with<00:06:25.010> the<00:06:25.099> binary<00:06:25.520> companion<00:06:26.090> of<00:06:26.210> our<00:06:26.360> son

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
with the binary companion of our son

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.490 
with the binary companion of our son
obviously<00:06:28.520> it's<00:06:28.669> probably<00:06:29.120> got<00:06:29.900> a<00:06:29.930> planetary

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
obviously it's probably got a planetary

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.430 
obviously it's probably got a planetary
family<00:06:30.860> of<00:06:30.979> its<00:06:31.130> own

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.160 

and<00:06:33.530> it<00:06:34.430> goes<00:06:34.640> by<00:06:34.910> many<00:06:35.060> names<00:06:35.390> and<00:06:35.960> you<00:06:36.050> know

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170 
and it goes by many names and you know

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.100 
and it goes by many names and you know
what<00:06:36.290> I'm<00:06:36.380> talking<00:06:36.410> about<00:06:37.450> so<00:06:38.450> I<00:06:38.780> think<00:06:38.900> it's

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
what I'm talking about so I think it's

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.560 
what I'm talking about so I think it's
getting<00:06:39.230> close<00:06:39.560> I<00:06:39.860> think<00:06:40.070> that's<00:06:40.390> part<00:06:41.390> of<00:06:41.450> why

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
getting close I think that's part of why

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.490 
getting close I think that's part of why
the<00:06:41.630> world<00:06:41.960> is<00:06:42.260> so<00:06:42.500> chaotic<00:06:42.740> today<00:06:44.050> the<00:06:45.050> earth

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
the world is so chaotic today the earth

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.800 
the world is so chaotic today the earth
is<00:06:45.710> like<00:06:45.740> a<00:06:45.890> powder<00:06:46.160> keg<00:06:46.400> I<00:06:46.760> mean<00:06:47.510> there<00:06:47.690> is

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
is like a powder keg I mean there is

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.200 
is like a powder keg I mean there is
dysfunction<00:06:48.590> and<00:06:48.770> all<00:06:49.220> all<00:06:49.790> the<00:06:50.000> way<00:06:50.090> around

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
dysfunction and all all the way around

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:56.080 
dysfunction and all all the way around
this<00:06:50.510> earth<00:06:50.780> and<00:06:51.700> I<00:06:53.980> think<00:06:54.980> it's<00:06:55.160> this<00:06:55.610> is<00:06:55.820> part

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.090 
this earth and I think it's this is part

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.230 
this earth and I think it's this is part
of<00:06:56.240> it<00:06:57.340> what<00:06:58.340> time<00:06:58.520> will<00:06:58.670> tell<00:06:58.790> but<00:06:58.850> anyway

00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 
of it what time will tell but anyway

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.150 
of it what time will tell but anyway
