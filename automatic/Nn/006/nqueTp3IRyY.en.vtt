00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 I'm pens nicholas cashews and 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.719
 I am currently working 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.230
 give violin lessons in the levels 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.220
 basic of it 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.030
 many years I have dedicated myself to what 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:22.060
 same I am currently retired from 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:24.250
 musician as symphonic orchestra 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.610
 then just be dedicating to the 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.610
 teaching 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.970
 in this book I am making known 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.370
 many techniques taught me that 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.070
 it is very useful for the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.780
 development as a violinist and 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.730
 later I continued developing 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.020
 about the system and I have continued giving 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.860
 the classes based on this system where 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.320
 the real resources but it really was 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.790
 something that I face in Argentina with a 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.850
 teacher who gives the concert 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.630
 of schools to see touch after 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.180
 many years 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.460
 I'm still in the investigation 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.670
 and write another book 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.390
 which is more than anything about work 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.150
 of the left hand 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.010
 in this work of the left hand I 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:23.180
 I focused because I saw that it helped a lot 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.180
 in relaxation 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.800
 relaxation then this book is already 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.120
 such 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.190
 with color images and tones are not 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.130
 these are only books properly of 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.400
 music to read but based almost 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.680
 exclusively in the technical part almost 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 this in the technical part 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.960
 this is the cover 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:55.619
 according to the doctor chÃ¡vira who is dedicated 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.450
 physical rehabilitation problems she 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.420
 He said there is a problem worldwide 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.820
 that affects the instrumentalists of 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.750
 rope that says it is given in the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.050
 nerves in median and ulnar social are 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.170
 are affected it is very important that a 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.610
 Berlin student or a violinist 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:21.090
 While his bow because otherwise no 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.120
 there is no one you are in the 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.220
 excursion then it is very important 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.600
 know many bow strokes 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.250
 then in the first book 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:37.310
 I learned that I mentioned 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.470
 I learned 16 and exercises that helped me 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.690
 right richest of games at least 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.640
 to have more security one of them by 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.780
 example are are broad movements are 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.780
 broad moments for example 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.190
 A) Yes 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.440
 and 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.850
 everything etc and then there is another one that starts 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.850
 with an attack on the tip 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.610
 that then everything is done on scales 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.850
 different scales are handled first in 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.800
 first position after 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.950
 Longer scales in three octaves 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.950
 so he 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.710
 Later we have another one that is 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.190
 we call hammock or swing that comes 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.190
 down 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.610
 then there is another one called resumed 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.840
 in short there are many called double 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.840
 point 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:00.810
 Y 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.240
 the fact of managing relaxation 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.990
 and to have 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.720
 let's say the control of the arms is very 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.240
 important because that gives greater security 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.740
 I'm more like I discovered it giving 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.420
 lessons 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.420
 a moon that has a little girl 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.760
 when sine 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.760
 I was out of tune fourth finger 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.460
 with my whole arm and from there I 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:35.460
 I started to take care 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.099
 then the left hand refers 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.039
 rather to have many lessons and 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:43.510
 movements are not forcing 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:46.870
 fingers do this movement yes 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:50.670
 but that the arm collaborates a lot in everything 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.670
 what is touched then here 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.100
 and the arm is fundamental 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.020
 then develop the whole system but 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.650
 apart from that afterwards I complement it 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.070
 with a lot because it includes movement 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.620
 side 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.250
 a longitudinal and micro movement 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.250
 positions
