compartment okay now

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.960 
compartment okay now
finally<00:02:18.239> there<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.750> one<00:02:18.870> more<00:02:19.170> compartment

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
finally there is one more compartment

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.750 
finally there is one more compartment
which<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.090> back<00:02:21.239> here<00:02:21.829> you<00:02:22.829> know<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.489> flat

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
which is back here you know it's flat

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.479 
which is back here you know it's flat
put<00:02:24.599> my<00:02:24.750> extra<00:02:25.560> spare<00:02:25.769> pants<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.189> there

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
okay now the final flaw is I haven't

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.660 
okay now the final flaw is I haven't
noticed<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.769> see<00:02:28.950> how<00:02:29.099> it's<00:02:29.280> hanging<00:02:29.519> on

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
noticed is you see how it's hanging on

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.319 
noticed is you see how it's hanging on
Mel's<00:02:29.909> back<00:02:30.349> yeah

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
Mel's back yeah

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.059 
Mel's back yeah
dum-dum<00:02:33.329> max<00:02:33.659> position<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.680> do<00:02:34.799> all<00:02:34.950> that

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
dum-dum max position you do all that

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.229 
dum-dum max position you do all that
ingenious<00:02:35.400> nests<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.819> then<00:02:35.939> you<00:02:36.030> can't

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
ingenious nests and then you can't

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.809 
ingenious nests and then you can't
figure<00:02:36.420> out<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.920> put<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.310> strap<00:02:38.670> in

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
figure out that you put that strap in

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.610 
figure out that you put that strap in
that<00:02:38.939> corner<00:02:39.299> this<00:02:39.689> bag<00:02:39.930> weighs<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.530> goes

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
that corner this bag weighs and goes

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.920 
that corner this bag weighs and goes
like<00:02:40.739> that<00:02:40.879> why<00:02:41.879> like<00:02:42.239> if<00:02:42.269> anything<00:02:42.659> it<00:02:42.840> should

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
like that why like if anything it should

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.649 
like that why like if anything it should
be<00:02:42.989> this<00:02:43.260> on<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:43.980> corner<00:02:44.519> so<00:02:45.180> then<00:02:45.359> it<00:02:45.480> weighs

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
be this on this corner so then it weighs

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:46.970 
be this on this corner so then it weighs
out<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.140> way<00:02:46.290> which<00:02:46.439> goes<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.829> direction

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
out that way which goes that direction

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.099 
out that way which goes that direction
which<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.609> anyway<00:02:47.879> we<00:02:48.030> give<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.450> crowd<00:02:48.659> I'll

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
which is anyway we give the crowd I'll

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.899 
which is anyway we give the crowd I'll
put<00:02:49.319> it<00:02:49.379> down<00:02:49.409> the<00:02:49.650> middle<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:50.069> know<00:02:50.099> but<00:02:50.819> they

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
put it down the middle you know but they

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.399 
put it down the middle you know but they
put<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.120> right<00:02:51.329> there<00:02:51.540> on<00:02:51.569> that<00:02:51.659> side<00:02:52.019> instead

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
put it right there on that side instead

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.300 
put it right there on that side instead
and<00:02:52.709> CCI<00:02:53.069> keeps<00:02:53.340> hanging<00:02:53.519> off<00:02:54.049> so<00:02:55.250> now<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
and CCI keeps hanging off so now the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.369 
and CCI keeps hanging off so now the
cool<00:02:56.519> thing<00:02:56.549> about<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.909> bag<00:02:57.060> most<00:02:57.420> turn

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
cool thing about the bag most turn

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.369 
cool thing about the bag most turn
around<00:02:59.450> is<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.599> you<00:03:00.690> can<00:03:00.810> turn<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.139> forward

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
around is that you can turn it forward

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
something I move around something you

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.379 
something I move around something you

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
that makes it cool but the flow of not

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.979 
that makes it cool but the flow of not
being<00:03:27.150> able<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.329> hold<00:03:27.480> enough<00:03:27.720> water
