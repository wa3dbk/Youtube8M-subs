00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
have enough survivability even with that

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.130

to<00:05:07.260> do<00:05:07.380> that<00:05:07.410> anywhere<00:05:07.980> between<00:05:08.360> one<00:05:09.360> to<00:05:09.390> three

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
to do that anywhere between one to three

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.010 
to do that anywhere between one to three
times<00:05:10.070> depending<00:05:11.070> on<00:05:11.190> how<00:05:11.280> lucky<00:05:11.610> you<00:05:11.670> are

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
times depending on how lucky you are

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.740 
times depending on how lucky you are
I've<00:05:13.020> been<00:05:13.170> lucky<00:05:13.290> so<00:05:13.440> far<00:05:13.620> gone<00:05:14.280> through<00:05:14.750> two

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
I've been lucky so far gone through two

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.180 
I've been lucky so far gone through two
rounds<00:05:15.900> here<00:05:16.200> without<00:05:16.350> having<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:16.890> do<00:05:16.950> it<00:05:17.010> at

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
rounds here without having to do it at

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
rounds here without having to do it at
all<00:05:17.250> so<00:05:18.060> that's<00:05:18.240> good

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.950 

so<00:05:25.050> many<00:05:25.199> thousand<00:05:25.560> experience<00:05:26.009> that<00:05:26.160> time<00:05:26.960> if

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
so many thousand experience that time if

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.529 
so many thousand experience that time if
you<00:05:28.139> do<00:05:28.259> bring<00:05:28.380> a<00:05:28.500> level<00:05:28.620> one<00:05:29.389> you're<00:05:30.389> going<00:05:30.479> to

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
you do bring a level one you're going to

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.180 
you do bring a level one you're going to
find<00:05:30.750> the<00:05:31.169> first<00:05:31.380> rail<00:05:31.560> is<00:05:31.680> probably<00:05:31.919> going<00:05:32.069> to

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
find the first rail is probably going to

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.999 
find the first rail is probably going to
take<00:05:32.280> them<00:05:32.400> to<00:05:32.520> level<00:05:32.759> 14<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:34.680> next<00:05:34.889> round

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009 
take them to level 14 the next round

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:36.920 
take them to level 14 the next round
will<00:05:35.220> bring<00:05:35.370> them<00:05:35.490> to<00:05:35.580> level<00:05:35.849> 17<00:05:36.270> the<00:05:36.720> next

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
will bring them to level 17 the next

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.930 
will bring them to level 17 the next
round<00:05:37.110> will<00:05:37.199> burn<00:05:37.319> over<00:05:37.349> level<00:05:37.770> 20<00:05:38.039> and<00:05:38.220> then

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
round will burn over level 20 and then

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.790 
round will burn over level 20 and then
it'll<00:05:39.060> slow<00:05:39.270> down<00:05:39.300> from<00:05:39.660> there<00:05:39.870> so<00:05:40.500> that's

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
it'll slow down from there so that's
