00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.560
 that is trick number 8 of the 100 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.440
 best tricks for photoshop first 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.500
 dedicated to the automation of works 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.810
 that this program offers us 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.660
 automate repetitive tasks we 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.550
 saves a lot of monotonous work 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.730
 and boring and it's one of the best 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.349
 helps that photoshop offers us that 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.869
 It has different systems of 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.789
 automation of which we will see about 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.640
 how many witnesses over the 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.860
 first is the command to cut and 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.340
 straighten the photos that you find 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.930
 within the file menu automate this 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.360
 command what it does is detect 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.850
 automatically multiple images that 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.840
 they are inside a single file 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.930
 separating the straightens and puts 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.109
 in different files its use more 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.940
 usual is for jobs with a scanner 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:01.180
 if we have to scan multiple 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.039
 images we can do it with all of 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.530
 once or those that take inside the 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.530
 size of the scanner and then allow that 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.290
 be photoshop automatically 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.750
 Cut straightens them and turns them into a 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.780
 separate input file looks like something 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.869
 impossible but it is not really for 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.810
 certain people can be from a 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.450
 huge help in the only rule that should 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.670
 to comply with the file so that it works 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.680
 this command is that you have to keep 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.869
 some separation between the images 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.690
 so you know that photoshop can 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.060
 detect the edges an example like the 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.210
 that we have here on the screen can be 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.640
 valid as I say with scanned images 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.039
 but it can also be done with another 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.690
 type of book images although already 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.390
 I take that to work it is necessary 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.000
 there is a clear separation between 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.819
 what is not necessary is that 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.520
 are straight photoshop is already going to 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.229
 charge to straighten the two by one 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.110
 again it is a trick that you have to 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.740
 know the expertise to use it is from 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.019
 zero of 0.5 as much here we have the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.000
 image that adapts to the conditions 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.700
 what we said and we're just going to 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.140
 file automate you see how it is here 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.130
 they include different actions 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.500
 automated 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.020
 some of which we will see in some 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.870
 another trick and here we have cut out and 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.270
 straighten photographs click on the 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.610
 command and photoshop takes place so 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.740
 very fast the process that looks like 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.540
 shows us now the images each 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.760
 of them from a file perfectly 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.100
 trimmed and straightened here we have 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.020
 one here we have the other that appeared 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.330
 crooked if you remember in the image 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.970
 original here we have the third and here 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.130
 we have the fourth the four in his 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.380
 original size that I had in this 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.870
 file in its own file and 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.790
 perfectly straightened I say that 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.920
 for people who used a lot of scanner or in 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.800
 some other type of images that 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.140
 can search the internet for their use 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.390
 be really useful to get rid of 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.310
 a lot of repetitive work although it would not be 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.020
 too much time to have to cut back and 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.000
 save each of these images in a 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.280
 file so the can even 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.590
 cut these that are twisted then 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.390
 in short is not that it is tremendously 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.210
 complicated but it does take time and it's 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.110
 boring so new tricks what 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.110
 hide see you
