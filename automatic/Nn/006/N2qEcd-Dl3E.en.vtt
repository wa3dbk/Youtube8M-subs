00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.840
 saleh who asks today I you 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.090
 learn business little trick all 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.330
 GÃ©raud ways we will say with dough 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.339
 fimo and then with spinach from the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
 feta and a little bit of counting for 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.310
 right now 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.720
 how does everything take your steps from 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.369
 philo who wanted to separate one by one 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.679
 the files hop where take a brush 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:36.260
 with a little melted butter or medard 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.260
 which is so good to be too much apart 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:45.149
 take our fact and then you have it 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:54.449
 shifted just a little bit see I'm going 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:57.149
 shifted so we come back two hours then 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.260
 there we continue our operations while 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:05.160
 rotating as and when shifting 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:09.480
 our sheet see special tax that's it 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.180
 will give a thickness done once and 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:18.890
 we did everything an almost Account 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.910
 this is going to put it in a mold 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.640
 it shows right away what we will have 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.320
 I did all my done now 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.370
 will take a good month never been a fan 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.990
 you have a pan that's the same too 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.970
 the ideal is that you can have 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.330
 something to heat in 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.650
 below a little bit in the fire for just 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.450
 to make columns a little bit paw 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.570
 underneath so see a tefal that I 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.290
 take the dough she's doing her best 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.290
 attack 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.350
 now we'll leave that on the side 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.730
 the math in the fridge while waiting then 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.470
 play my name I should come back but 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.760
 corsa spinach have enough shoots 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.190
 spinach you can take some 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.170
 normal spinach it makes your problem 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.670
 you can take on game too but 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.380
 Frozen must be well drained 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.390
 after which we really pay attention 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.190
 because it's full of water there we go 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.600
 just do it so you have it well 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.030
 before that it's important 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.050
 so there to go to fries we go 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.240
 get them grabbed we'll do them 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.310
 spit out their juice and then let 's leave 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.620
 reproduce listen to them after I get 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.620
 crazy there remains so see it warms up 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.170
 here in the end is the weight 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.189
 see that overflows flotilla jury at the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.049
 jules volume that had just now 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.819

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.000
 pepper 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:11.090
 or so we'll listen to that okay the least 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.010
 of juice possible so now during 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.950
 that our spinach cold 10 and 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:27.650
