00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.300
 friends with absolute exclusivity 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.460
 Test the new I am 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.820
 and when you talk about what is new, I am the 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.460
 new is not merely a word ornament 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.510
 children or what generates only the 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.510
 Of marketing 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.119
 this is really a new vehicle that has been 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.580
 presented at first hand in the 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.090
 hall of geneva in march 2013 last 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.980
 official launch of the new one that is only 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.040
 Then he repeated the dose in the 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.720
 frankfurt in September 2013 and he 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.420
 continued to appear in 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.690
 January 2014 at the international show 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.870
 detroit's car was now 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.080
 still with a guide star in the lounge 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.299
 detroit 2015 also presented in the 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.710
 paris hall in october 2014 

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:53.290
 therefore the veteran salons 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.330
 international and we what is just 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.549
 with a new platform a platform 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.170
 more he gained some 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:01.809
 centimeters in between axes 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.720
 the platform is much wider and more sensitive 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.180
 here in and there are old or me 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.820
 I drove very old or the impression is 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.079
 that you really are in the crossover of 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.420
 larger size 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.939
 the old south and gave the impression of being 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.789
 another urban crossover this one 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:21.429
 although it has a draw 4 2 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.909
 it seems that the position of whoever 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:28.090
 one of these is silves 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.340
 silves courageous disposable all situation 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.869
 four by four and in the market 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.539
 I was reading this 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.799
 week an article in the American press 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.499
 on the entrance of the reneguei in the market 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.820
 that happens now in March 

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:44.530
 before the arrival of the king of the market 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.749
 that will not happen in 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.740
 April will happen only in May 

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:49.840
 June 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.749
 already a certain delay in production I reneged 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.659
 at the goiana factory in pernambuco but the 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:57.999
 competitor listed by chrysler as 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:03.009
 enemy of the rescue potential which is 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:05.109
 for it is I who am the new sun the king of 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.780
 a vehicle of a slightly larger size than the 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:11.470
 old southern but with the same size 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.550
 segment of this new sound and it state 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.820
 How did I see the suv? 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.940
 is already a medium and civil size is with a 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.160
 capacity even though as I said it is 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.320
 the traction vehicle 4 2 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.250
 here continues to opt for traction 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.410
 forward 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.020
 the engine 1.6 is the engine the same engine 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.090
 competent authority which makes it more 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.590
 mainly due to the competence of the 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.960
 six-speed gearbox 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.750
 this exchange is a very precise exchange rate 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.790
 Sequential is an exchange has six 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.550
 speeds it can be automatic 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.310
 sequential and if you want to enjoy 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.690
 really all the power of 128 you 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.400
 will have to work a little more on 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:55.070
 exchange is not a power and hiss is not 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.590
 a great power said that it's me I 'm 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.230
 here I confess that as is my 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.090
 first contact because I'm here at 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.820
 gaucho coast I have a certain 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.100
 difficulty with exchange rates because 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.250
 and went down and up 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.230
 Descendants are down and I 've seen the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.240
 exchange rate you were testing from another 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.850
 car was good inverse but that bit 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.280
 matter what the refinement is all over the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.820
 orb takoulo materials are materials 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.770
 soft touch quality materials I do not even 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.410
 I remember that the old south had 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.720
 hard plastic materials that impoverished 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.330
 a bit lower though it was a guy 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.380
 excellent handling and also 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:40.130
 note is in addition to a larger size if you notice a 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.709
 stiffness is in the face that is 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.250
 genius of spins that made adjustments that 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:49.160
 platform to make it more rigid in 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.850
 proportional terms, ie 3 - a 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.850
 body shows - lateral and 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.410
 here we are on an asphalt 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.870
 relatively conserved area of the 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.959
 paraguassu on the gaucho coast we do not have 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.050
 there the ways to preserve neither in Brazil nor 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.520
 much less this infernal coastline 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.280
 only by heat it is a heat 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.140
 absurd across brazil championship jumps 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.630
 but also because we have some of the 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.330
 worst floors in Brazil like that 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.480
 infamy leading beaches a way that could 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.280
 to be a tremendous drainage route 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.340
 parallel to the road of the saturated marcanã 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.550
 but there a succession of good holes 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.320
 help me the poor thing here of my 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.199
 that it is only by placing it in a 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.330
 pirambeira brava prove that the car is is 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.010
 It's in the face that he has a good network of 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.919
 work or I do not believe in anyone who 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.560
 tested more than 2,500 cars please 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.600
 who are over 26 years of testing here 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.760
 cars in Brazil and the world, right? 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.110
 good friends are you really seeing 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.760
 a large screen a large lcd screen 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.550
 kiehl's current multimedia system 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.820
 act of great effectiveness 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.460
 the air conditioning without frills like 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.919
 should be here in the middle of the panel 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.970
 easy controls without large 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.250
 inventions 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.310
 they tried to do everything seeing here a 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.979
 very intuitive panel with easy control 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.510
 and also following that simplicity 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:20.389
 lovely here dosage of kia gifts 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:23.060
 on the front panel singer here central 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:26.360
 you have here a speedometer 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.970
 account with good visibility in the 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.900
 left a counters up to 220 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.090
 kilometers kilometers 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.160
 this car goes up to 185 or so 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.400
 speed is already great speed 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.840
 solve a high ceiling case and 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.599
 we have here left then 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.160
 water temperature and we also have the 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:45.650
 Fuel marker 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.300
 everything very easy all very intuitive one 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.060
 marker and in the center with odometer 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.570
 partial other secondary markings 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.370
 all easy to see all the very 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.039
 reach the driver another point 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:01.039
 positive of this new sun without a doubt 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:03.950
 ergonomics you go extremely well 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:07.130
 positioned banks are tremendously 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.660
 can support you well. 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.490
 body they get involved 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.860
 are banks with a fairly physical fall 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.660
 and both the driver and a 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.560
 as well as in the back seat 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:21.950
 traveled with total confidence 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.070
 comfort and color and vehicle says 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.210
 generated for me above a reliability 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.490
 now more adapted to the 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.639
 I already feel more comfortable here. 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:34.010
 with which the sound only this detail is the motor 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:36.220
 being 28 in the pedro really you go 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.860
 need some gear shifts 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.410
 reductions and slopes because the 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.250
 it is at the limit for this kind of 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.190
 vehicle 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:48.130
 but it is a tremendous visual evolution 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.440
 tremendous technological evolution of this 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.990
 who thought that he has now won the 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.420
 car of the year design in english market 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:58.210
 friends the English market is a market 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.570
 sophisticated 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:04.000
 people of good taste not to go and give a 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:06.370
 an award if the car does not really 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.300
 has its merits and especially this 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:12.610
 evolutionary aesthetic quality that the 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.520
 registered trademark of kia design and the 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:18.910
 also of the genius of the German Peter 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.920
 scheier né great new friends who found 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.180
 What was you doing here? 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.920
 for test drive 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.460
 here in the summer territory we go 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:30.190
 arriving from the action motors on the beach here 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.500
 I spend a lot of day and night here in 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.480
 atlantic central region 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:37.230
 visible and more important in all 

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.230
 line here at your disposal
