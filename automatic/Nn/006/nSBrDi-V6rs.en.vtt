00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.470
 ps3 games on psn digital media 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.470
 games mania 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.660
 Speak there. Personal beauty is starting. 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.440
 another video of gt so with there and there 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.670
 you 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.500
 and today I'm going to start a new 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.939
 series in the channel to be called and 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.970
 useless failures of a gta5 personal livestock 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.640
 in this series I'm going to bring those glitz 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.590
 those asses that have nothing to do 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.500
 are free that will not add anything 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.390
 in your gameplay are hits is like entering 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.140
 in some 11 you fall into the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.870
 limbo 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.079
 are rather bizarre crashes the game and return 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.690
 bringing video in this series is I go 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.120
 start with this cry and nothing in the air 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.800
 because it is a very interesting hit that is 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.829
 It's kind of complicated, I'm going to 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.170
 A step by step for you is in that ness 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.719
 in this episode that the first pilot only 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.800
 You will have only this grid but will I bring and 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.600
 from 2 to 3 gleeks and in each episode 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.180
 so beauty then there is a good blush 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.850
 complicated to make personal is it is 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.490
 here near the light saints near the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.640
 Airport is for you, you 're going to have to 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.380
 on this point here behind the moon the saints 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.170
 here you will stop a car here you 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.290
 can rise by the crisis ndash it the point 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.180
 on the map is that there you only have one 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.369
 car even I said climb up the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.580
 crane that will climb on the roof of the car 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.409
 and will pass in that part that has if this 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.299
 failure that will jump in the water 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.180
 jumping on the water you're going to have to go 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.070
 swimming or heading those stones to and 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.869
 As soon as I get there on the rocks and I'll be back. 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.000
 It's going to take a little bit so I'll go 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.689
 give that fast and as soon as you arrive 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.689
 there the touch up 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.140
 So the people when you arrive 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.060
 more or less at this point where I am 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.040
 You will see very slowly until your 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.100
 character gets put there points 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.160
 head out of the area and he 's like that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.000
 that he put there is head out 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.310
 of the area 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.740
 your character will be doing the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.930
 single ticket negative point is that you 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.729
 will not get your character to do 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.130
 blitze will only be able to see your friends 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.930
 Just as I see Lucas there, can you? 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.240
 to see that he is swimming in the air but I 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.430
 I'm not airing at least 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.400
 I can see my character. 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.390
 Nothing on amazon Lucas is living. 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.590
 swimming to and from 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.530
 so that's why I said it was a 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.300
 very interesting but at the same time 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.700
 pretty useless time why I 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.630
 I put him in this series so that's it 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.610
 Guys, I hope you liked it. 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.110
 if you like what you already know that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.090
 favorite before the release 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.950
 no more, this is a hug, stay in peace and 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.950
 until the next video said
