00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
vegetable oil that I've brought up to

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.759 
vegetable oil that I've brought up to
about<00:04:06.579> a<00:04:06.640> medium<00:04:06.820> heat<00:04:07.810> you<00:04:08.079> don't<00:04:08.590> really

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
about a medium heat you don't really

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:09.970 
about a medium heat you don't really
want<00:04:09.010> to<00:04:09.040> go

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
want to go

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.399 
want to go
other<00:04:10.069> than<00:04:10.250> that<00:04:10.310> or<00:04:10.819> you'll<00:04:11.569> probably<00:04:11.840> burn

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
other than that or you'll probably burn

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.360 
other than that or you'll probably burn
the<00:04:12.650> shrimp<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.220> these<00:04:13.840> cook<00:04:14.840> in<00:04:15.110> about<00:04:15.370> maybe

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
the shrimp and these cook in about maybe

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.729 
the shrimp and these cook in about maybe
three<00:04:16.850> minutes<00:04:17.030> total<00:04:17.479> so<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.350> cooking

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
three minutes total so the cooking

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.099

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
process is pretty quick so we're just

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.620

and start getting them in here and you

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.260 
and start getting them in here and you
need<00:04:28.490> to<00:04:28.580> watch<00:04:28.760> these<00:04:29.060> pretty<00:04:29.330> close<00:04:31.270> and
