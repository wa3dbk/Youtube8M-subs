motorola as we've been expecting the
Moto<00:01:41.970> X<00:01:42.210> plus<00:01:42.420> one<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:42.869> quite<00:01:43.049> some<00:01:43.290> time

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
Moto X plus one for quite some time

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.200 
Moto X plus one for quite some time
which<00:01:43.890> would<00:01:44.100> be<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> successor<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> Moto

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
which would be the successor to the Moto

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.630 
which would be the successor to the Moto
X<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.750> we've<00:01:45.840> also<00:01:45.990> heard<00:01:46.290> rumors<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.159> this

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
X and we've also heard rumors that this

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.999 
X and we've also heard rumors that this
phone<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.210> codenamed<00:01:48.540> Victora<00:01:49.380> which<00:01:49.770> is

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
phone is codenamed Victora which is

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.429

partly victorious or whatever the name

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.670 
partly victorious or whatever the name
might<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.759> more<00:01:53.970> leaks<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:55.350> this

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
might be but we get more leaks and this

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.590 
might be but we get more leaks and this
is<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> very<00:01:56.189> interesting<00:01:56.610> design<00:01:57.270> actually

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
is a very interesting design actually

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.899 
is a very interesting design actually
the<00:01:57.899> leaks<00:01:58.110> or<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.409> case<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.009> we<00:01:59.520> see<00:01:59.729> two

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the leaks or of a case and we see two

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.749 
the leaks or of a case and we see two
separate<00:02:00.270> leaks<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.899> very<00:02:01.380> big<00:02:01.950> camera<00:02:02.549> hole

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
separate leaks of a very big camera hole

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.609 
separate leaks of a very big camera hole
since<00:02:03.420> everybody<00:02:03.810> complained<00:02:04.229> about<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
camera on the Moto X and could it be

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.990 
camera on the Moto X and could it be
that<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.409> will<00:02:07.710> be<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.099> pitch<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.819> Moto

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
of the next generation android running

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.230 
of the next generation android running
on<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.050> nexus<00:03:07.440> 4<00:03:07.800> which<00:03:08.010> means<00:03:08.310> it'll<00:03:08.460> run<00:03:08.940> on

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
on a nexus 4 which means it'll run on

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.480 
on a nexus 4 which means it'll run on
the<00:03:09.390> nexus<00:03:09.660> war<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.140> even<00:03:11.100> though<00:03:11.190> there<00:03:11.370> are

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
the nexus war and even though there are

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.790 
the nexus war and even though there are
some<00:03:11.760> design<00:03:12.090> changes<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.870> really<00:03:13.260> looks<00:03:13.620> a

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
some design changes it really looks a

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.470 
some design changes it really looks a
lot<00:03:14.040> like<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.520> current<00:03:14.730> generation<00:03:14.880> android

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
lot like the current generation android

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.180 
lot like the current generation android
so<00:03:15.690> it's<00:03:15.840> easy<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.380> think<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.800> this<00:03:16.920> will

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
so it's easy to think that this will

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.970 
so it's easy to think that this will
just<00:03:17.400> be<00:03:17.720> android<00:03:18.720> 4.5<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.650> not<00:03:19.739> really

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
just be android 4.5 and not really

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.580 
just be android 4.5 and not really
android<00:03:20.340> 5.0<00:03:20.989> appetizers<00:03:21.989> already<00:03:22.170> confirmed
