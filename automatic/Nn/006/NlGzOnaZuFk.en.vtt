if the read patch your Minecraft which

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.880 
if the read patch your Minecraft which
only<00:02:51.630> takes<00:02:51.720> probably<00:02:52.110> around<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.590> would<00:02:52.739> say

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
only takes probably around I would say

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.420 
only takes probably around I would say
15<00:02:53.040> seconds<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:54.030> yep<00:02:54.750> then<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:55.800> if<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.070> down<00:02:56.280> on

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
15 seconds so yep then so if you down on

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.890 
15 seconds so yep then so if you down on
a<00:02:56.459> map<00:02:56.670> it's<00:02:56.880> just<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.209> little<00:02:57.630> bit<00:02:57.750> more

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900
