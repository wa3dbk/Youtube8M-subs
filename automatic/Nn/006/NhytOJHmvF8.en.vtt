00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.109 

alright<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.010> basically<00:00:20.130> as<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.640> guys<00:00:20.789> saw

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
alright so basically as you guys saw

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.019 
alright so basically as you guys saw
there<00:00:22.020> was<00:00:22.199> some<00:00:22.439> random<00:00:22.590> pixel<00:00:23.220> outage<00:00:23.699> and

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
there was some random pixel outage and

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.609 
there was some random pixel outage and
there<00:00:24.150> was<00:00:24.330> flashing<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.050> pixels<00:00:25.439> every

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
there was flashing of the pixels every

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.320 
there was flashing of the pixels every
now<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:25.980> then<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.699> actually<00:00:26.849> had<00:00:27.180> that

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
now and then and I actually had that

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.720 
now and then and I actually had that
problem<00:00:27.570> really<00:00:27.930> bad<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.560> my<00:00:28.740> iPod<00:00:29.160> Touch<00:00:29.340> 4th

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
problem really bad on my iPod Touch 4th

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.550 
problem really bad on my iPod Touch 4th
generation<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> point<00:00:31.230> where<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> went

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
generation to the point where I went

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.430 
generation to the point where I went
looking<00:00:31.710> around<00:00:32.009> because<00:00:32.780> to<00:00:33.780> be<00:00:33.899> honest<00:00:34.230> it

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
looking around because to be honest it

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.410 
looking around because to be honest it
really<00:00:34.500> didn't<00:00:34.980> bother<00:00:35.010> me<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.700> much<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
really didn't bother me that much I

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.180 
really didn't bother me that much I
figured<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.320> was<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.469> hardware<00:00:37.739> problem

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
figured it was a hardware problem

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.639 
figured it was a hardware problem
because<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> did<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:39.450> water<00:00:39.750> damage<00:00:40.020> earlier

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
because I did have water damage earlier

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.770 
because I did have water damage earlier

yes<00:01:37.650> Apple<00:01:38.009> does<00:01:38.460> make<00:01:38.729> software<00:01:39.329> issues<00:01:39.869> but

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
yes Apple does make software issues but

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.710 
yes Apple does make software issues but
they<00:01:40.920> soon<00:01:41.310> after<00:01:41.729> fix<00:01:42.000> those<00:01:42.299> almost

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
they soon after fix those almost

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.800 
they soon after fix those almost
immediately<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.210> no<00:01:45.210> need<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> worry<00:01:45.509> about
