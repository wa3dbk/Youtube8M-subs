 juniper cypress peppermint e 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.910
 used as a preservative 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.910
 cosmo and you can use the cons card 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.210
 he began proving our cell 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.320
 because everything is clean our own 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.790
 we dry the containers and put them in 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.790
 a container of vegetable glycerin 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.810
 once the vegetable glycine is inserted 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:55.200
 we have to go and weigh the rubber 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:58.080
 santana the gum xanta naneva 1.5 g later 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:06.090
 what we have to pour rain or 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:09.710
 glycerin here it is pouring it to 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:17.270
 rain very calmly to do it 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:20.400
 drop everything and then stir 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.670
 mixed woman to mix well 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.670
 the whole 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.090
 now we have to create the cell then 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.090
 you need to add water 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:46.080
 once the water has reached the glycerine 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.840
 and to the santana hip it is necessary to mix if 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.570
 just want you can help yourself with a 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.459
 areo milk to make cappuccinos 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.260
 but I can't find it because anyway yes 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.160
 therefore they would form too many bubbles 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:03.180
 however used is a spoon 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.630
 then stir and set aside 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.210
 this solution even for 10 minutes a 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.030
 quarter of an hour so leave it now 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.920
 let's take another container and cheever 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.230
 we are inside extracted from alcohol 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.150
 of centella I have inserted now is 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.500
 he was the alcoholic king because I have to go there 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.880
 to dissolve menthol invented it is one 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.440
 raw material that can be dissolved in 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.720
 oil or alcohol 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.030
 so if by chance you don't have any 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.930
 hydro alcoholic extract that point 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.900
 contains alcohol you will have to add e 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:40.340
 12 grams of alcohol at 95 degrees for 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.340
 go and dissolve menthol 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.200
 we mix so that the menthol is 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.620
 dissolve now let's take back the previous one 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.460
 compound we have seen that it is precisely yes 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.460
 gen 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.230
 and after that let's add the gel 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.230
 of aloe vera 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:14.780
 once added the jewel is true 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.789
 let's go and give another stir 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.910
 we take the compound with the extract of 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:26.130
 centella and we are going to add 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:28.620
 the ruscus extract we go to mix 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.199
 i after that we have to pay 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:37.380
 within the gela these extracts 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:42.690
 let's go and give another mixed one 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:48.050
 Once you mix it all up we have to go 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:05:04.440
 add panthenol panthenol 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:05:06.449
 let's put in between the g once 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.160
 added this ingredient we give 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:12.510
 another shuffle after which we must 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.180
 dedicate ourselves to the joining of oils 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.340
 essential 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.919
 I remind you that for replacements 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.560
 you can see the last slides in 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:26.750
 At the bottom of this video we add the oil 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.750
 essential juniper 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:34.080
 cypress essential oil 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:37.369
 I remind you that with each addition you must 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.369
 give as still mixed 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.530
 and finally the essential oil is added 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.490
 of peppermint once added 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.220
 the essential oil of peppermint 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.940
 let's add the cons card oe 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.340
 save cosma we measure the ph that must 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.460
 be on 5 5 and 6 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:03.060
 and if you want at the end add 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:06.770
 a friend or another dye this 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.770
 the final effect of the jella 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.880
 small parenthesis on menthol or lo 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.220
 put the oil but increase the three drops 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.250
 essential mint or used in 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.950
 mind you have an effect 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:22.200
 refreshing even if with more action 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:25.380
 bland compared to menthol but is more 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.330
 lasting over time is lighter and less 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:32.190
 menthol irritant so you can 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:33.960
 use it safely before 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.550
 use my essential oils 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.440
 advice is to do a test of 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.960
 skin sensitivity the so-called patch 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.610
 test then add a drop of 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.190
 essential oil to a teaspoon of oil 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.440
 vegetable applied a small amount 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.200
 and the hollow of the brazzoli and massage 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.640
 wait until completely absorbed 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.830
 some hours even up to a day e 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.420
 check that there are no irritations 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.300
 and clean redness and other reactions 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.430
 in this recipe used 40 drops 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.710
 total of essential oils only because the 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.270
 specific recipe will be proportions e 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.790
 I also made it based on the type of oil 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.700
 essential inserted this is the 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.780
 final consistency you have to take a 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.390
 small quantity 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:15.210
 massage the area from the bottom towards 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:18.330
 the top then from the foot towards is the 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.830
 thigh until completely absorbed 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.230

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:24.930
