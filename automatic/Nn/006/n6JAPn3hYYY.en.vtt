but I just hit prestige master and I

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.109 
but I just hit prestige master and I
thought<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.189> know<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.310> might<00:00:23.609> as<00:00:23.699> well<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:24.000> do

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
thought you know I might as well just do

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.700 
thought you know I might as well just do
it<00:00:24.240> for<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> prestige<00:00:24.750> master<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.439> it's

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
it for the prestige master and it's

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.740 
it for the prestige master and it's
funny<00:00:25.920> because<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.730> hit<00:00:26.939> prestige<00:00:27.300> master

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
know this but I actually did a fresh

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.410 
know this but I actually did a fresh
restart<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.430> account<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.000> before<00:00:36.390> that

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
restart on this account and before that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.000 
restart on this account and before that
I<00:00:36.570> was<00:00:36.690> already<00:00:36.899> prestige<00:00:37.320> master<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.890> had

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
I was already prestige master and had

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.680 
I was already prestige master and had
like<00:00:38.250> almost<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.730> hundred<00:00:39.030> new<00:00:39.180> killers<00:00:39.510> or

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
like almost a hundred new killers or

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.180 
like almost a hundred new killers or
something<00:00:39.930> crazy<00:00:40.140> like<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.800> then<00:00:41.010> back

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
something crazy like that and then back

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.860 
something crazy like that and then back
when<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.399> play<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> console<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.629> think<00:00:42.809> I

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
when I play it on a console I think I

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.990 
when I play it on a console I think I
got<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.170> prestige<00:00:43.620> seven<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.340> almost<00:00:44.640> prestige

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
got to prestige seven so almost prestige

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.639

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that I have 16 days played in this game

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.150 
that I have 16 days played in this game
which<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> lot<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.020> people<00:00:58.379> that's<00:00:58.500> nothing

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
which for a lot of people that's nothing

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.380 
which for a lot of people that's nothing
but<00:00:59.340> for<00:00:59.489> me<00:00:59.579> that's<00:00:59.730> actually<00:00:59.910> pretty

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
but for me that's actually pretty

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.299 
but for me that's actually pretty
ridiculous<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.590> hadn't<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.010> done<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
ridiculous and if I hadn't have done the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.039 
ridiculous and if I hadn't have done the
fresh<00:01:02.699> restart<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.510> probably<00:01:03.930> would<00:01:04.019> have

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
fresh restart it probably would have

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.929 
fresh restart it probably would have
been<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.260> up<00:01:04.589> there<00:01:04.799> almost<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.400> 30<00:01:05.640> days

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
been like up there almost a 30 days

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.550 
been like up there almost a 30 days
actually<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:06.900> go<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> right<00:01:07.320> all

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
actually but if we go to the right all

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.000 
actually but if we go to the right all
together<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.360> 120<00:01:09.360> 1000<00:01:10.290> kills<00:01:10.560> which

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
together I have 120 1000 kills which

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.620 
together I have 120 1000 kills which
again<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.460> didn't<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> fresh<00:01:12.030> restart<00:01:12.540> I

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
again if I didn't do the fresh restart I

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
again if I didn't do the fresh restart I
think<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.869> would<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.110> had<00:01:13.490> probably<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
think I would have had probably a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.310 
think I would have had probably a
hundred<00:01:15.150> thousand<00:01:15.630> more<00:01:15.780> than<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.080> so

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
hundred thousand more than that so

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.280 
hundred thousand more than that so
around<00:01:16.860> 220<00:01:17.640> 1,000<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.450> then<00:01:18.659> three<00:01:18.900> thousand

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
around 220 1,000 and then three thousand

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.660 
around 220 1,000 and then three thousand
four<00:01:19.409> hundred<00:01:19.530> eighty<00:01:19.770> one<00:01:19.920> wins<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:20.520> my

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
four hundred eighty one wins and then my

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.749 
four hundred eighty one wins and then my
score<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.659> don't<00:01:22.259> even<00:01:22.560> want<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> try<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> say

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
score is I don't even want to try to say

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.160 
score is I don't even want to try to say
whatever<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.180> heck<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.330> number<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.930> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
whatever the heck that number is and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.280 
whatever the heck that number is and
then<00:01:25.380> my<00:01:25.439> overall<00:01:25.950> KD<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.580> four-point<00:01:27.150> 56<00:01:27.840> so

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
then my overall KD is a four-point 56 so

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.020 
then my overall KD is a four-point 56 so
the<00:01:28.409> number<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:28.710> reason<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.549> did<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> fresh

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the number one reason I did a fresh

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.280 
the number one reason I did a fresh
restart<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.689> count<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.259> I

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
restart on this count is because I

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.859 
restart on this count is because I
actually<00:01:31.740> wasn't<00:01:32.130> satisfied<00:01:32.790> with<00:01:32.939> my<00:01:33.060> KD<00:01:33.509> so

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
actually wasn't satisfied with my KD so

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.270 
actually wasn't satisfied with my KD so
before<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.140> did<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.350> fresh<00:01:34.530> restart<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.040> think<00:01:35.220> I

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
before I did the fresh restart I think I

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.630 
before I did the fresh restart I think I
had<00:01:35.430> like<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:36.140> 3.30<00:01:37.140> KD<00:01:37.740> overall<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.460> that's

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
had like a 3.30 KD overall and that's

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.609 
had like a 3.30 KD overall and that's
mostly<00:01:38.880> because<00:01:38.970> black<00:01:39.780> ops<00:01:39.960> 2<00:01:40.229> was<00:01:40.409> one<00:01:40.530> of

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
mostly because black ops 2 was one of

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.800 
mostly because black ops 2 was one of
the<00:01:40.680> first<00:01:40.979> call<00:01:41.310> duties<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.700> played<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:41.939> PC<00:01:42.479> so

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the first call duties I played on PC so

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.030 
the first call duties I played on PC so
when<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.049> started<00:01:43.320> playing<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.740> was<00:01:43.860> nowhere

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
when I started playing it I was nowhere

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.130 
when I started playing it I was nowhere
near<00:01:44.189> as<00:01:44.549> good<00:01:44.909> as<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.119> am<00:01:45.149> now<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.869> now<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
near as good as I am now but now it's a

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.050 
near as good as I am now but now it's a
four-point<00:01:46.530> 56<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.220> I'm<00:01:47.610> pretty<00:01:47.820> I'm<00:01:48.000> pretty

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
four-point 56 and I'm pretty I'm pretty

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.819 
four-point 56 and I'm pretty I'm pretty
satisfied<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.960> be<00:01:49.049> honest<00:01:49.350> if<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.680> were

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
satisfied with it to be honest if I were

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.109 
satisfied with it to be honest if I were
to<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> fresh<00:01:50.310> restart<00:01:50.759> right<00:01:50.880> now<00:01:51.090> I

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
to do a fresh restart right now I

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.600 
to do a fresh restart right now I
probably<00:01:51.570> could<00:01:51.840> get<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> 6-7<00:01:53.369> KD

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
probably could get up to like a 6-7 KD

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.340 
probably could get up to like a 6-7 KD
overall<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.420> um<00:01:54.540> that's<00:01:54.840> not<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.259> to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
overall but um that's not going to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.020 
overall but um that's not going to
happen<00:01:55.500> by<00:01:55.890> anyways<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.280> my<00:01:56.399> win-loss<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.909> have

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
happen by anyways for my win-loss I have

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.800 
happen by anyways for my win-loss I have
a<00:01:57.060> one-point<00:01:57.570> 93<00:01:58.170> which<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.619> um<00:01:59.369> not<00:02:00.119> very<00:02:00.149> good

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
a one-point 93 which is um not very good

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.359 
a one-point 93 which is um not very good
I<00:02:01.049> think<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.439> main<00:02:01.649> reason<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.070> don't<00:02:02.250> have

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
I think the main reason I don't have

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.399 
I think the main reason I don't have
some<00:02:02.579> amazing<00:02:02.909> win-loss<00:02:03.540> ratio<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:04.110> because<00:02:04.380> I

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
some amazing win-loss ratio is because I

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.980 
some amazing win-loss ratio is because I
play<00:02:05.100> solo<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.090> even<00:02:06.540> though<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.689> may<00:02:06.960> be

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
play solo and so even though I may be

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.570 
play solo and so even though I may be
able<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> get<00:02:07.469> tons<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.860> kills<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.160> stuff<00:02:08.399> it's

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
able to get tons of kills and stuff it's

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.100 
able to get tons of kills and stuff it's
just<00:02:08.670> not<00:02:08.940> enough<00:02:09.330> when<00:02:09.599> like<00:02:09.750> your<00:02:09.929> whole

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
just not enough when like your whole

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.990 
just not enough when like your whole
team<00:02:10.379> goes<00:02:10.590> negative<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:11.400> moving<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:11.849> my

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
team goes negative but then moving on my

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.910 
team goes negative but then moving on my
score<00:02:12.239> per<00:02:12.420> minute<00:02:12.450> overall<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.319> 5

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
score per minute overall is a 5

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.640 
score per minute overall is a 5
in<00:02:14.130> 52<00:02:14.550> now<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.270> would<00:02:15.480> be<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.660> lot<00:02:15.959> higher<00:02:16.260> but

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
in 52 now this would be a lot higher but

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.790 
in 52 now this would be a lot higher but
I<00:02:17.010> pretty<00:02:17.340> much<00:02:17.459> play<00:02:17.910> TDM<00:02:18.569> like<00:02:18.840> 90%<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.739> the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
I pretty much play TDM like 90% of the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.350 
I pretty much play TDM like 90% of the
time<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.250> obviously<00:02:20.849> if<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.030> were<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.239> play

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
time and obviously if I were to play

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.760 
time and obviously if I were to play
like<00:02:21.540> more<00:02:21.720> domination<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.440> could<00:02:22.620> probably

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
like more domination I could probably

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.559 
like more domination I could probably
get<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.069> up<00:02:23.190> there<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.430> seven<00:02:24.180> eight<00:02:24.360> hundred

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
get it up there to seven eight hundred

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.000 
get it up there to seven eight hundred
score<00:02:24.989> per<00:02:25.110> minute<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.530> then<00:02:25.709> just<00:02:25.860> down<00:02:25.980> here

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
score per minute and then just down here

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.229 
score per minute and then just down here
we<00:02:26.280> have<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.459> calling<00:02:26.670> cards<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.209> have

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
we have the calling cards that I have

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.210 
we have the calling cards that I have
showcase<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.290> we<00:02:28.380> have<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.590> nuke<00:02:28.800> Dow<00:02:29.010> which

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
showcase so we have the nuke Dow which

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.100 
showcase so we have the nuke Dow which
was<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.400> pretty<00:02:29.790> fun<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.209> get<00:02:30.330> actually<00:02:30.810> master

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
was a pretty fun to get actually master

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.750 
was a pretty fun to get actually master
killer<00:02:31.350> which<00:02:31.530> took<00:02:31.739> me<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.920> long<00:02:32.160> time<00:02:32.220> just

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
killer which took me a long time just

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.610 
killer which took me a long time just
because<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.270> like<00:02:33.510> chain<00:02:34.290> killer

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
because of the like chain killer

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.199 
because of the like chain killer
challenge<00:02:35.520> or<00:02:35.610> whatever<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.850> heck<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.090> was

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
challenge or whatever the heck it was

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.729 
challenge or whatever the heck it was
the<00:02:36.360> nine<00:02:36.540> kills<00:02:36.810> in<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.050> row<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.410> the

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
the nine kills in a row and the

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.830 
the nine kills in a row and the
free-for-all<00:02:38.130> master<00:02:38.730> which<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.030> um<00:02:39.270> it's

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
free-for-all master which is um it's

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.300 
free-for-all master which is um it's
actually<00:02:40.140> funny<00:02:40.290> because<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.500> don't<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:41.040> this

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
actually funny because I don't have this

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.770 
actually funny because I don't have this
anymore<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:41.670> got<00:02:41.880> this<00:02:42.090> before<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.510> did<00:02:42.690> the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
anymore I got this before I did the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.420 
anymore I got this before I did the
fresh<00:02:42.989> restart<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.650> just<00:02:43.769> never<00:02:43.950> took<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.310> off

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
fresh restart and just never took it off

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.340 
fresh restart and just never took it off
so<00:02:44.700> uh<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:45.330> actually<00:02:45.599> never<00:02:45.690> deleted<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.319> so

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
so uh it actually never deleted it so

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.080 
so uh it actually never deleted it so
it's<00:02:46.560> still<00:02:46.830> there<00:02:47.040> but<00:02:47.430> anyways<00:02:47.760> if<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:47.970> go

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
it's still there but anyways if we go

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.520 
it's still there but anyways if we go
back<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.840> guys<00:02:48.989> are<00:02:49.110> probably<00:02:49.200> really

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
back you guys are probably really

thing that I get asked about all the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.340 
thing that I get asked about all the
time<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.700> how<00:02:56.850> many<00:02:57.030> new<00:02:57.239> shows<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.630> have<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:58.170> on

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
time is how many new shows I have so on

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.930 
time is how many new shows I have so on
this<00:02:58.530> account<00:02:58.769> right<00:02:59.190> now<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.459> have<00:02:59.700> two

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
this account right now I have two

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.970 
this account right now I have two
hundred<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.420> thirteen<00:03:00.930> new<00:03:01.140> killers<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.680> of

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
hundred and thirteen new killers and of

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.140 
hundred and thirteen new killers and of
course<00:03:02.220> even<00:03:02.549> though<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:02.640> brought<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:02.970> up<00:03:03.000> like

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
course even though I brought it up like

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.880 
course even though I brought it up like
a<00:03:03.180> million<00:03:03.540> times<00:03:03.720> already<00:03:03.870> um<00:03:04.260> if<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.620> didn't

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
a million times already um if I didn't

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.320 
a million times already um if I didn't
do<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.069> fresh<00:03:05.250> restart<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.760> probably<00:03:06.060> would<00:03:06.239> be

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
do the fresh restart I probably would be

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.660 
do the fresh restart I probably would be
around<00:03:06.600> like<00:03:06.750> 300<00:03:07.440> nuclear's<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.220> probably<00:03:08.489> be

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
around like 300 nuclear's I probably be

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.390 
around like 300 nuclear's I probably be
getting<00:03:08.760> up<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.060> about<00:03:09.560> 320<00:03:10.560> new<00:03:10.709> killers<00:03:11.040> but

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
getting up to about 320 new killers but

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.830 
getting up to about 320 new killers but
anyways<00:03:11.730> if<00:03:11.880> we<00:03:11.970> go<00:03:12.120> over<00:03:12.150> here<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:12.600> can<00:03:12.720> see

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
anyways if we go over here you can see

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.350 
anyways if we go over here you can see
that<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:12.959> have<00:03:13.049> 701<00:03:13.950> UNSTOPABLES<00:03:14.819> now<00:03:15.209> this

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
that I have 701 UNSTOPABLES now this

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.789 
that I have 701 UNSTOPABLES now this
actually<00:03:15.690> surprised<00:03:16.049> me<00:03:16.230> because<00:03:16.290> not<00:03:16.650> too

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
actually surprised me because not too

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.770 
actually surprised me because not too
long<00:03:16.830> ago<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.340> was<00:03:17.549> only<00:03:17.850> like<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.299> hundred

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
long ago I was only like a hundred

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.900 
long ago I was only like a hundred
UNSTOPABLES<00:03:19.440> above<00:03:19.769> how<00:03:20.190> many<00:03:20.340> new<00:03:20.519> heroes<00:03:20.790> I

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
UNSTOPABLES above how many new heroes I

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.340 
UNSTOPABLES above how many new heroes I
had<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.299> then<00:03:21.510> all<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.870> sudden<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.140> think<00:03:22.230> I

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
had and then all of a sudden I think I

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.840 
had and then all of a sudden I think I
just<00:03:22.380> started<00:03:22.739> getting<00:03:22.799> tons<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.430> tons<00:03:23.459> and

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
just started getting tons and tons and

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:24.979 
just started getting tons and tons and
tons<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:24.180> UNSTOPABLES

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
tons of UNSTOPABLES

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.960 
tons of UNSTOPABLES
I<00:03:25.109> started<00:03:25.500> going<00:03:25.709> on<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:26.010> lot<00:03:26.340> longer<00:03:26.549> gun

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
I started going on a lot longer gun

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.300 
I started going on a lot longer gun
streaks<00:03:27.329> so<00:03:27.690> now<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:27.959> almost<00:03:28.230> 500<00:03:29.070> more

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
streaks so now it's almost 500 more

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.160 
streaks so now it's almost 500 more
UNSTOPABLES<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.090> i<00:03:30.120> have<00:03:30.269> new<00:03:30.480> killers<00:03:30.810> which

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
UNSTOPABLES and i have new killers which

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.780 
UNSTOPABLES and i have new killers which
to<00:03:31.530> me<00:03:31.620> is<00:03:31.739> actually<00:03:31.980> pretty<00:03:32.160> good<00:03:32.370> but

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
to me is actually pretty good but

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.380 
to me is actually pretty good but
anyways<00:03:33.150> for<00:03:33.359> brudos<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.140> have<00:03:34.430> 404<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:35.970> me

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
anyways for brudos I have 404 so to me

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.180 
anyways for brudos I have 404 so to me
this<00:03:36.690> basically<00:03:37.260> means<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.680> have<00:03:37.890> failed

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
this basically means that I have failed

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.610 
this basically means that I have failed
200<00:03:39.120> nuclear's<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.930> another<00:03:40.230> thing<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.530> it

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
200 nuclear's and another thing that it

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.500 
200 nuclear's and another thing that it
makes<00:03:40.769> me<00:03:40.890> think<00:03:41.100> about<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.489> if<00:03:41.730> this<00:03:42.209> was<00:03:42.390> like

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
makes me think about is if this was like

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.289 
makes me think about is if this was like
Monitor<00:03:42.959> 3<00:03:43.290> this<00:03:43.620> would<00:03:43.859> be<00:03:44.040> Moab's<00:03:44.730> all<00:03:45.090> these

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
Monitor 3 this would be Moab's all these

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.699 
Monitor 3 this would be Moab's all these
would<00:03:45.420> be<00:03:45.510> Moab's<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.170> then<00:03:46.350> like<00:03:46.470> all<00:03:46.650> of

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
would be Moab's and then like all of

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.099 
would be Moab's and then like all of
these<00:03:47.160> would<00:03:47.340> be<00:03:47.459> counted<00:03:47.850> as<00:03:48.019> UNSTOPABLES

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
these would be counted as UNSTOPABLES

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.050 
these would be counted as UNSTOPABLES
but<00:03:49.410> then<00:03:49.500> moving<00:03:49.769> on<00:03:50.070> for<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.640> 20<00:03:50.910> gun

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
but then moving on for the 20 gun

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.750 
but then moving on for the 20 gun
streaks<00:03:51.359> I<00:03:51.540> have<00:03:51.920> 749<00:03:52.920> which<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.370> actually

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
streaks I have 749 which is actually

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.729 
streaks I have 749 which is actually
more<00:03:54.209> than<00:03:54.329> my<00:03:54.450> UNSTOPABLES<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.410> then<00:03:55.650> of

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
more than my UNSTOPABLES and then of

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.759 
more than my UNSTOPABLES and then of
course<00:03:55.950> just<00:03:56.310> 15<00:03:57.209> 10<00:03:57.630> 5<00:03:57.989> blah<00:03:58.380> blah<00:03:58.500> blah<00:03:58.620> blah

blah but right here this is what gave me

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.569

so<00:04:01.200> much<00:04:01.410> trouble<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.980> getting<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.310> one

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
so much trouble and getting that one

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.729 
so much trouble and getting that one
calling<00:04:03.150> card<00:04:03.510> for<00:04:03.930> some<00:04:04.079> reason<00:04:04.350> I<00:04:04.440> just<00:04:04.470> had

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
calling card for some reason I just had

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.380 
calling card for some reason I just had
like<00:04:04.890> such<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.069> hard<00:04:05.400> time<00:04:05.700> getting<00:04:06.120> killed

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
like such a hard time getting killed

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.970 
like such a hard time getting killed
chains<00:04:06.630> I<00:04:06.900> think<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.260> big<00:04:07.440> part<00:04:07.709> of<00:04:07.799> it<00:04:07.950> is

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
chains I think the big part of it is

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.160 
chains I think the big part of it is
that<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.310> mostly<00:04:08.880> played<00:04:09.090> TDM<00:04:09.569> so<00:04:09.810> if<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:09.989> kill

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
that I mostly played TDM so if you kill

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.140 
that I mostly played TDM so if you kill
the<00:04:10.290> entire<00:04:10.560> team<00:04:10.859> they<00:04:11.160> switch<00:04:11.639> spawns<00:04:11.940> to

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
the entire team they switch spawns to

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.580 
the entire team they switch spawns to
the<00:04:12.269> other<00:04:12.389> side<00:04:12.600> of<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.780> map<00:04:12.959> but<00:04:13.319> I<00:04:13.350> finally

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
the other side of the map but I finally

in<00:05:05.940> domination<00:05:06.870> and<00:05:07.140> I<00:05:07.230> think<00:05:07.440> my<00:05:07.500> KD<00:05:07.890> is

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010

in domination and I think my KD is
pretty<00:05:08.190> good<00:05:08.370> too<00:05:08.490> I<00:05:08.520> think<00:05:08.730> that's<00:05:08.850> around

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
like a five or six KD overall then for

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.940 
like a five or six KD overall then for
the<00:05:12.060> career<00:05:12.420> leaderboards<00:05:13.170> I'm<00:05:13.500> actually<00:05:13.650> not

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
pretty good accuracy with I think where

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.460 
pretty good accuracy with I think where
is<00:06:07.080> it

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
is it

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.190

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
to have over at n KD with this weapon

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.240 
to have over at n KD with this weapon
until<00:06:15.450> I<00:06:15.480> started<00:06:15.810> using<00:06:15.840> it<00:06:16.320> in<00:06:16.680> burst<00:06:16.980> mode

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
until I started using it in burst mode

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.980 
until I started using it in burst mode
pretty<00:06:17.460> much<00:06:17.640> only<00:06:17.880> and<00:06:18.240> then<00:06:18.480> the<00:06:18.600> rest<00:06:18.810> of<00:06:18.870> my

have almost a 4 KD with it and my
accuracy<00:06:38.340> is<00:06:38.610> almost<00:06:38.910> a<00:06:39.030> 50%<00:06:39.270> same<00:06:39.720> thing<00:06:39.870> with

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
accuracy is almost a 50% same thing with

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.500 
accuracy is almost a 50% same thing with
the<00:06:40.080> ballista<00:06:40.560> except<00:06:40.830> with<00:06:40.919> the<00:06:41.010> blister

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510 
the ballista except with the blister

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.960 
the ballista except with the blister
like<00:06:41.690> nowhere<00:06:42.470> near<00:06:42.830> as<00:06:42.950> good<00:06:42.980> as<00:06:43.130> a<00:06:43.220> KD<00:06:43.490> but

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
like nowhere near as good as a KD but

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.940 
like nowhere near as good as a KD but
then<00:06:44.060> anyways<00:06:44.450> for<00:06:44.660> my<00:06:44.780> equipment<00:06:45.320> I<00:06:45.530> pretty

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.950 
then anyways for my equipment I pretty

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.590 
then anyways for my equipment I pretty
much<00:06:46.010> don't<00:06:46.280> use<00:06:46.550> equipment<00:06:46.880> very<00:06:47.150> often<00:06:47.510> I

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 
much don't use equipment very often I

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.420 
much don't use equipment very often I
usually<00:06:48.020> keep<00:06:48.410> that<00:06:48.620> out<00:06:48.770> so<00:06:48.920> I<00:06:48.950> can<00:06:49.100> get<00:06:49.220> more

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
usually keep that out so I can get more

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.460 
usually keep that out so I can get more
perks<00:06:49.730> or<00:06:49.910> attachments<00:06:50.570> so<00:06:50.720> you<00:06:51.230> know<00:06:51.320> just

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:51.470 
perks or attachments so you know just

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.290 
perks or attachments so you know just
concussions<00:06:52.040> grenades<00:06:52.430> and<00:06:52.670> then<00:06:52.760> I<00:06:52.910> really

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300 
concussions grenades and then I really

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.660 
concussions grenades and then I really
use<00:06:53.450> c4<00:06:53.720> then<00:06:54.350> for<00:06:54.530> scorestreaks<00:06:55.220> pretty<00:06:55.550> much

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:55.670 
use c4 then for scorestreaks pretty much

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.090 
use c4 then for scorestreaks pretty much
my<00:06:55.820> normal<00:06:56.330> setup<00:06:56.570> is<00:06:56.870> a<00:06:56.900> UAV<00:06:57.380> orbital

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
my normal setup is a UAV orbital

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.070 
my normal setup is a UAV orbital
encounter<00:06:58.610> I<00:06:58.640> actually<00:06:58.790> have<00:06:59.090> that's<00:06:59.810> pretty

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
encounter I actually have that's pretty

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.610 
encounter I actually have that's pretty
insane<00:07:00.230> I<00:07:00.470> have<00:07:01.390> 2715<00:07:02.390> orbitals<00:07:02.930> use<00:07:03.170> and<00:07:03.500> then

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:03.620 
insane I have 2715 orbitals use and then

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.530 
insane I have 2715 orbitals use and then
UAVs<00:07:04.130> of<00:07:04.400> course<00:07:04.610> like<00:07:04.850> most<00:07:05.210> of<00:07:05.330> the<00:07:05.390> players

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:05.540 
UAVs of course like most of the players

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.060 
UAVs of course like most of the players
who<00:07:05.720> play<00:07:05.870> this<00:07:06.020> game<00:07:06.230> the<00:07:06.380> UAV<00:07:06.800> is<00:07:06.890> going<00:07:07.010> to

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
who play this game the UAV is going to

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.340 
who play this game the UAV is going to
be<00:07:07.160> their<00:07:07.310> most<00:07:07.490> used<00:07:07.910> scorestreak<00:07:08.870> and<00:07:09.050> the

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:09.350 
be their most used scorestreak and the

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.310 
be their most used scorestreak and the
EMP<00:07:09.590> system<00:07:10.070> is<00:07:10.130> also<00:07:10.340> up<00:07:10.610> 30<00:07:10.790> of<00:07:11.080> 973<00:07:12.080> of<00:07:12.170> those

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.320 
EMP system is also up 30 of 973 of those

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.680 
EMP system is also up 30 of 973 of those
used<00:07:12.590> I'm<00:07:12.890> hoping<00:07:13.130> to<00:07:13.340> get<00:07:13.460> close<00:07:13.820> if<00:07:14.090> not<00:07:14.120> the

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
used I'm hoping to get close if not the
