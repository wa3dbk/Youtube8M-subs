you installed it yes yes I did but in

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.539 
you installed it yes yes I did but in

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
installed incorrectly the biggest

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.710 
installed incorrectly the biggest
mistake<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.610> they're<00:01:41.790> loose<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.420> see<00:01:42.600> I'm

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
mistake is that they're loose to see I'm

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.200 
mistake is that they're loose to see I'm
able<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.049> move<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.409> base<00:01:43.759> one<00:01:44.759> inch<00:01:44.970> or<00:01:45.180> more

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
able to move the base one inch or more

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.090 
able to move the base one inch or more
so<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.720> need<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.110> tighten<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.590> seat<00:01:46.920> up

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
so I need to tighten that seat up

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
mistake number two the harness is too

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.160 
mistake number two the harness is too
loose<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.159> needs<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.460> be<00:01:50.579> snug<00:01:51.060> as<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> hug<00:01:51.540> can
