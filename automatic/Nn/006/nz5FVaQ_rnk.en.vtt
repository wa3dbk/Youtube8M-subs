 last program that the government launched

 requirements are very simple first not 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.940
 owning a second home 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.979
 not have been a beneficiary of the subsidy 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.390
 family housing by the 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:42.670
 National government 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.229
 third party not appear as delinquent debtor 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.979
 in some information center 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:50.319
 credit what steps must follow first 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:54.159
 look for a new home whose price does not 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:56.530
 exceeds 86.9 million pesos 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.989
 go to the bank of your choice or 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.389
 the national saving fund third 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.620
 start a covered mortgage loan 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:04.150
 with the measure 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.210
 remember that the program only applies 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.570
 for purchase of new housing 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.250
 house or apartment in urban areas 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.530
 there were two great difficulties for 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.470
 access a home the first time 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.470
 to be able to pay the initial fee now 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.509
 We want to help be your partners to 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.909
 the people who earn between two and three 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.240
 We are going to help you with minimum wages 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.119
 12 million 800 thousand pesos that's almost the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.950
 70 percent of the initial fee and the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.229
 who earn between three and four salaries 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.210
 minimums with approximately seven 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.399
 million eight hundred thousand pesos 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.530
 the other great difficulty that existed for 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.780
 a family was that the bank could 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.390
 provide that the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.429
 interests that gave them the ability to 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.070
 payment and that's why at home I already thought of 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.440
 that we will help them for the first 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.509
 seven years with four points of the rate 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.369
 of interest it is a great opportunity to 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.070
 buy housing that the government 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.020
 help in a very important percentage of 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.360
 the initial fee and that the government will 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.700
 help in seven years helping you pay 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.740
 the interests in the opportunity 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.030
 to stop paying rent and power 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.030
 buy own house
