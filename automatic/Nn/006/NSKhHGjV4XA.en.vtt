higher<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.059> kinetic<00:00:42.450> chain<00:00:42.530> meaning<00:00:43.530> that

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
higher of the kinetic chain meaning that

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.740 
higher of the kinetic chain meaning that
there's<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.550> good<00:00:44.760> chance<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.570> probably
