pen it detects you're walking so that it

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.660 
pen it detects you're walking so that it
will<00:01:53.210> actually<00:01:53.420> vibrate<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:55.190> and<00:01:55.370> let<00:01:55.520> you

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
will actually vibrate that and let you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.100 
will actually vibrate that and let you
know<00:01:55.700> hey<00:01:56.090> you're<00:01:56.330> walking<00:01:56.720> away<00:01:56.810> with<00:01:56.960> your

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
know hey you're walking away with your

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.230 
know hey you're walking away with your
pen<00:01:57.350> I'm<00:01:58.040> a<00:01:58.100> little<00:01:58.340> too<00:01:58.490> close<00:01:58.760> to<00:01:58.940> it<00:01:59.030> at<00:01:59.150> this

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
pen I'm a little too close to it at this

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.960 
pen I'm a little too close to it at this
point<00:01:59.510> so<00:01:59.750> I<00:01:59.780> don't<00:02:00.050> think<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:00.470> will<00:02:00.650> do<00:02:00.890> it<00:02:01.070> but

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
point so I don't think it will do it but

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.850 
point so I don't think it will do it but
let's<00:02:02.360> see<00:02:02.690> if<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:02.990> does<00:02:05.200> no<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.470> won't<00:02:06.680> do<00:02:06.830> it

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
let's see if it does no it won't do it

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.339 
let's see if it does no it won't do it
I'm<00:02:07.040> too<00:02:07.220> close<00:02:07.490> unfortunately<00:02:08.349> but

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
I'm too close unfortunately but

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.040 
I'm too close unfortunately but
basically<00:02:09.649> just<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:10.039> really<00:02:10.369> nice<00:02:10.550> feature

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
basically just a really nice feature

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.180 
basically just a really nice feature
simply<00:02:12.050> because<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.860> will<00:02:13.070> automatically

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
simply because it will automatically

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.010 
simply because it will automatically
