is<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:09.990> time-consuming<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.100> often<00:01:11.909> end<00:01:12.000> up

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
is it time-consuming you often end up

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.910 
is it time-consuming you often end up
with<00:01:12.450> almost<00:01:12.720> as<00:01:12.930> much<00:01:13.080> juice<00:01:13.380> stuck<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.799> your

with almost as much juice stuck to your

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.820 
with almost as much juice stuck to your
hand<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.970> container<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:16.530> up<00:01:16.680> to
