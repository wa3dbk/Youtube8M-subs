and<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:19.080> really<00:00:19.410> talked<00:00:19.740> about<00:00:20.060> falling<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.240> and

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
and I really talked about falling in and

and I really talked about falling in and
taking<00:00:22.050> angles<00:00:22.939> what<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:23.970> want<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.330> talk<00:00:24.539> about

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.040 
taking angles what I want to talk about
here<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.289> taking<00:00:26.250> angles<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> cutback<00:00:27.300> you

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
here is taking angles on a cutback you

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.750 
here is taking angles on a cutback you
might<00:00:28.260> be<00:00:28.410> able<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.590> beat<00:00:28.800> somebody<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:29.580> the
