 with the 18-inch wheels of our

 comfort 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.320
 this 308 is very pleasant to drive 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.659
 as well for the chassis part as 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.460

 road this 308 does not stop there she 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.650
 is also frugal given his level 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.750

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.290
 automatic transmission hardly penalizes 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.820
