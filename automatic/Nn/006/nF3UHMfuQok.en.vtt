00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.059
 here is the asus tai chi the tai chi actually 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.980
 sensations because it's part of 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.110
 new products windows 8 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.939
 innovative enough which sense where like you 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.840
 can see it's a computer 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.980
 notebook with a touch screen that 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.900
 do not like me touch so an investigator 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.220
 portable without touch screen so there it 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.170
 is not really innovative what we 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.100
 already knows this kind of products at its 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.620
 ends that looks more like an ultrabook 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:37.460
 in fact the big surprise is that if 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.750
 I close and bahia a screen behind 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.470
 which goes out but there is a screen 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.520
 behind a screen of the arena that 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.750
 has the same resolution and the same 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.460
 size that who is who and the other 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.930
 side so it's already a full resolution 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.239
 hd but this time the touch and 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.480
 So hop unclear when it comes back 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.170
 back 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.730
 abbas also has an income on 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.590
 the touch interface and so we have a 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.960
 screen that is thaksin so this is a 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.729
 use that's pretty special it's a 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.619
 product that should not be given 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.450
 but it's a product that brings 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.950
 new new use of 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.479
 new uses ie I'm going 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.510
 can at any time switch the 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.700
 contents 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.730
 of this screen on the other or even 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.810
 display content that is different 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.550
 that is to say imagine that I am in 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.730
 working in the process of 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.380
 work on my computer and I have my 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.030
 girlfriend who is not happy because I 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.620
 work eh ben i put him a video 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.050
 is behind so that to occupy it in 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.490
 waiting for me to finish my email that 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.160
 it's tai chi 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.740
 we have no launch date has 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.550
 also no price but but that kind 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.260
 of product that gives asus this be 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.010
 this value of innovation because 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.300
 every year we present products 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.640
 different that was a tablet 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.479
 hybrid plugged into a docking station 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.760
 sega is also the case of the pat von 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.560
 is a netbook tablet in which one 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.650
 can slip a phone and now 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.180
 this is the case of tai chi which is a 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.790
 tablet that pavin tablet at a 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.300
 hybrid computer with a touch screen 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.730
 on the back cover 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:17.670
 the outer shell and with a finish 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.990
 really very very good as we can 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.640
 to see it we really feel it 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.700
 there is a glass plate either on the whole 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.930
 back cover 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.810
 I will leave the product manager 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.670
 france presented the product 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.140
 the asus tai-chi so the big fat 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.600
 innovation on this product it's you 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.000
 are going to have a dual screen one that is 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.400
 I had classics in notebook mode is 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.989
 one behind the hull 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.550
 what we imagine around the use 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.000
 of this product it's three scenarios 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.680
 different 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.600
 the first is the notebook use 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.970
 classic or finally you work 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.739
 on your on your pc by having being the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.959
 hull behind it's quite 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.150
 possible with peace windows by activating 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.560
 the pool screen is not released by train 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.480
 to work on my pc only 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.530
 and then second scenario I want 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.550
 share what I'm trying to 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.860
 do so for example I'm in 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.560
 meeting with someone and I want him 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.230
 project my presentation you can in 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.880
 let's duplicate show what you 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.910
 are watching you on 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:16.290
 supper is the other possibility in 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.090
 the changes by turning on the screen at 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.700
 the back of the tai chi 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.530
 it is to project something 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.060
 different so for example if I'm in 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.440
 working and that children who 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.829
 is in front of me bored I can him 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.570
 pass one of a cartoon or a 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.150
 movie to occupy it so I can 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.820
 really extend the function and tries to 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.440
 windows that can have on one side my 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.209
 work will sing work on a 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.959
 presentation and the other side project 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.030
 something different 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.549
 finally behind one last use 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.810
 this is simply the close of 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.209
 the clip is to use it in mode 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.590
 tablet at home as you can see 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.410
 really happened very very hungry 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.609
 which takes up the curvature of the zenbook and 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.040
 so the interest is to really be able to 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.540
 have a tablet if I'm in my 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.310
 couch at home and I do not want 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.329
 use it in notebook mode 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.780
 use it in tablet mode 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.150
 so here we go 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.709
 so the screen inside is not 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.319
 touch but the one on the outside was 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.560
 exactly both are full hd you 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:15.640
 have the touch screen on the outside and 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.639
 inside a classic classic screen 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.190
 of full hd anyway and matt so a 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:29.940
 very good and very good and very good screen 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:29.940
 also but not tactile as well
