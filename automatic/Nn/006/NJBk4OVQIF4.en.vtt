00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
has a two cell cr123 two cell battery I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.619 
has a two cell cr123 two cell battery I
mean<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.640> was<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.879> different<00:00:45.239> battery<00:00:45.570> uh

well worth the book when you see the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.799 
well worth the book when you see the
brightness<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.910> which<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.539> another

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.449 
Shock watch this is just to give you an
idea<00:03:45.570> of<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.780> size<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.140> this<00:03:46.290> thing<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.769> as

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
idea of the size of this thing and as

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.580 
idea of the size of this thing and as
far<00:03:47.670> as<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.940> opening<00:03:48.329> and<00:03:48.900> this<00:03:49.049> is<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.200> quarter

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
far as the opening and this is a quarter

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.979 
far as the opening and this is a quarter
right<00:03:49.739> here<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.160> can<00:03:50.480> probably<00:03:51.480> compare

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
right here so you can probably compare

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.990 
right here so you can probably compare
that<00:03:52.170> size<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.459> opening<00:03:53.820> with<00:03:53.910> the

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
that size of the opening with the

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.240 
that size of the opening with the
quarter<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:54.600> mean<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.320> where<00:03:56.130> the

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
quarter I mean that the where the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.160 
quarter I mean that the where the
lettuce<00:03:56.610> and<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.900> glass<00:03:58.140> is<00:03:58.170> at<00:03:58.500> um<00:04:00.019> this<00:04:01.019> is

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
lettuce and the glass is at um this is

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.270 
lettuce and the glass is at um this is
the<00:04:02.810> different<00:04:03.810> uh<00:04:03.930> is<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.829> painting<00:04:05.160> right

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
the different uh is the painting right

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.569 
the different uh is the painting right
there<00:04:07.700> and<00:04:08.700> then<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:08.970> red<00:04:10.250> should<00:04:11.250> give<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.489> a

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
there and then the red should give you a

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.340 
there and then the red should give you a
good<00:04:11.730> idea<00:04:11.760> how<00:04:12.120> thick<00:04:12.480> this<00:04:12.630> thing<00:04:12.870> is<00:04:13.079> I

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
good idea how thick this thing is I

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.990 
good idea how thick this thing is I
think<00:04:14.130> weighs<00:04:14.430> pretty<00:04:15.090> decent<00:04:15.600> um<00:04:16.609> and<00:04:17.609> takes

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
think weighs pretty decent um and takes

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.550 
think weighs pretty decent um and takes
two<00:04:18.239> batteries<00:04:18.630> as<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:18.900> said<00:04:19.140> they<00:04:19.349> look

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
two batteries as I said they look

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.750 
two batteries as I said they look
different<00:04:22.280> cr123a<00:04:23.280> they<00:04:23.370> tell<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.640> what

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
different cr123a they tell you what

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.600 
different cr123a they tell you what
batteries

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
batteries

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.360 
batteries
I<00:04:25.409> haven't<00:04:26.409> built<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.620> back<00:04:26.830> up<00:04:26.979> see<00:04:27.129> it<00:04:27.219> but
