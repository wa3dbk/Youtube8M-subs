00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello I hope you are super good 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.240
 we have always been living in my 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.150
 name would come out of disney channel 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.950
 and his god every day eyes this this 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.440
 I bring a video with 5 hairstyles 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.000
 different but back to classes 1 to 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.760
 every day of the week so you have 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.550
 aria from there between easy little bit more 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.410
 difficult sounds more unexpected 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.410
 associated if you want to learn 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.080
 and have the first thing first I'm going to 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.580
 to do is to separate a little hair 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.340
 I always use the side stripe 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.590
 so this time I did it just like that and 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.050
 caught a little hair about three 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.110
 fingers and divided it into three and I started 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.750
 braid hair but in a way a 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.370
 little different as they see the part of the 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.500
 final he took it and I pass it below 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.660
 one and on top of the other and I throw it to 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.220
 the side of the face like I'm going to catch 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:04.910
 another bit and I'm going to pass it underneath 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:08.619
 of one of a piece of hair and for 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.619
 on top of the other and so on down 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.140
 do not worry about the top part 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.840
 so he has a little disheveled 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.540
 by financing and pulling the strips of 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.610
 hair so everything adjusted I 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.980
 what I did was pretty much make a couple of 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.950
 bandages as they see about 4 there and then 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.380
 the 13 until the end so that that 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.390
 cascade aspect since this braid is 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.150
 he calls her cascade braid and really 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.370
 it's super practice it's very nice recontra 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.350
 easy and that pull any trouble and 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.460
 it seems that you had broken a 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.460
 lots of time doing it 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.010
 good appears an opinion also take 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.690
 a section of hair and divide it into 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.100
 three equal parts and what I wanted to do 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.660
 this hairstyle was to make a company 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.300
 French attached to the scalp 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.130
 report on pregnancy is super simple 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.290
 then give separate in three parts 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.170
 same I started to braid and when I caught 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.110
 hair from both sides of the part that 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.450
 It was stuck to the face and the other 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.520
 back and so I started to braid 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.890
 and make the French braid until the 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.320
 part of the ear and then what 13 as a 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.390
 press any and in the end I tied it 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.050
 in the end part and it was beautiful 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.759
 planted 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.759
 [Music] 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.180
 what interests us most is how it looks 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.280
 that incorporates a little hair 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.720
 on each side and this is one of the most 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.720
 easy to make and faster 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.800
 and good but the third hairstyle I know that 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.990
 It seems super difficult but in truth it is 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.180
 recontra simple first what I did 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.520
 was to divide into three equal parts a 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.990
 piece of hair and I started to braid 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.150
 more or less like making a small 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.270
 French farm hits the fallen leather but 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.430
 for one side and they took hair from each 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.160
 first side of the face part and 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.540
 then from the back as you see 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.880
 stubborn these days is super easy and it's 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.210
 very practical to continue with cigars in 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.210
 hands 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.370
 and the end the trance all of you are 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.470
 until the end and tie it up with a list 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.540
 but you can put any 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.250
 Ganchito can even put those 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.770
 hooks that come with bows and stays 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.399
 super pretty 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.399
 [Music] 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.320
 for the short hairstyle what I did was 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.360
 just take a little hair and see it 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.100
 in three equal parts like I'm going to do 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.220
 a braid but it's going to be stuck 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.770
 leather hair taking hair parts 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.560
 only those around me 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.930
 face I started to braid like any 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.970
 press and when taking hair what 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.710
 I did what I did was take hair that 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.000
 be around my face is catching 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:13.400
 all this section iii and that will give you a 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.860
 It looks like he was on set 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.600
 the braid and makes any braided 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.300
 French because it's called AndrÃ© is 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.220
 French are very beautiful they look super 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.020
 formal and it would appear that 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.100
 invested a lot of time in the braid 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.100
 when in truth they are the touch 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:39.259
 he says in the end was to start separating 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:41.059
 the transita to do it a little more 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.759
 great to give it that look 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:45.349
 Roman that for already superbonito and al 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:49.809
 I'll tie it in the back 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.809
 like a half tail and it's beautiful 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.919
 given what I did 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.820
 What is a braid in a headband and what comes first? 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:17.500
 what I did was separate a whole a strip 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.840
 of hair around the face and what 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.729
 I tied him up and in this strip of 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.320
 hair first I will have a section of 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:24.910
 hair and divide into three parts 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.530
 same but start making a braid 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.120
 that will be more or less attached to the 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.789
 scalp but what I'm going to do 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.460
 is to take hair pieces that are 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.320
 around my face to give that 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.940
 effect to the braid as if it were 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.880
 superimposed in truth the braid remains 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.350
 super pretty and female seems like 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.199
 you had taken a lot of time 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.090
 know it but in rada recontra simple and 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:48.010
 at the end they have it certain distitos down 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.680
 and in the end part what I did 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.979
 was tied up in the back back 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.540
 so that to follow is the effect of a headband and 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:59.589
 it looks beautiful and out 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.589
