00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.640
 but I can renew myself because 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.200
 the fight is not over 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.790
 there are so many 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.440
 to 10 on the African continent a 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.020
 so many injustices so much 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.820
 of inequalities does not see to the sharing of 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.140
 cake 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.500
 there are so many things to do by 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.630
 report to the awakening of the African people 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.169
 there are so many things so the 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.790
 causes to defend that that's even me 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.610
 I think that throughout my career I 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.079
 not be able to go the tower So here 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.469
 there are things said and the fight to 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.390
 lead 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:43.850
 there is that I think that all my 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.130
 career I do not think I could 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.840
 everything says because before - there are 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.280
 artists who started in what 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.710
 none of our thing cd and so the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.780
 current generation of which you are a part 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.660
 did in you listen to me a lot I 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.570
 redis is there she sees things 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.829
 otherwise so sacred dose of inspiration 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.049
 it's done it's done here it is 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:12.649
 last album he's focused a little bit on 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.380
 the awakening of the Africans and the unity and 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.389
 there is also a call to the diaspora because 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.329
 that the African diaspora in the world 

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:22.759
 has made a great contribution to 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.409
 fight on the African continent after 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.810
 meetings of African leaders 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.189
 1960s with those of the diaspora 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.050
 especially malcom x maternity king 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.020
 accuse me 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.360
 two francophones have loved cesaire we have 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.480
 many people who have been so we have 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.970
 seen today that the descendant of these 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:49.070
 people from the diaspora day helps us 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.270
 which also brings us not only 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.400
 money but that we proposed 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.560
 ideas he does not have ideas we 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.790
 bring the elysÃ©e to get to the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.060
 freedom for the new independence 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.560
 total and so that's it's it's 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.160
 themes like that that are addressed in the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.850
 next album 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:09.770
 the relief is ensured she assured and 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.240
 so we tried to do everything too 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.300
 for this to raise him there are assured 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.470
 because I was going it was me who 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.470
 revealed takana zion 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.830
 the two maxims of senegal beta simon 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.510
 also better than this world liked 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.160
 that he thought before me but it's me 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.090
 who has produced his first album 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.849
 that he did we were in France a 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.140
 little so there the pupil and the insured she 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:42.019
 assured there is no concern one 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.849
 are engaged they make the world what is this 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.470
 we advise them it's all done 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.660
 to give an identity to faquamp to 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.129
 to dump because they do not do better 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.380
 the gay that Americans 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.640
 on the other hand frozen account just now 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.970
 has instruments that Americans 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.950
 we can not add to the legacy and 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.810
 give a different color to reggae 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.819
 Jamaican but the message of rugby is 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.400
 the same yes yes we will not have all 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.500
 monthly indices but today with 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.599
 technology did together and we 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.760
 may seem certain it's a 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.590
 instrument but otherwise on stage we will have 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.230
 the kora and the 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.090
 longo ni and for big dates like 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.220
 the zenith oh of course we make a buzz if 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:25.459
 one day we will come the balafon and the 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.150
 petition but yes they have the same meaning 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.269
 social 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.319
 there just when you case it was 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.019
 the cassettes but the cassettes and 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.280
 buy less in 2000 I felt a 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.580
 album called the chameleon 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.430
 I evaluate 30000 in one day ie 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.090
 from the opening of the shop to 10 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.319
 in the morning until 9pm even when 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.730
 I went looking for cases this 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.530
 promo the traders told me we 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.290
 does not have enough for us unless you 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.590
 see here is piracy touches everything 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.720
 the world 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.579
 here is the touch everyone we had 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.610
 culture and tape we recorded 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.650
 in made copies but today 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.200
 piracy touches everyone knows 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.750
 Assad is today less for this 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.299
 next album I do not hope to sell 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.739
 more than ten thousand in ivory coast and 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.230
 in mali I do not hope to sell more than 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.599
 5000 in guinea I do not hope to sell 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.320
 more than ten thousand either since good 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:23.360
 in guinea I like what I did 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.190
 So here is the same stop this is the 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.690
 same thing today artists 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.120
 local Africans those who live there 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.440
 but they do not have me because he 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.030
 do not know how they do to live in 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.320
 do it because we're crazy it's the stage 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.790
 in the clubs the clubs are a lot 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.170
 must today me I have a club has 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.080
 so all weekend there are artists 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.610
 who pass with the groups so there 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.860
 so they pass in several groups 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.880
 like that in the week and in the 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.790
 week he can total 1500 to 1500 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.260
 euros with his group and it's not 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.990
 a lot but for life the base is 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.150
 still enough is not bad every 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.770
 week so also to four weeks 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.280
 in the month the group is done 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.390
 easily 4 5 million in the month 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.250
 that's what allows them to live in 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.720
 waiting for the year but in the meantime 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.770
