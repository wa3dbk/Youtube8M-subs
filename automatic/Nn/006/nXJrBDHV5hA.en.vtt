newer<00:00:53.340> version<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.090> goflex<00:00:54.510> drive

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
newer version of the goflex drive

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.729 
newer version of the goflex drive
another<00:00:57.329> really<00:00:57.570> cool<00:00:57.870> thing<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.320> it's

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
another really cool thing is that it's

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.979 
another really cool thing is that it's
able<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.129> upgrade<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.359> could<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.809> this

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
able to upgrade so you could have this

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.290 
able to upgrade so you could have this
drive<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.440> long<00:01:01.680> time<00:01:02.340> seeing<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.120> four

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
drive for a long time seeing it's four

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.030 
drive for a long time seeing it's four
terabytes<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.049> probably<00:01:04.409> want<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.890> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
terabytes you probably want to do that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.460 
terabytes you probably want to do that
you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.640> have<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.180> USB<00:01:06.479> 3<00:01:06.810> point<00:01:07.020> which<00:01:07.260> is

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
you can have the USB 3 point which is

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.770 
you can have the USB 3 point which is
included<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.310> then<00:01:08.790> also<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
included and then also you can have a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.160 
included and then also you can have a
firewire<00:01:10.439> 800<00:01:10.770> adapter<00:01:11.640> which<00:01:12.020> gives<00:01:13.020> you

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
firewire 800 adapter which gives you

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.870 
firewire 800 adapter which gives you
different<00:01:13.439> ports<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.100> different<00:01:14.340> speeds<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
different ports and different speeds and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.060 
different ports and different speeds and
then<00:01:15.330> finally<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.869> thunderbolt<00:01:16.560> adapter<00:01:16.920> which

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
then finally a thunderbolt adapter which

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.520 
then finally a thunderbolt adapter which
is<00:01:17.220> very<00:01:17.490> cool<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.420> sold<00:01:18.689> separately<00:01:19.049> but

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
is very cool it is sold separately but

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.460 
is very cool it is sold separately but
you<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.310> amazing<00:01:20.880> amazing<00:01:21.689> speeds<00:01:22.259> of

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
you get the amazing amazing speeds of

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.039 
you get the amazing amazing speeds of
Thunderbolt<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.490> maybe<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.689> could<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
Thunderbolt so maybe we could have a

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.429 
Thunderbolt so maybe we could have a
view<00:01:25.350> review<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.580> coming<00:01:26.970> soon<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.479> then

and has a superseded SuperSpeed USB 3.0

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.460 
and has a superseded SuperSpeed USB 3.0
so<00:01:50.759> let's<00:01:51.210> get<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> unboxing<00:01:51.899> knife<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.290> get

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
so let's get the unboxing knife and get

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:02.539 
so let's get the unboxing knife and get
right<00:01:52.799> into<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.369> box<00:02:00.170> okay<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.590> immediately

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
right into the box okay so immediately

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.429 
right into the box okay so immediately
you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.790> see<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> bottom<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.049> drive

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
you can see the bottom of the drive

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.310 
you can see the bottom of the drive
already<00:02:04.979> ah<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.540> guess<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:06.930> could<00:02:07.049> take<00:02:07.170> that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
already ah so I guess we could take that

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.820 
already ah so I guess we could take that
out<00:02:07.530> first

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.550 

so<00:02:11.830> there's<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.340> drive<00:02:12.910> enough<00:02:13.420> some<00:02:14.260> pretty

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
so there's the drive enough some pretty

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.290 
so there's the drive enough some pretty
good<00:02:14.890> protection<00:02:15.340> we'll<00:02:15.640> set<00:02:15.820> that<00:02:15.850> aside<00:02:16.000> for

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
good protection we'll set that aside for

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.990 
good protection we'll set that aside for
right<00:02:16.720> now<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:19.780> here<00:02:20.260> we<00:02:21.160> have<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.790> USB<00:02:22.860> 3.0

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
right now in here we have the USB 3.0

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.750 
right now in here we have the USB 3.0
cord<00:02:25.000> this<00:02:25.270> goes<00:02:25.540> into<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.990> back<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.200> the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
cord this goes into the back of the

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.870 
cord this goes into the back of the
goflex<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.180> then<00:02:28.270> from<00:02:28.510> there<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.950> plug<00:02:30.760> it

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
goflex and then from there you plug it

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.200 
goflex and then from there you plug it
into<00:02:31.090> your<00:02:31.300> computer<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.680> that's<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.220> then

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
into your computer so that's that then

into your computer so that's that then
also<00:02:34.570> over<00:02:35.170> here<00:02:35.440> we<00:02:35.710> have<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:37.480> power<00:02:37.810> adapter

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
also over here we have the power adapter

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.110 
also over here we have the power adapter

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
nothing we can't figure out ourselves

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.500 
nothing we can't figure out ourselves
and<00:03:23.590> here's<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.310> star<00:03:24.550> of<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:24.700> show<00:03:24.730> we<00:03:25.240> have

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
and here's the star of the show we have

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.250 
and here's the star of the show we have
the<00:03:25.750> backup<00:03:26.080> plus<00:03:26.590> 4<00:03:27.550> terabyte<00:03:28.090> hard<00:03:28.270> drive<00:03:28.540> it

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
the backup plus 4 terabyte hard drive it

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.610 
the backup plus 4 terabyte hard drive it
comes<00:03:29.560> in<00:03:29.740> a<00:03:29.920> few<00:03:29.950> different<00:03:31.110> sizes<00:03:32.110> including

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
comes in a few different sizes including

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.350 
comes in a few different sizes including
one<00:03:33.100> terabyte<00:03:33.550> and<00:03:33.610> then<00:03:33.880> it<00:03:34.000> goes<00:03:34.150> all<00:03:34.330> the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
one terabyte and then it goes all the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.810 
one terabyte and then it goes all the
way<00:03:34.510> up<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.660> four<00:03:35.050> terabytes<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:36.100> let's<00:03:36.400> take<00:03:36.610> a

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
way up to four terabytes so let's take a

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.420 
way up to four terabytes so let's take a
quick<00:03:37.209> look<00:03:37.240> around<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:38.650> is<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:38.980> side<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.220> it

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
quick look around this is the side of it

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.449 
quick look around this is the side of it
it's<00:03:39.640> a<00:03:39.790> nice<00:03:39.940> blank<00:03:40.630> simple<00:03:41.350> help<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.890> then

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
it's a nice blank simple help and then

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.220 
it's a nice blank simple help and then
on<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.670> front<00:03:42.970> we<00:03:43.120> have<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.360> Seagate<00:03:43.810> logo

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
on the front we have the Seagate logo

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.949 
on the front we have the Seagate logo
and<00:03:44.470> then<00:03:44.800> I<00:03:45.040> believe<00:03:45.370> maybe<00:03:45.880> some<00:03:46.330> indicators

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
and then I believe maybe some indicators

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.540 
and then I believe maybe some indicators
LED<00:03:47.410> indicators<00:03:47.890> on<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:48.160> side<00:03:48.370> we<00:03:48.520> have

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
LED indicators on the side we have

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.610 
LED indicators on the side we have
another<00:03:48.820> seagate<00:03:49.270> logo<00:03:51.390> on<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.540> bottom<00:03:52.660> just

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
another seagate logo on the bottom just

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.070 
another seagate logo on the bottom just
information<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.520> then<00:03:54.670> on<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.420> back<00:03:55.660> as<00:03:55.930> I

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
information and then on the back as I

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.720 
information and then on the back as I
said<00:03:56.740> just<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:57.070> little<00:03:57.310> while<00:03:57.459> ago<00:03:57.670> we<00:03:58.330> have<00:03:58.600> the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
said just a little while ago we have the

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.550 
said just a little while ago we have the
power<00:04:00.730> adapter<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.630> then<00:04:01.780> also<00:04:01.990> where<00:04:02.440> you

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
power adapter and then also where you

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.560 
power adapter and then also where you
connect<00:04:02.830> the<00:04:02.950> USB<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:03.820> believe<00:04:04.060> some<00:04:04.240> fans

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
connect the USB and I believe some fans

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.890 
connect the USB and I believe some fans
at<00:04:05.320> up<00:04:05.590> some<00:04:05.860> more<00:04:06.100> events<00:04:06.760> and<00:04:07.000> that<00:04:07.570> is<00:04:07.720> it

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
at up some more events and that is it

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.199 
at up some more events and that is it
it's<00:04:08.470> pretty<00:04:08.680> simple<00:04:08.950> design<00:04:09.310> it's<00:04:09.580> nice<00:04:09.880> it's

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
it's pretty simple design it's nice it's

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.130 
it's pretty simple design it's nice it's
not<00:04:10.480> that<00:04:10.780> big<00:04:11.320> for<00:04:12.100> Terra<00:04:13.000> four<00:04:13.390> terabytes<00:04:13.750> is

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
not that big for Terra four terabytes is

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.190 
not that big for Terra four terabytes is
a<00:04:14.310> very<00:04:15.310> large<00:04:15.580> space<00:04:16.000> as<00:04:16.270> I<00:04:16.390> said<00:04:16.600> before<00:04:16.630> and

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
a very large space as I said before and

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.550 
a very large space as I said before and
I<00:04:18.540> think<00:04:19.540> it's<00:04:19.660> going<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:19.810> be<00:04:19.900> very<00:04:19.960> good<00:04:20.380> it

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
I think it's going to be very good it

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.070 
I think it's going to be very good it
should<00:04:20.710> be<00:04:20.830> very<00:04:20.859> fast<00:04:21.400> depending<00:04:22.270> on<00:04:22.270> what

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
should be very fast depending on what

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.320 
should be very fast depending on what
show<00:04:23.229> you<00:04:23.289> use<00:04:23.650> it<00:04:23.949> is<00:04:24.099> compatible<00:04:24.729> with<00:04:24.909> USB

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
show you use it is compatible with USB

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.219 
show you use it is compatible with USB
2.0<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.439> 3.0<00:04:27.479> backwards<00:04:28.479> compatible<00:04:29.020> and

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
2.0 and 3.0 backwards compatible and
