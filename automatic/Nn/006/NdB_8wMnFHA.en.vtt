00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.559
 I hope you are well in any case 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.520
 I for my part it's going my great one 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.800
 so resold themselves for a new 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.720
 video about call of duty modern warfare 2 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.000
 in general scrum mode 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.350
 i want to thank Scottish qg coast 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.600
 philip lowe because you'll see it's 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.970
 a very very nice gameplay and I was 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.220
 provided with the keller breton 50 as well as 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.949
 akimbo diggers two trump cards 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.750
 and not to aim to reload more 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.280
 quickly of course cough forces 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.340
 opposition to do more damage 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.930
 and as well as ninja cough to be 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.350
 much more stealth especially in melee 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.570
 General 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.360
 so that was an attempt it's 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.670
 also nuclear of course but hey I 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.409
 do not spoil the score or know if 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.120
 I saw them or not but hey you 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.800
 doubt that if I send this gameplay 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.290
 in that touch is that it is necessarily 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.150
 a very good gameplay so here I will be 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.479
 finished loan for the description of the 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.680
 gameplay 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.000
 now I come my leader 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.980
 comments and as you all know 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.540
 there are some duty costs coming out in 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.090
 November by the way the first videos 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.870
 campaign have been claude and so if 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.890
 you had not seen him I you 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.270
 recommend going to go on the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.550
 code string that I have for example or 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.870
 coach and f who put the videos in 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.220
 line about it so me 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.840
 personally I look at them on it 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.010
 after you do as you want I 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.480
 think now youtube there is no 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:52.020
 many chains that would have studs 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.730
 this kind of videos here but 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.250
 today chose to talk to you about the 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.260
 subject especially more specifically of 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.900
 dogs in which optics os so see 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.560
 the dogs in this game have a very 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.350
 great importance 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.009
 compared to the tough call of duty such as 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.509
 modern warfare 3 or 1 dogs not 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.039
 sir if there were dogs with a 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.470
 little word of the sentence three yes well 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.850
 sure in the Bible management but otherwise 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.260
 it was in black ops girl in 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.550
 black ops of course also where 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.840
 we can unblock our dogs and 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.250
 swing but the dogs in modern 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.540
 warfare 3 it was only in the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.190
 survival but so you 're going to sell and 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.250
 in those who have what he saw what 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.630
 was really super important so 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.130
 firstly yes as announced at the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.420
 xbox wayne conference and like 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.170
 you could have seen in the first 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.060
 campaign images 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.250
 the dogs they have a great big 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.780
 importance in the game so firstly 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.910
 we can listen to it relay in the 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.180
 campaign mode so of course if you have 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.430
 seen the videos but of course they will be 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.560
 present in the multiplayer and that's 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.780
 much more than an opinion or debate because I 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.580
 will prove to you in any case so already 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.720
 at the conference of ex boss wayne 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.850
 already they announced that dogs 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.620
 can be controlled and could 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.180
 serve to defuse explosives 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.880
 so I'm thinking for instance about miles 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.830
 maybe black keys to dimitile 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.200
 yes good carnage does not talk about things 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.570
 who annoy short for me I hope 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.549
 take short or help to win 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.660
 the goal so I want to clarify already 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.470
 that that was said so for those who 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.120
 would have watched the video in English 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.340
 so maybe it would have been 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.400
 may be complicated to understand 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.840
 but I personally watched 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.980
 thanks to jeuxvideo.com so maybe 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.840
 there may be some people 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.790
 also we look and I think 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.810
 besides a lot of eyes to watch and 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.790
 one of the people he is he has it 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.129
 said so that's when he translated and 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.930
 so it's no problem on that side 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.579
 so appreciated not when we look at the 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.720
 video of the campaign sometimes so if 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:49.180
 you look at her part in her code that 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.530
 I chatted is crazy at first if we stop 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.470
 at the good end of this second we can 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.889
 so see a kind of tablet or 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.569
 a mini laptop like like 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.889
 in modern warfare 3 for example with 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.470
 the little vision there that promise us 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.790
 something so had it was many 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.829
 flagship places 3 for example when 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.780
 had a ripper for example when one 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.069
 the balance and uche occitana deigns us 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.569
 not engage if there was a noticeable 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.379
 I believe you can open his 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.510
 laptop 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.789
 remember and so his thrust the cry 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.859
 strict who were against the tree after 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.479
 if you want or cia which blackhawks 2 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.099
 of course where there is the famous tablet 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.099
 for whoever plays a high performance 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:30.080
 not just to launch a 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.250
 lightning for example or launched I 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.260
 do not know how to control a combat daf 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.330
 for example we use the table is so 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.400
 that's when you control a district 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.050
 so here in this case I think that 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.669
 already there in the countryside would 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.940
 controllable in my opinion I think that's 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.729
 would be so the rich kilt that would 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.320
 usable online then by cons 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.930
 what I will go but what I would like 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.400
 point out that ben the killstreaks 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.199
 should not they be too crack 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.539
 because for example if you look at this 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.310
 video about the camp on the countryside that 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.580
 you can observe see at the top 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.510
 right of your screen 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.400
 it's true that as you can see 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.720
 the dog can detect the enemies 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.150
 behind the walls so I do not know 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.590
 how will they manage for the 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.570
 multiplayer mode but it's true that good 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.699
 we already have that with the viewfinder 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.770
 on modern warfare on black ops excuse 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.360
 me that allows to see through the 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.310
 walls 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.050
 enemies before m I think it is 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.030
 really I'm not sure but I believe 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.379
 that's it and so should not they 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.960
 be too cracked because of course 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.180
 people rage ray and that would make 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.610
 rachid as on blackhawks 2-1 on good 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.379
 in short, anyway, I tell you that it can 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.719
 to promise that can allow something else 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:36.930
 especially that swing dogs like 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:38.710
 on black ops 2 or on low black ops 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.409
 I want to say that dogs do 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.729
 of taf but we finally down that we 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.169
 allows rocks so one side it's 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.909
 well because of one knew well the 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.280
 dogs do the job and that allows us to 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.419
 rocks but controlled a dog that can 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.979
 to be even more fun and that can 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.990
 allow I think another experience 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.849
 of the game it can also allow other 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.860
 thing in the game and that's maybe it 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.449
 who can make the difference on this on 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.270
 this news this new opus 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.909
 well here I am so I think I said 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.349
 pretty much not bad for all that is 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.389
 killstreaks dogs so now 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:09.189
 I would like to thank you once again 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:10.960
 coast that i have cocef simu claude but 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:12.129
 first my for those who do not 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.569
 do not know or what happened 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:15.159
 this video without subscribing to my 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.270
 chain I would like to introduce myself a little 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:17.500
 little because yes it's a little 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.560
 moment for those who subscribe to the 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.180
 channel I did not do and video because 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.969
 unfortunately I had the cases and 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.349
 it's me and I'm in second so 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:29.500
 I do not have the bac at the end of the year already 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:31.539
 seduced not bad but I had I go 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.680
 work and that's what I did not do 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:33.969
 great thing this year 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.620
 so to present a little bit my 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:37.300
 chain and me my chain I base 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.589
 especially of course everything that is 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:44.379
 gameplay of gameplay discoveries 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:47.080
 as well as multiplayer games such as 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:48.610
 call of duty for example I base 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.289
 also on the tutorials because I have 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.539
 started my chain at the base on 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:56.110
 tutorials such as having the eye or speed 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:59.740
 on pc or audi a video in hd 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.360
 and so it's tutorials of course and 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.800
 also mostly fun because I like 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.599
 do a little delirious video 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.949
 anything getting lost in gold or having 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:07.509
 totally anything because 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:08.770
 that's what I like to touch for that 

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:10.539
 I like this kind of youtube hours 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.060
 in any case you have been able 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:15.430
 see in the bottom right from where in water 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.960
 when the light appeared that yes 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.060
 so I'm doing 25 frac in a row so 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.490
 I unlocked my neck the tunes 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.050
 so I do not know if deer the 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.639
 score directly and you will see 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:28.330
 obviously I did a great score 

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:29.800
 there I think I'm at I'm at 28 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.530
 frag so here I 'm going to do the last 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.810
 just after and i'm going to swing my
