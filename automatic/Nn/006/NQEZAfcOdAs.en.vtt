00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
initial thoughts on it so yeah I thought

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.650 
initial thoughts on it so yeah I thought
at<00:00:32.009> first<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.820> foundation<00:00:32.969> was<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.570> be

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
at first this foundation was going to be

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.530 
at first this foundation was going to be
a<00:00:33.690> lot<00:00:33.989> too<00:00:34.200> dark<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.590> me<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.360> but<00:00:36.360> when<00:00:36.510> I

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
a lot too dark for me and but when I

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.940 
a lot too dark for me and but when I
started<00:00:36.840> putting<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.590> seemed<00:00:37.829> to

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
started putting it on it seemed to

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.760 
started putting it on it seemed to
change<00:00:38.190> color<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.850> lighter<00:00:39.180> tone<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.899> I

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
change color to a lighter tone and I

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.100 
change color to a lighter tone and I
don't<00:00:41.010> know<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:42.420> supposed<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.750> do<00:00:42.930> that

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
don't know if it's supposed to do that

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.560 
don't know if it's supposed to do that
or<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.890> looks<00:00:44.730> dark<00:00:45.090> when<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.480> a

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
or if it just looks dark when it's a

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.180 
or if it just looks dark when it's a
little<00:00:46.079> bit<00:00:46.200> more<00:00:46.289> concentrated<00:00:48.620> but<00:00:49.620> yeah<00:00:49.920> I

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
little bit more concentrated but yeah I

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.819 
little bit more concentrated but yeah I
quite<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.270> it's<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> little<00:00:52.350> bit<00:00:52.500> harder

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
quite like it it's a little bit harder

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.040 
quite like it it's a little bit harder
to<00:00:52.949> work<00:00:53.100> with<00:00:53.160> some<00:00:53.910> other<00:00:54.180> foundations<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
to work with some other foundations and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.080 
to work with some other foundations and
I<00:00:55.079> do<00:00:55.140> find<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.860> had<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.340> use<00:00:56.370> quite<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.820> lot

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I do find that I had to use quite a lot

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.639 
I do find that I had to use quite a lot
of<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:58.190> but<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> do<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.699> way<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.059> looks

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
of it and but I do like the way it looks

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.320 
of it and but I do like the way it looks
it's<00:01:02.960> it's<00:01:03.960> not<00:01:04.170> completely<00:01:04.619> flawless<00:01:05.070> as<00:01:05.670> you

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
it's it's not completely flawless as you

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.440 
it's it's not completely flawless as you
see<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.810> still<00:01:07.110> see<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> few<00:01:07.680> like

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
see it still see a few like

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.050 
see it still see a few like
imperfections<00:01:09.450> every<00:01:09.689> now<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:11.060> did

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
imperfections every now and then and did

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.810 
imperfections every now and then and did
reapply<00:01:12.720> some<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.500> well<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.920> it's

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
reapply some of this as well and it's

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.980 
reapply some of this as well and it's
still<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.119> little<00:01:15.420> bit<00:01:15.799> obvious<00:01:16.799> but<00:01:17.840> you<00:01:18.840> know

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
still a little bit obvious but you know

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.160 
still a little bit obvious but you know
I<00:01:19.170> also<00:01:19.950> found<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> quite<00:01:21.840> dry

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
I also found that I have a quite dry

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.830 
I also found that I have a quite dry
nose<00:01:22.470> bury<00:01:23.310> my<00:01:23.460> hand<00:01:23.670> again<00:01:23.850> anyway<00:01:24.150> quite<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
nose bury my hand again anyway quite a

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.920 
nose bury my hand again anyway quite a
dry<00:01:25.080> nose<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.210> foundation<00:01:27.210> tends<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.900> not

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
dry nose and foundation tends to not

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.609 
dry nose and foundation tends to not
want<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.590> stick<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.479> think<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:31.110> sticks

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
want to stick to it I think this sticks

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.730 
want to stick to it I think this sticks
too<00:01:32.009> well<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:33.990> goes<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> little<00:01:34.590> bit

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
too well and it's all goes a little bit

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.719 
too well and it's all goes a little bit
cakey<00:01:36.200> but<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.530> easily<00:01:37.829> sorted<00:01:38.189> out<00:01:38.340> because

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
cakey but it's easily sorted out because

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.510 
cakey but it's easily sorted out because
i<00:01:38.880> use<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.570> car<00:01:40.320> remember<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.130> brand<00:01:41.280> name

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
i use the car remember the brand name

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.469 
i use the car remember the brand name
LaRoche<00:01:42.200> Posey<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.500> think<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.729> spring

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
LaRoche Posey I think is the spring

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.700 
LaRoche Posey I think is the spring
water<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.579> think<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.470> spread<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.649> on

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
water in a can think and spread that on

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.710 
water in a can think and spread that on
and<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.340> all<00:01:50.579> sorted<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.149> out<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.299> little<00:01:51.600> bit

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
and it's all sorted it out a little bit

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
and it's all sorted it out a little bit
made<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.799> less<00:01:52.950> cakey<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.140> just<00:01:55.140> generally

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
made it less cakey and just generally

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.510 
made it less cakey and just generally
looked<00:01:56.070> nicer<00:01:57.530> he<00:01:58.530> made<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> whole<00:01:59.040> face<00:01:59.250> look

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
looked nicer he made the whole face look

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.170 
looked nicer he made the whole face look
a<00:01:59.700> lot<00:01:59.939> nicer<00:02:00.000> because<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.659> think<00:02:01.310> if<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.790> clings

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
a lot nicer because I think if it clings

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.230 
a lot nicer because I think if it clings
on<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.420> any<00:02:03.719> places<00:02:04.020> where<00:02:04.460> your<00:02:05.460> skin<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.880> dry

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
on to any places where your skin is dry

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.139 
on to any places where your skin is dry
and<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.500> you've<00:02:07.649> got<00:02:07.680> oily<00:02:08.580> foundation

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
and so if you've got oily foundation

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.880 
and so if you've got oily foundation
oily<00:02:09.599> skin<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.170> think<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.739> would

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
oily skin I think that this would

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.920 
oily skin I think that this would
probably<00:02:11.099> be<00:02:11.310> better<00:02:11.580> for<00:02:11.970> you

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
probably be better for you

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.580 
probably be better for you
I<00:02:13.310> have<00:02:14.310> weird<00:02:15.269> skin<00:02:15.659> that<00:02:15.930> strained<00:02:16.349> some

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590
