and<00:05:22.480> somehow<00:05:22.690> the<00:05:22.890> lines<00:05:23.890> hitch<00:05:24.340> his<00:05:24.580> legs<00:05:24.880> rip

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
and somehow the lines hitch his legs rip

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.110 
and somehow the lines hitch his legs rip
him<00:05:25.930> underneath<00:05:26.200> the<00:05:26.740> undercarriage<00:05:27.220> like<00:05:28.090> a

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
him underneath the undercarriage like a

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.770 
him underneath the undercarriage like a
slingshot

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
slingshot

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.690
