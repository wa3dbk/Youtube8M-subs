 hamas spyware farewells or 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:55.820
 hidden identifiers that attempt 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.550
 against information security 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.530
 in the same if that information medium in

 of information contained in it 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.000
 very interesting this effort the 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.430
 Colombian town brother would be 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.860
 interesting an extra effort here

 movistar the country game this means 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.900
 that if venezuela point b in scoring is 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.019
 argentina punto r which is uruguay the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.819
 point if it's colombia and so on 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.590

 of the we can comment more two 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.330
 limited guarantees after three watching 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.879
 because it comes with two 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.709
 and here comes something interesting that are 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.980
 evolution of the device charger 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:35.340
 of perry was here 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.459
 it is precisely the plug here back 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.709
 place you note this charge quoted 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.590
 that you already know him as the 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.230
 saver or charger when connected to 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.170
 the computer this one or just like 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.780
 the charge for connectivity port looks 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.670
 how it looks precisely to synchronize 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.400
 relationship to each other for that if possible 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.650
 place with this and this is a charger 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.930
 it is no longer great this is fulfilling 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.180
 as always normative rules or insurance 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.830
 they are interesting is specifically the 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.260
