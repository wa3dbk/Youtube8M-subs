00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 Clear 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.140
 things 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.110
 the announcement of road construction 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.380
 stowage or south by president danilo 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.390
 medina has brought with it different 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.060
 conjectures some in favor others against 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.790
 this project has been expected by 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.250
 sectors of the two regions for 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.920
 more than three decades since this way 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.470
 would come to develop the trade and the 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.750
 tourism from the southern part several 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.730
 alternatives have been presented and 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.400
 evaluated by the representatives of the 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.070
 ecological society of the cibao so that 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.820
 the central mountain range is affected by 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.940
 here is that it is being announced that 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.440
 is working on one of the routes for 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.630
 road 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.770
 yangón santiago or the cibao south highway 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.590
 only 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.260
 seeing the panorama of what is this 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.090
 population because there is talk of two 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.490
 regions that do not have communication with 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.950
 one is behind the other as in 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.980
 the case of santiago and san juan and that 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.010
 is looking for a one way alternate one 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.410
 an alternate route for this road 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.560
 between these is the stone path 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.410
 blanca bonao up rancho arriba san 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.950
 Jose gave coba and from there to barahona 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.640
 pedernales and san juan a second option 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.130
 would be the road jarabacoa constanza 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.770
 New San Jose de Ocoa San Juan Valley 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.560
 the maguana as a third lesson would be 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.320
 the road jarabacoa constanza el 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.460
 fenced father the houses san juan de la 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.560
 maguana the biggest impacts that 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.310
 they can have another road they have to 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.729
 see with water sources 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.280
 that is, we would be talking about a 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.860
 tracing that would touch part of what 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.399
 would be the park manolo tavares just the 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.399
 Park 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:11.640
 armando bermúdez and also part of the 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:16.300
 park is also ramírez and certainly 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.910
 del carmen ramírez is that park 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.640
 that there is everything that is called a 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.110
 large expanse of forests and sources 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.470
 of water would be one of the places where 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.020
 there would be greater environmental impact through 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.820
 a field study conducted by the 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.220
 science academy of the republic 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.500
 Dominican Republic it was determined that for the 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.410
 construction of a road that crosses the 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.960
 mountainous system would be necessary 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.150
 make huge cuts of hillsides and 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.180
 large earthworks with the 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.680
 potential risk of inducing 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.100
 considerable landslides whose 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.500
 sediments would go to riverbeds and 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.900
 streams that in turn will lead to 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.800
 several dams in the country by two elements 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.820
 important that would impact so 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.240
 negative which is the water system and 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.480
 we are talking about the very important river 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.880
 and the mountain range but also going to 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.400
 impact what they are 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.250
 to the most important protected areas 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.520
 of the country and that we want 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.540
 preserve it because there is a whole 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:31.030
 set of elements that are necessary 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.240
 to maintain balance 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:39.130
 ecological of the region we are talking 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.620
 of the park armando bermúdez del josé del 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.290
 carmen ramírez from manolo tavares just 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.170
 and other alternative protected areas that 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.060
 they are out there of these rivers tp of great 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.480
 part of the economy of the regions 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.820
 north and south of the country for their contributions to 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.920
 agricultural irrigation generation 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.320
 hydroelectric power and supply of 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.990
 aqueducts through this investigation 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.450
 it was determined that there is no way to cross 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.850
 the central mountain range and that is damaged 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:11.080
 Irreversible way water sources 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.540
 of the country good that part there we are 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.870
 talking about that part there is where 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.239
 comes where is the difference manaclas 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.780
 the whole road would come bordering that 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.930
 Montana 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.620
 falling down here for these hills 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:31.340
 and it would happen it would be all this side all 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.949
 this part here and that would be the route that 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.650
 is being designed for the area 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:38.870
 san josé de las matas to two before in the 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.289
 particular case of the sabaneta dam 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.169
 would put at risk the supply of 6.35 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.910
 megawatts of hydroelectric power well 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.240
 as agricultural activity in the 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.370
 municipalities are juan hato del yaque 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.740
 sabaneta the maguana juande generates and 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.630
 punta caño gonzalo castillo minister 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.240
 public works said the government is 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.949
 studying 17 alternatives for 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.560
 construction and they are being 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.150
 studied by different technicians but 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.849
 one of the options that has come to the 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.340
 public light as possible route is the 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:13.250
 tracing of monastery sabaneta crossing the 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.530
 armam national park bermudez whose 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.020
 design is being criticized by 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.509
 different environmental associations and 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.440
 that we want to preserve because 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:28.039
 there is a whole set of elements 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.780
 which are necessary to maintain 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.930
 preserve balance 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:37.790
 ecological of the region we are talking 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:40.310
 of the park armando bermúdez del josé del 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.980
 carmen ramírez from manolo tavares just 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.610
 and other alternative protected areas that 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.950
 they are out there that we want 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:53.180
 draw significant attention 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:55.400
 of the government so that those areas are not 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.400
 affected because of affecting those areas 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.530
 would put into play what is the 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.930
 stability 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.430
 ecological and environmental country and there 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.020
 another element that is extremely 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:12.750
 important there is not a country in the world 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:17.190
 that has achieved a development 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:19.650
 important but preserves if you do not care if 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:22.140
 it does not protect what its resources are 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.990
 natural advantages increase of 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.510
 Cultural tourist trade exchange 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.000
 artistic and social between these two 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.190
 regions will change the face of the south with 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.200
 job creation companies and 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.280
 riches for the benefit of both 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.890
 regions 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.620
 the cibaeños would not have to go through 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:43.950
 the capital to go south and they could 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.620
 do it in an hour and a half disadvantages 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:49.230
 it would affect more than 40 kilometers of 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.690
 stable forests and in the process of 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.600
 regeneration endangers the 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.730
 tropical forests plus the impact of 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.980
 soil and water this discontinuity 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.770
 would have a devastating effect on 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.230
 ecological flows modifying the habitat 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.270
 of thousands of species the cibao highway 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.340
 south one of the most projects 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.230
 preponderant in the history of the 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.900
 terrestrial communication in the republic 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:15.600
 Dominican without a doubt that would come 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.880
 to develop two communities but the 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.030
 authorities can not forget the 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.580
 welfare of the country if this continues 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:26.870
 tracing that affects so 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.870
 significant to natural resources 

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.640
 yes but
