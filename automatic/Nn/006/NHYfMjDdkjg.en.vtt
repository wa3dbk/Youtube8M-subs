00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.839
 At some point I aspire to do how I 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.850
 like to be simple like that without keys 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.860
 pistons and with the possibility of stretching 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.170
 me and to bail me like whoever is looking 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.170
 be happy 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.570
 in my case I had a rest of vision 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.720
 up to 7 years and then continue 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.180
 completely and as the cuchi would say 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.340
 I'm staying the guy was staying 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.900
 blind and he fucked the situation so much 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.490
 who wrote a samba so that in that 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.410
 shadow is all the sadness of that 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.360
 situation and being able to keep light and 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.250
 a sadness I think it's almost one of the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.660
 more wonderful things that I appreciate 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.400

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.640

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.640
