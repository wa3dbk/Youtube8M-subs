00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
training and we've had two different

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.340

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.300 
doing you know playing a lot so you know
I<00:00:18.510> think<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.869> coaches<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.289> see<00:00:19.439> us<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.770> how

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
I think the coaches can see us and how

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.660 
I think the coaches can see us and how
we<00:00:20.340> do<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.960> we<00:00:21.960> had<00:00:22.080> our<00:00:22.109> first<00:00:22.230> game<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:23.490> went

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
we do and we had our first game it went

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.700 
we do and we had our first game it went
pretty<00:00:23.730> well<00:00:23.880> tie<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.840> wind<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.350> feels<00:00:25.380> a

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
pretty well tie in a wind it feels a

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.540 
pretty well tie in a wind it feels a
little<00:00:25.830> bit<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> preseason<00:00:26.900> but<00:00:27.900> yeah<00:00:28.890> we

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
little bit like a preseason but yeah we

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.769 
little bit like a preseason but yeah we
just<00:00:29.730> forgot<00:00:30.000> about<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.300> when<00:00:30.599> we<00:00:30.689> were

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
just forgot about that when we were

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.870 
just forgot about that when we were
playing<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.140> game<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.349> know<00:00:32.250> where<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.550> were

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
playing the game and know where we were

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.299 
playing the game and know where we were
come<00:00:33.239> out<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> win<00:00:33.750> 3-1<00:00:34.260> as<00:00:34.710> our<00:00:35.040> first

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
come out with the win 3-1 as our first

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.370 
come out with the win 3-1 as our first
game<00:00:35.489> together<00:00:35.700> as<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> team<00:00:36.390> for<00:00:36.719> olympics<00:00:37.170> and

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
game together as a team for olympics and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.920 
game together as a team for olympics and
I<00:00:38.340> think<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.000> always<00:00:39.120> good<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.390> start<00:00:39.540> good

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
I think it's always good to start good

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.049 
I think it's always good to start good
and<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.680> thought<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.070> played<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.340> really<00:00:41.940> good
