row<00:01:53.630> we're<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.900> going<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> purl<00:01:55.500> where<00:01:55.890> we

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
row we're just going to purl where we

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.560 
row we're just going to purl where we
see<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.160> purl<00:01:56.400> stitch<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.910> knit<00:01:57.060> where<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.360> see

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
see a purl stitch and knit where we see

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:06.320 
see a purl stitch and knit where we see
a<00:01:57.600> knit<00:01:57.990> stitch

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.590 

against<00:02:07.110> fu<00:02:07.530> pearl<00:02:07.830> across<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:09.150> cable

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
against fu pearl across the for cable

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.150 
against fu pearl across the for cable
stitches<00:02:10.050> there<00:02:10.290> might<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.680> bit<00:02:10.890> tighter

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
stitches there might be a bit tighter

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.880 
stitches there might be a bit tighter
because<00:02:11.700> you've<00:02:11.910> actually<00:02:12.590> twisted<00:02:13.590> them<00:02:13.770> on

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
because you've actually twisted them on

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.410 
because you've actually twisted them on
the<00:02:14.040> needle<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:20.310> then<00:02:20.520> just<00:02:20.760> keep<00:02:20.940> working

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
the needle and then just keep working

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.950 
the needle and then just keep working
across<00:02:21.630> this<00:02:21.930> wrong<00:02:22.170> side<00:02:22.440> row<00:02:22.710> until<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:24.750> get

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
across this wrong side row until you get

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.980 
across this wrong side row until you get
to<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.320> end<00:02:25.830> just<00:02:26.400> purling<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.690> knitting<00:02:27.960> the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
to the end just purling and knitting the

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:40.360 
to the end just purling and knitting the
stitches<00:02:28.970> as<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.180> would<00:02:30.360> do<00:02:30.540> normally

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.280 

okay<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.090> if<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.450> turn<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.840> around<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:42.170> can

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
okay so if you turn it around you can

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.320 
okay so if you turn it around you can
see<00:02:42.940> that's<00:02:43.940> your<00:02:44.269> cable<00:02:45.110> forward<00:02:45.560> with<00:02:45.860> the

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
see that's your cable forward with the
