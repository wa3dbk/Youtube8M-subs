 prospects that we need us 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:36.420
 need such a small bowl 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.060
 where in it we will cook banana puree 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.850
 by the way this mask is often used in 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.190
 Thai spa salons and this mask is very 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.820
 common in asia and especially in 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.070
 Thailand 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.700
 we'll take this banana slice 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.650
 somewhere here probably 34 to roll 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.990
 opel entei sang a certain 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.060
 but in no case should a banana be 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.210
 you will find the dark one and I will ask you 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.150
 knead to a state of mush and you can 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.360
 quietly add some water to a spoon 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.789
 a spoon so that this was smetanka not 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.250
 very thick not very liquid but we take 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.650
 The following ingredients are rice flour 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.969
 the fastest way to cook take 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.100
 white rice and 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:21.240
 on the grinder to the state 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.580
 flour and dust youth we are at home such flour 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.390
 ourselves can do so we need 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.330
 such 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.940
 teaspoon with a slide it we will 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.830
 masochku to do at one time or directly here 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.300
 a few times, you can get in 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.900
 do the workpiece 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.150
 banana pulp can be added but 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.980
 necessarily fresh and I understood that is 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.280
 dry ingredients separately wet 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.710
 separately just like in the kitchen sector and yes 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.530
 the fact is that rice is unique 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.440
 means unique product first 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.620
 Japanese cosmetologists love 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.740
 funds and from rice the fact is that rice 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.080
 perfectly finely polishes the skin in the second 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.880
 it contains a huge amount 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.650
 antioxidants and very important such 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.970
 component that help the skin 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.270
 keep young 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.990
 removes toxins already polished taper 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.740
 pores 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:17.340
 it is just a number one hit 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:19.650
 next we add in such a spoon with 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.930
 riding oatmeal and cooked 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.450
 in the same way you need to take flakes 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.590
 you can take oat kernels and grind that 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.200
 by the way more useful oats is such 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.480
 very soft grinder removes all 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.760
 all here this roughness here you know 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.760
 about winter and autumn during the cold season and 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.840
 especially if you are going to look 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.090
 do not solemnly use coarse 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.880
 mechanical scrubs even for 3-4 days 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.000
 because the skin will slazit 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.880
 pieces and no make-up will not save you 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.100
 and this that and this here we have cleaned 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.440
 walnut and also this way seems 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.810
 can be cooked on several masks and 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.600
 add such a fat spoon 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.240
 buckwheat past walnut butter 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.460
 walnut very long penetrate the skin on 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.920
 she is so viscous and helps the skin 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.560
 give a good turgor that is here 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.570
 what we need to have skin 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.230
 smart filled plus beautiful 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.000
 again , a light natural scrub 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.710
 Now we mix that is what 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.750
 billet that can be stored 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.060
 some days yes yes and 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.470
 This can be diluted for example 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.130
 milk or cream 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.020
 but the best remedy is a banana and therefore 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.000
 you will find 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.220
 perfectly cooked mashed potatoes just that 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.160
 consistency that is needed and we 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.470
 add our turns out 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.220
 teaspoons downright full 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:47.000
 yes yes we need so that the banana and some water 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.220
 crushed oatmeal and softened from the 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.229
 eat ours shouldn't be dry 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.909
 i must be soaked with fat and 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.250
 remember that walnut 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:58.129
 for a very long time it gives off oils and we are very 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.110
 it is important that this oil is just mixed 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.699
 how much is the minute to stand 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.220
 must this mixture before we will 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:07.970
 put holding enough literally there 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.610
 20 30 40 seconds while we mix 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.530
 carefully and here's a hero I'm mixed 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.360
 I think this is such a magic mixture that 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.849
 in principle , it can be useful 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.729
 turns out to be a banana oatmeal walnut rice 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.710
 nut and banana are just health porridge and 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:26.300
 health mask at the same time look 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:28.789

 any make-up how to apply it correctly 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.310
 Apply this mask to cleansed skin
