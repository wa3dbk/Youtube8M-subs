in<00:00:45.539> some<00:00:46.050> islands<00:00:46.469> there<00:00:46.920> were<00:00:47.190> se<00:00:48.149> beetles<00:00:48.629> as

the major source of food so the beaks of
these<00:00:52.050> finches<00:00:52.590> were<00:00:53.160> designed<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.789> best<00:00:54.149> eat

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
these finches were designed to best eat

these finches were designed to best eat
beetles<00:00:55.620> whereas<00:00:56.340> others<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.850> may<00:00:57.000> find<00:00:57.360> your

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
beetles whereas others you may find your

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
food in the form of nuts and so they had

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.430 
food in the form of nuts and so they had
to<00:00:59.789> have<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> different<00:01:00.210> shaped<00:01:00.660> beak<00:01:00.840> designed

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
to have a different shaped beak designed

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.500 
to have a different shaped beak designed
to<00:01:01.559> crack<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.070> nuts<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:02.969> up<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> food

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
to crack the nuts to get up the food

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.070 
to crack the nuts to get up the food
inside<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.400> bird<00:01:05.640> came<00:01:06.299> over<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
inside and so as the bird came over and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.170 
inside and so as the bird came over and
expanded<00:01:07.979> throughout<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.580> Galapagos

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
expanded throughout the Galapagos

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.990 
expanded throughout the Galapagos
Islands<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.869> chain<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.560> islands<00:01:10.909> created<00:01:11.909> by

all originally derived from some
mainland<00:01:16.830> bird<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.909> few<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.509> them<00:01:18.630> got

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
mainland bird but a few of them got

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570 
mainland bird but a few of them got
blown<00:01:18.990> over<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.439> island<00:01:19.860> say<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.189> example

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
blown over to one island say for example

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.880 
blown over to one island say for example
those<00:01:21.119> who<00:01:21.150> had<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> best<00:01:21.869> traits<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.590> survive

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.770 
those who had the best traits to survive
in<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.130> Island<00:01:23.310> lived<00:01:23.790> those<00:01:24.299> who<00:01:24.479> had<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.340 
traits that didn't allow them to survive
died<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.880> therefore<00:01:27.479> didn't<00:01:27.810> pass<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.140> their

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
traits and ultimately the population

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.480 
traits and ultimately the population
there<00:01:31.020> got<00:01:31.320> well<00:01:31.560> designed<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.189> first

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
there got well designed for that first

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.969 
there got well designed for that first
Island<00:01:32.939> then<00:01:33.450> maybe<00:01:33.960> they<00:01:34.170> flew<00:01:34.409> off<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.650> some

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
Island then maybe they flew off to some

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.260 
Island then maybe they flew off to some
other<00:01:35.040> islands<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.640> storm<00:01:35.909> blew<00:01:36.090> them

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
other islands a storm blew them

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.910 
other islands a storm blew them
something<00:01:36.780> happened<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.350> allowed<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> few<00:01:37.829> of

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
something happened and allowed a few of

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.120 
something happened and allowed a few of
them<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.420> migrate<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.869> yet<00:01:40.619> another<00:01:40.770> new

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
them to migrate to yet another new

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.639 
them to migrate to yet another new
Island<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.700> had<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.600> adapt<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.229> Selective

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
Island and had to adapt to the Selective

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.410 
Island and had to adapt to the Selective
pressures<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.100> are<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.369> Island<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
pressures that are on that Island and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.929 
pressures that are on that Island and
this<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.350> allowed<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.920> create<00:01:47.399> lots<00:01:47.729> of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
this just allowed you to create lots of

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.749 
this just allowed you to create lots of
different<00:01:48.390> kinds<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.780> birds<00:01:48.930> from<00:01:49.259> one

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
different kinds of birds from one

different kinds of birds from one
starting<00:01:50.759> population<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:51.840> again<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> say

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
starting population now again I say

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.920 
starting population now again I say
relatively<00:01:53.100> fast<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.659> the
