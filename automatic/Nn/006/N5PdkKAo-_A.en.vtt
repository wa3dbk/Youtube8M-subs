00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.490
 in terms of the differences that we can 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.319
 find among the three models we have 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.620
 have to say that well, the iphone5 that 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.620
 a processor is taken to 7 while 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.290
 iPhone 6 and 6 plus mount a chip 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.180
 what is the a8 that good is more powerful and 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.400
 it is logically faster to be 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.040
 new phones we also have to 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.170
 take into account the weight of the phones 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.610
 although it is not too different between 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.640
 we have to say that 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.699
 example the iphone 5s are 112 grams that 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:36.020
 It is very light and with respect to the models 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:38.570
 following the iphone 6 the model of 4.7 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.710
 inches are 129 grams and the model of 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.350
 5.5 172 grams in terms of resolution 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.640
 of the screen we have to say that the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:54.320
 model of the model 5 s has 1.136 x 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:58.870
 640 pixels the cic the 6 the model 6 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.450
 it has 1,334 for 750 and the 6 plus model 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.680
 1920 x 1080 in terms of the density of 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.530
 pixels 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.910
 each one good because these two the model 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:14.810
 5 and 6 have 326 dots per inch and 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.790
 the 6 plus model have 401 points for 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.820
 inch in terms of prices that 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.370
 we can find these three models of 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.340
 phones we have to say that the three 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.070
 they are manufactured in 16 gb but only 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.479
 the 5 s is manufactured in 32 therefore the 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:36.200
 price are 599 2 649 for the 5 s in 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.259
 function of the capacity we want 699 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.040
 up to 900 euros depending on whether they are 16 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.080
 64 or 128 and for the model 6 plus amounts 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.220
 start at 800 euros of these two thousand 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.690
 euros that the 128 gb model costs 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.020
 will also remember that we can buy the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.810
 iphone 5 c that ultimately is corn a 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.580
 iphone 5 or a little older than what 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.580
 they make in 8 gigs and it has a price of 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.440
 399 euros in terms of colors 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.690
 available all three are available 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.940
 in exactly the same silver colors 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.520
 gold and space gray 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.630
 the three models are the spatial reverse 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:19.160
 as you can see the back is what it is 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.170
 as if it were graphite in this part 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.360
 another of the differences between 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.660
 these three phones comes associated with the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.670
 video recording the highest models 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.670
 of iPhone 6 are capable of recording video 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.460
 in full hd both at 30 and 60 frames 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.070
 per second while the model 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.770
 iphone 5 s is only able to record 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.450
 1000 to 1080 with 30 frames that is 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.940
 pretty good but hey there's a 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.320
 slight improvement on the iphone 6 in terms of 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.810
 Slow motion video recording 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.360
 we have to say that the 5 s was capable 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.230
 to record video at 120 frames per second 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.790
 at 720 dots per inch and it has also 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.850
 Improved this aspect on iPhone 6 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.730
 full of 220 hours per second 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.890
 up to twice 240 raps per second 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.960
 which means that we can record 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.050
 actions in motion and these 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.900
 appear softer and simply that 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.640
 they will do better in terms of the camera 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.470
 front which is the one used in the 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.180
 video calls or when we make a 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.730
 self and for example we have to say that 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.520
 all three models share exactly 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.310
 the same camera with only one difference 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:29.569
 all three have 12 megapixels 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.790
 with a resolution of 1280 x 960 records 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.280
 a video at 720 dots per inch is 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.580
 say high definition is not full hd but 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.860
 if it's high definition and this model 5 is 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.510
 he has an opening of 2.4 and these two 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.950
 fingers with two the difference is not 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.840
 too big but good when 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.330
 we are in situations with little light as 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.340
 example inside a house then 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.030
 well, yes, it can be noticed 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.140
 slightly the difference in the opening 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.209
 so I 've said good about the 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.430
 zeidi good well we also have improvements 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.080
 on the iphone 5 is the stub and it is the 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.760
 first that was implemented in a phone 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.830
 apple mobile and even the 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.269
 competition and well then it has a use 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.780
 simple to unlock the phone 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:11.209
 as you see if we press it unlocks 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.560
 with our footprint and in the models of 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:17.810
 iPhone 6 not only serves to 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.630
 unlock the phone but also 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.870
 if we press twice because it has this 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.570
 function that the screen goes down so that what 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.580
 we can use better with one hand in 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.260
 how to use it with one hand 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.780
 we have to say that really the most 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.090
 comfortable is the iphone 5 that since it's more 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.310
 small yes it is true that good now we 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.039
 we have become accustomed to the edges 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.470
 rounded models of iphone 6 and 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.760
 this now it seems that we are nailed 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.250
 but the truth is that we have been 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.050
 using for a year and we have not had 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.120
 no problem of being nailed 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.800
 edges or anything like that we follow 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.199
 thinking that the 4-inch model is 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.930
 a very correct model for most 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.910
 of users nevertheless good then in 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.850
 some occasions like to read or 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.229
 write messages or see pictures 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.600
 good models with one more screen 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:08.000
 great is appreciated more that increase of 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.190
 screen in model 6 good then 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.410
 we can also handle it with one hand 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.539
 and if we have an inconvenience like 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.389
 we have mentioned we can make use of 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.370
 this feature to the iPhone 6 if 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.960
 true that good because some things for 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.759
 example if we enter 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.160
 on twitter, as you can see, everything looks 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:27.319
 pretty good you see all the big text 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.680
 and the photographs are seen in the 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:33.229
 4.7-inch model look great 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.370
 however, well, we have to say 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.710
 that if for example now we would like 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.990
 touch our logo, it's a bit 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.050
 complicated to reach with one hand so 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.610
 there are so many occasions that we either have 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.940
 have to resort to this function to 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.610
 reach or simply what we have to 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.770
 to do is to use it with two hands 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.719
 what happens with the iphone 6 model 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.879
 plus new ones that effectively do not 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:59.180
 we can use with one hand this is a 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:01.009
 great disadvantage because well the 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.349
 people who want to use it with one hand 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.479
 will be able to use it but therefore 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.310
 we have to use both hands 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:10.039
 what is your good advantage because 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.900
 example if we enter the calendar and 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.139
 we put it in landscape mode and we see the 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.240
 month then it has an interface 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:19.129
 absolutely different than in the others 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.629
 two phones this way that good 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.819
 Well, we can see a lot more 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:24.650
 information and good because this is going to 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.659
 improve in our experience in 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.289
 our productivity and well then 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:32.120
 simply because it is more comfortable to have a 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.789
 larger screen at the time of 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.740
 work not however if we want it 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:38.840
 put in your pocket for example the 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.719
 trousers since good because the more 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.980
 small be logically more comfortable going to 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:45.980
 be 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:48.680
 In short, well, we have Paul 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.960
 has taken out two new phones the iphone 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.380
 6 and the iPhone 6 plus and that compared to 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.420
 the iphone 5 that yes there is an improvement in 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.210
 As for the overall performance there is a 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.800
 improvement of autonomy and well then 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.520
 we want the design to create 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.710
 larger screens because they are the 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.650
 we are thanking users 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:12.400
 less us if we liked it and good 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:15.580
 for doubt really consists 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.430
 in choosing what iphone 6 model does not 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.199
 like more if a more portable model more 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.630
 comfortable to wear that has a screen 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:24.789
 large or a model with a screen 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.820
 really great that although one is therefore 

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:29.470
 a little more complicated to handle it with 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.050
 one hand and we have to make use of two 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:34.030
 Well the truth is that ls that increase in 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:38.009
 screen we will thank the 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.009
 most applications that we have
