00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
and when you get down to the ends where

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.560 
and when you get down to the ends where
the<00:02:19.290> elastics<00:02:20.040> are<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:20.940> just<00:02:21.120> pull<00:02:21.360> those

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
the elastics are you can just pull those

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.190 
the elastics are you can just pull those
right<00:02:22.020> out

and<00:02:36.110> then<00:02:36.530> at<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.799> bottom<00:02:36.830> you<00:02:37.459> can<00:02:37.489> just<00:02:37.819> add

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
and then at the bottom you can just add

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.350 
and then at the bottom you can just add
an<00:02:38.450> elastic

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
an elastic
