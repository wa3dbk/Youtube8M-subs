00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.860 

look<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:47.760> all<00:00:47.880> the<00:00:47.970> water<00:00:48.210> that's<00:00:48.450> inside

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
look at all the water that's inside

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.150 
look at all the water that's inside
there<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.340> keeps<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:51.530> playing<00:00:52.530> ticking

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
there but it keeps on playing ticking

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.670 
there but it keeps on playing ticking
timex<00:00:53.850> keeps<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.240> ticking<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:55.260> keeps<00:00:55.500> on

timex keeps on ticking this keeps on
playing<00:00:56.180> you<00:00:57.180> see<00:00:57.360> all<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.720> water<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.050> there

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
playing you see all the water out there

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.970 
playing you see all the water out there
all<00:00:58.560> day<00:00:59.100> long<00:01:00.410> everybody's<00:01:01.410> talking<00:01:01.860> about

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
all day long everybody's talking about

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.310 
all day long everybody's talking about
everybody's<00:01:02.880> talking<00:01:03.090> about<00:01:03.390> water<00:01:03.840> proofing

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
everybody's talking about water proofing

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.280 
everybody's talking about water proofing
the<00:01:04.430> technology<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.360> check<00:01:06.660> it's<00:01:07.080> all

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the technology but if you check it's all

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.110 
the technology but if you check it's all
sealed<00:01:07.620> they're<00:01:07.860> wrapping<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
sealed they're wrapping it up and

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.610 
sealed they're wrapping it up and
they're<00:01:09.240> putting<00:01:09.510> sills<00:01:09.840> into<00:01:10.230> putting<00:01:10.410> sit

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
they're putting sills into putting sit

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.800 
they're putting sills into putting sit
like<00:01:10.800> a<00:01:10.830> look<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.730> i<00:01:12.300> want<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.600> i<00:01:12.780> want

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
like a look at that and i want it i want

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.570 
like a look at that and i want it i want
some<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.350> mine<00:01:13.590> or<00:01:13.800> if<00:01:13.860> i<00:01:13.920> want<00:01:14.190> to<00:01:14.250> go<00:01:14.310> surfing

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
some of mine or if i want to go surfing

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.550 
some of mine or if i want to go surfing
with<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.330> don't<00:01:15.780> want<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.960> all<00:01:16.050> sealed<00:01:16.350> up

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
with it I don't want it all sealed up

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.630 
with it I don't want it all sealed up
and<00:01:17.550> then<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> only<00:01:19.800> and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
and then and so this is the only and

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.920 
and then and so this is the only and
that's<00:01:20.820> why<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.000> got<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.390> innovator<00:01:21.720> award

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that's why we got the innovator award

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.630 
that's why we got the innovator award

anything<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:46.050> you've<00:01:46.860> now<00:01:47.070> got<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
anything you have you've now got the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.430 
anything you have you've now got the
ability<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.970> protect<00:01:48.150> you<00:01:48.450> from<00:01:48.630> water<00:01:48.900> and

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
ability to protect you from water and

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.620 
ability to protect you from water and
not<00:01:49.680> just<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.130> raindrop<00:01:50.550> here<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.270> raindrop

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
not just a raindrop here and a raindrop

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.310 
not just a raindrop here and a raindrop
there<00:01:52.080> but<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.130> literally<00:01:53.870> go<00:01:54.870> swimming

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
there but you can literally go swimming

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.890 
there but you can literally go swimming
with

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.700 

yeah<00:01:59.900> right<00:02:00.530> now<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:01.520> process<00:02:02.410> it<00:02:03.410> goes

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
yeah right now the process it goes

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.460 
yeah right now the process it goes
through<00:02:03.980> a<00:02:04.040> huge<00:02:04.310> chamber<00:02:04.790> that<00:02:05.480> is<00:02:05.540> vacuum

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
through a huge chamber that is vacuum

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.700 
through a huge chamber that is vacuum
and<00:02:07.040> it<00:02:07.400> was<00:02:07.550> basically<00:02:08.210> sills<00:02:08.960> apparel<00:02:09.530> and

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
and it was basically sills apparel and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.430 
and it was basically sills apparel and
polar<00:02:10.160> molecule<00:02:10.759> mammoth<00:02:11.210> molecule<00:02:12.170> together

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
polar molecule mammoth molecule together

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.220 
polar molecule mammoth molecule together
that<00:02:13.250> blocks<00:02:13.520> out<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.820> h2o<00:02:14.360> molecule<00:02:14.930> all

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
that blocks out the h2o molecule all

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.370 
that blocks out the h2o molecule all
other<00:02:15.470> liquid<00:02:15.920> moisture<00:02:16.490> while<00:02:17.090> allowing<00:02:17.420> the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
other liquid moisture while allowing the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.280 
other liquid moisture while allowing the
electronic<00:02:19.070> conductivity<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:20.210> continue<00:02:20.810> and

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
electronic conductivity to continue and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.140 
electronic conductivity to continue and
those<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:22.070> can<00:02:22.220> understand<00:02:22.670> those<00:02:22.880> chambers

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
those you can understand those chambers

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.850 
those you can understand those chambers
are<00:02:23.630> about<00:02:23.840> five<00:02:24.110> hundred<00:02:24.290> thousand<00:02:24.830> dollars

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
are about five hundred thousand dollars
