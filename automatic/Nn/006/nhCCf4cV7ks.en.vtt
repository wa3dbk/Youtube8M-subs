 The open world seal receives the best 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.309
 One character card inside 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.310

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.300
 You can put on a ribbon, hold a pre-change mirror, put on a seal and change it. 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:07.940

 Well then, if you try to take care of Joshin by putting a nurse cap on the nurse's stick too 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:17.350
 I already have a stethoscope and I have a syringe 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.119
 Ruppoku a little with by entering the opponent seal Toka or to have a first aid kit in the back 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.860
 You can also show 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:28.420
 I came to the hospital with a cold like this or something like this 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:32.300
 Megumi who does a vision test can also do such coordination after 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:36.360
 Next is the 4th Cure Princess and the idol set contents 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.660
 Masu like this relationship 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.830
 One character card and back 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.320

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:48.000

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.550
 It is a Cure Princess of the 4th Toki at the time of No. 2 and winks with the previous lovely. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.420
 There is a difference in whether you do not have it 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:59.650
 So let's start writing at first Macadamia Praders 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:04.720
 It is full phosphorus mirror change idol 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:09.270
 It seems that the idol where the た め Gumi-chan sticks out in the play is a little different 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.270
 Rin mirror coming from the idol further 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.220
 change 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.540
 You will be a free-flowing idol 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.780
 But it is good to have inter-6 Gatsui 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.120
 And so on 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.159
 You can also do this 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.330
 If it is a pre-card , there is a comment saying that the day's cooling of the head is cute below here. 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:34.560
 Maybe there is 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:38.630
 Yes, so this time the Pretty Cure is the number 3 of the press conference play with a sparkling seal 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:43.130
 Introduces the cure Lovely toner set fourth cure Princess and the idle set directly below 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:48.090
 The last time I did not peel off at the time of the 1st and 2nd, I said that the light guide might be difficult 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:51.510
 I've ended up quite fun while it is something Kisei Association play But 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:56.730
 Because there are so many parts 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:59.730
 It is great fun to think about various kinds of hellos and such 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.490
 I like glasses great so I have parts with eyes 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:09.830
 Five about put me and Toka ne Red under-rim specific guy is happy with the after 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:11.150
 But It is a tooth is difficult Tteyuu hard to understand how good stuck on anywhere because there is no guide 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.380
 It does not change 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.870
 One point of caution if you do not put the bottoms first 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.430
 that 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.680
 Because here does not overlap properly 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.250
 It is careful when playing it 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.079

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.079
