00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
how I mean of course this isn't as

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.030 
how I mean of course this isn't as
effective<00:04:05.970> as<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.690> jailbroken<00:04:07.170> device<00:04:07.530> bought

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
effective as a jailbroken device bought

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.810 
effective as a jailbroken device bought
through<00:04:08.940> Cydia<00:04:09.210> but<00:04:09.840> I<00:04:10.310> mean<00:04:11.310> this<00:04:11.460> is<00:04:11.670> pretty

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
through Cydia but I mean this is pretty

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.540 
through Cydia but I mean this is pretty
much<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.210> best<00:04:12.300> you're<00:04:12.450> going<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:12.630> get<00:04:12.780> on<00:04:12.990> and

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
much the best you're going to get on and

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.760 
much the best you're going to get on and
on<00:04:14.550> an<00:04:14.730> on<00:04:14.850> jailbroken<00:04:15.300> device<00:04:17.270> and<00:04:18.530> if<00:04:19.530> you're

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
on an on jailbroken device and if you're

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.340 
on an on jailbroken device and if you're
in<00:04:19.830> jail<00:04:20.130> break<00:04:20.370> just<00:04:20.669> for<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:21.060> bar<00:04:21.270> I<00:04:21.540> suggest

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
in jail break just for the bar I suggest

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.200 
in jail break just for the bar I suggest
against<00:04:22.770> it

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
against it

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.350 
against it
I<00:04:24.499> mean<00:04:25.819> jailbreaking<00:04:26.819> I<00:04:26.999> know<00:04:27.090> a<00:04:27.120> lot<00:04:27.300> of

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
I mean jailbreaking I know a lot of

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.179 
I mean jailbreaking I know a lot of
people<00:04:27.599> do<00:04:27.719> it<00:04:27.870> but<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.169> it<00:04:28.590> is<00:04:28.770> in<00:04:28.949> fact

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:29.189 
people do it but it it is in fact

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:32.300 
people do it but it it is in fact
illegal<00:04:29.999> and<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:31.620> just<00:04:31.770> don't<00:04:32.009> want<00:04:32.129> to<00:04:32.159> get

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
illegal and you just don't want to get

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.610 
illegal and you just don't want to get
caught<00:04:32.520> in<00:04:32.759> doing<00:04:33.539> something<00:04:33.870> bad<00:04:34.319> like<00:04:34.379> that

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
caught in doing something bad like that

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.830 
caught in doing something bad like that
so<00:04:35.069> I<00:04:35.279> mean<00:04:36.060> you<00:04:36.180> can<00:04:36.300> do<00:04:36.360> what<00:04:36.479> you<00:04:36.569> want<00:04:36.749> of

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
so I mean you can do what you want of

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.230 
so I mean you can do what you want of
course<00:04:36.870> but<00:04:37.379> I<00:04:37.710> definitely<00:04:38.520> suggest<00:04:38.639> against

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
course but I definitely suggest against

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.559 
course but I definitely suggest against
it<00:04:41.870> but<00:04:42.870> yeah<00:04:43.020> that's<00:04:43.199> how<00:04:43.379> you<00:04:43.439> get<00:04:43.650> a<00:04:43.680> bot<00:04:44.009> in

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:44.569 
it but yeah that's how you get a bot in

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:49.040 
it but yeah that's how you get a bot in
madam<00:04:45.569> mobile<00:04:45.840> for<00:04:46.110> sniping<00:04:46.409> and<00:04:47.479> I<00:04:48.479> guess

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
madam mobile for sniping and I guess

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.080 
madam mobile for sniping and I guess
what<00:04:49.259> I<00:04:49.289> did<00:04:49.529> up<00:04:49.650> here<00:04:49.819> actually<00:04:50.819> kind<00:04:50.999> of

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
what I did up here actually kind of

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.279 
what I did up here actually kind of
worked<00:04:51.379> the<00:04:52.669> up<00:04:53.669> here<00:04:54.680> I<00:04:55.680> guess<00:04:56.370> you<00:04:56.520> can't<00:04:56.789> tap

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
worked the up here I guess you can't tap

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.719 
worked the up here I guess you can't tap
so<00:04:58.289> it<00:04:58.529> just<00:04:58.710> makes<00:04:58.830> it<00:04:58.979> more<00:04:59.099> effective

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
so it just makes it more effective

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.330 
so it just makes it more effective
so<00:05:00.379> yeah<00:05:01.379> that's<00:05:01.500> he<00:05:01.710> make<00:05:01.889> you<00:05:01.979> bought<00:05:02.189> in

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
so yeah that's he make you bought in

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.550 
so yeah that's he make you bought in
madam<00:05:02.639> mobile<00:05:04.159> for<00:05:05.159> a<00:05:05.189> non<00:05:05.370> jailbroken<00:05:05.819> device

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560

madam mobile for a non jailbroken device
if<00:05:07.560> you<00:05:07.830> do<00:05:08.039> use<00:05:08.610> this<00:05:08.729> I<00:05:08.879> hope<00:05:09.000> it<00:05:09.120> works<00:05:09.270> for
