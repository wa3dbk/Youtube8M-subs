that we've laid out for you does that

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.890 
that we've laid out for you does that
for<00:05:39.069> you<00:05:39.250> we<00:05:39.759> increase<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.389> numbers<00:05:40.719> we

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
for you we increase the numbers we

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.570 
for you we increase the numbers we
increase<00:05:41.259> the<00:05:41.409> difficulty<00:05:41.770> of<00:05:42.009> the<00:05:42.099> exercises

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
increase the difficulty of the exercises

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.120 
increase the difficulty of the exercises
and<00:05:42.909> therefore<00:05:43.690> we<00:05:43.870> get<00:05:44.050> to<00:05:44.259> recover<00:05:44.919> that

this conditioning program it's obviously
worked<00:05:52.210> well<00:05:52.479> with<00:05:52.630> up<00:05:52.810> for<00:05:53.139> us<00:05:53.259> at<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.770> twist

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:54.009 
worked well with up for us at the twist
