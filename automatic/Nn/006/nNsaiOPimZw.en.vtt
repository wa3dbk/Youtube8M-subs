 with that with this the y esports also 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.610
 the creators of the games naturally 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.300
 in the case of vigo playing the owners

 millions of dollars in the case of them 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.900
 It is important to clarify that before 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.700
 gifted that is in the dow is original not 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.200
 They were winning silver and why 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.450
 which are not giving money was because 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.640
 they were part of a little platform 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.890
 larger for a game the game will 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.660
 flame warcraft 3 and one can create maps 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.320
 inside that game and one of your maps 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.940
 it was endowed 2 as such and it became itself 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.280
 being makita within one more game 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.950
 great I am the most popular game in the 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.380
 world in that era after that came 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.940
 league of legends and was changed endowment and 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.000
 that the patient was a very similar game 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.800
 open grew a lot today wins 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.080
 much more money that endows them 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.670
 to mention once inheritance 624 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.190
 millions against 80 million dollars 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.960
 However that's a little bit of 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.870
 story of how this came about 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.480
 now in terms of hearings the 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.020
 audiences of these types of games are 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.460
 incredible 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.460
 last year more 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.650
 70 million people saw a u 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.350
 another way electronic games today 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.530
 sports interestingly from his 70s 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.320
 Millions of people 94% approximately 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.810
 they were men and these numbers are 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.090
 impressive but what does it consist of 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.610
 example one of these games in what 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.520
 consists of how to play in what way 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.280
 we could play it if they wanted to we 're going 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.900
 there a vip law of how I know from how 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.030
 see the game and I will explain 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.340
 what is the basic theory behind how 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.930
 the gifted game is played is a game in 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.150
 which you and four friends play against 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.620
 a team of 5 enemies each player 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.570
 controls a hero who has four 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.070
 different skills the goal of 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.350
 game is to destroy an enemy building 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.230
 known as dj and once one of the 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.060
 fans is destroyed the game is over 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.460
 there are two teams in gifted the 'ratings' 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.680
 and the dail each team has its own 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.480
 base with three roads called lines that 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.610
 they lead towards the enemy base with a river 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.930
 dividing the map in half once 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.210
 the game starts every 30 seconds 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.370
 creatures called scripts are born from each 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.960
 base and move towards the enemy truth 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.580
 they attack all enemies in their path 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.800
 a series of towers are 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.080
 on every road too and attack all 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.610
 nearby enemies each base also 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.439
 has an area that is called the source 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.569
 where the heroes can recover life and 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:40.360
 mana and where can buy items and 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.650
 weapons in the store some items only 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.569
 are available in one of the two 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.550
 Secret stores around the map 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:48.080
 so that you are you become strong and 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.059
 have new skills you have to 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.679
 gain experience fighting when a 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:53.149
 powerful enemy clip dies close to you 

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:55.009
 you want to experience experience 

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:56.599
 divided equally among all 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.219
 who are close to the hero or who have 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.139
 dead when they have enough 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:01.969
 experience you can level up and 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.589
 receive a shield point the heroes 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:05.029
 they will automatically become stronger 

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:06.589
 when they rise in level you are also 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:08.539
 can become stronger by buying 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:10.429
 items and weapons with gold all heroes 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.529
 will receive gold unit per second 

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:14.449
 they also earn gold by hitting the blow 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:16.159
 death to clips or weight or towers 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.930
 destroy a tower will also give to 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:18.469
 all in your team a large sum of gold 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.939
 extra 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:21.469
 apart from the clips that are born in each 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:23.180
 base there are also neutral clips that 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:24.919
 they are in the woods also known 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.779
 like the jungles of each base these 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.459
 clips are born every minute near the 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:30.649
 half of the map there is also a club 

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:32.779
 big neutral called pink who is 

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:34.580
 hard to kill killing rollán 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:36.169
 all in your extra insurance team and 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.969
 also an item that allows one of 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.499
 the heroes resuscitate immediately then 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:41.300
 to die the next time 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:42.860
 russian revive every 10 minutes and once 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.360
 has been killed three times also loose 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.039
 admit that it is called cheese that recovers 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.680
 a lot of life and it emanates 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.089
 instantly additionally to give 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.840
 the death blow to enemy clips 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:52.460
 as well 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.110
 give the death blow to your own 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.699
 creeps when they are low in life 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.590
 that's called denying and reducing the 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.220
 experience that won in your enemies by 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.540
 his death and with this already has a good 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.460
 idea of how to play another 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.070
 in particular you can think and league 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.240
 of legends is quite similar until the 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.010
 that differs a little bit in the 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.720
 sense that they are just a player 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.850
 against another player in each 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.590
 they controlled a large army and the 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.169
 idea is that that mana is relatively 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.790
 similar and then already driver and is more 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.919
 similar to the piston games that 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:26.030
 you usually see there as it can be 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:27.650
 read as it was at the time goal of 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.690
 no one of that of the 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.060
 forerunners of all these games and already 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.190
 stopped houris at a very high level 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.620
 professional basically not training 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.760
 they are trained by the military in the army 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.010
 with this time see them 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.810
 finally let me know if you thought 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.250
 interesting this video if you want to put 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.289

 show those who also play pongan 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.470
