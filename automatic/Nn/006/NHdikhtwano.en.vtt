00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:37.040
 equality that had measure since never 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.040
 it is known which is the next one treated 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.420
 the program always has the good 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.010
 surprise of a guest actor which is 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.390
 is immersed in the peculiar situations 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.350
 of these characters giving a touch of 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.350
 freshness at each emission 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.640
 for that teacher yourself 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.079
 Good Morning 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.550
 some strange person that I shut up without 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.550
 my consent 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.170
 director paco cruz the one that devastated with the 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.190
 lucas awards this year 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.140
 that for the sum that I'm going to accept 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.060
 neither by the rabble nor with the network also 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.900
 by multiplication and chile 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.600
 square I'm not interested you imagine your 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:38.870
 house every day the television in a 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:41.870
 video clip awarded this amount not 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.870
 wants 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.310
 that number which is the number that would be the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.150
 sum but good if we have each flower 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.150
 i 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:04.889
 and I think the program has achieved 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.689
 represent a little to what is the 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.519
 Cuban of that generation to what they are 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.459
 the characters that have passed to the 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.969
 third and their conflicts their problems 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.299
 they socialize they are taken to a plane where 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:19.469
 the solutions are usually 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.480
 played by the comedy where they are 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:23.010
 pleasant many times the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.560
 critiques the critics our reality 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.419
 social criticism but trying to leave 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.400
 a jump trying to give a reflection 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.230
 that people think a bit about how much 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.060
 when we made a mistake 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.270
 and what is behind that error and how 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.820
 we can solve it 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.740
 the element of surprise is another of the 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.870
 things that characterizes us by the house of 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.460
 Panfilo have passed lots of animals 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.630
 and Panfilo has had a cow in his house 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.630
 with a calf 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.860
 and to the partner like this pass the 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.980
 animalito here is going to put it here in 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.980
 the 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.660
 appeared snake have appeared mice 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.940
 cats 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.770
 I think the search and the work of 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.600
 work table with scripts 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.610
 constantly looking for how to surprise 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.010
 the public try to introduce a 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.490
 element that is not expected has been part 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.490
 of success 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.390
 and accounts have characteristics that 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.780
 they are very peculiar, not that is 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.420
 talking about a program that basically 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.700
 with measure of situations that are 27 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.680
 minutes a told story of 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.380
 beginning to end that implies a 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.390
 complicated writing because you have to 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.610
 keep in mind whenever you want the 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.060
 characters that situations create as 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.710
 guarantee the surprise how to guarantee 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.560
 the always sympathetic situations 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.420
 attractive and include all the elements 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.550
 that are possible to refresh 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:58.920
 outside animals situations that are 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.650
 really unpublished sometimes in some 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.780
 Our television programs invite 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.060

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.610
 Cuban society is reflected with 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.270
 two very popular characters very 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.800
 protagonists 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.330
