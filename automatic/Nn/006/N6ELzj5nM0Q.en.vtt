00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.220
 So friend goes on 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.449
 "Yasi" 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.890
 Super Mario 64 we have our first wife Stern after we can barely 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.859
 have moved 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:12.859
 and if our world right now on the second or not 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.909
 Best performance 6 coins year 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:19.300
 Memory even further 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.029
 you have one of those already found in the 4-star so you can do some 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.230
 tried to open the locked doors my grandmother said on the first floor 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.619
 or in percent Womens fortress on the ground floor a lobby 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.870
 Heise Boser on bottom us and the power stars we count on you and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.980
 Keep your fingers crossed 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.280
 I do not care they do not open the door yet. "We want all the stars 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.580
 we really want to have everything in the games 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.800
 so defeat the fast Copa, we will also directly the second star 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.650
 pick up 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.790
 so also the headwind of group a we have to 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.870
 against the Metten friend her race 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.140
 "If Marios agrees that you could come there during a hard 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.280
 Battle Besiktas after does not have names like they already are 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.520
 so it seems pretty nice to have something on the box 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.880
 But do you think that's enough for me? 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.500
 up to 2 5 percent back what are you fast enough 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.390
 to beat me I would say you do not look like that 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.930
 How about a race so the tip to find out who faster 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.320
 is 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.690
 but clearly 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.990
 Telgte Telgte 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.040
 percent 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.540
 the music is just awesome 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.340
 percent 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.520
 discreet 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.380
 Why 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.779
 to tents an accent percent 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.710
 is actually my is relatively loose to create the whole 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.420
 unless you build is very big was crap 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.470
 what I 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.020
 Hoffer not to do 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.760
 down there the coppa agrees he said with the shortcut you're making doubts again 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.740
 gate 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.110
 yes, that's pretty much her more little Copa there 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.030
 He does not want to be that way but already 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.740
 a school to ear 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.910
 but so it will probably have no problems and sets easier and then 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.029
 pick up second prize and when 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.629
 So Bruckbauer Stern won the first prize in the second showroom of the 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.629
 not the second prize in the race 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.069
 Of course we only want the first one 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:27.949
 provides 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:30.949
 Barrera on Mario g hamlet 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.689
 Sor the cannonballs Orber blow up horrendous 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.509
 on it also made 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:42.879
 would be the sda 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.199
 Borisov Copado Lusche 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.909

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.979
 Come on, I want to go on 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:53.879
 Percent cell 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.879
 could be too 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.549
 including Euro 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.639
 was my god he was old Koper but soon 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.449
 is synonymous times yes 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:08.449
 some probably beat my friends 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.269
 Arbon 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.269
 Place often not beaten that borders on a miracle 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.269
 here he permanently deserves to be seen 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.669
 Gombold from the star year 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.779

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.799
 and Barack Obama Rioja 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.180
 Nova 2 in the picture of the performance 0 and coins year is not 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.539
 wonder 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:40.539
 Sorbonne range normally 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:43.739
 Bochum 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.519
 Coming from the Adriatic we must once again make our way to the mountain 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.950
 Let's do the hatches on the construction of which I come from 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.009

 Â«We are peaceful Bochums and do not want planning and we put them 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.919
 but their age is at 30 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.970
 Now everyone can do this course for you 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.239
 Percent Pretoria to the ground and flight

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.859
 Ding use such a cannon 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:17.230

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.919
 While not much has brought Switch Gradert 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.699
 although there too 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.879
 we have to take on a fly as already indicated 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.949
 and there we have to, and above all else 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:45.460
 cannons 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.009
 Use of swords but that is on the way up because 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.240
 everyone also in the report 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.699

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.699
 last but also 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.699

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.490
 Frechen one um 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.469

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:17.999
 we have around 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:21.080
 OK 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.080
 That was the wrong thing, but you have to 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:28.819
 introduces ADATA LTE 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:30.439

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:40.189
 and that closes her the cannon 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:43.189
 Szalais is throwing away the body 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:47.309

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:22.990
 the actors have 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.430
 save for your disappear island and continue of course 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.080
 Of course, we can go now, but we can go one year 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.490
 now go on big coins yard people 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.319
 I think the abrupt Munich 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.899
 so the topic already directly many bind from here three pieces 

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:41.639
 beautiful 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.009
 I do not want to read 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.179
 and not only that we get ourselves is 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.680
 up here 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:55.330

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:19.389
 Number three on the eye sanctions how to do that in a market 

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:21.830
 then you have to 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.990
 front 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.990

 Instinctively I ran then but right 

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:51.259
 Although we have to catch up with the red minster this year, that's clear 

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:00.289
 we had to look at it so well was not easy 

00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:03.289
