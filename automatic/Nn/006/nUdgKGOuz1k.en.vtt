00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.880
 Hello friends 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.640
 in this video I'm going to show you how it was 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.650
 my filter filter of the last video is 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.369
 a homemade external filter as you can see 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:21.720
 the water no longer runs off 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:25.410
 it's practically the same but then this one 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.590
 it is better done also the base change it 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.500
 I put a glass base to hold 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.290
 more then then everything is safer 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.129
 the hose changed it and I put it more 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.760
 long so that the head can stay 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.760
 up there back 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:50.489
 and well everything goes fine filtering excellent 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.489
 in the current is less 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.930
 that's why I made the change of 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.080
 filters because 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.019
 the current of the power head was 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.790
 very strong and then in the long run my fish 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.100
 they got stressed and 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.130
 and that's why it was the change apart from that 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.440
 this filter is how it is on the outside 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.960
 it is easier to clean it approximately 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.780
 it lasts a month or will last a month 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.650
 and then everything is very good, the water is so 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.490
 clean 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.420
 and this 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.580
 Well, if you want me to share how you 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:35.150
 does how did I comment what 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.520
 and this I share with you how this is done and 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:42.670
 how can they see the water falls 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.230
 Very slowly, not without strength and without much 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.640
 strength of the fish of sant more 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:51.890
 quiet 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.880
 there is no stress by force and then 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.440
 everything is going very well 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.410
 so it looks from the side 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.790
 the head of power and the hose that 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.340
 get on the boat and filter the water 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.090
 Oh friends, that's all, see you 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.090
 bye
