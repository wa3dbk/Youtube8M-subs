 offspring of Schalke 04 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.660
 but 96 is not back 28 minutes 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.939
 that 's in defender waldemar anton 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:13.200
 with the strong allusion to captain 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:16.020
 kruppke on serious the nearly 30 to 1 was called 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.810

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.180
 flashy sany who pushes the ball 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.060
 and then his fellow florian pick 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.649
 leaves the 0 2 for the royal blue 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.689
 in the 52nd 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.789
 but who now thinks that 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.049
 the game is decided is one of 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.960
 better be taught 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.329
 96 comes back and like that 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.240
 substitutes noah jewel series pass 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.159
 Fueled up nicely in the penalty room plays 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.140
 the ball is sharp in front of goal and in there 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.720

 play and 96 continues to gas 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.920
 this is where anton falls in the penal area 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.670
 brought and that gives the eleven meters 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.369
 Captain herb belongs to execute and inside 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.470

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.799
 one minute and a quarter before the game 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.799
 ending 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.890
 and it should stay that way 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.770
 referee that the victory en suite

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.349
 but also bring no decision 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.030
 should 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.040
 The decisions must be made in the 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.140
 penalty shootout be brought about 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:38.489
 Schalke 04 starts with the protection 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:41.910

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.640
 a self-confidence 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.950
 So now the shadow mountain 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.040

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.560
 Hannover 96 now has to balance Timo 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.569
 ebbers carries the burden and masters it 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.610

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:39.189

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:53.219
 Substitution certainly transformed to 7 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.219

 the defender starts and hits 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:15.629
 88 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:26.050
 the local is called the ninth pillar for 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:27.460
 Schalke no chance for Mexico and he 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.539
 marked the important goal 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:34.389
 to 1 2 darius marotzke marotzke is running 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:36.940

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:40.389
 bitter schalke 04 wins the junior 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.389
 dfb cup semi-final with 8 to 0 at 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:46.870
 Hannover 96 in the eleven meter lottery 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:48.909
 pity for 96 fought great and great 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.610
 returned to the game after a 0 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:53.800

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.810
 be sure to be more than proud too 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.280
 if the mourning naturally outweighs too 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.729
 as some stalls from the stadium 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.860
 program 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:03.190
 before the game of the pros against Werder 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.110
 bremen matching words it was a 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.400
 sensational game the 2000's at it 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.740
 I think we were very supportive 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.020
 and boys got everything out and on 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.539
 At the end we missed the luck 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.030
 but I am very proud of our boys 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:18.370

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.169
