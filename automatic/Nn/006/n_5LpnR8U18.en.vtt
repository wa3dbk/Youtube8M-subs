00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.559
 i am patricia and i am going to you 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.010
 explain how to make an angel 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.630
 and this is the little angel that we are going to make 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.869
 step by step I will explain how it works 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.970
 what we need is fill'd 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.230
 a piece of string and bead for it 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.990
 head 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.269
 and from colored paper we go the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.980
 make wings 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.630
 so what are we going to do we are going to start 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.489
 making the body 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.489
 so there I cut a piece on the 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:53.270
 next step is the feet and making 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.270
 we are a button and turn this look 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:01.170
 that is a brother that is important to you 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.610
 button on the same side same 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.420
 length does otherwise you have two 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:11.670
 different greetings of course and then 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:16.550
 I have to make the body by up there 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.550
 piercing a bead in front of the hofje 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:25.550
 and we will do it that way 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.550
 then you already have the body 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.490
 you can put your little angel on a gift somewhere 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.660
 paste or even in the Christmas tree 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.690
 and then you can get bigger or smaller 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.970
 make like you want what you do so 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.970
 nevertheless make a knot above it 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:49.110
 so and then so 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.860
 one step what we need are the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.380
 arms and a dress and the wings 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.210
 the arms is nice if we have them 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:04.200
 for example in a different color 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:06.179
 I grab a large piece of rope for that 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.670
 doing it is also a knot 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.670
 put for the hands 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.580
 another one and that side and one on the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.580
 customer 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.140
 so then the two arms have 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.540
 what we are going to do now is a piece of felt 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.000
 may choose which color and I go 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.580
 quite choose I already have a strip 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.230
 then cut off and then with a dress 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.450
 for cutting to just equalize him 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.500
 kate best just get a double 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.030
 fold 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.150
 you can measure a little how 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.970
 must be long dress and then you can 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:03:00.790
 just cut a triangle and do that 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.790
 we cut it off by a corner 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:09.470
 cut the other corner and up 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.300
 cut loose because what you have to do 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.420
 you have two sides to me is one of them 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.970
 for pasting and stick one from behind 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.170
 so that the yellow is stuck so do something 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.170
 we put a little glue on it 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.240
 a little glue on the other side then 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.569
 we 'll just put it on you later 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.569
 on it 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:44.860
 And with that comes the head you immediately 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.860
 stuck so we put it back on 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.040
 empty the arms on it 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.140
 and stick it very close 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.460
 so 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.430
 then you already have the little angel 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.430
 what we need now are the wings 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.870
 so how to cut the wings then 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.090
 are different colors of cardboard 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:27.800
 I opted for blue with a bit 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:30.810
 and a motif with stars 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.250
 I already have a wing on it 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.930
 signed but you can for example 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.220
 different signs you can 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.610
 have different forms of one 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.610
 wing 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.120
 I'm going to cut this out 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:05:02.670
 then you fold it there so that I double 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:04.860
 a little bent, we just do that 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.600
 also glue on the inside and not 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.930
 on the colored side but on the white 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.930
 inside 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:26.740
 and then we stick it in the back of it 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.740
 in the middle of it and then you have the wings 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.229
 And then the last thing is that he doesn't have any 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.419
 has faces 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.500
 so we do that with 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.510
 by getting white eyes 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.410
 for instance 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.410
 let's use this 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.590
 the arrow and create with it 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.590
 small white dots 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:58.090
 you can go there with just a black marker 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.090
 draw a coin on it 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.250
 and if you would like to decorate 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.360
 that is my little daughter has done can 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:13.490
 for example you still have the white dots 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:16.210
 do this and in principle you are 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.210
 angel then ready 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:23.749
 you can also find everything on 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:23.749
