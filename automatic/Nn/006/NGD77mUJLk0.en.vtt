00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
straight away from the Mach punch so I

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.150 
straight away from the Mach punch so I
go<00:00:54.690> for<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> u-turn<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:55.379> didn't<00:00:55.890> think<00:00:56.039> you

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
probably not the best play but it is a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.870 
probably not the best play but it is a
specially<00:01:34.710> defensive<00:01:35.100> wall<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.790> hit

know this little dragon pulls more here

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.130 
know this little dragon pulls more here
because<00:01:41.820> he's<00:01:42.000> doing<00:01:42.240> less<00:01:42.390> damage<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:43.140> leave

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
because he's doing less damage to leave

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.620 
because he's doing less damage to leave
I'm<00:01:44.200> doing<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:44.620> hit<00:01:44.800> so<00:01:45.100> I<00:01:45.610> just<00:01:46.180> decided<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:46.510> go

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
I'm doing it hit so I just decided to go

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.880 
I'm doing it hit so I just decided to go
for<00:01:46.840> another<00:01:46.960> one<00:01:47.170> he's<00:01:47.440> gonna<00:01:47.560> end<00:01:47.770> up

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
for another one he's gonna end up

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.310 
for another one he's gonna end up
switching<00:01:48.159> out<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.729> go<00:01:48.880> into<00:01:49.210> his<00:01:49.810> slow<00:01:50.110> bro

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
switching out and go into his slow bro

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.960 
switching out and go into his slow bro
it's<00:01:50.560> gonna<00:01:50.740> do<00:01:50.950> like<00:01:51.159> a<00:01:51.190> decent<00:01:51.580> amount<00:01:51.820> of

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
it's gonna do like a decent amount of

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.290 
it's gonna do like a decent amount of
damage

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
damage

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.230 
damage
I<00:01:52.420> guess<00:01:52.630> not<00:01:53.200> too<00:01:53.830> much<00:01:54.070> but<00:01:54.520> I<00:01:54.760> just<00:01:54.970> don't

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
I guess not too much but I just don't

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.880 
I guess not too much but I just don't
really<00:01:55.390> feel<00:01:55.780> like<00:01:55.840> switching<00:01:56.440> out<00:01:56.590> here

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
really feel like switching out here

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.859 
really feel like switching out here
because<00:01:57.729> I<00:01:58.119> just<00:01:58.300> want<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.510> get<00:01:58.630> as<00:01:58.720> much

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
because I just want to get as much

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.780 
because I just want to get as much
damage<00:01:59.140> on<00:01:59.380> this<00:01:59.590> thing<00:01:59.710> as<00:01:59.830> possible<00:02:00.040> goodra

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
damage on this thing as possible goodra

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.190 
damage on this thing as possible goodra
is<00:02:00.850> already<00:02:01.119> at<00:02:01.210> load<00:02:01.420> amount<00:02:01.600> of<00:02:01.720> health<00:02:01.900> um

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
is already at load amount of health um

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.249 
is already at load amount of health um
so<00:02:03.100> I<00:02:03.520> was<00:02:03.610> kind<00:02:03.970> of<00:02:04.000> like<00:02:04.090> let's<00:02:04.420> just<00:02:04.869> do<00:02:05.080> this

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
so I was kind of like let's just do this

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.699 
so I was kind of like let's just do this
and<00:02:05.500> pretty<00:02:06.160> much<00:02:06.340> slow<00:02:06.670> bro<00:02:06.900> not<00:02:07.900> necessarily

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
and pretty much slow bro not necessarily

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.440 
and pretty much slow bro not necessarily
specially<00:02:09.100> offensive<00:02:09.550> most<00:02:09.729> of<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:09.880> time<00:02:10.090> so

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
specially offensive most of the time so

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.690 
specially offensive most of the time so
it's<00:02:10.750> attacks<00:02:11.650> I'm<00:02:11.890> gonna<00:02:12.070> be<00:02:12.190> doing<00:02:12.550> that

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
it's attacks I'm gonna be doing that

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.670 
it's attacks I'm gonna be doing that
much<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.120> me<00:02:13.239> so<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:13.780> decided<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.410> go<00:02:14.530> for

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
much to me so I decided to go for

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.350 
much to me so I decided to go for
another<00:02:14.800> dragon<00:02:15.250> pulse<00:02:15.400> he<00:02:15.610> now<00:02:15.790> switches<00:02:16.239> out

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
another dragon pulse he now switches out

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.330 
another dragon pulse he now switches out
in<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.540> miltank<00:02:16.989> thinking<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.800> milton<00:02:18.190> can

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
in the miltank thinking that milton can

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.670 
in the miltank thinking that milton can
actually<00:02:18.610> do<00:02:18.790> more<00:02:19.360> damage<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.720> me<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.170> indeed

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
actually do more damage to me and indeed

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.960 
actually do more damage to me and indeed
that's<00:02:20.890> probably<00:02:21.340> what<00:02:21.520> he<00:02:21.580> should<00:02:21.760> have<00:02:21.850> done

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
that's probably what he should have done

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.120 
that's probably what he should have done
in<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.209> first<00:02:22.420> place<00:02:22.750> because<00:02:23.230> milton<00:02:23.950> can

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
in the first place because milton can

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.800 
in the first place because milton can
actually<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:24.790> know<00:02:24.820> probably<00:02:25.450> knock<00:02:25.660> me<00:02:25.780> out

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
actually you know probably knock me out

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.180

they can't be put asleep at all so

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.670 
they can't be put asleep at all so
that's<00:04:39.310> pretty<00:04:40.120> unfortunate<00:04:40.960> I<00:04:41.080> guess<00:04:41.290> I<00:04:41.530> just

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680
