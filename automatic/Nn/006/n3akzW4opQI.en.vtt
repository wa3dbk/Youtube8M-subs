00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.890 
chemicals today big cosmetics companies
say<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.520> doses<00:05:04.000> of<00:05:04.030> poison<00:05:04.270> in<00:05:04.509> the<00:05:04.599> products

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
say the doses of poison in the products

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.020 
say the doses of poison in the products
are<00:05:05.020> small<00:05:05.380> enough<00:05:05.410> to<00:05:05.650> be<00:05:05.800> harmless<00:05:06.160> yeah

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
are small enough to be harmless yeah

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.760 
are small enough to be harmless yeah
maybe<00:05:07.300> if<00:05:07.479> you<00:05:07.570> use<00:05:07.720> them<00:05:07.870> once<00:05:08.020> a<00:05:08.199> year<00:05:08.590> I

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
maybe if you use them once a year I

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.710
