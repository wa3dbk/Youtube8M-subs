00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
pulling the lines I'm saying don't let

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.320 
pulling the lines I'm saying don't let
it<00:02:27.040> touch<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.220> water<00:02:27.520> tell<00:02:27.880> me<00:02:27.970> tell<00:02:28.180> me<00:02:28.209> about

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
it touch the water tell me tell me about

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.740 
it touch the water tell me tell me about
that

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
that

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.240 
that
well<00:02:29.110> when<00:02:29.320> it<00:02:29.410> touches<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.770> water<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:30.130> line

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
well when it touches the water the line

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.640 
well when it touches the water the line
becomes<00:02:30.520> extremely<00:02:30.850> heavy<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.690> water<00:02:31.870> the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
becomes extremely heavy the water the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.890 
becomes extremely heavy the water the
lion<00:02:33.130> absorbs<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.610> water<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.690> comes

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
lion absorbs the water and it comes

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.830 
lion absorbs the water and it comes
really<00:02:35.050> heavy<00:02:35.320> so<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.790> less<00:02:37.000> water<00:02:37.269> has<00:02:37.540> in<00:02:37.720> it

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
really heavy so the less water has in it

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.120 
really heavy so the less water has in it
the<00:02:38.050> easier<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.560> is<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.769> heave<00:02:40.920> today<00:02:41.920> this

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
the easier it is to heave today this

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.430 
the easier it is to heave today this
