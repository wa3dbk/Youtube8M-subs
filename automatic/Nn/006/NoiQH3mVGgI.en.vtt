 within the state policy on 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.749
 development of the Far East in accordance 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.110
 with presidential decree of November 22, 2012 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:17.539
 of the year

 adata nursed ohh rushydro for 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.279
 a better future region of the energy 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.009
 the revolution in the east of the country has begun 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.390
 today oyu rushydro and rao es east 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.339
 are actively working on the implementation 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.339
 projects in 4 regions 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.620
 after commissioning in 2016 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.420
 new stations will replace the old ones and create 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.030
 required power reserve for 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.530
 reliable energy and heat supply 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.330
 Far Eastern consumers more 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.910
 light and heat for the Annunciation 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.790
 Sakhalin Yakutsk and Soviet speak 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.780
 more business opportunities 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.630
 construction industry 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.490
 infrastructure projects for 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.960
 ensure maximum transparency in 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.810
 budget expenditures 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.580
 JSC RusHydro has formed a mechanism 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.410
 allowing the state in constant 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.570
 mode to evaluate and analyze the course 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.680
 project implementation and implement 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.979
 target use control 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.020
 means an important part of the control system 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.119
 spending funds are a contract 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.689
 bank escort between jsc 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.189
 RusHydro and Sberbank 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.049
 use of budget funds will begin 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.479
 only after state examination 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:25.729
 and independent price audit technique 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:28.929
 project four stations four regions 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.929
 four years 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.260
 start-up of the second stage 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.000
 Annunciation TEC will ensure 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.490
 progressive development of the Amur capital 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.020
 give home citizens warmth and light to lay 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.980
 the foundation for rapid growth and 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.470
 regional economy 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.150
 expert estimates show 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.640
 shortage of heat capacity in the city already 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.030
 today is 90 hyp this is lari per hour 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.390
 from 2015 this figure will rise to 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.740
 170 fuel for the station is already defined and 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.960
 brown coal gets tired 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.150
 new technologies applied to the TEC 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:14.000
 guarantees environmentally safe 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:16.930
 specific generation in 2015 station 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.930
 will be put into operation 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.290
 The first stage of the Yakut GRES-2 is 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.790
 unique modern gas station 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.590
 for permafrost conditions 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.690
 new station will be the heart 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.700
 Central Energy District of the Republic 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.200
 varieties 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.000
 the existing Yakut gres works on 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.099
 extremely worn out equipment and not 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.989
 able to cope with growing on the harp 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.830
 new station is designed to replace 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.510
 outdated capacity to realize this 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.830
 project last year done 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.830
 significant work 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.740
 the launch of the Yakut GRES-2 will give the opportunity 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.480
 expand the centralized zone 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.850
 heating eliminate part 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.770
 low-efficiency boilers significantly 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.040
 improve the environmental situation in 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.040
 Yakutsk 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.370
 implementation of the tex project in the city 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.030
 Soviet harbor and and power will allow 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.860
 to expand 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.550
 Baikal-Amur electrification 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.380
 highways and provide energy 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.260
 developing here a special port 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.670
 economic zone completion 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.320
 construction of the Kuznetsovsky tunnel 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.570
 will lead to a significant increase 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.160
 cargo traffic on bam and will require 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.260
 appropriate heat resources and 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.060
 electricity is therefore ted soviet 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.740
 harbor strategically important region 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.020
 object Today JSC RusHydro and RAO ES 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.820
 East has already completed the necessary 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.430
 preparatory work has already been purchased and 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.700
 80 percent made basic 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.700
 equipment 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.780
 first stage new Sakhalin GRES-2 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.970
 will provide island power grid 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.620
 significant power reserve it will allow 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.780
 boost industry development in 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.580
 Sakhalin Energy System 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.440
 truly unique is the only 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.270
 the country has a large energy hub entirely 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.890
 island rise 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.810
 power supply reliability here 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.690
 key task for the development of everything 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.700
 far east 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.239
 Already selected location Sakhalin 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.850
 GES-2 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.040
 all engineering works are completed on the site 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.360
 surveys 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.050
 fuel in this case will be 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.410
 Sakhalin coals 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.680
 the opening of the new station is scheduled for 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.680
 2016 year 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.410
