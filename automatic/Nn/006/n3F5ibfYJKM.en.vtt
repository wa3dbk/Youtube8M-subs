an important caution okay how do you

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.459 
an important caution okay how do you
measure<00:00:44.340> your<00:00:44.460> tank<00:00:44.789> lid<00:00:44.969> first<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.230> do

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
measure your tank lid first of all do

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.080 
measure your tank lid first of all do
not<00:00:46.620> measure<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> top<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> toilet<00:00:47.700> tank

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
not measure the top of the toilet tank

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.850 
not measure the top of the toilet tank
lid<00:00:48.149> there's<00:00:48.420> too<00:00:48.539> many<00:00:48.660> radiuses<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.559> curves

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
lid there's too many radiuses and curves

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.979 
lid there's too many radiuses and curves
and<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.670> hard<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.969> get<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> definitive<00:00:51.420> point

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
and it's hard to get a definitive point

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.569 
and it's hard to get a definitive point
for<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> consistent<00:00:52.829> time<00:00:53.010> measurement<00:00:53.460> from

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
for a consistent time measurement from

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.610 
for a consistent time measurement from
the<00:00:53.640> top<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.149> lid<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.629> we're<00:00:55.530> gonna

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
the top of the lid so we're gonna

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.110 
the top of the lid so we're gonna
measure<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.980> bottom<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.399> lid<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.850> we're

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
measure the bottom of the lid and we're

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.549 
measure the bottom of the lid and we're
gonna<00:00:57.210> measure<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.660> length<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.410> width

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
gonna measure the length and the width

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.689 
gonna measure the length and the width
so<00:01:00.350> when<00:01:01.350> measuring<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> length<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.460> want<00:01:02.609> to

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
so when measuring the length you want to

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.549 
so when measuring the length you want to
pick<00:01:02.850> again<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> widest<00:01:03.539> point<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.080> lid

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
pick again the widest point so this lid

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.350 
pick again the widest point so this lid
has<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> shape<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.460> smaller<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:06.000> this

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
has a shape to it and smaller at this

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.880 
has a shape to it and smaller at this
area<00:01:06.659> than<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.290> area<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.680> you're<00:01:07.799> gonna

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
area than this area so you're gonna

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.910 
area than this area so you're gonna
measure<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.390> greatest<00:01:09.750> point<00:01:09.960> this

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
measure that that greatest point this

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.560 
measure that that greatest point this
lid<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.640> greatest<00:01:11.939> point<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> be

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
lid the greatest point is going to be

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.670 
lid the greatest point is going to be
one<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.900> tips<00:01:13.140> you're<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.530> measure

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
one of the tips you're going to measure

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.170 
one of the tips you're going to measure
from<00:01:13.830> from<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.580> you're<00:01:14.729> not<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
from from here you're not going to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.240 
from from here you're not going to
measure<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> concave<00:01:16.560> area<00:01:16.920> which<00:01:17.100> is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
measure in the concave area which is

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.700 
measure in the concave area which is
smaller<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.979> lid<00:01:20.310> it'll<00:01:20.729> be<00:01:21.500> 20<00:01:22.500> and

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
smaller so on this lid it'll be 20 and

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.160 
smaller so on this lid it'll be 20 and
1/8<00:01:23.090> long<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:25.100> 8<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.369> 1/8<00:01:26.610> wide<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.960> that's

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
1/8 long and 8 and 1/8 wide so that's

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.660 
1/8 long and 8 and 1/8 wide so that's
how<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.350> measure<00:01:28.590> them<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:28.890> our<00:01:29.009> website<00:01:29.189> when

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
how we measure them on our website when

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.039 
how we measure them on our website when
you<00:01:29.820> see<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> measurements<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.570> our<00:01:30.659> website

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
you see the measurements on our website

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.690 
you see the measurements on our website
that's<00:01:31.229> how<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.530> did<00:01:31.799> them<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.490> measure

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
that's how we did them if you measure

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.490 
that's how we did them if you measure
the<00:01:32.909> same<00:01:33.119> way<00:01:33.299> then<00:01:33.659> when<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.900> compare<00:01:34.079> we're

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the same way then when you compare we're

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.399 
the same way then when you compare we're
gonna<00:01:34.590> get<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> good<00:01:35.070> match<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.610> an<00:01:35.670> accurate

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
gonna get a good match so an accurate

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.359 
gonna get a good match so an accurate
comparison<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.710> could<00:01:38.009> be<00:01:38.130> able<00:01:38.280> to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
comparison so you could be able to

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.730 
comparison so you could be able to
select<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.939> right<00:01:39.479> toilet<00:01:39.900> tank<00:01:40.110> lid<00:01:40.380> for
