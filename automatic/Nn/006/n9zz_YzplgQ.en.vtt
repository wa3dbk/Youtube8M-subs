so I'm primarily getting rid of all the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.760 
so I'm primarily getting rid of all the
calories<00:00:54.350> in<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:56.930> most<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.199> calories<00:00:58.500> in

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
calories in the most of the calories in

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.330 
calories in the most of the calories in
the<00:00:59.070> milk<00:00:59.340> or<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.730> top<00:01:00.289> quart<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the milk or in this top quart of the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.490 
the milk or in this top quart of the
milk<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.539> top<00:01:03.780> point<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
milk it's the top point of the of the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.520 
milk it's the top point of the of the
gallon<00:01:07.500> would<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:09.720> cream<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.320> then<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
gallon would be the cream and then the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.010 
gallon would be the cream and then the
next<00:01:10.890> pint<00:01:11.130> down<00:01:11.369> would<00:01:11.970> be<00:01:12.020> half-and-half

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
next pint down would be half-and-half

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.410 
next pint down would be half-and-half
and<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:15.950> what<00:01:16.950> I'm<00:01:17.040> doing<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.490> getting<00:01:18.180> rid<00:01:18.390> of
