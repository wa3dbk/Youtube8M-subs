00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.880
 by the rings as they are I am sarah and 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.580
 today we are going to talk about something that is 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.280
 asking a lot that is how to make 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.990
 your hair grow faster faster what 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.789
 first I want to clarify is that a 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.430
 It did cost me a lot of work 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.410
 it grew this was a process of many 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.720
 many years but above all a lot 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.880
 patience the hair grows more or less 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.580
 half an inch a month that is roughly 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.349
 Well, here's some things that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.120
 can help hair grow more 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.430
 fast the first thing you have to know 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.809
 is that no matter how much you put your hair and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.300
 more if you impound more than 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.520
 do if your hair is not nourished from 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.739
 inside then it does not make much sense 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.050
 What I recommend you do is take 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.940
 lots of water so that from inside or 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.730
 from the root the hair starts to grow 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.510
 I also recommend something else that I recommend 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.370
 to do is with aloe literally cut what 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.760
 that you see here the penca of those of the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.670
 aloe in half and the stick that comes out 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.230
 This drink is applied to leather 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.270
 scalp that is root 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.620
 and you give yourself a good massage with the yolks of 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.930
 the fingers 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.660
 another remedy also very natural and good 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.540
 are the egg yolks the oil of 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.450
 castor and olive oil you can 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.940
 put more or less 15 minutes of media to 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.700
 long and what you can do is also 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.880
 put a hot towel and wrap it 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.340
 all all all the hair with the towel and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.190
 put this mixture yolk oil 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.110
 of castor and olive oil is great 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.660
 you're going to smell like a little salad a 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.660
 but after you do this 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.950
 wash your hair well with warm water and 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.060
 you're going to see that the results are going to 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.530
 notice more or less in a month 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.910
 approximately 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.310
 this you have to do three of salah 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.440
 weeks and the tips are very dry 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.780
 they are very mistreated if you can not 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.210
 do more or less every 15 days until 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.460
 I have here is a mask there are 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.680
 many brands of masks that help 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.380
 to moisturize hair I recommend you 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.450
 use not just the mask but 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.940
 you do them regularly every time 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.500
 through the hair at least the first 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.080
 two or three months that's when you're 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.450
 looking for it to grow faster this yes 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.620
 It is very important I have repeated them 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.370
 very much to those who write to me in 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.860
 facebook also 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.830
 I say again, do not wash your hair 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.110
 daily please the only thing they do is 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.690
 a vicious circle if you feel your hair 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.390
 super its use and greasy the more it 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.860
 you wash like the scalp says 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.959
 ah I need to produce more fat and 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.120
 then you have it dirty longer and 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.920
 more times I recommend you do it 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.930
 every three days or twice a week 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.209
 to wash them only those times 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.209
 it costs work because if it smells ugly and 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.040
 hair feels dirty it looks ugly but 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.329
 true the hair gets used and in the end 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.370
 and you do not have to wash almost never 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.720
 it really is very very very good there are 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.819
 several tricks for when you have your hair 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.410
 super dirty and you can not wash it or 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.629
 you want to continue this treatment for 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.549
 that grows faster there is the 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.609
 dry shampoo that can basically be 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.440
 or cornstarch or talcum with odor in any 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.430
 super you can find the shampoo in 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.109
 dry they sell it in all 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.060
 presentations with all the smells of 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:08.549
 many brands and they look for you more 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.400
 convince the infallible trick that to me of 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.680
 it really changed my life was this is a 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.540
 cream that has cocoa butter and that 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.569
 is a cream for stretch marks of the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.639
 belly as you hear it I put it on 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.030
 medium to long and I put it once to 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.130
 month 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.840
 and they do not really know the difference 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.540
 I have split ends and I have my hair 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.850
 super super super licit the last 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.220
 recommendation you always have to 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.430
 Protect your hair from the heat if you go to 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.709
 put irons tucker irons whatever 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.959
 you have to protect it the heat the only thing 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.090
 what are you going to do when you do not protect it 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.440
 break it in any beauty house 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.090
 you can find this type of products 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.220
 that basically what they do is cover 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.860
 the hair so that it does not get treated my 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.660
 burn and do not put on anything else that is 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.610
 important is that they never unravel 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.950
 with dry hair, what I do is 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.870
 within the shower just after the 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.750
 medium shower cap with hairs use tape 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.090
 waters but what I do is untangle myself 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.950
 inside the shower because that's what 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.569
 I do not break the hair fiber 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.730
 it's like a lot easier when you 're 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:12.540
 humid now I'm going to tell you what to 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.850
 I never worked out number one the 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.440
 contraceptive pills number two no 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.470
 I know if you have heard about magnets 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.090
 well I paid a fortune and they passed me to 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.889
 smear and attach animals for all 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.210
 sides and it did not help me then if 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.950
 you want to preserve your dignity and your 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.090
 pocket 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.300
 number 3 cut it often and apart 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.650
 do not do it 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.540
