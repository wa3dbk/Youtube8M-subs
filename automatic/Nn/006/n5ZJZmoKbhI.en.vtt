00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.940
 time to return to the origin 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.470
 homeworld remastered with the homeworld 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.570
 collection brings developer gearbox 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.269
 two strategy classics back on 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.369
 Modern pcs are included humboldt 1 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.080
 and 2 in graphically revised form 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.330
 what is missing is the great cataclysm addon 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.929
 its source code over the years 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.929
 got lost 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.670
 the pretty hd graphics with resolutions 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.600
 up to 4k jumps naturally as 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.520
 first in the eye 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.890
 home world is attracted by this 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.900
 timely, especially the lighting effects 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.180
 and space backgrounds make one 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.410
 fine impression who compare himself 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.019
 I want to do that 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.790
 humboldt 12 are the 30 euro expensive 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.750
 Steam download as unmodified 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.750
 original version at 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.180
 the stylish cut-scenes has 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.950
 gearbox redraw the sound based on 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.290
 the uncompressed original shots 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.910
 new mixed class so comes the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.950
 Dense science fiction atmosphere in the 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.640
 style of battlestar galactica still 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.640
 more intense over 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.790
 home world is playful even today 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.830
 one more punch the innovative 3d 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.479
 navigation in the alfeld thanks to thoughtful 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.640
 control easily and he too 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.890
 interesting tactics also who that 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.580
 original never played has fun 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.800
 the many different ones 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.810
 spaceships and the two motivating ones 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.600
 campaigns with a play time of around 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.670
 50 hours for more overview outdoors 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.750
 navigable in everything vice in view 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.520
 the sensor card 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.590
 this is all catchy and 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.340
 in no way acts outdated or how 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.340
 seen before 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.230
 the turning point is all the mission 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.239
 The mother ship here is building her new one 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.459
 hunters or frigates and explored 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.230
 technological progress fleet 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.120
 Account balance and research are from 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.500
 mission to mission, therefore 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.500
 weigh losses twice as hard 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.370
 the change to the humboldt 2 engine 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.709
 Unfortunately humboldt robs some of them 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.540
 peculiarities so will information in the 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.190
 fight generates and behaving 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.940
 Commands work differently than in 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.280
 original 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.500
 hardcore fans should be bothered 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.010
 but it will hardly be negative to everyone else 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.010
 stand out 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.130
 annoying things are already there with peculiarities 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.780
 The costs of rescue are blocked 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.760
 like to tow each other 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.790
 enemy ships therefore is annoying 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.680
 micromanagement inevitably around the 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.510
 own units fire at opposing 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.250
 Heads we just tow and 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.780
 want to incorporate our fleet 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:15.920
 here the employment of the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:17.810
 break function we like it better 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.730
 already that in humboldt 1 all 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.890
 discovered raw material deposits automatically 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:32.150
 be harvested when we are at the end of a 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:34.130
 mission in the hyperspace jump the 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.990
 Missions themselves are great for 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.390
 there are always surprises 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.100
 and varied goals of the high 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.230
 Difficulty calls, however 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.510
 There is no optional light mode 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.160
 for beginners the opponent arise 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.580
 but at least easily adapts to the 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.440
 size of our own fleet to the new 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.210
 slim interface ensures little 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.040
 But the headaches are the 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.140
 symbols sometimes very small 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.090
 the home is being taken over two 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.800
 Changes like the camera freely movable 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.300
 we do not want more beyond that 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.620
 do without 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.720
 rowohlt remastered makes the impression 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.700
 as if it were a brand new game and 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.450
 not the new edition of two well-known 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.450
 Strategy title 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.110
 we also feverishly in the remastered 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.430
 the people cuddling with the on the 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.860
 looking for a new home planet 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.750
 though hardly travel through the galaxy 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.220
 acting figures are introduced and 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.289
 there is only English speech output 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.240
 Nevertheless , the story belongs to the best 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.919
 the genre has to offer that is also 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.840
 often melancholy but always 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.580
 explosive mood of the game the 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:46.460
 the fantastic soundtrack wonderful 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.960
 emphasizes the 16-year-old game principle 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.210
 but is not free of defects 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.250
 especially the extremely slow gameplay 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.990
 put your patience to the test about 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.280
 if collectors eternal with collected 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.320
 resources are on the way 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.599
 a timelapse function like this one 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.599
 video does not offer the remaster namely 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.660
 a few orders are also bad 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.910
 balanced and rely on trial and 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.100
 error mechanics or unfair script 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:24.370
 Events like the arrival in this 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:26.110
 asteroid field next to the 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.210
 singles campaign and a fight 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.260
 There is also a mode against cpu opponents 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.780
 a multiplayer mode 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.070
 but that is still in the beta stadium we 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.900
 put occasional in the test 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.210
 connection breaks and the four 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.180
 fractions from homburg 1 and 2 are still 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.710
 not perfectly balanced for that 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.630
 It addition to the online variant also a 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.100
 lan mode and we can start before game 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.850
 detailed the starting conditions 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.850
 to adjust 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.750
 thanks to the common engine for both 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.090
 games are likely to be numerous in a short time 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.919
 humboldt 2 mod also for the remaster 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.810
 collection appear and go by steam 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.770
 workshop easy into the game 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.770
 integrate 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.699
 rom world like master collection is one 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.370
 strong hd reprint of two 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:27.530
 fantastic strategy games also series 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.039
 Newcomers do well that remaster too 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.479
 to buy 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.009
 more beautiful and exciting 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.639
 Space battles are currently available 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:33.639
 nowhere else 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.360
 but who are still good at the 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.380
 peculiarities of humboldt 1 is remembered 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.180
 some feature like that 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.180
 miss the original formation 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.430
 there are small problems and an in 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.470
 Share outdated game design with long ones 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.930
 waiting times for raw material mining as well 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.699
 a handful of unfair situation at the 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.680
 basic quality of the new edition 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:56.720
 But that does not change that much 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.680
 simply nothing comparable even 16 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.680
 years after the original
