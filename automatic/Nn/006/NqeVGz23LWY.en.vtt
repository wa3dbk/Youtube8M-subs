00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.870
 good afternoon good morning good 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:39.579
 nights thank you very much for giving him play today 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:42.399
 I bring you a mask wow 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.920
 and here that is going to erase the wrinkles 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:48.560
 it's really amazing but the same mother 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.200
 nature gives us all these benefits 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.630
 for the ingredients we will use 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.810
 a papaya to make a quarter 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:01.620
 a yogurt the yogurt that I'm going to use 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:05.160
 is the yogurt break stand that style 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.990
 organic greek almond oil 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.990
 sweets and honey 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.730
 the papaya the delicious tropical fruit 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.670
 has an enzyme called papain this 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:23.650
 enzyme is responsible for giving us the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.560
 source of youth and what else brings 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.870
 a delicious fruit that also has more 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.220
 benefits when we take it when the 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.980
 we consume 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.610
 very well then in this we are going to 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.230
 use the extractor if you do not have 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.050
 extractor you can use the blender 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.410
 Peruvian at a speed that does not go 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.090
 to be very very watery but if you can 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.560
 do or manually but they 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.360
 I would recommend an extractor 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.160
 then we are going to 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.130
 as I told you earlier this 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.760
 anime and this is not given by the mother 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.899
 nature let's add a room 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.690
 of Greek yogurt is a little room nothing more 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.300
 This is going to be a mask for 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.840
 It's time for us to use it 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.840
 they are like 15 2 that already a quarter of papaya 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:28.070
 we are going to add a spoonful 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.140
 of honey that also know the 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.750
 natural properties of honey 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.760
 bee all this is totally natural to 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.730
 preference many times that honey is 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.680
 of those partly in Mexico there is the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.460
 opportunity that there are people that you 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.160
 sold in the natural many times as 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.400
 that is also they gave it to me 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.769
 husband 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.730
 of the clients 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:03:00.150
 and it's totally natural it went up 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.690
 until the farm and forget is totally 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.210
 organic 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:09.270
 This brought him on his journey left as 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.270
 two very rich and we are going to throw some 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.940
 but always preferred to me 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.580
 like to buy it as easy as it is 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.730
 Most natural possible is much better 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.200
 I'm going to add 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:29.880
 also two teaspoons of oil 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:34.290
 almond if you have oily skin 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:38.180
 I recommend one I'm going to add 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.180
 like two here I'm going to eat it 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.790
 with a spoonful of almond oil 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.510
 let's add let's grind and right now 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.019
 he came back 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:56.819
 we will be this consistency if you 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:04:00.420
 they fix I 'm not going to apply it for 10's 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:06.000
 10 to 20 minutes 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:08.110
 and you have rinsed it dry and it's going to 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.260
 know the difference 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.480
 the papaya there are people who call it up 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.650
 the fountain of youth for our 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.139
 skin 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.840
 as I explained to them the enzyme 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.600
 what it does in a soft way is going to 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.300
 remove the layers of the cells that 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.759
 they're going to be dead and try to 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.870
 soften the lines of expression in the 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.510
 skin 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.510
 nature gave us this fruit and 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.400
 it has all these benefits 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.550
 as it has others more than to go down 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.180
 weight for constipation problems 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.180
 for problems 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.980
 with our intestines is very good 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.260
 fruit I recommend you should always 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.900
 consult your doctor before there are people 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.900
 that we can be allergic to certain 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.820
 food and then I'm going to try it and 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.280
 how do they tell me if they liked it 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.310
