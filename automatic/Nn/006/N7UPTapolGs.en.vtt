here<00:00:01.500> is<00:00:01.620> part<00:00:01.860> 2<00:00:02.100> of<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.429> reflector<00:00:03.179> LED<00:00:03.480> mod

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
here is part 2 of the reflector LED mod

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.809 
here is part 2 of the reflector LED mod
for<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:03.990> 9<00:00:04.140> shine<00:00:04.350> on<00:00:04.529> our<00:00:04.560> cord<00:00:05.040> in<00:00:05.279> this

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
for the 9 shine on our cord in this

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.190 
for the 9 shine on our cord in this
video<00:00:06.089> I'm<00:00:06.180> going<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.359> talk<00:00:06.509> about<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.870> LED

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
video I'm going to talk about the LED

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.330 
video I'm going to talk about the LED
strip<00:00:07.470> that<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.680> use<00:00:07.950> for<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.429> particular<00:00:08.820> mod

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
strip that I use for this particular mod

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.110 
strip that I use for this particular mod
here<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.679> 5730<00:00:13.679> chip<00:00:14.040> led<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
here it is it is the 5730 chip led the

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.320 
here it is it is the 5730 chip led the
reason<00:00:15.450> why<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.630> chose<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.619> LED<00:00:17.190> over<00:00:18.029> the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
reason why I chose this LED over the

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.679 
reason why I chose this LED over the
50-50<00:00:18.930> chip<00:00:19.109> led<00:00:19.320> which<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> bigger

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
50-50 chip led which is the bigger

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.670 
50-50 chip led which is the bigger
square<00:00:22.100> size<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:24.060> because<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:25.019> brighter

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
square size is because this is brighter

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.439 
square size is because this is brighter
compared<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.550> one<00:00:26.789> also<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.269> want<00:00:27.420> to

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
compared to this one also you want to

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.880 
compared to this one also you want to
make<00:00:27.570> sure<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.930> get<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> non

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
make sure that you get the non

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.919 
make sure that you get the non
waterproof<00:00:29.220> one<00:00:29.760> if<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> waterproof

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
waterproof one if you get the waterproof

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.540 
waterproof one if you get the waterproof
one<00:00:30.960> it'll<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> silicone<00:00:32.099> coating<00:00:32.430> on

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
one it'll have the silicone coating on

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.270 
one it'll have the silicone coating on
top<00:00:32.940> right<00:00:33.180> here<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:34.410> won't<00:00:34.710> slide<00:00:34.980> into

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
top right here and it won't slide into

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.189 
you want to make sure that's that way to
put<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.239> top<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.660> negative<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
put it on top and negative is in the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.370 
put it on top and negative is in the
bottom<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.760> opposite<00:01:06.390> end<00:01:06.630> we're

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
bottom and on the opposite end we're

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.429 
bottom and on the opposite end we're
gonna<00:01:07.530> count<00:01:07.770> 1<00:01:08.159> 2<00:01:08.490> 3<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.900> see<00:01:10.229> where

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
gonna count 1 2 3 and you see where

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.010 
gonna count 1 2 3 and you see where
right<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:11.240> right<00:01:12.240> where<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> copper

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
right here is right where the copper

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.999 
right here is right where the copper
starts<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.650> want<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.920> bend<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:15.530> like<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
starts you want to bend it like so and

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.249 
starts you want to bend it like so and
peel<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.400> back<00:01:23.600> remove<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.750> Telos<00:01:24.990> sided

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259

tape

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.480 

and<00:01:28.850> where<00:01:29.300> you<00:01:29.420> made<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.250> indentation<00:01:31.250> pad

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
and where you made the indentation pad

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.810 
and where you made the indentation pad
we're<00:01:31.940> just<00:01:32.090> gonna<00:01:33.190> fold<00:01:34.190> it<00:01:34.340> in<00:01:34.460> like<00:01:34.490> this

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
we're just gonna fold it in like this

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.320 
we're just gonna fold it in like this
and<00:01:35.680> cook<00:01:36.680> this<00:01:36.860> enough<00:01:39.220> like<00:01:40.220> that<00:01:40.400> I'm<00:01:41.180> gonna

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
and cook this enough like that I'm gonna

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.220 
and cook this enough like that I'm gonna
count<00:01:41.570> seven<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:44.480> see<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:44.780> resistor

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
count seven and you see the resistor

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.560 
count seven and you see the resistor
between<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:46.100> resistor<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.730> the<00:01:46.940> LED<00:01:47.330> we

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
between the resistor and the LED we

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.170 
between the resistor and the LED we
gotta<00:01:47.780> make<00:01:47.990> a<00:01:48.020> fold<00:01:48.380> but<00:01:49.070> we're<00:01:49.280> not<00:01:49.520> folding

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
gotta make a fold but we're not folding

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.070 
gotta make a fold but we're not folding
all<00:01:50.330> the<00:01:50.480> way<00:01:50.570> we're<00:01:50.720> just<00:01:50.900> bending<00:01:51.110> it<00:01:53.080> for

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
all the way we're just bending it for

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.360 
all the way we're just bending it for
now<00:01:54.230> okay

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
now okay

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.340 
now okay
I<00:01:55.400> just<00:01:56.060> made<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.360> little<00:01:56.870> crease<00:01:57.110> right<00:01:57.290> here

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
I just made a little crease right here

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.670 
I just made a little crease right here
I'm<00:01:58.250> gonna<00:01:58.430> take<00:01:58.640> this<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.330> the<00:02:00.200> side<00:02:00.410> that<00:02:00.560> we

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
I'm gonna take this and the side that we

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.120 
I'm gonna take this and the side that we
fold<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.070> completely<00:02:01.190> we're<00:02:02.000> gonna<00:02:03.100> place<00:02:04.100> it

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
fold it completely we're gonna place it

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.640 
fold it completely we're gonna place it
on<00:02:04.370> the<00:02:04.610> skin<00:02:05.420> your<00:02:05.600> side<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:06.170> is<00:02:06.229> where

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
on the skin your side so this is where

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.020 
on the skin your side so this is where
the<00:02:06.770> sticker<00:02:07.130> is<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:08.000> gets<00:02:08.179> longer

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
the sticker is and it gets longer

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.790 
the sticker is and it gets longer
sitting<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:12.260> wiggle<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.900> make<00:02:15.170> sure<00:02:15.200> you

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
sitting and wiggle it and make sure you

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.070 
sitting and wiggle it and make sure you
can<00:02:15.980> see<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.880> see<00:02:17.150> where<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.690> is<00:02:17.750> just

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
can see it so you see where it is just

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.240 
can see it so you see where it is just
touching<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.470> top<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:19.010> here<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:21.070> once<00:02:22.070> that's

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
touching the top of here and once that's

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.870 
touching the top of here and once that's
done<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:24.650> know<00:02:24.770> where<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.130> just<00:02:25.400> made

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
done and you know where you just made

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.750 
done and you know where you just made
the<00:02:26.030> slightly<00:02:26.300> bent<00:02:26.750> I'm<00:02:27.560> gonna<00:02:27.740> put<00:02:28.010> this<00:02:28.250> and

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
the slightly bent I'm gonna put this and

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.630 
the slightly bent I'm gonna put this and
put<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.120> in<00:02:29.240> here<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:32.980> we're<00:02:33.980> getting<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.400> one

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
put it in here so we're getting to one

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.680 
put it in here so we're getting to one
side<00:02:35.560> I'm<00:02:36.560> just<00:02:36.709> gonna<00:02:36.910> scoot<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.090> thing<00:02:38.420> to

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
side I'm just gonna scoot this thing to

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.259 
side I'm just gonna scoot this thing to
one<00:02:38.870> side<00:02:39.170> like<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:42.610> because<00:02:43.610> we're<00:02:43.910> gonna<00:02:44.060> add

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
one side like so because we're gonna add

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.540 
one side like so because we're gonna add
another<00:02:44.510> LED<00:02:45.380> strip<00:02:45.769> in<00:02:45.950> here<00:02:46.360> another<00:02:48.550> LED

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
another LED strip in here another LED

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.350 
another LED strip in here another LED
strip<00:02:49.970> cut<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.630> exactly<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.230> same<00:02:52.150> fold<00:02:53.150> it

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
strip cut it exactly the same fold it

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.720 
strip cut it exactly the same fold it
like<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:54.019> did<00:02:54.290> here<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:54.830> then<00:02:55.280> then

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
like so I did here and then then

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.710 
like so I did here and then then
slightly<00:02:56.440> here<00:02:57.700> between<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.850> seven<00:02:59.300> we<00:02:59.480> just

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
slightly here between the seven we just

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.570 
slightly here between the seven we just
ER<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.650> LED<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.950> side<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.400> you

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
ER and the LED and the side that you

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.270 
ER and the LED and the side that you
double-sided<00:03:05.350> just<00:03:06.350> fighting<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.860> smaller

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
double-sided just fighting the smaller

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.590 
double-sided just fighting the smaller
side<00:03:09.670> okay<00:03:10.670> here<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:10.910> is<00:03:11.000> bottom<00:03:11.450> are

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
side okay here it is bottom are

and four wires you know if you don't
have<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:20.720> soldering<00:03:21.080> gun<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:22.250> can<00:03:22.489> purchase

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
have a soldering gun you can purchase

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.259 
have a soldering gun you can purchase
this<00:03:24.459> it's<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.930> LED<00:03:26.930> strip<00:03:27.170> adapter<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:29.120> will

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
this it's a LED strip adapter it will

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.300 
this it's a LED strip adapter it will
connect<00:03:29.750> your<00:03:30.019> positive<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.709> negative<00:03:30.769> into

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
connect your positive and negative into

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.420 
connect your positive and negative into
this<00:03:31.430> little<00:03:31.850> connector<00:03:32.510> type<00:03:33.290> now<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.100> just

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
this little connector type now you just

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.730 
this little connector type now you just
don't<00:03:34.640> place<00:03:34.880> this<00:03:35.180> like<00:03:35.600> this<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.200> you<00:03:36.319> clamp

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
don't place this like this and you clamp

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.309 
don't place this like this and you clamp
it<00:03:36.860> down<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:37.310> actually<00:03:37.670> slide<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:38.209> in<00:03:38.390> so<00:03:38.630> dope

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
it down you actually slide it in so dope

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.699 
it down you actually slide it in so dope
you<00:03:39.500> like<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.800> slot<00:03:40.190> in<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.490> bottom

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
you like the slot in the bottom

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.840 
you like the slot in the bottom
because<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:42.860> can<00:03:43.010> see<00:03:43.130> there's<00:03:43.370> a<00:03:43.459> slot<00:03:43.670> right

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
because you can see there's a slot right

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.430 
because you can see there's a slot right
there<00:03:43.910> so<00:03:44.450> you<00:03:44.510> slide<00:03:45.050> this<00:03:45.410> side<00:03:45.860> in<00:03:47.140> like<00:03:48.140> so

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
there so you slide this side in like so

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.690 
there so you slide this side in like so
so<00:03:48.709> then<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.550> LED<00:03:49.850> strip<00:03:50.180> goes<00:03:51.040> below<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.490> two

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
so then the LED strip goes below the two

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.820 
so then the LED strip goes below the two
metal<00:03:53.060> tab<00:03:53.300> and<00:03:53.600> you<00:03:54.080> just<00:03:54.200> close<00:03:54.440> this<00:03:54.590> stuff

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
metal tab and you just close this stuff

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.500 
metal tab and you just close this stuff
and<00:03:55.400> I'll<00:03:55.520> quickly<00:03:55.670> touch<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.150> make<00:03:56.270> sure<00:03:56.390> the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
and I'll quickly touch to make sure the

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.300 
and I'll quickly touch to make sure the
LEDs<00:03:56.840> work<00:03:57.050> before<00:03:57.350> I<00:03:57.410> go<00:03:57.560> ahead<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:58.010> seal

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
LEDs work before I go ahead and seal

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.340 
LEDs work before I go ahead and seal
everything<00:03:58.730> up<00:03:59.030> go<00:03:59.569> ahead<00:03:59.750> and<00:03:59.930> test<00:04:00.110> both

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
everything up go ahead and test both

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.740 
everything up go ahead and test both
sides<00:04:00.709> to<00:04:01.069> make<00:04:01.220> sure<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.489> they<00:04:01.640> work<00:04:01.880> and

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
sides to make sure that they work and

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.150 
sides to make sure that they work and
they<00:04:02.870> do<00:04:03.550> you<00:04:04.550> can<00:04:04.819> see<00:04:05.030> they<00:04:05.750> work<00:04:06.020> now<00:04:06.860> I'm

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
they do you can see they work now I'm

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.680 
they do you can see they work now I'm
gonna<00:04:07.250> put<00:04:07.520> exactly<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.090> same<00:04:08.239> one<00:04:08.390> on<00:04:08.420> this

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
gonna put exactly the same one on this

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.710 
gonna put exactly the same one on this
side<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.170> then<00:04:09.560> I'm<00:04:09.739> gonna<00:04:10.000> bend<00:04:11.000> this<00:04:11.180> here

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
side and then I'm gonna bend this here

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.160 
side and then I'm gonna bend this here
and<00:04:11.900> then<00:04:12.260> leave<00:04:12.620> one<00:04:12.830> up<00:04:12.980> here<00:04:13.840> and<00:04:14.840> I'm<00:04:15.050> gonna

whatever<00:04:18.350> you<00:04:18.500> have<00:04:18.709> that<00:04:19.579> you<00:04:19.700> think<00:04:19.910> will

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
whatever you have that you think will

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.129 
whatever you have that you think will
work

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.770 

okay<00:04:25.139> here<00:04:25.530> you<00:04:25.560> go<00:04:26.460> I<00:04:26.490> have<00:04:26.969> soldered<00:04:27.479> the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
okay here you go I have soldered the

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.529 
okay here you go I have soldered the
leads<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.379> the<00:04:28.740> LED<00:04:29.310> strips<00:04:29.639> for<00:04:30.120> wires

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.369 

cutting<00:04:33.539> it<00:04:34.050> right<00:04:34.319> here<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:34.919> I'm<00:04:35.580> going<00:04:35.849> to

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:36.379 
cutting it right here and I'm going to

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.529 
cutting it right here and I'm going to
solder<00:04:37.379> and<00:04:37.740> string<00:04:38.069> to<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:39.090> connection

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
solder and string to the connection

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.089 
solder and string to the connection
right<00:04:39.689> here<00:04:39.960> so<00:04:40.169> there's<00:04:40.319> only<00:04:40.529> two<00:04:40.830> wires

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
right here so there's only two wires

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.719
