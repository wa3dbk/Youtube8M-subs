00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
so much easier for you to mix let's

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.000 
so much easier for you to mix let's
start<00:00:59.699> blending<00:00:59.940> all<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.539> together<00:01:01.010> you're

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
start blending all this together you're

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.460 
start blending all this together you're
gonna<00:01:02.160> form<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> dough<00:01:03.000> mixture<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
gonna form like a dough mixture but the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.690 
gonna form like a dough mixture but the
cream<00:01:04.739> cheese<00:01:04.769> might<00:01:05.189> be<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> little<00:01:05.519> hard<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
cream cheese might be a little hard to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.280 
cream cheese might be a little hard to
break<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.180> there<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.600> keep<00:01:06.810> mixing<00:01:07.049> until

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
break in there so just keep mixing until

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.560 
break in there so just keep mixing until
you<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> nice<00:01:07.830> solid<00:01:08.070> mixture<00:01:08.430> now<00:01:09.390> that

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
you have a nice solid mixture now that

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.030 
you have a nice solid mixture now that
this<00:01:09.659> has<00:01:09.810> come<00:01:10.020> together<00:01:10.170> into<00:01:10.650> more<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.920> like

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
this has come together into more of like

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.740 
this has come together into more of like
a<00:01:11.070> dough<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.909> want<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> make<00:01:12.299> sure<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.689> a

a dough you want to make sure you have a
skillet<00:01:13.140> that's<00:01:13.380> set<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.770> probably<00:01:14.220> about<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
skillet that's set on probably about a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.670 
skillet that's set on probably about a
medium-high<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.869> get<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> nice<00:01:16.140> brown<00:01:16.380> color

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.160 
we're gonna take out the dough in 1/3
pieces<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.759> using<00:01:21.119> our<00:01:21.210> hands<00:01:21.479> actually<00:01:21.720> form

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
pieces and using our hands actually form

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.200 
pieces and using our hands actually form
it<00:01:22.259> into<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.530> stick<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.610> want<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.000> even

prevent it from sticking too bad so

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.340 
prevent it from sticking too bad so
that's<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> shape<00:01:29.130> we're<00:01:29.280> looking<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:30.350> do

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
that's the shape we're looking for do

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.620 
that's the shape we're looking for do
three<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.950> these<00:01:32.100> again<00:01:32.970> shape<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.390> into<00:01:33.509> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
three of these again shape it into a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.800 
three of these again shape it into a
stick

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810
