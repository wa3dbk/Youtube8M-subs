00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.209 
about them we just don't know what it is
yet<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.640> could<00:00:50.969> see<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:52.530> swirlix<00:00:52.980> just

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
yet so as you could see the swirlix just

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.200 
yet so as you could see the swirlix just
looks<00:00:53.399> like<00:00:53.610> cotton<00:00:54.600> candy<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:55.260> feet<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.830 
looks like cotton candy with feet and
spritzee<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.449> looks<00:00:57.719> like<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.350> big<00:00:58.680> hairy

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.500 
spritzee just looks like a big hairy
thing<00:01:00.840> bird<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:02.969> much<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.239> say<00:01:03.390> about

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
thing bird so it's not much to say about

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.060 
thing bird so it's not much to say about
these<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:04.110> course<00:01:04.350> they<00:01:04.530> weren't<00:01:04.680> confirmed

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.390 
these of course they weren't confirmed
yet<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.700> pretty<00:01:06.439> pretty<00:01:07.439> likely<00:01:07.979> that

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400

along with that fletchling has a middle
evolution<00:03:41.530> so<00:03:41.980> instead<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.489> just<00:03:42.610> going<00:03:42.730> from

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
evolution so instead of just going from

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.940 
evolution so instead of just going from
fletchling<00:03:43.420> to<00:03:43.570> talonflame<00:03:43.930> which<00:03:44.410> I<00:03:44.590> kind<00:03:44.920> of

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
fletchling to talonflame which I kind of

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.060 
fletchling to talonflame which I kind of
expected<00:03:45.489> you<00:03:45.730> don't<00:03:45.910> see<00:03:46.150> something<00:03:47.070> that's

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
expected you don't see something that's

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.370 
expected you don't see something that's
like<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.220> tiny<00:03:48.459> bird<00:03:48.790> evolving<00:03:49.330> to<00:03:49.450> like<00:03:49.600> a<00:03:49.630> big

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
like a tiny bird evolving to like a big

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.949 
like a tiny bird evolving to like a big
hawk<00:03:51.070> looking<00:03:51.549> thing<00:03:51.850> so<00:03:52.360> there<00:03:52.660> will<00:03:52.810> be<00:03:52.840> a

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
hawk looking thing so there will be a

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.150 
hawk looking thing so there will be a
middle<00:03:53.350> evolution<00:03:54.190> too<00:03:54.640> fletchling<00:03:55.299> and

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
middle evolution too fletchling and

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.380 
middle evolution too fletchling and
talonflame<00:03:58.350> it's<00:03:59.350> I<00:04:00.100> think<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.940> name<00:04:01.150> that

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
talonflame it's I think the name that

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.840 
talonflame it's I think the name that
they're<00:04:01.540> calling<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.019> is<00:04:02.140> fletchling

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
they're calling it is fletchling

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.180 
they're calling it is fletchling
fletchinder<00:04:03.850> fletchinder<00:04:04.269> I<00:04:04.930> don't<00:04:05.830> ask<00:04:06.010> me

share it with you guys another thing is

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.770 
share it with you guys another thing is
that<00:04:39.690> vivillon<00:04:40.410> has<00:04:40.950> multiple<00:04:41.610> patterns<00:04:41.850> one

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
that vivillon has multiple patterns one

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.990 
that vivillon has multiple patterns one
of<00:04:42.930> which<00:04:43.140> is<00:04:43.170> dark<00:04:43.830> in<00:04:44.040> color<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:44.850> is

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
of which is dark in color and it is

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.830 
of which is dark in color and it is
called<00:04:45.510> a<00:04:45.930> polar<00:04:46.740> pattern<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:48.000> this<00:04:48.630> could

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
called a polar pattern so this could

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.060 
called a polar pattern so this could
just<00:04:49.080> be<00:04:49.230> like<00:04:50.420> i'm<00:04:51.420> guessing<00:04:52.050> it's<00:04:52.830> gonna<00:04:52.950> be

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
just be like i'm guessing it's gonna be

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.720 
just be like i'm guessing it's gonna be
a<00:04:53.100> lot<00:04:53.280> like<00:04:53.460> warm<00:04:53.730> a<00:04:53.850> damn<00:04:54.290> like<00:04:55.290> and<00:04:55.550> burn<00:04:56.550> me

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
a lot like warm a damn like and burn me

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.870 
a lot like warm a damn like and burn me
like<00:04:56.910> depending<00:04:57.420> on<00:04:57.630> where<00:04:57.990> you<00:04:58.260> get<00:04:58.650> it<00:04:58.880> it's

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
like depending on where you get it it's

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.320 
like depending on where you get it it's
going<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.510> be<00:05:00.780> different<00:05:01.680> color<00:05:02.070> but<00:05:02.880> i<00:05:02.910> really

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
going to be different color but i really

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.970 
going to be different color but i really
don't<00:05:03.570> think<00:05:03.690> that<00:05:04.140> they're<00:05:04.680> gonna<00:05:04.800> have

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
don't think that they're gonna have

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.740 
don't think that they're gonna have
different<00:05:05.310> typing<00:05:05.760> with<00:05:05.940> vivillon<00:05:06.240> it<00:05:06.600> could

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
different typing with vivillon it could

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.740 
different typing with vivillon it could
be<00:05:06.900> wrong<00:05:07.140> but<00:05:07.610> that's<00:05:08.610> just<00:05:08.910> what<00:05:09.120> I<00:05:09.150> think<00:05:09.570> so

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
be wrong but that's just what I think so

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.000 
be wrong but that's just what I think so
that<00:05:09.930> is<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.170> end<00:05:10.290> of<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.410> video<00:05:10.530> guys<00:05:10.770> if<00:05:10.800> you

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
that is the end of the video guys if you

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.460 
that is the end of the video guys if you
guys<00:05:11.070> enjoyed<00:05:11.550> please<00:05:11.940> like<00:05:12.300> comment<00:05:12.840> I<00:05:13.200> am
