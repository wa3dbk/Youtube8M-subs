00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.790
 as I said in our case not much 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.650
 work works that now we were 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.210
 back to the job because I have 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.480
 Forgotten we have to overload 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.210
 his 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.060
 there is a buck that has something 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.490

 Radien pharma pattern will drive larger 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.820
 you also pay attention 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.520
 do you want to go out here we drive 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.540
 times to the shop I need a trailer 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.970
 I completely forgot that 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.530
 it is not always so to prepare 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.870
 bad 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.610
 you can see it bends slightly to the right 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.770
 the trailer that's just that 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.310
 even with small combine harvester nice 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.690
 come down 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.580
 and most of the time always on the left 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.790
 side then higher if you are right 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.290
 it is already my wife yes 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.180
 not going down vertically but 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.990
 always a little on the left side 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.640
 That's why everyone is taller than me 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.209
 Thank you very soon 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.709
 look here 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:24.459
 Here's the value Marc Marquez says 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.020
 I just do not care but fit 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.910
 complicated 25,000 liters of personal 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.470
 maintenance costs of overcharged 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:37.459
 confused whole pack tractor 200 ps 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.050
 or more like that , 79,000 york 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.239
 have my money left oh yes I wanted 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:46.270
 still buy a trailer to test 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.270
 if you can really over load 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:58.489
 bigger from the other side i was hoping 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.959
 that with these chain wheels here calls 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.690
 you actually chain drive now 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:06.110
 know wheels I do not know now so 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.850
 well then we do that with me I want that 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.560
 now not completely conscious because 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.940
 I also want it if he loads so off 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.940
 it did not completely fail 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.260
 also seems to work 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:23.090
 Now it's overloaded 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.880
 We b and he took that nicely done 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.300
 and fold in again and get ready 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.300
 the whole affair 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:37.360
 Well then it was the idea 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:42.440
 we have again attracted the lok says 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:45.100
 a little mistake here particles 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.970
 system had a small error 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.760
 no idea there can not be anything 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.460
 loading does not seem so bad too 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.530
 because there are only two small mistakes 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.300
 otherwise works without errors too much 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.979
 Well, I'm glad about that 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.919
 ladewagen da was perfectly nice 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.600
 I like it so much fun 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.400

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.590
