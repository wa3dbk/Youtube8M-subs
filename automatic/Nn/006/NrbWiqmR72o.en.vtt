00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.620 
bad for point 795 like I said we barely
moved<00:06:09.100> there<00:06:09.310> so<00:06:09.520> next<00:06:10.120> up<00:06:10.360> we're<00:06:10.480> gonna<00:06:10.540> have

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
moved there so next up we're gonna have

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.120 
moved there so next up we're gonna have
searching<00:06:11.020> destroy<00:06:11.290> flew<00:06:11.530> can<00:06:11.710> have<00:06:11.800> a<00:06:11.860> little

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
searching destroy flew can have a little

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.890 
searching destroy flew can have a little
bit<00:06:12.250> better<00:06:12.430> outing<00:06:12.790> in<00:06:12.880> that<00:06:13.060> and<00:06:13.420> then<00:06:13.780> we

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
bit better outing in that and then we

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.260 
bit better outing in that and then we
got<00:06:14.020> infected<00:06:14.380> which<00:06:14.710> should<00:06:15.040> hopefully<00:06:15.550> in

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
got infected which should hopefully in

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.390 
got infected which should hopefully in
theory<00:06:16.750> be<00:06:17.320> pretty<00:06:17.590> good<00:06:17.710> for<00:06:17.920> the<00:06:17.980> Katy<00:06:18.190> and

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
theory be pretty good for the Katy and

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.890 
theory be pretty good for the Katy and
then<00:06:18.550> Kill<00:06:18.760> Confirmed<00:06:18.790> in<00:06:19.270> domination<00:06:19.660> we're

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
then Kill Confirmed in domination we're

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.710 
then Kill Confirmed in domination we're
gonna<00:06:20.020> destroy<00:06:20.470> in<00:06:20.620> those<00:06:20.800> no<00:06:21.070> question<00:06:21.460> guys

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720
