00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.019
 the honda of the city car chaire 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.220
 really important because it's on 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:19.710
 the catch market as early as 2008 juke 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.910
 know this is what is sold in France 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.190
 and honda suffers in France today 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.640
 the civic has not exactly marketed like 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.640
 ball guy 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.120
 even if it's the very good product 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.860
 the world agrees to say it 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.390
 jazz is a little old life so he 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.010
 they needed this model there I think that 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.010
 you trade waiting for him 2 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.350
 I will do at 1 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.170
 a first impression in this 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.550
 atmosphere I do not care 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.429
 it keeps detoxification is the 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.219
 first time I see the usual 18 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.820
 it's Christ and tennis is 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.950
 no worse and 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.240
 the ground 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.680
 why the crime is not lit 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.900
 brepols put the ignition is what 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.300
 it is digital but why ice 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.700
 is on and why there's not going 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:14.399
 I would not be very close to 17 hours 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.710
 launched it's funny because they 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.860
 are in the running have all given the right for 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.150
 we do 3d trapezoidal grille 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.920
 at 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.850
 it will be the marker of the poor 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.850
 in ten years we would say 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.060
 m 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.270
 I have a hard time getting my opinion in blue 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.530
 like that I can not do very well 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.170
 I can not do very well to you 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.450
 account of the correctness of the proposal 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.700
 queen of the living rooms silence quite funny 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.479
 tried the specialties honda did you 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.820
 can it be here it is 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.869
 very good dassa know but that you can 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.190
 put to mock pact he waits so 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.310
 that's all why its part frankly 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.740
 willing and then that's this Norman will then 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.710
 equipped with pains 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.520
 the hall is a cardboard thing that's 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.520
 that 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.690
 Have you noticed that it is often 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.280
 that they are and among china in 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.130
 all the salons but there is a number of 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.630
 Chinese not possible 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.069
 there is a number of Chinese not possible 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.079
 that carved car it's funny 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.599
 see these is funny because 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.549
 look at the honda and I was struggling to 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.180
 to kill bitterly I had trouble 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.450
 apprehend 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.720
 and there you have version cx 3 at 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.760
 mazda 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.510
 I find 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.640
 maybe because she's better 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.240
 enlightened because colors are more 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.900
 there repro 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.610
 but I find 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.079
 very successful as a complement face in 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.079
 these proportions in his stadium 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.630
 by ccn to raise the mouth but 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.360
 much more than the purchases it's 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.450
 terrible a lot more than the honda yielded 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.160
 17,49 so yeah yeah yeah but the 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.600
 table these cars that get tired is 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.600
 the huge pressure of happy cars 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.180
 aggressive and that it did not close very pretty 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.709
 to the whey be it's very successful this 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.810
 that we said in normal this is really 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.360
 finding his ground affirms 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.580
 anne because there but it's all going 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.470
 coherent 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.120
 two three six look frankly she 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.290
 is pretty finish that did not have the 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.740
 choice of my looks in versions 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.870
 high 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.069
 it's nice either angina al-fassi is 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.269
 unite 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:27.370
 you have a little more text 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.859
 to say a well then like that was done 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.510
 on the basis of the two killed for having it 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.409
 conduct appreciate what I told you 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.409
 I'm sure it's going to be a 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.380
 even very good 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.370
 my equal to 28 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.370
 but not enough for 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.900
 the same calendars thank you audi we all 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.900
 the 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.870
 yes no but I say it's yahia a 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.849
 international when 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.849
 jain adherents yeah dudu 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.159
 and still codes there that all the 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.260
 world starts again but you know it's 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.450
 interesting because when I spoke 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.909
 with the guy from finity thursday mesloub 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.500
 had a French Japanese influence 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.849
 Normally we are international 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.530
 we went to our homes 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.489
 Cuban designers of the windows of 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.590
 their French internationals 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.820
 all they say that but actually 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.440
 now all design centers 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.930
 it's the same ones that go from one brand 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.720
 halo and that they are trained to the same 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.580
 rtnb school form meriem is and we see 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.710
 well I find it interesting if we 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.320
 Treats a first assessment 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.790
 there is a level precisely in the design 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.449
 since we did not approach the technique 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.469
 have gone around 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:41.289
 son there really are codes in the 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:44.349
 preciousness from one side at a time to 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.020
 solid and luxurious purchase prices 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:49.860
 that we find everywhere 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.860
 so it's really 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.080
 this is striking
