00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.200
 just a couple of years ago the company 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.889
 nintendo has identified a new path 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.840
 development 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.910
 these were console games aimed at 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.619
 improving the health of playing video games 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.750
 similar ideas slipped from them and 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.699
 earlier take the same refid or never 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.410
 successful vitality sensor however 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.300
 analysts have noticed that 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.130
 all the time since the announcement of the new stage 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.390
 the development of the company of some movements in 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.519
 this direction has not followed 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.949
 nintendo since its inception 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.780
 illness satoru ivata began to grow dim 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.700
 and less appear in tabloids 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.410
 talk about them do not want to raise even 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.000
 gamers console that should have been 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.379
 deal with the health of gamers by 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.660
 the last reassurance was to 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.059
 appear in the second quarter of 2016 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.160
 however, these same assurances we heard 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.170
 just two years ago after a while 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.780
 peace and quiet and it is absolutely not 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.680
 surprisingly in our age a mass audience 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.930
 interested in beautiful triple 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.829
 and eSports and mobile projects 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.390
 offshoot market 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.129
 than by the way speaking and going 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.960
 do nintendo according to michael 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.969
 factor and light bar securities company 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.710
 now focused all his strength on 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.570
 what to keep afloat and not engage 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.430
 rather controversial projects therefore 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.170
 words and dora rather forcing the topic 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.700
 mobile gaming from the mouth of many 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.080
 top managers from nintendo can 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.189
 interpreted as true 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.229
 direction of their development 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.150
 good or bad on the one hand 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.560
 good companies with such a story should 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.630
 stay on the market because they can 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.340
 present a lot of interesting things and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.140
 futuristic how your time was with 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.479
 console nintendo fault or and ends 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.950
 which in their own times were very 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.780
 attractive products other 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.280
 hand it's bad because it means that 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.350
 at the moment they have to water 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.890
 to all your ideas and go for an opinion 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.509
 most 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.820
 and in the end we can only get 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.920
 another company doing the same 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.820
 as all the others however time will show to 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.560
 what will it all lead 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.270
 and what do you think about nintendo? 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.340
 they still somehow surprise and attract yourself 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.650
 gamers or most likely companies are waiting 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.380
 by him 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.480
