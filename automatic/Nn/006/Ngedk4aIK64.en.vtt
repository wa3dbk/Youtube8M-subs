00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
the pieces now what's quite important is

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.600 
the pieces now what's quite important is
to<00:01:45.390> make<00:01:45.570> sure<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:46.170> their<00:01:46.860> heat<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.340> evenly

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
to make sure that their heat is evenly

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.240 
to make sure that their heat is evenly
spread<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> very<00:01:49.350> high<00:01:49.680> heat<00:01:50.009> and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
spread and it's not a very high heat and

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.539 
spread and it's not a very high heat and
that's<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:50.670> gives<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:52.140> texture<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.009> seals

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
that's what gives the texture and seals

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.480 
that's what gives the texture and seals
the<00:01:53.700> flavor<00:01:54.119> for<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.020> chickens<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.680> that's

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the flavor for the chickens and that's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.370 
the flavor for the chickens and that's
really<00:01:56.790> really<00:01:57.270> important<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> keep<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
really really important to keep it on a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.310
