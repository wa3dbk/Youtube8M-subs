should point out now that initially your

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:28.769 
should point out now that initially your
background<00:00:28.000> is<00:00:28.119> in<00:00:28.239> civil<00:00:28.630> engineering

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
background is in civil engineering

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.050 
background is in civil engineering
underneath<00:00:29.590> that's<00:00:29.950> right<00:00:30.130> actually<00:00:30.369> am<00:00:30.759> but

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
underneath that's right actually am but

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.819 
underneath that's right actually am but
it<00:00:31.509> didn't<00:00:31.750> really<00:00:31.810> work<00:00:32.050> out<00:00:32.140> for<00:00:32.349> me<00:00:32.380> because

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
it didn't really work out for me because

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.280 
it didn't really work out for me because
well<00:00:33.610> one<00:00:34.329> of<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.480> problems<00:00:34.780> I<00:00:34.840> had<00:00:35.050> was<00:00:35.230> that

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
well one of the problems I had was that

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.020 
well one of the problems I had was that
when<00:00:36.040> you're<00:00:36.160> a<00:00:36.220> civil<00:00:36.489> engineer<00:00:36.790> or<00:00:36.910> when

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
when you're a civil engineer or when

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.520 
when you're a civil engineer or when
you're<00:00:37.120> in<00:00:37.210> any<00:00:37.360> job<00:00:37.570> really<00:00:37.780> you're<00:00:38.170> expected

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
you're in any job really you're expected

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.840 
you're in any job really you're expected
to<00:00:38.560> get<00:00:38.650> everything<00:00:38.950> right<00:00:39.190> all<00:00:39.460> of<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.640> time

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
to get everything right all of the time

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.580 
to get everything right all of the time
and<00:00:40.120> I<00:00:40.390> didn't<00:00:40.930> really<00:00:41.080> like<00:00:41.230> that<00:00:41.440> because

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
and I didn't really like that because

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.290 
and I didn't really like that because
well<00:00:42.160> I<00:00:42.190> was<00:00:42.430> a<00:00:42.460> civil<00:00:42.730> engineer<00:00:42.790> I<00:00:43.090> used<00:00:43.240> to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
well I was a civil engineer I used to

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.670 
well I was a civil engineer I used to
have<00:00:43.390> to<00:00:43.480> work<00:00:43.600> out<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.870> strength<00:00:44.140> of<00:00:44.380> beams

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
have to work out the strength of beams

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.370 
have to work out the strength of beams
needed<00:00:45.190> on<00:00:45.370> construction<00:00:46.000> projects<00:00:46.450> okay<00:00:46.750> and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
needed on construction projects okay and

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.020 
needed on construction projects okay and
I<00:00:47.530> didn't<00:00:47.770> get<00:00:47.890> a<00:00:47.920> ride<00:00:48.100> all<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.370> time<00:00:48.400> right

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
I didn't get a ride all the time right

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.360 
I didn't get a ride all the time right
so<00:00:49.300> if<00:00:49.750> you<00:00:49.990> are<00:00:50.110> ever<00:00:50.290> driving<00:00:50.680> on<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:50.860> m50

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
so if you are ever driving on the m50

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.010 
so if you are ever driving on the m50
and<00:00:51.670> you<00:00:52.150> have<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.390> go<00:00:52.480> into<00:00:52.630> the<00:00:52.750> bridge<00:00:52.870> at
