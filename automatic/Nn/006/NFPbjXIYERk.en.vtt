00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
whenever I think of a sports game

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.069 
whenever I think of a sports game
I<00:02:44.129> think<00:02:44.549> customization<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.599> mean<00:02:45.810> seriously

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079

that's<00:02:46.620> half<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.890> fun<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.670> think<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.390> was<00:02:48.510> cool

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
that's half the fun I think it was cool

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.240 
that's half the fun I think it was cool
to<00:02:48.810> be<00:02:48.870> able<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.110> play<00:02:49.319> as<00:02:49.500> me<00:02:49.739> but<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.190> don't

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
to be able to play as me but I don't

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.160 
to be able to play as me but I don't
like<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.819> I<00:02:50.849> couldn't<00:02:51.120> customize<00:02:51.660> me

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
like that I couldn't customize me

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.860 
like that I couldn't customize me
because<00:02:53.099> all<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.579> Me's<00:02:53.790> use<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.299> same<00:02:54.510> stats

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
because all the Me's use the same stats

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.900 
because all the Me's use the same stats
and<00:02:55.200> that's<00:02:55.470> really<00:02:55.769> lame<00:02:56.099> plus<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:56.730> makes

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
and that's really lame plus it makes

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.880 
and that's really lame plus it makes
your<00:02:57.060> Mii<00:02:57.239> super<00:02:57.750> slow<00:02:58.049> against<00:02:58.500> faster

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
your Mii super slow against faster

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.280 
your Mii super slow against faster
opponents<00:02:59.459> my<00:02:59.940> next<00:03:00.269> issue<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.810> there's<00:03:01.049> no

was boring enough to put me to sleep
actually<00:04:06.930> when<00:04:07.230> playing<00:04:07.530> this<00:04:07.680> game<00:04:07.859> with

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
actually when playing this game with

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.180 
actually when playing this game with
friends<00:04:08.459> we<00:04:08.609> listen<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.269> j-pop<00:04:09.919> which<00:04:10.919> if<00:04:11.099> you

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
friends we listen to j-pop which if you

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.500 
friends we listen to j-pop which if you
don't<00:04:11.310> know<00:04:11.430> what<00:04:11.609> that<00:04:11.639> is<00:04:11.790> it's<00:04:12.180> Japanese

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
don't know what that is it's Japanese

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.420 
don't know what that is it's Japanese
pop<00:04:13.049> which<00:04:13.560> actually<00:04:13.980> made<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.250> game<00:04:14.400> more

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
pop which actually made the game more

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:43.510 
pop which actually made the game more
exciting<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.299> play

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.580 

which<00:04:44.360> is<00:04:44.509> a<00:04:44.539> shame<00:04:44.870> because<00:04:45.080> I've<00:04:45.410> always

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
which is a shame because I've always

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.170 
which is a shame because I've always
liked<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:46.099> music<00:04:46.220> in<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.610> Mario<00:04:46.849> sports

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
liked the music in the Mario sports

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.909 
liked the music in the Mario sports
games<00:04:47.630> but<00:04:48.050> since<00:04:48.259> this<00:04:48.380> game<00:04:48.590> was<00:04:48.770> developed

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
games but since this game was developed

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.700 
games but since this game was developed
by<00:04:49.220> Square<00:04:49.580> Enix<00:04:50.030> musically<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:51.139> relaxing

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
by Square Enix musically the relaxing

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.640 
by Square Enix musically the relaxing
tones<00:04:51.949> may<00:04:52.430> work<00:04:52.699> for<00:04:52.880> an<00:04:53.000> RPG<00:04:53.300> but<00:04:53.990> for<00:04:54.440> this

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
tones may work for an RPG but for this

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.920 
tones may work for an RPG but for this
game<00:04:54.889> now<00:04:55.250> and<00:04:55.639> don't<00:04:55.940> get<00:04:56.060> me<00:04:56.180> wrong<00:04:56.210> I<00:04:56.660> like

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
game now and don't get me wrong I like

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.200 
game now and don't get me wrong I like
RPG<00:04:57.560> music<00:04:57.919> as<00:04:58.039> much<00:04:58.220> as<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.490> next<00:04:58.759> guy<00:04:58.910> but

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
RPG music as much as the next guy but

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.120 
RPG music as much as the next guy but
for<00:04:59.599> this<00:04:59.720> game<00:04:59.960> with<00:05:00.289> the<00:05:00.380> repetitive<00:05:00.979> loop

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
for this game with the repetitive loop

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.070 
for this game with the repetitive loop
of<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.460> music<00:05:01.819> that<00:05:01.970> goes<00:05:02.090> on<00:05:02.330> every<00:05:02.569> minute

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
of the music that goes on every minute

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.400 
of the music that goes on every minute
is<00:05:03.289> just<00:05:03.740> overkill<00:05:04.669> and<00:05:04.970> no<00:05:05.599> fun<00:05:05.840> to<00:05:05.960> listen<00:05:06.259> to

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
is just overkill and no fun to listen to

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.980 
is just overkill and no fun to listen to
so<00:05:06.979> enough<00:05:07.460> of<00:05:07.580> my<00:05:07.759> gripes<00:05:08.120> it's<00:05:08.449> time<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.780> talk

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
so enough of my gripes it's time to talk

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.200 
so enough of my gripes it's time to talk
about<00:05:09.020> what<00:05:09.500> I<00:05:09.530> liked<00:05:10.099> about<00:05:10.310> Mario<00:05:10.849> sports

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
about what I liked about Mario sports
