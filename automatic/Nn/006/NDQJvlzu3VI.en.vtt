00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 people today I show you my yard 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.090
 buchenwald my stock to double bed of 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.370
 which we showed you the last time 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:17.660
 I need a shoe box lid 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.949
 two stands of monster high end this 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:26.699
 Bottle lids and simply strip 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:31.380
 with 34 5 you can with the length 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.680
 about and wide of your bed for 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:43.260
 which then decide you then that is 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:48.239
 So if your shoe box is one now 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:52.440
 width of 24 cm then it's in bed 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.600
 then a pub would have to graze next to the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.399
 twelve centimeter long or just better 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.489
 if the text has msi now i'm okay 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.119
 place, of course, once more sharpened 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.390
 a pencil and a kuli and two 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.340
 cloths okay I have that already 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:18.259
 This was not prepared with the daddy 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:21.920
 So Thomas has to come here too 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.920
 piece of cardboard lid 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.430
 I just measured what they did 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.159
 width was and you have divided by 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.460
 two exactly and then there's a point 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.460
 made 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.729
 the times connected 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.729
 I have the same on the 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.780
 outside made measured point 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.729
 made point and connected 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:52.640
 then I go along with the scissors 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:56.870
 made long cut 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:09.410
 then you have your basic frame 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:10.610
 here lives the substance of it is not 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:20.480
 bad if it does not fit is one 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:21.680
 improvise a bit and be two times 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.020
 it's bad if it's a bit her 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.850
 based ok button housed opened 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.250
 it must be finally that is enough 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.020
 shashlik game pops something 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.900
 your cardboard in the middle again 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.660
 slightly stabilized 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.020
 thanks the style or toothpick or 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.220
 Schaschlikspieß mit mittäter fell in 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:56.470
 the middle firm then you do that 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:56.470
 tesafilm to the ends so our sleep 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:19.930
 then a bed between the 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:31.079
 Show exhibitors that then 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:35.549
 That's how your pope does 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:43.560
 mature on it that the that of the 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:46.370
 Tables here at the part here and on 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.370
 both sides 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:59.359
 twice with ok it looks like 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:10.290
 I have to top it with excel 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:16.049
 then you can do something here 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:19.979
 stand in your areas and ceiling 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:33.090
 pushes that too for stabilization and 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:49.340
 the bed and that is enough stability 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:52.440
 enough to carry my 22 dolls 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:57.240
 The monster has a three when you have one 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:59.330
 so you want to have displays wide at the top 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.699
 wider down then you just take 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.889
 shoe box and turn it on 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:08.990
 desired width so that would be the 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:14.370
 width of 2 is because there next to each other 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:18.270
 sport of course two cardboard lids and 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:21.139
 then cut it out like that and put it down 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:25.189
 then on it and if not then directly 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:28.430
 down here this strip you take 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:34.909
 but do not make a tele strip 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:36.370
 as that retains and sticks again 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:40.069
 wear down here 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:47.090
 there made teaspoon oh so 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:50.150
 This trouble has that here or 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.620
 this is not 12 individual things 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:57.889
 that keeps that at the same height 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:58.539
 others then get here from after 15 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.949
 30 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.719
 and that is my stretch the hand 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.240
 broken i wanted you this time 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:06.969
 show had hardly any more acute 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:12.830
 that's why I have to fulfill 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:14.000
 this is a monster high bed sow holder 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.409
 until next time that was mine 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.599
 second video next makes us that 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.599
 third if you sympathize
