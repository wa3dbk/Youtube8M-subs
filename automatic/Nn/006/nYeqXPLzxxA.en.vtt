00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.730
 after almost a year of waiting compared to Japanese relaxation 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.800
 the chatter of the world is coming 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.449
 trenitalia state graffiti produced by bamboccioni streaming ita playstation - 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.179
 the title on wine shelves 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.739
 sin and the logical structure of stockings in front of lawyer 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.739
 perfectly 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.700
 indiscreet film * here for graphics you put immediately and a fantastic atmosphere 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.289
 of this new effort at lunch the game tells the story of the boletaria kingdom 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.190
 fallen into disgrace after the rebirth of the ancient 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.410
 brought back to life give to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.890
 the risen one spread over all the territories of a quantity 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.940
 awesome of damned creatures 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.229
 and demons of macroscopic proportion 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.820
 which semi-panic and destruction 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.190
 among the inhabitants now resigned to annihilation 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.710
 This is what the developers felt like 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.760
 to put yourself in the shoes of the classic hero called save 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.200
 before starting with small but well-kept editor introduces the campaign 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.950
 allowing internal retouched are not the aesthetic aspects is yours 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.370
 tirreno also sending the possibility to choose the class to which it belongs 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.320
 the latter should not be underestimated 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.630
 the differences between the various specializations 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.400
 are deliberately obvious example umago will ever become true 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.250
 sword master as a warrior cannot specialize in 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.690
 maximum of spells 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.010
 the classes however there are not many edicts too much in the accent on the 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.490
 not some average personalization between these few categories of borrowed deixis 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.140
 from the improvement of the single abilities during the continuation of the fortune 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.050
 from the first moments the control system appears to be very particular 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.460
 although the mapping is actually simple dorsal hummingbirds used for 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.600
 attack and defense the rest of the tronto barton called to manage objects of 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.759
 defensive offensive type 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:28.080
 the game requires a certain meticulousness in the fight 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.120
 and every move is also the simplest but most painstakingly studied 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:37.059
 from this point of view, it is as deep as beating 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:41.249
 every animation you have made its completion times challenges every opponent 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:43.599
 reacts differently 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.599
 it is therefore essential to know the execution times by heart 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.099
 whatever the selected class 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.459
 after a small and not very exhaustive tutorial we will be introduced in the nexus la 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.120
 abode of lost souls 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.450
 the game in fact uses a particular system of rebirth after death 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.269
 we will be transformed into wandering souls forced to wander around the world in 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.959
 seeks salvation. 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.539
 only by defeating a demon foa through some rare sure we can recover the 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:12.919
 our body 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:17.229
 at a playful level, demons howl does not forgive the fratta 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:21.249
 in the event of death, it will always start from the beginning of the danube with the 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:24.249
 characteristic days to the last fight 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.889
 all the souls collected useful also as exchange currency for the 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:29.599
 transpar 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.029
 recoverable souls however returning to the place of the departure and examining the 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:35.429
 own corpse 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:39.100
 looking around shows a moderate wise curiosity 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.810
 It is therefore essential to carefully study the intricate dangerous in which there is 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.719
 will find 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:48.060
 know how to advance considering sadness of death, thus tracing a path 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:50.639
 sure to face possible defeat 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.279
 it is a real necessity 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.279
 which stimulates controlled methodical exploration 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:59.269
 a reasoned strategy is also essential to activate 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.089
 special events able to put one's adventurer first condition 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:04.469
 prime 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:08.090
 avoid defeats and deaths even in the most difficult clashes 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.470
 in fact it allows you to ingratiate yourself with a certain celestial sympathy 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.400
 ensuring for example the ability to interact with a few characters to 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.280
 activate so 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.280
 secondary quests for rewards and specials 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.859
 I have 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.310
 the technical aspect of berlusconi after all satisfactory 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.479
 but leaves many doubts retouching 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.699
 polygonal models for example are not up to the current generation 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.509
 they are characterized by a rather meager animation sector 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.520
 works in reverse 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.539
 the scenographic sensation and the style of the houses able to involve 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.509
 the player even without making the technological miracle scream 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.069
 excellent characterization of locations that embrace a style 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:52.680
 rather dark adulthood 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.410
 falls on gothic tv bad almost a punch in the stomach an insurmountable 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.910
 an architectural obstacle for anyone who had to come in and a windfall 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.770
 from the sky for that time I was looking for something different from the usual canons 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.030
 Lively, this monystar generation gets us used to 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:15.309
 good finally the essential but excellent sound effects as well as the 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:19.080
 decision to eliminate the musical background during the phases played 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.539
 to leave room for the sense of anxiety generated by silence 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.009
 Street 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.750
 the Italian version 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.250
 finally present a discrete translation work regarding 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.249
 the infinity of dialogues that is Calabrian for production 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:38.080
 which occur among others 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.509
 decidedly consistent with respect to the general writer 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.710
 the dubbing has remained the one in English keeping naturally high 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.710
 quality that had characterized the Asian version yes 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.569
 ischia design 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.569
 xxx what 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.879
 devastated 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:01.710
 it is certainly not uu 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.850
 indeed in all probability reserved that restricted circle of the cat 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.270
 we are all different guitar chords 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.300
 desperately looking for style if you test your skills 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:15.369
 video requires short digestion time 

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:19.289
 but able to offer on the occasion of degree of satisfaction but r. first 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:20.869
 this evening 

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:23.869
 in short, it does not matter - - 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.259
 daemon tools is a timeless masterpiece of the best exclusive 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:31.259
 tonight's playstation 3
