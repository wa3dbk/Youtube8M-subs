 winter storm this is precisely 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.130
 it is a very cold system system that is going 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.100
 to associate with the moisture input that 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.960
 comes from the Pacific and that will lead 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.070
 to moderate to heavy rainfall 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.470
 in the north of the American republic 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.630
 but that the potential exists can be 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.629
 important for the fall of snow in 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.430
 chihuahua in sonora in coahuila as well as 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.070

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.190
 the hours of this Friday the front in 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.500
 front of 21 could appear in the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.909
 Gulf of Mexico is also observed 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.920
 fully the moisture input that 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.839
 comes from the gulf of mexico and the 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.339
 Caribbean and will lead to rainfall 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.010
 moderate to strong in the peninsula and 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.440
 berta from strong to very strong in the

 there will also be some intense there in 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.120

 part of the center of the republic 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.480
 Mexican takes advantage of the cold environment 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.580
 with all that great amount of humidity 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.070
 that will also give us even the 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.870
 potential for snow in the areas 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.900
 mountainous areas of the republic 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.280
 mexicana and towards the east good then 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.200
 these forms functions create them that 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.670
 we have for you regarding the

 with some rainfall 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.790
 mainly in so it can be 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.680
 modeled the low peninsula 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.350
 california will stay out of that 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.150
 possibility with very sunny days in 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.120
 the next ones for this region with

 temperatures between warm to warm in 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.980
 as to what the northeast is the part 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.710
 from the northeast and maximum site of 12 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.690
 Maximum maximum 11 the environment is still 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.120
 being very cold because the entry of 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.800
 polar air air good as it presents 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.060
 in this region with great intensity and that 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.780
 the displacement of systems 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.630
 company 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.310

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.170
 resent the presence of this great layer 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.910
 cloudy and of course we would have 13 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.310
 degrees there in san luís potosí las 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.500
