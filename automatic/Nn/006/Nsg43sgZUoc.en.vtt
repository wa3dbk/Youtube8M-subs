00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.890
 today's tutorials is going I 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.899
 hope to help you master the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.639
 coordination of your two fingers we have 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.090
 all already tried to do a little 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.120
 rhythm on on the piano look a few 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.920
 days then two things everyone 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.840
 is able since it is used cooked by hand 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.070
 the problem if using the same back 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.390
 time and why first of all there 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.890
 arrive many denis comes in or not 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.960
 I will explain it to you that's all 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.730
 simply because doing very nice back 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.920
 you tomorrow at the same time done 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.670
 work two different parts of 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.079
 your brain who is not used to 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.420
 work together so the enemy 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.309
 brain you right hemisphere and that's 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.110
 for that to play an air on a hand 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.550
 is simple since there is only half 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.559
 sphere working except that play 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.750
 the two sites more complicated and that's 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.640
 like just like the sport like like 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.590
 all that kind of stuff that's all 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.530
 simply a practice so practice 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.969
 practice does not tell you does it tell you 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.190
 not I am not able everyone 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.649
 can we all are human 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.010
 so here we are going to work on 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.210
 chords that I invented that are very 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.210
 very simple this is it 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 we 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.210
 the really really simple agreements like 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.920
 you can hear it except that which 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.330
 is not simple at all it's 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.620
 coordinate the two fingers when we do not 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.270
 do not know how to play the piano yet 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.670
 I will try to teach you 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.220
 so first very important 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.200
 focus on your left hand 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.300
 it is this one that accompanies the hand 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.620
 right who use notes a lot 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.110
 more acute and that they will get along 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.760
 much better at the ear of people to 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.630
 around but 7 mango is very 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.770
 important because it accompanies 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.190
 to master having the first report that 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.190
 is this one 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.020
 of course there I show you have me 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.940
 helped my own chords that I have you 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.460
 shown you can do on yours 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.510
 invented yours as you please 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.510
 control your left hand 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.190
 continue till time 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.080
 100 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.520
 Do them 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.310
 the eyes 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.310
 I close my eyes 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.310
 we 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.239
 play there is no problem I am 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.939
 what I master this agreement this is 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.560
 really very very important people 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:27.420
 have always advised when I 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.340
 asked that I learn to play 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.140
 both hands very slowly and 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.939
 do little by little what would 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.000
 this according to you is what it would take 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.000
 make 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.830
 Oh 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.900
 but except that I did not do like 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.420
 this here hell in my head and then it has 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.400
 rather well I'm going to show you 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.190
 how did I do so I mastered 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.520
 so an agreement like those like this 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.440
 it is understood it was not sexy 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.600
 you have to add with your right hand 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.360
 note by note as these master 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.600
 your problem and could cost a 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.600
 note 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200
 1 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.030
 the discount 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.400
 after this note 1 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.370
 ea fourth year 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.409
 so on until you 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.250
 would simply put the agreement in 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:40.860
 whole left hand right hand 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.800
 that's just adding them 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.720
 slices 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.640
 do not try to do two or three 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.990
 keys at the same time it's useless 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.490
 first master the road first 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.770
 touch your second touch while 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.850
 just good looking your hand 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.780
 left 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.780
 which is important 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.980
 obviously you will get there until 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.590
 time you arrive at the changes 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.360
 of notes from the left hand in our 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.170
 second left hand agreement like 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.940
 this one with the little finger that on the 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.520
 tube 1 key and picks 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.000
 your agreement 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.320
 this change you can do it in 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.890
 mastering the first chord 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.480
 perfectly the automatically in mode 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.470
 Where we would be able to go 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.470
 our note may 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.510
 then you can change the 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.890
 rope on the left without problem 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.050
 something very important if you 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.000
 want to improve your coordination and 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.750
 especially the speed of your 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.550
 learning 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.110
 it is necessary that when you master a 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.710
 agree perfectly you are able 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:51.630
 to change his pace his speed so the 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:55.570
 basic rhythm I will be able to the 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.480
 it becomes faster even more 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.410
 long 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.130
 we 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.800
 until you master everything 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.630
 perfectly here I hope that what 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.790
 I told you you brought some 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.180
 thing and I did not provide for the 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.180
 next video
