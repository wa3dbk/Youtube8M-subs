00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.510 

and<00:02:19.410> again<00:02:19.680> we're<00:02:19.860> coming<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.220> our<00:02:20.250> little

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
and again we're coming to our little

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.790 
and again we're coming to our little
curve<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.180> need<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.510> pivot<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.680> can

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
curve so you need to pivot and you can

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.960 
curve so you need to pivot and you can
do<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.040> with<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> needle<00:02:23.640> in<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.940> down

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
do that with a needle in the down

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.060 
do that with a needle in the down
position<00:02:24.330> which<00:02:24.840> makes<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.650> easier<00:02:25.920> if<00:02:26.010> you

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
position which makes it easier if you

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.230 
position which makes it easier if you
don't<00:02:26.220> have<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> down<00:02:26.550> position<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.120> can

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
don't have a down position you can

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.520 
don't have a down position you can
either<00:02:27.360> turn<00:02:27.540> your<00:02:27.720> hand<00:02:27.900> wheel<00:02:27.960> towards<00:02:28.410> you

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
either turn your hand wheel towards you

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.950 
either turn your hand wheel towards you
or<00:02:29.160> just<00:02:29.400> sew<00:02:29.640> around<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.510> little<00:02:30.750> corner

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
or just sew around that little corner

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:41.090 
or just sew around that little corner
slowly

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.670 

we<00:02:42.100> have<00:02:42.220> one<00:02:42.430> last<00:02:42.640> thing<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.120> do<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.630> that<00:02:44.500> is

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
we have one last thing to do and that is

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.650 
we have one last thing to do and that is
trim<00:02:45.220> off<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:47.290> excess<00:02:47.710> material<00:02:48.630> if<00:02:49.630> you

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
trim off the excess material if you

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.880 
trim off the excess material if you
don't<00:02:49.990> trim<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.380> you'll<00:02:50.530> have<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.680> little

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
don't trim that you'll have a little

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.140 
don't trim that you'll have a little
bulky<00:02:51.280> corners<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.700> want<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.000> get<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.270> out<00:02:54.150> we

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
bulky corners I want to get that out we

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.210 
bulky corners I want to get that out we
will<00:02:55.270> flip<00:02:55.690> our<00:02:56.260> material<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.840> there<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.960> go

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
will flip our material and there you go

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.770 
will flip our material and there you go
perfect<00:03:00.750> typed<00:03:01.770> corner
