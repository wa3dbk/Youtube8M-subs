in<00:00:15.200> fact<00:00:16.039> I<00:00:16.219> had<00:00:16.520> this<00:00:16.760> idea<00:00:17.289> given<00:00:18.289> our

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
in fact I had this idea given our

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.929 
in fact I had this idea given our
theater<00:00:18.830> seating<00:00:19.189> and<00:00:19.580> given<00:00:19.849> this

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
theater seating and given this

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.450 
theater seating and given this
incredible<00:00:20.599> painting<00:00:21.140> that<00:00:21.770> we<00:00:22.039> should<00:00:22.250> just

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
incredible painting that we should just

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.650 
incredible painting that we should just
sit<00:00:22.759> here<00:00:23.090> and<00:00:24.340> watch<00:00:25.340> the<00:00:25.730> movie<00:00:27.460> because<00:00:28.660> it

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
sit here and watch the movie because it

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.170

really<00:00:30.079> it<00:00:30.560> really<00:00:30.829> unfolds<00:00:31.730> and<00:00:31.880> I<00:00:31.939> think

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
really it really unfolds and I think

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
really it really unfolds and I think
that<00:00:32.329> says<00:00:32.540> a<00:00:32.570> lot<00:00:32.689> about<00:00:32.840> about<00:00:33.350> Louis's

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.259 
what's so remarkable about this is the
paint<00:02:43.129> seems<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.519> be<00:02:43.640> moving<00:02:43.909> in<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.090> lot<00:02:44.239> of

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
paint seems to be moving in a lot of

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.240 
paint seems to be moving in a lot of
different<00:02:44.780> ways<00:02:45.319> a<00:02:45.349> lot<00:02:45.830> of<00:02:45.950> different

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
different ways a lot of different

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.449 
different ways a lot of different
directions<00:02:47.290> there's<00:02:48.290> an<00:02:48.530> awful<00:02:48.950> lot<00:02:48.980> of

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
directions there's an awful lot of

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.280 
directions there's an awful lot of
thinning<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.510> paint<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:52.930> possibly<00:02:53.930> I

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
thinning of the paint and possibly I

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.800 
thinning of the paint and possibly I
don't<00:02:54.410> know<00:02:54.860> this<00:02:55.099> is<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.310> debate<00:02:55.730> but<00:02:56.299> possibly

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
don't know this is a debate but possibly

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.500 
don't know this is a debate but possibly
some<00:02:56.900> dragging<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:57.829> the<00:02:58.400> paint<00:02:58.670> with<00:02:58.879> with<00:02:59.390> the

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
for this series let's go with if you

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.379 
for this series let's go with if you
know<00:03:33.560> two<00:03:33.620> word<00:03:34.069> titles<00:03:34.639> and<00:03:34.910> then<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.120> next

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
know two word titles and then the next

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.000 
know two word titles and then the next
series<00:03:35.599> will<00:03:36.349> do<00:03:36.500> something<00:03:36.889> a<00:03:36.919> little

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
series will do something a little

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.009 
series will do something a little
different<00:03:37.549> so<00:03:39.730> see<00:03:40.730> oh<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.849> suppose<00:03:41.090> inspired

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
different so see oh I suppose inspired

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.550 
different so see oh I suppose inspired
by<00:03:42.290> you<00:03:43.069> know<00:03:43.220> some<00:03:43.519> of<00:03:43.639> the<00:03:43.730> colors<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.450> the

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
by you know some of the colors and the

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.530 
by you know some of the colors and the
feeling<00:03:45.560> of<00:03:45.650> water<00:03:46.280> perhaps<00:03:47.650> but<00:03:48.650> titles<00:03:49.069> are

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
feeling of water perhaps but titles are

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.509 
feeling of water perhaps but titles are
convenient<00:03:50.540> for<00:03:50.720> many<00:03:51.410> reasons<00:03:51.889> it's<00:03:52.160> much

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
convenient for many reasons it's much

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.379 
convenient for many reasons it's much
better<00:03:52.819> than<00:03:53.030> you<00:03:53.269> know<00:03:53.389> 1-3<00:03:54.380> 87b

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
better than you know 1-3 87b

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.920 
better than you know 1-3 87b
with<00:03:56.389> Clifford<00:03:56.780> still<00:03:57.169> or<00:03:57.410> whatever<00:03:58.510> so<00:03:59.510> it's

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
with Clifford still or whatever so it's

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.199 
with Clifford still or whatever so it's
good<00:04:00.109> that<00:04:00.139> we<00:04:00.349> have<00:04:00.380> them<00:04:00.799> but<00:04:00.970> but<00:04:01.970> I<00:04:02.000> don't

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
good that we have them but but I don't

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.909 
good that we have them but but I don't
think<00:04:02.269> we<00:04:02.419> need<00:04:02.569> to<00:04:02.599> think<00:04:02.900> seal<00:04:03.260> this<00:04:03.560> is<00:04:03.739> not

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
think we need to think seal this is not

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.539 
think we need to think seal this is not
a<00:04:04.220> figurative<00:04:04.750> painting<00:04:05.750> in<00:04:06.590> any<00:04:07.069> sense<00:04:07.370> of

a figurative painting in any sense of

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:15.590 
a figurative painting in any sense of
the<00:04:07.669> word
