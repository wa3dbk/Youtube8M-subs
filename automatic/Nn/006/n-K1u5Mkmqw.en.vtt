00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.870
 ladies and this weather service 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.490
 inform you about the presence 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.200
 of this that is the front the cold front 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.180
 number 30 that has quickly 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.650
 displaced throughout our 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.390
 territory and it comes right up to 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.980
 the center and is even about to touch the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.510
 southeast of our territory 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.090
 Note that this system 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.160
 will therefore be disturbing the noceda of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.810
 southeast with cloud formation some 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.089
 precipitations that can become 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.859
 strong in this region moderate light 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.440
 moderate in the yucatan peninsula 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.960
 some slight moderate in the east of 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.270
 our territory head that the mass the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.280
 great mass of cold air that generated this 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.600
 system and that keeps pushing it towards 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.030
 the southeast and the yucatan peninsula 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.590
 but it will give place and he has given it from 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.150
 then at a temperature drop 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.070
 very important for the states of the 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.900
 north we will begin to resent it in the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.060
 center from this late-night and 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.160
 that we will also be registering 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.630
 winds of north component in 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.490
 the littoral of the gulf of mexico in the 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.950
 same and gulf of tehuantepec gusts of 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.920
 up to 70 even a little faster 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.900
 these gusts of wind on the coast of the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.500
 gulf of mexico on the isthmus and gulf of 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.450
 tehuantepec of course we will wait 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.920
 little damp sky in the north despite 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.530
 that continues to train the humidity from 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.530
 the Pacific Ocean in some places 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.479
 with such a low temperature and the sky 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.759
 little bit wet well we'll wait 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.500
 intense frost in the states 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.170
 from the north and in some points of the center 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.659
 of the Mexican Republic temperatures 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.159
 I insist very low mainly for the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.960
 morning and night although I also 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.450
 I can say that the maximum temperatures 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.600
 in the north states good 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.179
 hardly reached about 67 degrees 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.189
 of maximum temperature for example in what 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.439
 that is monterrey new leon a lot but 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.390
 very cold on the other hand also not 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.549
 I can talk, we have this just 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.009
 the low temperatures then this 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.079
 great area look at all these states 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.780
 we have very low temperatures on the part 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.270
 of this great mass of cold air the north 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.799
 that we have already indicated towards the Gulf of 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.739
 mexico the isthmus and gulf of tehuantepec 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.539
 with significant gusts in the wind and 

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:09.060
 what good then the minimum temperatures 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.799
 also well indicated in everything that is 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.780
 the north and the center of the republic 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.760
 Mexican as we have reached 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.220
 up to 11 degrees below zero is alive 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.260
 tomorrow there in the rosilla in the state 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.390
 durango as to the precipitation 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.500
 we have also indicated we will wait 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.599
 some strong in what is 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.730
 strictly to the southeast in what is the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.040
 state of moderate Tabasco chiapas in 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.810
 Jalisco in Veracruz and light in the 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.700
 rest of you in some spots 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.340
 distant we will wait some light 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.870
 but I think I believe and I'm going to tell you 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.519
 we really have conditions that 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.069
 there are these light rains 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:44.340
 but very very scattered and the humidity is 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.109
 really very little very little in these 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.569
 regions and it 's degree that we can also 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.549
 highlight this restriction of 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.799
 forecast for cities there in 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.870

 cancún and of the rice we will have those 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.829
 temperature conditions that will be 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.409
 indeed in some points very 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.060
 pleasant and that we will also hope that 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.680
 there is this condition of some 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.569
 rainfall that only very 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.970

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.129
