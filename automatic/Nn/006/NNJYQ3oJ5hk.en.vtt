probably<00:03:48.150> about<00:03:48.390> maybe<00:03:49.290> four<00:03:49.680> months<00:03:50.570> I<00:03:54.620> love

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620

this<00:03:55.770> blade<00:03:56.070> I<00:03:56.780> love<00:03:57.780> everything<00:03:58.350> about<00:03:58.440> it

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
this blade I love everything about it

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.290 
this blade I love everything about it
except<00:03:59.250> for<00:03:59.490> one<00:04:00.030> thing<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:02.000> that<00:04:03.000> one<00:04:03.270> thing

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
except for one thing and that one thing

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.630 
except for one thing and that one thing
is<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.170> locking<00:04:04.410> system<00:04:06.650> it<00:04:07.650> does<00:04:07.890> not<00:04:08.040> have<00:04:08.370> a

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
is the locking system it does not have a

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.690 
is the locking system it does not have a
lighter<00:04:09.030> lock<00:04:09.360> like<00:04:09.930> most<00:04:10.800> of<00:04:11.010> your<00:04:11.130> Kershaw's

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
lighter lock like most of your Kershaw's

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.110 
lighter lock like most of your Kershaw's
dip<00:04:13.010> usually<00:04:14.010> there's<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.310> liner<00:04:14.610> lock<00:04:14.820> right

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
dip usually there's a liner lock right

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.650 
dip usually there's a liner lock right
there<00:04:15.890> I'm<00:04:16.890> a<00:04:16.950> creature<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.460> habit<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.210> guess

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
there I'm a creature of habit so I guess

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.570 
there I'm a creature of habit so I guess
I<00:04:18.810> just<00:04:18.840> haven't<00:04:19.620> gotten<00:04:19.859> used<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.370> this

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
I just haven't gotten used to this

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.080 
I just haven't gotten used to this
locking<00:04:21.120> system

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
locking system

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.060 
locking system
but<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.180> locking<00:04:23.570> system<00:04:23.780> is<00:04:24.350> called<00:04:24.620> a<00:04:24.740> stud

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
but the locking system is called a stud

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.580 
but the locking system is called a stud
lock<00:04:25.310> you<00:04:26.240> have<00:04:26.270> your<00:04:26.510> finger<00:04:26.810> studs<00:04:27.110> here<00:04:29.590> you

lock you have your finger studs here you

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
lock you have your finger studs here you
do<00:04:30.770> is<00:04:31.070> you<00:04:31.280> push<00:04:31.580> that<00:04:31.850> stud<00:04:32.300> forward<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:34.400> it

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
do is you push that stud forward and it

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.880 
do is you push that stud forward and it
unlocks<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.240> blade<00:04:37.090> it<00:04:38.090> is<00:04:38.510> a<00:04:38.780> very<00:04:39.290> solid

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
unlocks the blade it is a very solid

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:46.840 
unlocks the blade it is a very solid
lock<00:04:40.100> up<00:04:42.850> I<00:04:43.850> just<00:04:44.480> I<00:04:44.780> don't<00:04:44.840> care<00:04:45.830> for<00:04:46.430> that

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
lock up I just I don't care for that

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.360 
lock up I just I don't care for that
lock<00:04:47.180> up<00:04:47.420> system<00:04:47.860> like<00:04:48.860> I<00:04:48.890> said<00:04:49.190> I'm<00:04:49.280> a

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
lock up system like I said I'm a

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.660 
lock up system like I said I'm a
creature<00:04:49.610> of<00:04:49.790> habit<00:04:49.880> I'd<00:04:50.390> rather<00:04:50.630> have<00:04:50.960> a

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
creature of habit I'd rather have a

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.930 
creature of habit I'd rather have a
liner<00:04:52.670> lock<00:04:52.910> right<00:04:53.150> here<00:04:54.550> but<00:04:55.550> you<00:04:55.850> know

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
liner lock right here but you know

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.690 
liner lock right here but you know
that's<00:04:56.210> just<00:04:56.330> me<00:04:56.630> and<00:04:56.900> it's<00:04:57.080> not<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:58.580> my<00:04:58.850> liking

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
that's just me and it's not to my liking

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.510 
that's just me and it's not to my liking
that's<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:01.880> only<00:05:02.270> downside<00:05:03.040> for<00:05:04.040> me<00:05:04.070> that's

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
that's the only downside for me that's

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.790 
that's the only downside for me that's
the<00:05:04.640> only<00:05:05.000> downside<00:05:05.240> is<00:05:05.540> that<00:05:05.780> locking<00:05:06.410> system

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
the only downside is that locking system

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.960 
the only downside is that locking system
other<00:05:07.010> than<00:05:07.220> that<00:05:07.370> it's<00:05:08.090> it's<00:05:08.570> been<00:05:08.810> a<00:05:08.840> great

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
other than that it's it's been a great

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:20.320 
other than that it's it's been a great
EDC<00:05:10.970> knife<00:05:13.810> I<00:05:18.010> actually<00:05:19.010> was<00:05:19.760> doing<00:05:19.790> a<00:05:20.150> little

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
EDC knife I actually was doing a little

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.870 
EDC knife I actually was doing a little
research<00:05:20.600> on<00:05:21.050> this<00:05:21.230> I<00:05:21.530> was<00:05:22.280> trying<00:05:22.430> to<00:05:22.580> find

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
research on this I was trying to find

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.930 
research on this I was trying to find
out<00:05:23.060> when<00:05:23.270> this<00:05:23.680> this<00:05:24.680> knife<00:05:24.950> was<00:05:25.250> released<00:05:25.640> I

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
out when this this knife was released I

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.760 
out when this this knife was released I
was<00:05:26.690> unable<00:05:27.020> to<00:05:27.080> find<00:05:27.320> that<00:05:27.740> information<00:05:28.510> but

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
was unable to find that information but

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.200 
was unable to find that information but
what<00:05:30.770> I<00:05:30.800> did<00:05:31.130> find<00:05:31.160> is<00:05:31.820> that<00:05:32.030> this<00:05:32.930> knife<00:05:33.230> is

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
what I did find is that this knife is

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:41.590 
what I did find is that this knife is
discontinued<00:05:35.210> now<00:05:38.260> and<00:05:40.420> unfortunately<00:05:41.420> it

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
discontinued now and unfortunately it

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.660 
discontinued now and unfortunately it
was<00:05:41.780> unable<00:05:41.990> to<00:05:43.090> find<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.360> reasons<00:05:44.720> why<00:05:44.930> I

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
was unable to find the reasons why I

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.950 
was unable to find the reasons why I
mean<00:05:46.670> if<00:05:46.820> it<00:05:47.000> was<00:05:47.150> me<00:05:47.360> if<00:05:47.390> I<00:05:47.630> had<00:05:47.720> to<00:05:47.780> take<00:05:47.930> a

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
mean if it was me if I had to take a

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.590 
mean if it was me if I had to take a
guess<00:05:48.230> it's<00:05:48.590> because<00:05:48.770> of<00:05:49.130> that<00:05:49.300> stud<00:05:50.300> lock

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
guess it's because of that stud lock

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.080 
guess it's because of that stud lock
system<00:05:51.080> it<00:05:51.320> just<00:05:53.230> it<00:05:54.230> isn't<00:05:54.440> for<00:05:54.770> me<00:05:55.000> you<00:05:56.000> know

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
system it just it isn't for me you know

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.120 
system it just it isn't for me you know
other<00:05:56.300> people<00:05:56.660> may<00:05:56.840> like<00:05:57.080> it<00:05:57.110> I<00:05:57.470> don't<00:05:58.040> care

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
other people may like it I don't care

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.900 
other people may like it I don't care
for<00:05:58.460> it<00:05:58.580> at<00:05:58.760> all<00:05:58.970> it's<00:05:59.600> not<00:05:59.900> a<00:06:00.290> smooth<00:06:01.040> locking

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
for it at all it's not a smooth locking

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.210 
for it at all it's not a smooth locking
system<00:06:02.330> as<00:06:02.420> far<00:06:02.600> as<00:06:02.660> releasing<00:06:03.140> it<00:06:03.470> it's<00:06:03.980> not

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
system as far as releasing it it's not
