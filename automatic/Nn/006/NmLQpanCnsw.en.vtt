00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.590
 we saw that Dutch football fans can build a nice fox party 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.860
 last night in numerous cities where there were screens so you see on it 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.620
 Museumplein in Amsterdam but Groningen has to make do with TVs in bars 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.990
 also during the World Cup final 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.970
 we have looked very carefully at the specific situation of the coming one 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:20.550
 weekend 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.730
 for example, how the animals have that, he is actually perfect when it comes to the final 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.730
 contest 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.769
 that works extra people 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.379
 eye to turn they take and thousands of people that you can imagine 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:34.829
 be said of years 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.190
 it can be done somewhere else but I don't have to judge it 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.880
 and I know the greater the Groningen city center and I am responsible 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.120
 everyone can have an opinion but I am responsible and that is how I have the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.090
 make a decision 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.250
 much to the disappointment of many people who flocked in last night 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.740
 cafes and street parties 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.320
 the work very unfortunate because I have seen the images and Amsterdam but also 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.159
 region for example and 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.479
 yes, however, I expect that we really support the football I had 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.539
 gladly visited yesterday 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:05.660
 so there isn't either 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.440
 folk festival erupted an I have heard nothing of that was it is over and 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.270
 the all cheerful to read the people and the rules I think you are his own 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.570
 say in Amsterdam it is also going well now not all there in that little one 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.410
 alleys is an asset a year is a shame against each other after three years 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.940
 is 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.940
 things can go a little bit again 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.830
 not just by the foundation there is not too long it is the lack of it 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.020
 find confidence in your own citizens 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.940
 last night it seemed that Groningen would screen the final 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.840
 can watch 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.520
 Mayor Rehwinkel tweeted that he was increasingly looking forward to it and organizer 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.300
 natal van gelder had already submitted the plan 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.159
 did have to give thought to explain the approach to this 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.620
 enne refer, among other things, to the night of orange 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.580
 on the rarely square the fish market 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.180
 we actually have one the eu books with blueprints in the cupboard and i had whole 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.860
 can explain well about how to tackle and with the night of orange 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.470
 Wig to believe that there are 40,000 visitors 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.900
 no discord 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.080
 customers the police was very satisfied 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.850
 you got i see a real problem 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.869
 enter the municipality 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.910
 later it turned out that the World Cup party only in the city center is not possible in, for example 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.120
 euroborg or neighborhood few things are possible, but gelder sees no point in it 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.680
 and so it will look like yesterday at home or in the pub I hope people 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.630
 also understand that if it goes wrong beh year 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.989
 all those opinions do not have much to do and we want to look here and there 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.989
 like a restart from the north are quite a bit then 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.800
 because it looks like a big square 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.579
 in our own city 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.010
 a signature campaign has now been launched on the internet to 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.359
 persuade the municipality to install screens
