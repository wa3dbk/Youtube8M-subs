00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
graphics cards to make it easier just

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.450 
graphics cards to make it easier just
there<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:37.309> alternately

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
there and alternately

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.880 
there and alternately
just<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.079> put<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> true<00:00:40.379> two<00:00:40.530> graphics<00:00:40.920> cards

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
just to put a true two graphics cards

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.040 
just to put a true two graphics cards
replace<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.219> top<00:00:44.700> right<00:00:44.940> now<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.600> another

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
replace the top right now with another

replace the top right now with another
fovea<00:00:46.559> ride<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.010> version<00:00:47.370> 2<00:00:47.579> was<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.090> I

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
fovea ride the version 2 was the one I

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.590 
fovea ride the version 2 was the one I
had

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
had

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600 
had
so<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> could<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.500> part<00:00:49.860> at<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> end<00:00:50.160> there

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
so I could have a part at the end there

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.069 
so I could have a part at the end there
to<00:00:50.850> make<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.030> easier<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.690> route<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
to make it easier for a route and the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.990 
to make it easier for a route and the
children<00:00:54.170> that's<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.500> temporary<00:00:56.010> filling

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000

tube<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.100> can<00:00:59.129> see<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> one<00:00:59.609> behind

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
tube and you can see the one behind

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.930 
tube and you can see the one behind
there<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:01.440> leading<00:01:01.949> from<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.309> other<00:01:02.430> side<00:01:02.699> of

there is leading from the other side of
the<00:01:03.090> radiator<00:01:04.880> I've<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.090> replaced<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.020> fans

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350

the radiator I've just replaced the fans
with<00:01:07.710> BitFenix<00:01:08.430> funds<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.210> think<00:01:09.420> they<00:01:09.540> look

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
with BitFenix funds as I think they look

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.240 
with BitFenix funds as I think they look
a<00:01:09.780> little<00:01:09.930> bit<00:01:10.140> better

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250
