00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
like that I'd say that because of the

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.980 
like that I'd say that because of the
cleanser<00:04:26.729> or<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.030> moisturizer<00:04:27.449> but<00:04:27.720> never

cleanser or the moisturizer but never
the<00:04:28.199> toner<00:04:28.470> so<00:04:29.160> I'm<00:04:29.880> just<00:04:30.090> gonna<00:04:30.210> dismiss<00:04:30.720> the

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
the toner so I'm just gonna dismiss the

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.920 
the toner so I'm just gonna dismiss the
toner<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:31.699> you<00:04:32.699> have<00:04:32.970> after<00:04:33.270> that<00:04:33.570> a<00:04:33.600> lot<00:04:33.870> of

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
toner and you have after that a lot of

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.800 
toner and you have after that a lot of
moisturizing<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:35.070> lot<00:04:35.580> of<00:04:35.699> serums<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.479> a<00:04:36.630> lot

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
moisturizing a lot of serums and a lot

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.740

of<00:04:36.900> creams<00:04:37.169> and<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:38.100> think<00:04:38.520> that<00:04:38.940> was<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.510> base

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
of creams and I think that was the base

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.190 
of creams and I think that was the base
the<00:04:40.139> serum<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:41.130> serums<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:42.300> concentrated

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
the serum the serums the concentrated

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.379 
the serum the serums the concentrated
parts<00:04:43.500> of<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.710> skincare<00:04:44.130> system<00:04:44.580> was<00:04:44.729> the
