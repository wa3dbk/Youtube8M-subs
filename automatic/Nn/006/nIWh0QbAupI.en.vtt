00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.599
 Yes 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:12.880
 it's good day she's not doing her nights i'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.689
 is it an option 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:18.269
 some 900 wounded at once a great classic and then it's the high end 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.560
 panasonic camcorders 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.470
 the concept of sd 900 is to have in a clutter that is relatively 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.550
 small thanks to a device that I hold in the marl 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.150
 a camcorder that has everything a videographer can dream of a little bit 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.030
 sophisticated 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.800
 for the first thing is that everything on this device is disengageable I can 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.200
 set everything absolutely manually if I want the focus the balance of 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.120
 white for the exhibition 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.720
 he can receive 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.810
 microphones 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.690
 of course integrated microphones 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.149
 only 5 points 5 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.659
 25 'see it before 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:50.839
 otherwise if ever 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.539
 I leave recorded embedded seamicro also a headphone output when I 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.470
 can really have total control of 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.560
 both of my son have more of my image 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.780
 % a claw 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.950
 who comes to be connected to the fatality stellar 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.870
 this summer 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.600
 Removable to keep a profile very smooth account we do not use it 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.950
 and on which it is provided on which I can 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.310
 installed a lot of accessories 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.850
 the different orders this is something that is very much appreciated 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.440
 of the 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.810
 customers of this range of camcorders 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.180
 this Thursday by a wheel 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.830
 it has a button here that allows to rotate the functions choose I 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.390
 would choose white balance focus exposure 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.070
 and with the wheel to adjust that 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.270
 I can control so on my screen retina 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.650
 a big screen 3 inches 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.460
 the touch of course and then several 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.130
 it's pretty rare on this on this type of device 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.890
 he has a viewfinder in which I can absolutely control every 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.619
 parameters he called for a refusal front only unlike thomas 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.479
 ticket for that use a system that is now prevalent on all 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.070
 cameras as they are camcorders 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.920
 or cameras it pays it beats for intelligent automatisms 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.620
 persistence of a routine set that allow the state apparatus the 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.760
 text on the image 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.570
 to understand what kind of subject he has to do and then and configures himself by 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.630
 elsewhere was 900 for those who had known previous versions 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.929
 what distinguishes 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.129
 this is the goal he aspired typhoon indeed the cables of lovers 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.439
 have been activated draws objectives of this range it's a little more open 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.589
 than in previous years 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:18.489
 from a point of view the chronicles are three sensors 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.859
 and it's this family of 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.019
 camcorders 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.549
 a sensor by primary colors with a prism of sale not remind you to 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.790
 the school when the light crosses a price this massacre is decomposable 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.120
 set in primary colors and one sensor per color 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.110
 this color separation guarantee that is flawless none 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.890
 loyalty 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.170
 of color rendering that is absolutely flawless and these sensors 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.170
 are large it allows him to have a low sensitivity 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.700
 light surely the crucial point about consumer camcorders the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.189
 sensitivity in low light 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.830
 which is really excellent 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.040
 afp the 720p already very good that side the noxon is still both 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.850
 best and then he also has a characteristic is very fashionable 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.150
 so this is a very very classic camcorder is really as good 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.900
 at the level of ergonomics 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.539
 the operation will be me that remains classic 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:03.040
 who can if I want 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.180
 to do something extremely modern I can equipped 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:08.269
 the adapter 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.769
 who comes to interfere at the end 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.689
 and that allows him to record in 3d 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.329
 why the idea for these women 3d 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.890
 at first knowing that initially 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.540
 the 3d it's going to be an application that is punctual even for an amateur 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.399
 passionate 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:24.139
 in the idea it was to keep 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.289
 the entire assembly line 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:29.199
 he understood when I'm doing 3d 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.189
 so for that 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:31.299
 we do not use 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.930
 a technology called saïd aït saïd is to say that this objective 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.370
 which is placed in front of 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.199
 we see the two images 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.179
 the left the rights 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:41.639
 on the sensor 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.669
 they are at death were more compressed and so the camcorder 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.519
 himself that part of the telescope does not know who is smoking from 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.329
 the 3d and thin glasses of age quite normal which will then be my table 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.769
 by the software we are used to using 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.290
 simply these TVs offer to send the most 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.019
 which aims to actually recognize the image is cut in half the team 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.950
 reconstructed the two image halves that are contained in one piece 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.730
 it's called these drops axa his accessories c4 that comes alone it's 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.810
 before you go but in front of a camcorder quite classic that when I 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.110
 want to do the 3d it's the 3d it's a bit the part would have been 9 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.989
 cents compared to previous generations of all the 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.139
 connectivity is grouped under linux 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.309
 a small hatch 

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:23.849
 with the SD card he records coffee and that comes unprecedented the output 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.879
 hdmi 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:29.849
 2 the scope of ideas to recover images and camcorders a carton 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.680
 a usb port a port hdmi and tennis to release the video 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.900
 the stc to recover the photos and can also do the photocopiers 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:40.839
 a standard audio video output for people who have a TV that has 

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:41.500
 no 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.879
 hdmi input 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.719
 in conclusion for a public price and also or 900 round a few euros including 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:47.879
 less than 1000 euros 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:50.060
 % we have a little ras and who is 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.080
 complete extremely powerful 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.300
 equipped with devices as well at stabilization level one of the highlights 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.469
 the paneac optical range 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:57.449
 for the current 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.180
 more image capture expeed 3 extremely powerful sensors 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.300
 to end up working around a set of commands that allows this to be 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.139
 to have approached automatic mantoue 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.139
 suddenly extremely strong reinforcement in a manual way 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.070
 e with a picture quality in the end that is really exceptional and the cherry 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.660
 on the cake is the capacity if I want it 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.040
 ask paris the movie is in 3d
