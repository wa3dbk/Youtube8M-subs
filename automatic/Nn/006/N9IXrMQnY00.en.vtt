because<00:03:07.239> when<00:03:08.110> I<00:03:08.140> was<00:03:08.380> younger<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.680> grew<00:03:08.860> up<00:03:08.890> in

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
because when I was younger I grew up in

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.130 
because when I was younger I grew up in
a<00:03:09.100> church<00:03:09.280> setting<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.300> was<00:03:10.630> women<00:03:10.870> were

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
silent and so I actually had a problem

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.360 
silent and so I actually had a problem
with<00:03:15.430> women<00:03:15.640> preachers<00:03:16.620> look<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:17.769> did<00:03:18.010> I'm

that<00:03:22.299> we<00:03:22.540> were<00:03:22.720> trained<00:03:23.110> in<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.440> I<00:03:23.500> basically

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
that we were trained in and I basically

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.100 
that we were trained in and I basically
you<00:03:24.489> know<00:03:24.640> had<00:03:24.970> my<00:03:25.030> foundational<00:03:25.900> faith

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
you know had my foundational faith

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.110 
you know had my foundational faith
established<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.070> was<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.610> was<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:27.880> learning

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
established and it was it was a learning

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.000 
established and it was it was a learning
curve<00:03:28.329> for<00:03:28.540> me<00:03:28.720> but<00:03:28.959> I<00:03:28.989> also<00:03:29.200> recognized<00:03:29.860> at

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
curve for me but I also recognized at

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.039 
curve for me but I also recognized at
the<00:03:30.040> same<00:03:30.310> time<00:03:30.610> this<00:03:30.850> is<00:03:30.910> very<00:03:31.329> liberating

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
the same time this is very liberating

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.870 
the same time this is very liberating
and<00:03:32.350> I<00:03:32.410> don't<00:03:32.470> mean<00:03:32.769> that<00:03:32.829> liberating<00:03:33.700> like

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
and I don't mean that liberating like

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
and I don't mean that liberating like
women's<00:03:34.360> lib

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
women's lib

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.680 
women's lib
I<00:03:34.930> mean<00:03:35.079> liberate<00:03:35.410> as<00:03:35.590> in<00:03:35.769> freeing<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:37.510> see

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
I mean liberate as in freeing to see

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.199 
I mean liberate as in freeing to see
something<00:03:38.079> I'd<00:03:38.200> never<00:03:38.380> seen<00:03:38.560> before<00:03:38.829> and<00:03:39.519> also

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
something I'd never seen before and also

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.870 
something I'd never seen before and also

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
recognizing something that I I really

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.580 
recognizing something that I I really
believed<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.209> I<00:03:43.390> needed<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.870> step<00:03:44.079> into<00:03:44.320> in

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
believed that I needed to step into in

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.009 
believed that I needed to step into in
terms<00:03:44.799> of<00:03:45.010> how<00:03:45.340> God<00:03:45.730> had<00:03:45.910> wired<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.480> me<00:03:46.870> and

where<00:03:56.859> women<00:03:57.130> really<00:03:57.880> were<00:03:58.359> considered

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
property and so if I could just throw

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.870 
property and so if I could just throw
that<00:04:01.630> out<00:04:01.660> as<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:01.930> blanket<00:04:02.560> thing<00:04:02.859> to<00:04:03.430> keep<00:04:03.670> in

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
that out as a blanket thing to keep in

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.240

the New Testament these were written to

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.240 
the New Testament these were written to
cultures<00:04:15.400> that<00:04:16.090> didn't<00:04:16.690> just<00:04:17.109> ignore<00:04:17.410> women

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
cultures that didn't just ignore women

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.009 
cultures that didn't just ignore women
they<00:04:18.669> actually<00:04:19.150> went<00:04:19.419> out<00:04:19.539> of<00:04:19.690> their<00:04:19.780> way<00:04:19.840> to

they actually went out of their way to
devalue<00:04:20.950> them<00:04:21.159> not<00:04:21.909> not<00:04:22.690> just<00:04:22.720> by<00:04:23.550> not

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
devalue them not not just by not

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.370 
devalue them not not just by not
allowing<00:04:24.729> them<00:04:25.360> right

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
allowing them right

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.130 
allowing them right
not<00:04:26.530> alone<00:04:26.830> but<00:04:27.070> actually<00:04:27.960> mistreating<00:04:28.960> them

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
not alone but actually mistreating them

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.680 
not alone but actually mistreating them
and<00:04:29.410> abusing<00:04:30.340> them<00:04:30.490> in<00:04:30.640> horrible<00:04:31.090> ways<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:31.570> so

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
and abusing them in horrible ways and so

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.390 
and abusing them in horrible ways and so
we<00:04:31.840> just<00:04:32.020> we<00:04:32.230> don't<00:04:32.590> get<00:04:33.040> that<00:04:33.250> we<00:04:33.370> don't

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
we just we don't get that we don't

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.670 
we just we don't get that we don't
understand<00:04:34.120> that<00:04:34.360> but<00:04:34.900> that's<00:04:35.080> where<00:04:35.410> a<00:04:35.440> lot

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
understand that but that's where a lot

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.380 
understand that but that's where a lot
of<00:04:35.710> what<00:04:35.920> Paul<00:04:36.190> was<00:04:36.460> saying<00:04:36.730> was<00:04:37.030> written<00:04:37.270> to

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
of what Paul was saying was written to

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.330 
of what Paul was saying was written to
these<00:04:37.510> cultures<00:04:37.990> that<00:04:38.110> absolutely<00:04:38.920> did<00:04:39.160> not

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
these cultures that absolutely did not

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.580 
these cultures that absolutely did not
recognize<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.090> value<00:04:40.210> of<00:04:40.510> women<00:04:40.690> at<00:04:40.990> all<00:04:41.050> and

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
recognize the value of women at all and

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.920 
recognize the value of women at all and
so<00:04:42.310> just<00:04:42.700> keep<00:04:42.940> it<00:04:43.090> as<00:04:43.180> a<00:04:43.210> blanket<00:04:43.630> statement

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
so just keep it as a blanket statement

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.420 
so just keep it as a blanket statement
when<00:04:44.290> you're<00:04:44.410> reading<00:04:44.590> through<00:04:44.950> and<00:04:45.130> things

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
when you're reading through and things

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.220 
when you're reading through and things
about<00:04:45.730> questions<00:04:46.300> about<00:04:46.570> gender<00:04:46.930> and

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
about questions about gender and

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.260 
about questions about gender and
equality<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:48.040> you<00:04:48.310> know<00:04:48.430> just<00:04:48.760> keep<00:04:49.120> that<00:04:49.210> in

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
equality and you know just keep that in

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.510 
equality and you know just keep that in
