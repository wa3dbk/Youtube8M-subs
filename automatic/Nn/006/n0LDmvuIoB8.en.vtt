00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.190
 students of avans university communication multimedia design in breda 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.060
 we have made training games for employees of sint in the last 8 weeks 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.219
 elizabeth hospital in tilburg 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.499
 for the hospital the knowledge and skills are better tied to a 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:18.189
 interactive form of learning the assignment is to use a co-scenario 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:19.429
 make the serious game 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.159
 very simple but ultimately also very complex because there are so many things 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:24.319
 come and take a look 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:26.810
 computer games to simulate reality 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.029
 those are actually the series of games 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.860
 24 call students from the so-called school have the last 8 weeks 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.860
 games made for St Elizabeth Hospital in Tilburg 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.760
 similarly in johan on canvas 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.910
 dorine and nec but the move makes a kiss as pretty as a kiss 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.100
 apply as possible 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.220
 So find other ways to tie the patient and not and whether yes 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.440
 if you give them the booty they need that of protection and free becker mate 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.510
 To apply to the patients he has covered the discussion said hope to 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.290
 this claim 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.060
 that afterwards she thinks she can do this and not just man like the 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.430
 to be informed 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.450
 Suppose they also do other things 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.360
 can use to help people 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.159
 takes the time for a taxi 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.750
 and after that it's a sport and the like 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.190
 the mole that can scare you 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.890
 and that I have on percent 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.960
 then you walk a bit on the sister during a kind of interface 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.300
 and then you have to make a choice of what caneke the swedish band can do 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.170
 because the family are going to call 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.110
 but I also get contact from the local percent 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.160
 and thereby read in the sister from Rotterdam 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.670
 actually have a lot to say 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.350
 the fool that the right choices 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.280
 check the training's langenberg communication trainer 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.690
 and research center of St Elizabeth Hospital 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.320
 was surprised by the quality there were very surprised by the originality and 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.630
 we are actually very happy that webber avans have asked for 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.730
 to do this because yes we have always proved ideal of the 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.680
 assistance and here are a lot of computer science students with a whole 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.910
 fresh look at the hospital and most 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.590
 I have to say that with us he even has my energy in 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.780
 at least how students instruct their card to do something 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.750
 develop is also going to be used 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.780
 they run harder in a certain sense because 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.449
 we have noticed and have done a front portal for mopeds 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.999
 that was the wish for an external client to start doing a real one 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.239
 busy in the world 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.559
 it's all about echoes when it comes to extra motivation 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:24.380
 and 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.419
 I have to say 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:27.499
 what I have not seen 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.499
 and the time they were given for that 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.360
 also with the winners 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.849
 it will continue to develop 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.080
 we are going to make a case for it, and danny has just finished years that was good too 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.929
 see 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:42.279
 given the assignment 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.749
 also almost impossible for you to know that someone is actually completely finished 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.209
 rounds so that they can be completed 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.090
 and start using nature
