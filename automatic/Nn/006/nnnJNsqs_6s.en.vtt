00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.060 
big moment
huge<00:01:42.060> huge<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:43.260> I<00:01:43.290> only<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.800> pull<00:01:43.920> one

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.290 
huge huge that I only have to pull one
match<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> watch<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.030> other<00:01:45.150> girls

play<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> lanes<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.260> kind<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.530> get<00:01:46.650> an

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
play the lanes and kind of get an

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.190 
play the lanes and kind of get an
insight<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.130> what's<00:01:47.460> happening<00:01:47.910> and<00:01:48.150> then<00:01:48.990> go

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
insight to what's happening and then go

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.690 
insight to what's happening and then go
from<00:01:49.320> there<00:01:49.500> because<00:01:49.800> that's<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.280> quickest

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
from there because that's the quickest

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.180 
from there because that's the quickest
game<00:01:50.940> of<00:01:51.350> anyone's<00:01:52.350> bowling<00:01:52.740> career<00:01:52.950> once

they<00:01:53.340> get<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.580> TV<00:01:53.790> I'm<00:01:54.240> kind<00:01:54.480> of<00:01:54.540> hoping<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
they get on TV I'm kind of hoping the

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.090 
they get on TV I'm kind of hoping the
outcome<00:01:54.900> will<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.440> little<00:01:55.710> bit<00:01:55.800> different

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
outcome will be a little bit different

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.740 
outcome will be a little bit different
this<00:01:56.220> time<00:01:56.280> I'm<00:01:56.790> sure<00:01:57.060> she<00:01:57.300> wants<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.720> be

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
this time I'm sure she wants it to be

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.240 
this time I'm sure she wants it to be
the<00:01:57.930> same<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.590> know<00:01:58.650> we<00:01:58.770> had<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.920> good<00:01:59.070> time

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the same but you know we had a good time

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.280 
the same but you know we had a good time
I<00:01:59.490> think<00:01:59.970> actually<00:02:00.150> it's<00:02:00.660> gonna<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.050> lot<00:02:01.170> of

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
I think actually it's gonna be a lot of

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.750 
I think actually it's gonna be a lot of
fun<00:02:01.470> I<00:02:01.620> mean<00:02:01.770> I'm<00:02:01.890> at<00:02:02.160> a<00:02:02.190> whole<00:02:02.370> different<00:02:02.640> part

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
fun I mean I'm at a whole different part

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.170 
fun I mean I'm at a whole different part
of<00:02:02.880> my<00:02:02.940> point<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.540> my<00:02:03.630> life<00:02:03.660> and<00:02:04.260> I<00:02:05.030> you<00:02:06.030> know<00:02:06.150> I

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
performed in a lot of matches when I

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.650 
performed in a lot of matches when I
needed<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.070> throw<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.700> really<00:02:09.090> did<00:02:09.270> throw<00:02:09.509> it

a<00:02:11.580> bike<00:02:11.700> that's<00:02:11.970> what<00:02:12.090> I'm<00:02:12.180> hoping<00:02:12.270> anyway<00:02:12.780> it

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
a bike that's what I'm hoping anyway it

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.500 
a bike that's what I'm hoping anyway it
means<00:02:13.350> everything<00:02:13.770> we<00:02:13.890> take<00:02:14.070> advantage<00:02:14.510> of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
means everything we take advantage of

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.870 
means everything we take advantage of
the<00:02:15.600> situations<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.470> we<00:02:17.310> have<00:02:17.550> right<00:02:17.760> now

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
the situations that we have right now

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.220 
the situations that we have right now
because<00:02:18.060> we<00:02:18.270> don't<00:02:18.420> get<00:02:18.570> very<00:02:18.600> many<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.050> them

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
because we don't get very many of them

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.740 
because we don't get very many of them
so<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:20.550> have<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.760> chance<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:21.300> win<00:02:21.480> another
