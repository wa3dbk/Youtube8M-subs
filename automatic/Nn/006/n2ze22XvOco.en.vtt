00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
got enough pace to essentially run

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.080

I just used the right trigger button to

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.450 
I just used the right trigger button to
sprint<00:02:00.420> through<00:02:00.689> teams<00:02:01.020> he<00:02:01.530> has<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.829> pace<00:02:02.219> to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
sprint through teams he has the pace to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.830 
sprint through teams he has the pace to
do<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.880> guys<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.450> very<00:02:03.719> very

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
do that guys and it's very very

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.200 
do that guys and it's very very
effective<00:02:04.710> when<00:02:05.219> he<00:02:05.310> hits<00:02:05.490> his<00:02:05.640> top<00:02:05.850> sprint

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
effective when he hits his top sprint

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.270 
effective when he hits his top sprint
speed<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.869> hard<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.290> catch<00:02:07.619> him<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.129> know

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
the goal to finish that run is very

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.040

disappointing<00:02:14.190> guys<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.030> he<00:02:15.090> did<00:02:15.270> let<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.870> few

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
disappointing guys and he did let a few

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.680 
disappointing guys and he did let a few
goals<00:02:16.320> slip<00:02:16.710> in<00:02:16.950> those<00:02:17.370> situations<00:02:18.240> for<00:02:18.480> me

now<00:02:19.050> going<00:02:19.320> into<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.530> weakness<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.670> found

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
now going into the weakness that I found

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.770 
now going into the weakness that I found
to<00:02:22.020> be<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.170> biggest<00:02:22.800> by<00:02:22.980> far<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.540> his

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
to be the biggest by far and that is his

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.380 
to be the biggest by far and that is his
strength<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.740> his<00:02:26.130> strength<00:02:26.430> really<00:02:27.120> was<00:02:27.360> a

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
strength is his strength really was a

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.600 
strength is his strength really was a
bit<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.930> weakness<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.680> me<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:28.860> did<00:02:29.220> find<00:02:29.520> that

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
bit of a weakness for me I did find that

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.120 
bit of a weakness for me I did find that
on<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.240> lot<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.930> occasions<00:02:31.380> guys<00:02:31.590> he<00:02:31.770> had<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
on a lot of occasions guys he had the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.070 
on a lot of occasions guys he had the
pace<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.730> catch<00:02:33.090> up<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.450> pretty<00:02:33.780> much

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080

fantastic<00:05:00.660> as<00:05:00.780> well<00:05:00.840> I<00:05:01.260> mean<00:05:01.560> comparing<00:05:02.130> the

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
fantastic as well I mean comparing the

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.970 
fantastic as well I mean comparing the
cards<00:05:02.580> from<00:05:02.700> FIFA<00:05:03.000> 15<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.540> FIFA<00:05:03.840> 14<00:05:03.990> I<00:05:04.470> think

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
short pass in long passing was pretty

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.430 
short pass in long passing was pretty
decent<00:05:14.940> with<00:05:15.300> this<00:05:15.420> card<00:05:15.690> and<00:05:15.900> his<00:05:15.990> tackling

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
abilities in general for me were

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.670

ridiculous<00:05:18.930> you've<00:05:19.080> got<00:05:19.230> to<00:05:19.320> center<00:05:19.590> back

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
know be a brick wall in defense

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.510 
know be a brick wall in defense
basically<00:05:25.110> and<00:05:25.530> I<00:05:25.620> felt<00:05:25.950> that<00:05:26.040> you<00:05:26.250> know<00:05:26.370> is

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
basically and I felt that you know is

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.790 
basically and I felt that you know is
standing<00:05:26.880> tackle<00:05:27.030> was<00:05:27.360> awesome<00:05:27.780> albeit<00:05:28.620> his

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
standing tackle was awesome albeit his

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.830 
standing tackle was awesome albeit his
strength<00:05:29.100> did<00:05:29.370> come<00:05:29.610> into<00:05:29.850> play<00:05:30.150> on<00:05:30.180> occasion

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
strength did come into play on occasion

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.660 
strength did come into play on occasion
but<00:05:30.990> in<00:05:31.200> general<00:05:31.380> it<00:05:31.740> was<00:05:31.830> half<00:05:32.040> decent<00:05:32.250> for<00:05:32.580> me

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
but in general it was half decent for me

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.300 
but in general it was half decent for me
and<00:05:32.850> a<00:05:32.910> sliding<00:05:33.360> tackle<00:05:33.780> was<00:05:34.290> very<00:05:34.590> strong<00:05:34.980> for

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
and a sliding tackle was very strong for

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.100 
and a sliding tackle was very strong for
me<00:05:35.430> as<00:05:35.610> well<00:05:35.670> now<00:05:36.180> final<00:05:36.630> thoughts<00:05:36.810> on<00:05:36.990> the
