pointed ends so that I'm in 50/50 it's a
bit<00:00:28.410> more<00:00:28.560> balanced<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.340> kind<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.580> helps

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
bit more balanced so it kind of helps

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.060

with<00:00:30.000> these<00:00:30.150> tricks<00:00:30.679> but<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.769> could<00:00:31.890> easily

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
do this on a regular board but I would

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.299 
do this on a regular board but I would
recommend<00:00:33.870> using<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.739> an<00:00:34.829> old<00:00:35.010> board

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
recommend using this on an old board

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.490 
recommend using this on an old board

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
closest to the tail board I'm gonna take

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.190 
closest to the tail board I'm gonna take
that<00:01:44.670> away<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.960> we're<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
that away and just so that we're on the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.190 
that away and just so that we're on the
same<00:01:46.320> page<00:01:46.530> my<00:01:47.220> front<00:01:47.610> foot<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.540> half<00:01:48.930> on

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
same page my front foot is like half on

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.469 
same page my front foot is like half on
the<00:01:49.380> board<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.829> half<00:01:50.100> off<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.640> board<00:01:50.880> it's

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the board and half off the board it's

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.569 
the board and half off the board it's
kind<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.560> right<00:01:52.920> here<00:01:53.130> where<00:01:53.310> it's

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
kind of like this right here where it's

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.770 
kind of like this right here where it's
kind<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.759> touching<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.180> ground<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.540> little<00:01:54.659> bit

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
kind of touching the ground a little bit

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.420 
kind of touching the ground a little bit
and<00:01:55.049> what's<00:01:55.500> good<00:01:55.649> about<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.130> if<00:01:56.310> your

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
and what's good about that is if your

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.459 
and what's good about that is if your
foot<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.670> more<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.360> nose<00:01:57.540> yet<00:01:58.140> more<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.380> a

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
foot is more on the nose yet more of a

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.080 
foot is more on the nose yet more of a
potential<00:01:58.920> let<00:01:59.009> slip<00:01:59.219> out<00:01:59.399> that's<00:01:59.939> why<00:02:00.060> I

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
potential let slip out that's why I

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.490 
potential let slip out that's why I
recommend<00:02:00.270> from<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.719> beginners<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.290> have

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
recommend from the beginners to have

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.380 
recommend from the beginners to have
just<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.860> little<00:02:02.009> bit<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.369> your<00:02:02.549> foot<00:02:02.790> touching

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
just a little bit of your foot touching

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.969 
just a little bit of your foot touching
the<00:02:03.450> ground<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.530> will<00:02:04.649> be<00:02:04.799> less

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
the ground so that you will be less

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.440 
the ground so that you will be less
prone<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.399> slipping<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.090> right<00:02:06.270> now<00:02:06.390> you

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
prone to slipping so right now you

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.330 
prone to slipping so right now you
should<00:02:06.689> be<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.110> we're<00:02:07.979> gonna<00:02:08.069> do<00:02:08.190> now

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
should be like this we're gonna do now

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.419 
should be like this we're gonna do now
is<00:02:08.369> going<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> little<00:02:09.360> hop<00:02:09.539> with<00:02:09.959> your

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
is going to do a little hop with your

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.610 
is going to do a little hop with your
foot<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.299> you<00:02:11.420> do<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:11.750> transferring

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
foot so that you do this transferring

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.740 
foot so that you do this transferring
and<00:02:13.189> you<00:02:13.489> honestly<00:02:13.790> don't<00:02:14.030> jump<00:02:14.299> that<00:02:14.329> high<00:02:14.569> at

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
and you honestly don't jump that high at

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.089 
and you honestly don't jump that high at
all<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.079> just<00:02:15.260> do<00:02:15.379> a<00:02:15.409> little<00:02:15.500> jump<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.069> that

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
all you just do a little jump so that

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.039 
all you just do a little jump so that
you<00:02:16.280> can<00:02:16.430> switch<00:02:16.670> over<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.390> as<00:02:17.599> you<00:02:17.750> jump<00:02:17.930> we

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
you can switch over and as you jump we

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.660 
you can switch over and as you jump we
got<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.260> take<00:02:18.379> your<00:02:18.469> board<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.920> just<00:02:19.340> push<00:02:19.640> it

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670

over to your other hand it's really that

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.059 
over to your other hand it's really that
simple

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
simple

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.890 
simple
you<00:02:22.219> just<00:02:22.400> move<00:02:22.969> it<00:02:23.090> over<00:02:23.180> you're<00:02:23.629> kind<00:02:23.840> of

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
you just move it over you're kind of

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.750 
you just move it over you're kind of
like<00:02:24.079> handing<00:02:24.439> the<00:02:24.530> board<00:02:24.739> off<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:25.519> your<00:02:25.609> other

like handing the board off to your other
hand<00:02:25.879> and<00:02:26.209> when<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.569> grab<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.900> your<00:02:27.019> fingers

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
hand and when you grab it your fingers

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.170 
hand and when you grab it your fingers
will<00:02:27.500> be<00:02:27.620> on<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.769> grip<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.159> your<00:02:28.340> thumb<00:02:28.609> will

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
will be on the grip and your thumb will

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.089 
will be on the grip and your thumb will
be<00:02:29.209> on<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.629> graphic<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:30.079> the<00:02:30.109> board<00:02:30.349> and<00:02:30.980> when

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
be on the graphic of the board and when

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.170 
be on the graphic of the board and when
you<00:02:31.189> catch<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.549> board<00:02:31.700> make<00:02:31.909> sure<00:02:32.030> that

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
you catch the board make sure that

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.360 
you catch the board make sure that
you're<00:02:32.329> in<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.599> good<00:02:32.629> angle<00:02:33.019> like<00:02:33.469> this<00:02:33.500> you

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
you're in a good angle like this you

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.190 
you're in a good angle like this you
don't<00:02:34.459> wanna<00:02:34.639> be<00:02:34.730> too<00:02:34.939> vertical<00:02:35.359> or<00:02:35.750> your<00:02:36.049> back

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
don't wanna be too vertical or your back

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.289 
don't wanna be too vertical or your back
foot<00:02:36.469> will<00:02:36.650> just<00:02:36.799> push<00:02:37.040> this<00:02:37.250> down<00:02:37.549> causing

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
foot will just push this down causing

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.720 
foot will just push this down causing
board<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.769> you<00:02:39.920> don't<00:02:40.069> want<00:02:40.189> to<00:02:40.250> go<00:02:40.340> too<00:02:40.400> far

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
board and you don't want to go too far

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.250 
board and you don't want to go too far
down<00:02:40.790> because<00:02:41.269> you'll<00:02:41.450> have<00:02:41.599> a<00:02:41.659> lot<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:41.930> force

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
down because you'll have a lot of force

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.479 
down because you'll have a lot of force
on<00:02:42.439> the<00:02:42.500> hands<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.010> I'll<00:02:43.159> be<00:02:43.280> pretty

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
on the hands and I'll be pretty

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.800 
on the hands and I'll be pretty
uncomfortable<00:02:43.700> so<00:02:44.450> right<00:02:44.569> here<00:02:44.720> will

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
uncomfortable so right here will

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.059 
uncomfortable so right here will
probably<00:02:44.900> be<00:02:45.139> the<00:02:45.230> best<00:02:45.470> angle<00:02:45.799> to<00:02:45.829> catch

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
probably be the best angle to catch

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.379 
probably be the best angle to catch
because<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.489> won't<00:02:46.579> have<00:02:46.700> that<00:02:46.939> much<00:02:47.090> force

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
because you won't have that much force

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:48.729 
because you won't have that much force
turned<00:02:47.599> hands<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.139> you'll<00:02:48.439> be<00:02:48.560> pretty

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
turned hands and you'll be pretty

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.319 
turned hands and you'll be pretty
comfortable<00:02:49.189> too<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.669> also<00:02:49.819> remember<00:02:50.209> that

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
your weight does not move throughout the

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.920 
your weight does not move throughout the

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:55.939 
trick my weight is right here and as I

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.059 
trick my weight is right here and as I
transferred<00:02:56.450> I<00:02:56.659> just<00:02:57.169> stay<00:02:57.439> in<00:02:57.709> this<00:02:57.799> one

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
transferred I just stay in this one

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.849 
transferred I just stay in this one
place<00:02:58.280> like<00:02:59.239> this<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.840> my<00:03:00.349> weight<00:03:00.530> will<00:03:00.680> end

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
place like this and my weight will end

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.449 
place like this and my weight will end
up<00:03:01.010> on<00:03:01.189> this<00:03:01.459> truck<00:03:01.760> right<00:03:01.909> here<00:03:02.230> like<00:03:03.230> that

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
up on this truck right here like that

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.159 
up on this truck right here like that
once<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.579> cast<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.939> board<00:03:05.120> at<00:03:05.299> an<00:03:05.419> angle<00:03:05.719> your

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.169 
once you cast the board at an angle your

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:07.929 
once you cast the board at an angle your
back<00:03:06.349> foot<00:03:06.590> will<00:03:06.709> immediately<00:03:06.980> follow<00:03:07.489> after

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
back foot will immediately follow after

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.959 
back foot will immediately follow after
that<00:03:07.969> and<00:03:08.299> my<00:03:08.810> back<00:03:08.989> foot<00:03:09.019> lands<00:03:09.799> solid<00:03:10.730> on<00:03:10.879> the

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:10.969 
that and my back foot lands solid on the

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.300 
that and my back foot lands solid on the
truck<00:03:11.209> it's<00:03:11.659> not<00:03:11.870> like<00:03:12.049> right<00:03:12.290> here<00:03:12.620> or<00:03:13.129> it's

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
truck it's not like right here or it's

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.099 
truck it's not like right here or it's
not<00:03:13.459> here<00:03:13.790> because<00:03:14.269> if<00:03:14.389> you<00:03:14.419> end<00:03:14.629> on<00:03:14.840> this

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
not here because if you end on this

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.349 
not here because if you end on this
wheel<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.859> board<00:03:16.099> will<00:03:16.220> go<00:03:16.250> this<00:03:16.489> way<00:03:16.549> and<00:03:16.760> if

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
wheel the board will go this way and if

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.460 
wheel the board will go this way and if
you<00:03:17.419> went<00:03:17.629> right<00:03:17.780> here<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.139> board<00:03:18.319> will<00:03:18.440> go

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
you went right here the board will go

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.500 
you went right here the board will go
that<00:03:18.769> way<00:03:18.979> so<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.489> just<00:03:19.579> won't<00:03:19.760> be<00:03:19.849> solid<00:03:20.359> on

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
that way so you just won't be solid on

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.240 
that way so you just won't be solid on
the<00:03:20.599> board<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.139> also<00:03:21.260> what<00:03:21.500> may<00:03:21.680> help<00:03:21.799> is<00:03:22.040> have

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
the board and also what may help is have

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.460 
the board and also what may help is have
your<00:03:22.430> foot<00:03:22.609> a<00:03:22.639> little<00:03:22.790> bit<00:03:22.909> inwards<00:03:23.299> I<00:03:23.569> just

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
your foot a little bit inwards I just

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.140 
your foot a little bit inwards I just
noticed<00:03:24.739> that<00:03:24.799> I<00:03:24.889> kind<00:03:25.159> of<00:03:25.220> have<00:03:25.370> my<00:03:25.400> 50/50

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
noticed that I kind of have my 50/50

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.479 
noticed that I kind of have my 50/50
back<00:03:26.689> foot<00:03:26.959> like<00:03:27.139> this<00:03:27.319> a<00:03:27.530> little<00:03:27.709> bit<00:03:27.889> so<00:03:28.340> if

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
back foot like this a little bit so if

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.069 
back foot like this a little bit so if
you<00:03:28.579> want<00:03:28.699> to<00:03:28.790> try<00:03:28.909> that<00:03:29.090> all<00:03:29.599> right<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:29.840> now

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
you want to try that all right so now

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.899 
you want to try that all right so now
you<00:03:30.139> should<00:03:30.319> be<00:03:30.349> like<00:03:30.500> this<00:03:30.680> where<00:03:31.579> your<00:03:31.699> front

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:31.909 
you should be like this where your front

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.219 
you should be like this where your front
foot<00:03:32.090> is<00:03:32.569> in<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.780> air

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:33.229 
foot is in the air

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:35.319 
foot is in the air
it's<00:03:33.379> just<00:03:33.530> chilling<00:03:33.919> it<00:03:34.129> helps<00:03:34.970> you<00:03:35.090> keep

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
it's just chilling it helps you keep

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.240 
it's just chilling it helps you keep
balance<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.019> now<00:03:36.650> you<00:03:36.709> should<00:03:36.919> be<00:03:36.949> ready<00:03:37.189> to

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
balance and now you should be ready to

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.339 
balance and now you should be ready to
transfer<00:03:38.000> back<00:03:38.150> in<00:03:38.389> now<00:03:38.870> there<00:03:39.019> are<00:03:39.109> two<00:03:39.319> ways

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
transfer back in now there are two ways

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.469 
transfer back in now there are two ways
to<00:03:39.530> land<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:39.979> trick<00:03:40.220> one<00:03:40.819> will<00:03:41.000> be<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.269> just

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:41.479 
to land the trick one will be to just

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:42.939 
to land the trick one will be to just
push<00:03:41.689> it<00:03:41.840> over<00:03:42.049> with<00:03:42.259> your<00:03:42.379> hands<00:03:42.680> like<00:03:42.919> this

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
push it over with your hands like this

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:47.050 
push it over with your hands like this
and<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:44.780> other<00:03:44.930> way<00:03:45.109> would<00:03:45.530> be<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.979> do<00:03:46.699> a<00:03:46.729> half

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
and the other way would be to do a half

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.629 
and the other way would be to do a half
finger<00:03:47.449> flip<00:03:47.659> like<00:03:48.259> this<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.979> go<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.430> heel

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
finger flip like this and go the heel

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.599 
finger flip like this and go the heel
foot<00:03:49.849> direction<00:03:50.299> and<00:03:50.629> the<00:03:51.019> transfer<00:03:51.409> over<00:03:51.609> was

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
foot direction and the transfer over was

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.520 
foot direction and the transfer over was
my<00:03:52.819> first<00:03:53.389> transfer<00:03:53.750> I<00:03:53.810> learned<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:56.379> it's<00:03:57.379> the

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
my first transfer I learned and it's the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.439 
my first transfer I learned and it's the
easiest<00:03:57.799> to<00:03:57.979> do<00:03:58.159> what's<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:58.729> hardest<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.239> land

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
easiest to do what's the hardest to land

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.140 
easiest to do what's the hardest to land
so<00:03:59.930> how<00:04:00.229> to<00:04:00.290> do<00:04:00.439> that<00:04:00.590> transfer<00:04:00.859> is<00:04:01.220> you'll<00:04:02.120> be

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
so how to do that transfer is you'll be

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.520 
so how to do that transfer is you'll be
in<00:04:02.299> your<00:04:02.329> regular<00:04:02.479> position<00:04:02.750> like<00:04:03.109> this<00:04:03.290> and

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
in your regular position like this and

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.349 
in your regular position like this and
you're<00:04:04.099> going<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.280> start<00:04:04.519> leaning<00:04:04.729> away<00:04:05.030> from

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
you're going to start leaning away from

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.270 
you're going to start leaning away from
the<00:04:05.689> board<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.109> the<00:04:06.590> board<00:04:06.769> is<00:04:06.859> going<00:04:06.979> to<00:04:07.040> come

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
the board and the board is going to come

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.369 
the board and the board is going to come
towards<00:04:07.729> you<00:04:07.849> and<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.750> reason<00:04:09.019> why<00:04:09.109> you<00:04:09.169> want

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
towards you and the reason why you want

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.649 
towards you and the reason why you want
to<00:04:09.439> lean<00:04:09.590> back<00:04:09.829> is<00:04:10.069> that<00:04:10.609> when<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.449> board

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
to lean back is that when the board

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.080 
to lean back is that when the board
transfers<00:04:12.199> over<00:04:12.560> it's<00:04:13.099> going<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.430> be<00:04:13.579> right

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
transfers over it's going to be right

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.659 
transfers over it's going to be right
here<00:04:14.449> so<00:04:14.959> you<00:04:15.019> do<00:04:15.199> not<00:04:15.409> want<00:04:15.739> to<00:04:15.949> stay<00:04:16.430> in<00:04:16.609> the

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
here so you do not want to stay in the

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.219 
here so you do not want to stay in the
same<00:04:16.849> spot<00:04:17.090> so<00:04:17.539> we're<00:04:17.659> going<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:17.840> do<00:04:17.959> is<00:04:18.079> going

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
same spot so we're going to do is going

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.660 
same spot so we're going to do is going
to<00:04:18.320> take<00:04:18.409> your<00:04:18.590> back<00:04:18.889> foot

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
to take your back foot

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.100 
to take your back foot
and<00:04:19.760> you're<00:04:19.910> going<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.180> move<00:04:20.360> it<00:04:20.450> back<00:04:20.600> and

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110 
and you're going to move it back and

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.770 
and you're going to move it back and
this<00:04:22.040> will<00:04:22.250> give<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.850> board<00:04:23.060> room<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.540> fold

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
this will give the board room to fold

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.270 
this will give the board room to fold
down<00:04:23.990> and<00:04:24.290> as<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.560> board<00:04:24.770> is<00:04:24.860> transferring

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
down and as the board is transferring

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.370 
down and as the board is transferring
over<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:26.030> want<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.270> look<00:04:26.450> at<00:04:26.630> these<00:04:26.810> back

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
over you want to look at these back

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.870 
over you want to look at these back
bolts<00:04:27.650> right<00:04:27.890> here<00:04:28.100> because<00:04:28.460> this<00:04:28.580> is<00:04:28.730> where

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
bolts right here because this is where

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.030 
bolts right here because this is where
you<00:04:28.970> want<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.270> back<00:04:29.420> put<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.660> land<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.680> when<00:04:30.920> it

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
you want to back put the land so when it

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.820 
you want to back put the land so when it
starts<00:04:31.130> to<00:04:31.340> go<00:04:31.460> over<00:04:31.490> I<00:04:31.910> just<00:04:32.450> follow<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:33.050> and

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
starts to go over I just follow it and

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.200 
starts to go over I just follow it and
the<00:04:34.010> next<00:04:34.280> type<00:04:34.400> of<00:04:34.430> landing<00:04:34.790> is<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.060> half

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
the next type of landing is the half

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.020 
the next type of landing is the half
finger<00:04:35.450> flip<00:04:35.690> which<00:04:36.230> is<00:04:36.380> like<00:04:36.530> this<00:04:36.880> which<00:04:37.880> is

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
finger flip which is like this which is

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.460 
finger flip which is like this which is
personally<00:04:38.450> my<00:04:38.690> favorite<00:04:39.080> way<00:04:39.200> to<00:04:39.230> land

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
personally my favorite way to land

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.070 
personally my favorite way to land
because<00:04:39.920> when<00:04:40.760> you<00:04:40.850> do<00:04:40.970> land<00:04:41.210> it<00:04:41.390> it's<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:41.930> lot

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
because when you do land it it's a lot

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.480 
because when you do land it it's a lot
more<00:04:42.260> comfortable<00:04:42.500> but<00:04:43.100> it<00:04:43.190> might<00:04:43.340> be<00:04:43.460> a

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
more comfortable but it might be a

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.830 
more comfortable but it might be a
little<00:04:43.580> tricky<00:04:43.970> for<00:04:44.000> some<00:04:44.360> of<00:04:44.480> you<00:04:44.570> when<00:04:44.780> you

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
little tricky for some of you when you

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.300 
little tricky for some of you when you
first<00:04:44.960> started<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:45.500> what<00:04:46.010> you're<00:04:46.130> going<00:04:46.220> to

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
first started and what you're going to

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.190 
first started and what you're going to
do<00:04:46.460> to<00:04:46.760> get<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.240> half<00:04:47.480> flip<00:04:47.690> is<00:04:47.960> you're<00:04:48.110> just

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
do to get that half flip is you're just

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.420 
do to get that half flip is you're just
going<00:04:48.290> to<00:04:48.410> jump<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.680> little<00:04:48.800> bit<00:04:48.920> and<00:04:49.220> you've

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
going to jump a little bit and you've

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.030 
going to jump a little bit and you've
got<00:04:49.550> twists<00:04:49.850> or<00:04:50.030> wrists<00:04:50.500> so<00:04:51.500> that<00:04:51.530> it<00:04:51.860> half

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
got twists or wrists so that it half

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.590 
got twists or wrists so that it half
hooks<00:04:52.250> over<00:04:52.370> and<00:04:52.880> make<00:04:53.060> sure<00:04:53.150> that<00:04:53.270> you<00:04:53.360> jump

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
hooks over and make sure that you jump

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.330 
hooks over and make sure that you jump
first<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.140> then<00:04:54.320> twist<00:04:54.650> your<00:04:54.710> hand<00:04:54.950> because

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
first and then twist your hand because

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.250 
first and then twist your hand because
if<00:04:55.460> your<00:04:55.580> foot<00:04:56.000> is<00:04:56.030> already<00:04:56.300> on<00:04:56.540> here<00:04:56.810> and<00:04:56.990> you

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
if your foot is already on here and you

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.200 
if your foot is already on here and you
start<00:04:57.500> to<00:04:57.560> twist<00:04:57.770> it<00:04:58.040> might<00:04:58.250> partner<00:04:58.880> a<00:04:58.970> wrist

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
start to twist it might partner a wrist

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.060 
start to twist it might partner a wrist
a<00:04:59.330> little<00:04:59.450> bit<00:04:59.660> so<00:04:59.930> I<00:04:59.960> wouldn't<00:05:00.440> do<00:05:00.680> that<00:05:00.710> at

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
a little bit so I wouldn't do that at

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.390 
a little bit so I wouldn't do that at
all

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
all

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.220 
all
once<00:05:01.730> the<00:05:01.820> board<00:05:02.030> starts<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.420> rotate<00:05:02.540> what<00:05:03.200> I

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
once the board starts to rotate what I

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.810 
once the board starts to rotate what I
like<00:05:03.380> to<00:05:03.470> do<00:05:03.560> is<00:05:03.680> look<00:05:03.860> at<00:05:03.980> my<00:05:04.100> front<00:05:04.310> truck<00:05:04.610> and

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
like to do is look at my front truck and

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.910 
like to do is look at my front truck and
to<00:05:05.480> look<00:05:05.630> at<00:05:05.750> my<00:05:05.840> front<00:05:06.020> bolts<00:05:06.350> as<00:05:06.470> well<00:05:06.650> and

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
to look at my front bolts as well and

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.310

and that's really all there is to it for
the<00:05:16.670> 50/50<00:05:17.180> sin<00:05:17.390> and<00:05:17.660> how<00:05:18.260> I<00:05:18.290> would<00:05:18.530> go<00:05:18.830> about

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
the 50/50 sin and how I would go about

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.860
