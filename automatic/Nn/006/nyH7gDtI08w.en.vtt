00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
generation for gaming some people even

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.529 
generation for gaming some people even
so<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.379> was<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.739> worst<00:00:44.040> generation<00:00:44.940> of

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
seventh generation was so bad now the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.660 
seventh generation was so bad now the
seventh<00:01:12.299> generation<00:01:12.540> was<00:01:13.530> my<00:01:13.740> introduction

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
seventh generation was my introduction

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.840 
seventh generation was my introduction
to<00:01:15.240> online<00:01:15.590> gameplay<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:17.640> my

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
to online gameplay it was my

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.800 
to online gameplay it was my
introduction<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:19.009> HD<00:01:20.009> gaming<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.270> things

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
like that so maybe I have a different

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.469 
like that so maybe I have a different
approach<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> seventh<00:01:26.100> generation<00:01:26.479> but

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
approach to the seventh generation but

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.780 
approach to the seventh generation but

without having my 360 at that time

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.900

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
or it wasn't that good we would have

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.600 
or it wasn't that good we would have
been<00:02:19.940> running<00:02:20.240> out<00:02:20.330> shelling<00:02:20.840> out<00:02:20.960> more<00:02:21.230> money

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
for broke hardware that we knew was

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.850

going<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.950> break<00:02:25.220> again<00:02:25.970> but<00:02:26.600> we<00:02:26.720> still<00:02:27.110> pay

i<00:04:39.690> wasn't<00:04:39.870> around<00:04:40.199> for<00:04:40.470> like<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.770> sixth

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
i wasn't around for like the sixth

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:43.219 
i wasn't around for like the sixth
generation<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:42.000> things<00:04:42.539> like<00:04:42.750> that<00:04:42.810> we<00:04:43.080> know

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
generation and things like that we know

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:44.240 
generation and things like that we know
why<00:04:43.409> that's<00:04:43.680> pretty<00:04:43.860> much<00:04:44.039> the<00:04:44.099> only

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
why that's pretty much the only

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.490 
why that's pretty much the only
generation<00:04:44.909> that<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:45.090> I<00:04:45.389> missed<00:04:45.930> since<00:04:46.319> I've

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
generation that I I missed since I've

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.730 
generation that I I missed since I've
been<00:04:46.650> gaming<00:04:47.099> but<00:04:47.970> I<00:04:48.270> like<00:04:49.229> the<00:04:49.259> suburbs

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
been gaming but I like the suburbs

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.580 
been gaming but I like the suburbs
generation<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.819> was<00:04:51.000> great<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:52.229> think<00:04:52.500> the

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
generation it was great and I think the

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.050 
generation it was great and I think the
eighth<00:04:52.740> generation<00:04:52.979> is<00:04:53.460> going<00:04:53.610> to<00:04:53.729> be<00:04:53.789> great

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
eighth generation is going to be great

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.730 
eighth generation is going to be great
shit<00:04:54.389> the<00:04:54.539> eighth<00:04:54.720> generation<00:04:54.960> might<00:04:55.530> not

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
shit the eighth generation might not

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.080 
shit the eighth generation might not
even<00:04:55.889> be<00:04:56.039> as<00:04:56.250> good<00:04:56.430> as<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.699> seventh

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
even be as good as the seventh

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.670 
even be as good as the seventh
generation<00:04:57.300> because<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.139> lot<00:04:58.380> of<00:04:58.409> things

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
generation because a lot of things

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.050 
generation because a lot of things
that's<00:04:58.919> going<00:04:59.069> on<00:04:59.280> now<00:04:59.340> we<00:04:59.759> didn't<00:04:59.940> already

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
generation was because that was my first

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.010 
generation was because that was my first
time<00:05:08.370> getting<00:05:08.639> online<00:05:08.970> that<00:05:09.690> was<00:05:09.810> my

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030
