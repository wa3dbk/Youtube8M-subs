00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.650
 good afternoon some tasks 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.279
 require compliance with a certain 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.930
 particular algorithm about the structure 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.359
 cuboid 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.240
 At the first lesson is the students 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.099
 great difficulty 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.510
 in order to make this process 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.980
 more interesting you can use one 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:39.059
 from the smart properties of the property record 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.809
 pages start recording building 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.809
 rectangle 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.230
 mark the top 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.600
 and continue building 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.369
 the remaining lines are invisible change the 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.369
 queen 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.790
 finished recording 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.370
 directly in class we can 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.130
 view 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.940
 construction execution algorithm in mode 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.940
 real time 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.200
 the teacher can comment on the construction 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.780
 and watch for the execution of three of three 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.670
 pupils and the same animated slide you 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.210
 can use and on the following 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.560
 lessons 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.410
 and using the pause function 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.400
 stop action 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.400
 comment give explanations
