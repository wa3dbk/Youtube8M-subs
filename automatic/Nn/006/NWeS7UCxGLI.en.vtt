things<00:02:29.720> here<00:02:30.049> already<00:02:30.379> and<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:31.069> was<00:02:31.159> talking

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
things here already and I was talking

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.750 
things here already and I was talking
the<00:02:31.519> whole<00:02:31.610> time<00:02:31.790> but<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:33.590> first<00:02:33.799> one<00:02:34.099> is<00:02:34.129> to

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
the whole time but the first one is to

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.280 
the whole time but the first one is to
practice<00:02:35.239> just<00:02:35.450> flipping<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.870> board<00:02:36.140> and

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
nice fast spin it's super key that you

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.240 
nice fast spin it's super key that you
get<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.400> fast<00:03:05.000> spin<00:03:05.690> because<00:03:06.650> obviously<00:03:06.829> you're

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
get a fast spin because obviously you're

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.530 
get a fast spin because obviously you're
trying<00:03:07.549> to<00:03:07.670> get<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.970> board<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.420> spin

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
trying to get the board to spin

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.360 
trying to get the board to spin
underneath<00:03:09.049> you<00:03:09.409> and<00:03:09.650> you're<00:03:09.889> trying<00:03:10.069> to<00:03:10.220> be

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
underneath you and you're trying to be

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.149 
underneath you and you're trying to be
over<00:03:10.819> it<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:11.599> if<00:03:11.989> the<00:03:12.230> board<00:03:12.470> is<00:03:12.560> spinning<00:03:12.950> too

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
over it so if the board is spinning too

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.190 
over it so if the board is spinning too
slow<00:03:13.519> it's<00:03:14.269> not<00:03:14.480> like<00:03:14.659> you're<00:03:14.870> going<00:03:15.049> to<00:03:15.139> be

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
slow it's not like you're going to be

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.039 
slow it's not like you're going to be
able<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.379> jump<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:15.950> levitate<00:03:16.609> in<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.819> air<00:03:17.049> you

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
able to jump and levitate in the air you

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.990 
able to jump and levitate in the air you
actually<00:03:18.440> need<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.799> board<00:03:19.129> to<00:03:19.250> spin<00:03:19.340> faster

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
actually need the board to spin faster

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.939 
actually need the board to spin faster
so<00:03:20.329> what<00:03:20.690> I<00:03:20.720> recommend<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.349> to<00:03:21.530> change<00:03:21.889> your
