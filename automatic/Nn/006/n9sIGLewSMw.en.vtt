speed<00:01:48.219> so<00:01:49.219> as<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.490> particle<00:01:50.060> approaches<00:01:50.630> the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
speed so as a particle approaches the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.170 
speed so as a particle approaches the
speed<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.289> talk<00:01:51.500> force<00:01:51.829> is<00:01:51.979> reduced<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.609> on

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
speed the talk force is reduced and on

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.910 
speed the talk force is reduced and on
matching<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.689> speed<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.200> force<00:01:54.439> is<00:01:54.530> dropped

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
matching the speed the force is dropped

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.639 
matching the speed the force is dropped
to<00:01:55.039> near<00:01:55.159> zero<00:01:55.630> this<00:01:56.630> option<00:01:56.990> is<00:01:57.229> useful<00:01:57.409> when

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
to near zero this option is useful when

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.709 
to near zero this option is useful when
you<00:01:57.920> want<00:01:57.950> to<00:01:58.250> avoid<00:01:58.729> your<00:01:58.969> particles<00:01:59.390> gaining

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
you want to avoid your particles gaining

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.569 
you want to avoid your particles gaining
too<00:01:59.840> much<00:01:59.869> speed<00:02:00.350> it's<00:02:00.979> basically<00:02:01.340> like<00:02:01.520> a

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
too much speed it's basically like a

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.660 
too much speed it's basically like a
throttle<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.289> when<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:04.039> force<00:02:04.310> actually

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
throttle and when the force actually

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.099 
throttle and when the force actually
realizes<00:02:05.179> that<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.570> achieve<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.899> speed

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
realizes that is to achieve the speed

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.169 
realizes that is to achieve the speed
that<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:06.350> defined<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:07.340> drops<00:02:07.609> the<00:02:07.759> throttle

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
that you defined it drops the throttle

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.359 
that you defined it drops the throttle
down<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.660> basically<00:02:09.259> zero<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:09.830> if<00:02:10.070> it<00:02:10.130> finds

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
down to basically zero and if it finds

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.830 
down to basically zero and if it finds
the<00:02:10.490> particle<00:02:10.940> speed<00:02:11.120> dropping<00:02:11.510> it'll

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
the particle speed dropping it'll

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.820 
the particle speed dropping it'll
actually<00:02:11.930> increase<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.470> throttle<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.800> little

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
actually increase the throttle a little

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.660 
actually increase the throttle a little
bit<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.670> actually<00:02:13.910> keep<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.240> speed<00:02:14.510> up

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
bit to actually keep that speed up

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.590 
bit to actually keep that speed up
reversible<00:02:16.670> which<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.000> can<00:02:17.150> see<00:02:17.270> is<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.450> tick

target<00:02:25.550> revs<00:02:25.730> value<00:02:26.060> is<00:02:26.210> actually<00:02:26.900> treated

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
target revs value is actually treated

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.210 
target revs value is actually treated
just<00:02:27.440> as<00:02:27.560> zero<00:02:29.140> then<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.410> have<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.770> target

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
just as zero then you have the target

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.150 
just as zero then you have the target
red<00:02:31.430> spinner<00:02:31.850> which<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.060> can<00:02:32.210> see<00:02:32.240> below<00:02:32.390> and

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
red spinner which you can see below and

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.970 
red spinner which you can see below and
here<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.250> is<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:35.020> this<00:02:36.020> is<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.320> target<00:02:36.560> speed

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
here it is and this is the target speed

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.200 
here it is and this is the target speed
for<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.220> feedback<00:02:37.430> system<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:38.060> actually

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
for the feedback system to actually

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.320 
for the feedback system to actually
match<00:02:38.710> so<00:02:39.710> what<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.280> basically<00:02:40.460> have<00:02:40.940> is<00:02:41.120> you

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
match so what you basically have is you

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.150 
match so what you basically have is you
have<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.600> basic<00:02:42.170> talk<00:02:42.410> which<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.800> strength

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
have a basic talk which is a strength

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.190 
have a basic talk which is a strength
which<00:02:43.760> is<00:02:43.880> applied<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.360> particles<00:02:45.110> and

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
which is applied to the particles and

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.810 
which is applied to the particles and
this<00:02:45.320> will<00:02:45.440> actually<00:02:45.590> this<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> kind<00:02:46.610> of<00:02:46.700> the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
this will actually this is a kind of the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.150 
this will actually this is a kind of the
grunt<00:02:47.090> of<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.330> motor<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.870> then<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:48.710> have<00:02:48.890> a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
grunt of the motor and then you have a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.430 
grunt of the motor and then you have a
target<00:02:49.610> revs<00:02:50.090> that's<00:02:50.510> how<00:02:50.660> many<00:02:50.840> revolutions

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
target revs that's how many revolutions

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.980 
target revs that's how many revolutions
you<00:02:52.430> actually<00:02:52.580> want<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.000> try<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.300> meet<00:02:53.420> meet

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
you actually want to try and meet meet

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.680 
you actually want to try and meet meet
and<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:55.100> can<00:02:55.790> choose<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.030> actually<00:02:56.480> have

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
and you can choose to actually have

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.210 
and you can choose to actually have
feedback<00:02:56.990> on<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.620> when<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:57.860> meets<00:02:57.980> that

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
feedback on and when it meets that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.270 
feedback on and when it meets that
target<00:02:58.820> revolution<00:02:59.300> speed<00:02:59.450> the<00:03:00.230> talk<00:03:01.010> will<00:03:01.250> be

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
target revolution speed the talk will be

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.340 
target revolution speed the talk will be
dropped<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.940> basically<00:03:02.330> not<00:03:02.630> actually<00:03:03.140> speed

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
dropped to basically not actually speed

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.840 
dropped to basically not actually speed
the<00:03:03.440> particles<00:03:03.830> of<00:03:03.920> beyond<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.340> that

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
the particles of beyond that that

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.890 
the particles of beyond that that
revolutionary<00:03:05.480> rate<00:03:07.240> then<00:03:08.240> we<00:03:08.420> have<00:03:08.630> these

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
revolutionary rate then we have these

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.380 
revolutionary rate then we have these
three<00:03:09.260> measurement<00:03:10.190> system<00:03:10.520> here<00:03:10.790> here<00:03:11.210> and

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
three measurement system here here and

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.800 
three measurement system here here and
there<00:03:12.370> revs<00:03:13.370> per<00:03:13.640> hour<00:03:13.760> which<00:03:14.420> is<00:03:14.570> obviously

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
there revs per hour which is obviously

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.380 
there revs per hour which is obviously
very<00:03:14.900> slow<00:03:15.350> revs<00:03:16.280> per<00:03:16.610> minute<00:03:16.640> which<00:03:17.240> is

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
very slow revs per minute which is

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.000 
very slow revs per minute which is
obviously<00:03:17.630> quite<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.810> bit<00:03:17.960> faster<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.620> revs

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
obviously quite a bit faster and revs

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.500 
obviously quite a bit faster and revs
per<00:03:19.220> second<00:03:19.610> which<00:03:19.820> is<00:03:19.850> obviously<00:03:20.240> a<00:03:20.300> very

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
per second which is obviously a very

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.480 
per second which is obviously a very
fast<00:03:20.750> setting<00:03:21.020> you<00:03:21.980> can<00:03:22.130> use<00:03:22.250> these<00:03:22.460> as

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
fast setting you can use these as

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.130 
fast setting you can use these as
basically<00:03:22.970> multipliers<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.840> value<00:03:24.110> that

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
basically multipliers to the value that

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.050 
basically multipliers to the value that
you've<00:03:24.380> actually<00:03:24.530> said<00:03:24.830> here<00:03:25.100> so<00:03:25.640> obviously

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
you've actually said here so obviously

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.940 
you've actually said here so obviously
if<00:03:26.240> you've<00:03:26.360> set<00:03:26.570> one<00:03:27.260> it'll<00:03:27.680> be<00:03:27.770> one

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
if you've set one it'll be one

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.090 
if you've set one it'll be one
revolution<00:03:28.430> per<00:03:28.460> second<00:03:29.000> or<00:03:29.690> one<00:03:30.620> revolution

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
revolution per second or one revolution

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.430 
revolution per second or one revolution
per<00:03:31.130> middle<00:03:31.460> one<00:03:31.700> revolution<00:03:32.480> per<00:03:32.510> hour<00:03:32.780> so

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
per middle one revolution per hour so

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.810 
per middle one revolution per hour so
basically<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:34.190> can<00:03:34.340> choose<00:03:34.520> whichever

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:16.460 
use a high gain value then in the group

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.460 
use a high gain value then in the group
below<00:04:16.730> we<00:04:17.030> have<00:04:17.060> another<00:04:18.049> group<00:04:18.320> of

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
below we have another group of

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.820 
below we have another group of
parameters<00:04:19.720> which<00:04:20.720> allow<00:04:20.930> us<00:04:21.049> to<00:04:21.200> set<00:04:21.380> up<00:04:21.530> two

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
parameters which allow us to set up two

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.120 
parameters which allow us to set up two
separate<00:04:22.420> pulses<00:04:23.420> in<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.750> actual<00:04:23.960> speed<00:04:24.860> of

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
separate pulses in the actual speed of

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.610 
separate pulses in the actual speed of
our<00:04:25.280> particles<00:04:25.790> rotation<00:04:26.330> you<00:04:27.320> can<00:04:27.470> see

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
our particles rotation you can see

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.980 
our particles rotation you can see
you've<00:04:27.770> got<00:04:27.800> two<00:04:28.130> separate<00:04:28.460> pulses<00:04:28.850> and<00:04:29.060> you

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
you've got two separate pulses and you

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.050 
you've got two separate pulses and you
can<00:04:30.140> see<00:04:30.350> that<00:04:30.380> these<00:04:30.590> can<00:04:30.890> be<00:04:31.040> made<00:04:31.250> to

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
can see that these can be made to

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.670 
can see that these can be made to
make<00:04:32.210> your<00:04:32.360> force<00:04:32.600> grow<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.169> fade<00:04:33.380> over<00:04:33.560> a

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
make your force grow and fade over a

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.950 
make your force grow and fade over a
defined<00:04:34.070> period<00:04:34.330> I'll<00:04:35.330> only<00:04:35.570> define<00:04:35.870> the

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
defined period I'll only define the

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.210 
defined period I'll only define the
parameters<00:04:36.080> for<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.500> first<00:04:36.710> pulse<00:04:36.980> as

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
parameters for the first pulse as

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.570 
parameters for the first pulse as
they're<00:04:37.550> actually<00:04:37.850> repeated<00:04:38.120> in<00:04:38.540> pulse<00:04:38.870> to

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
they're actually repeated in pulse to

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.450 
they're actually repeated in pulse to
first<00:04:40.580> we<00:04:40.820> have<00:04:41.320> an<00:04:42.320> enable<00:04:42.770> tick<00:04:42.950> box<00:04:43.190> and

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
first we have an enable tick box and

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.260 
first we have an enable tick box and
this<00:04:44.150> enables<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:45.250> first<00:04:46.250> variation<00:04:46.790> value

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
this enables the first variation value

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.050 
this enables the first variation value
which<00:04:48.230> you<00:04:48.350> can<00:04:48.470> actually<00:04:48.620> see<00:04:48.770> here<00:04:49.280> the

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
which you can actually see here the

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.379 
which you can actually see here the
period<00:04:50.780> one<00:04:51.230> value<00:04:51.710> can<00:04:52.580> define<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.030> period

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
period one value can define the period

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:54.820 
period one value can define the period
during<00:04:53.600> which<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:54.050> pulse<00:04:54.230> will<00:04:54.410> actually<00:04:54.680> go

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
during which the pulse will actually go

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.830 
during which the pulse will actually go
through<00:04:54.860> its<00:04:55.130> full<00:04:55.310> cycle<00:04:55.760> from<00:04:56.330> Maximum<00:04:56.810> to

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
through its full cycle from Maximum to

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.720 
through its full cycle from Maximum to
minimum<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:57.470> this<00:04:57.860> would<00:04:58.040> be<00:04:58.070> measured<00:04:58.639> in

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
minimum and this would be measured in

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.080 
minimum and this would be measured in
frames<00:04:59.680> then<00:05:00.680> you<00:05:00.830> have<00:05:01.040> amplitude<00:05:01.639> one<00:05:01.850> and

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
frames then you have amplitude one and

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.420 
frames then you have amplitude one and
this<00:05:03.020> parameter<00:05:03.500> allows<00:05:03.710> you<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:03.980> define<00:05:04.130> the

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
this parameter allows you to define the

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.850 
this parameter allows you to define the
maximum<00:05:04.880> variation<00:05:05.240> in<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:05.600> force<00:05:05.870> this<00:05:06.680> will

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
maximum variation in the force this will

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.710 
maximum variation in the force this will
be<00:05:06.979> from<00:05:07.220> one<00:05:07.430> hundred<00:05:07.729> percent<00:05:07.760> down<00:05:08.419> to<00:05:08.630> the

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
be from one hundred percent down to the

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.020 
be from one hundred percent down to the
value<00:05:08.930> of<00:05:09.020> you<00:05:09.110> pick<00:05:09.350> ie<00:05:10.070> if<00:05:10.460> you<00:05:10.610> use<00:05:10.700> a<00:05:10.729> value

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
value of you pick ie if you use a value

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.180 
value of you pick ie if you use a value
of<00:05:11.120> 25%<00:05:11.660> the<00:05:12.139> force<00:05:12.380> will<00:05:12.650> fluctuate<00:05:12.830> between

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
of 25% the force will fluctuate between

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.280 
of 25% the force will fluctuate between
one<00:05:13.520> hundred<00:05:13.639> percent<00:05:13.820> and<00:05:14.290> seventy-five

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
one hundred percent and seventy-five

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.840 
one hundred percent and seventy-five
percent<00:05:15.500> so<00:05:16.190> you<00:05:16.280> can<00:05:16.370> actually<00:05:16.490> enter<00:05:16.729> a

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
percent so you can actually enter a

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.790 
percent so you can actually enter a
value<00:05:17.060> there<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:19.370> phase<00:05:19.639> one<00:05:20.169> is<00:05:21.169> used<00:05:21.500> to

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
value there the phase one is used to

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.490 
value there the phase one is used to
offset<00:05:22.190> the<00:05:22.790> cycle<00:05:23.120> in<00:05:23.270> time<00:05:23.540> so<00:05:24.260> you<00:05:24.320> can

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
offset the cycle in time so you can

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.170 
offset the cycle in time so you can
actually<00:05:24.620> get<00:05:24.860> it<00:05:24.979> to<00:05:25.070> match<00:05:25.190> up<00:05:25.400> with<00:05:25.550> any

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
actually get it to match up with any

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.170 
actually get it to match up with any
particular<00:05:26.540> effect<00:05:27.229> that<00:05:27.410> you<00:05:27.440> want<00:05:27.530> to<00:05:27.830> match

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
particular effect that you want to match

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.580 
particular effect that you want to match
this<00:05:29.180> is<00:05:29.360> just<00:05:29.570> the<00:05:29.660> timing<00:05:29.870> value<00:05:30.320> so<00:05:30.440> you<00:05:30.500> can

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
this is just the timing value so you can

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.260 
this is just the timing value so you can
actually<00:05:30.710> just<00:05:30.979> use<00:05:31.070> it<00:05:31.340> to<00:05:31.370> as<00:05:31.639> I<00:05:31.880> said<00:05:32.090> offset

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
actually just use it to as I said offset

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.629 
actually just use it to as I said offset
the<00:05:32.630> actual<00:05:33.290> pulse<00:05:33.530> in<00:05:33.740> time<00:05:33.950> to<00:05:34.160> go<00:05:34.280> to<00:05:34.340> work

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
the actual pulse in time to go to work

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.060 
the actual pulse in time to go to work
in<00:05:34.910> the<00:05:34.970> point<00:05:35.270> that<00:05:35.389> you<00:05:35.510> want<00:05:35.690> to<00:05:35.919> then<00:05:36.919> you

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
in the point that you want to then you

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.730 
in the point that you want to then you
have<00:05:37.280> period<00:05:37.850> to<00:05:38.030> amplitude<00:05:38.690> 2<00:05:39.020> and<00:05:39.229> phase<00:05:39.440> 2

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
have period to amplitude 2 and phase 2

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.200 
have period to amplitude 2 and phase 2
and<00:05:39.979> as<00:05:40.130> I<00:05:40.250> said<00:05:40.310> those<00:05:40.610> are<00:05:40.760> actually<00:05:41.000> just

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
and as I said those are actually just

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.230 
and as I said those are actually just
duplicates<00:05:41.660> of<00:05:42.250> period<00:05:43.250> 1<00:05:43.460> amplitude<00:05:43.910> 1<00:05:44.090> and

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
duplicates of period 1 amplitude 1 and

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.760 
duplicates of period 1 amplitude 1 and
phase<00:05:44.419> 1<00:05:44.750> and<00:05:44.900> you<00:05:45.050> can<00:05:45.200> use<00:05:45.380> those<00:05:45.620> to

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
phase 1 and you can use those to

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.270 
phase 1 and you can use those to
actually<00:05:46.039> add<00:05:46.610> another<00:05:46.970> pulse<00:05:47.270> on<00:05:47.479> top

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
actually add another pulse on top

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.300 
actually add another pulse on top
finally<00:05:49.280> we<00:05:49.430> have<00:05:49.669> the<00:05:51.039> particle<00:05:52.039> effect

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
finally we have the particle effect

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.370 
finally we have the particle effect
range<00:05:52.580> and<00:05:52.820> here<00:05:53.510> you<00:05:53.660> can<00:05:53.810> enable<00:05:54.050> a

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
range and here you can enable a

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.880 
range and here you can enable a
spherical<00:05:55.660> gizmo<00:05:56.660> for<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.200> actual<00:05:57.380> maximum

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
spherical gizmo for the actual maximum

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.529 
spherical gizmo for the actual maximum
range<00:05:58.070> of<00:05:58.250> your<00:05:58.370> force<00:05:58.640> and<00:05:59.300> when<00:05:59.419> you've

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
range of your force and when you've

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.469 
range of your force and when you've
enabled<00:05:59.750> it<00:06:00.050> obviously<00:06:00.470> the<00:06:01.010> range<00:06:01.940> parameter

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
enabled it obviously the range parameter

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.180 
enabled it obviously the range parameter
here<00:06:02.660> actually<00:06:02.900> becomes<00:06:03.590> available<00:06:03.860> and<00:06:04.130> you

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
here actually becomes available and you

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.760 
here actually becomes available and you
can<00:06:04.220> actually<00:06:04.639> set<00:06:04.970> up<00:06:05.000> that<00:06:05.270> range<00:06:05.479> here<00:06:05.780> so

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
can actually set up that range here so

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.409 
can actually set up that range here so
let's<00:06:06.979> quickly<00:06:07.130> have<00:06:07.460> a<00:06:07.490> look<00:06:07.610> at<00:06:08.150> what<00:06:08.300> the

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
let's quickly have a look at what the

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.090 
let's quickly have a look at what the
sexual<00:06:08.870> for<00:06:09.139> supplies<00:06:09.470> to<00:06:09.620> our<00:06:09.680> particles

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
sexual for supplies to our particles

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.250 
sexual for supplies to our particles
it's<00:06:10.340> a<00:06:10.430> motor<00:06:10.639> and<00:06:10.940> it<00:06:11.510> will<00:06:11.690> actually<00:06:11.810> rotate

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
it's a motor and it will actually rotate

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.680 
it's a motor and it will actually rotate
our<00:06:12.410> particles<00:06:12.830> around<00:06:12.919> a<00:06:13.130> central<00:06:13.700> axis<00:06:13.880> so

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
our particles around a central axis so

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.870 
our particles around a central axis so
that's<00:06:14.840> pretty<00:06:14.990> easy<00:06:15.110> to<00:06:15.380> understand<00:06:15.880> so

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
that's pretty easy to understand so

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.100 
that's pretty easy to understand so
there<00:06:17.060> you<00:06:17.090> go<00:06:17.180> as<00:06:17.539> you<00:06:17.660> can<00:06:17.810> see<00:06:17.930> it<00:06:18.020> actually

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
there you go as you can see it actually

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.560 
there you go as you can see it actually
rotates<00:06:18.500> our<00:06:18.860> particles<00:06:19.340> and<00:06:19.570> almost

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
rotates our particles and almost

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.940 
rotates our particles and almost
immediately<00:06:20.960> they<00:06:21.169> go<00:06:21.320> flying<00:06:21.590> off<00:06:21.740> into

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950 
immediately they go flying off into

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.129 
immediately they go flying off into
space<00:06:22.240> what<00:06:23.240> you'd<00:06:23.360> actually<00:06:23.539> need<00:06:23.840> to<00:06:23.990> keep

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
space what you'd actually need to keep

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.640 
space what you'd actually need to keep
your<00:06:24.229> particles<00:06:24.710> in<00:06:24.889> in<00:06:25.130> in<00:06:25.430> position<00:06:26.030> is<00:06:26.210> a

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
your particles in in in position is a

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.719 
your particles in in in position is a
counteracting<00:06:27.650> gravity<00:06:28.100> force<00:06:28.340> to<00:06:28.490> actually

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
counteracting gravity force to actually

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.279 
counteracting gravity force to actually
pull<00:06:28.880> your<00:06:29.060> particles<00:06:29.450> in<00:06:29.570> words<00:06:29.780> as<00:06:29.900> well<00:06:30.080> and

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
pull your particles in words as well and

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.409 
pull your particles in words as well and
as<00:06:30.830> I<00:06:30.950> said<00:06:31.010> a<00:06:31.190> really<00:06:31.400> good<00:06:31.610> partner<00:06:32.060> for<00:06:32.090> the

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
as I said a really good partner for the

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.629 
as I said a really good partner for the
motor<00:06:33.020> force<00:06:33.320> would<00:06:33.560> be<00:06:33.620> the<00:06:33.950> particle<00:06:34.490> bomb

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 
motor force would be the particle bomb

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.159 
motor force would be the particle bomb
set<00:06:35.090> to<00:06:35.289> a<00:06:36.289> very<00:06:36.830> large<00:06:36.979> effect<00:06:37.669> range<00:06:38.090> and<00:06:38.389> so

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
set to a very large effect range and so

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.350 
set to a very large effect range and so
it<00:06:39.260> doesn't<00:06:39.740> actually<00:06:39.800> cut<00:06:40.159> on<00:06:40.310> or<00:06:40.520> come<00:06:41.240> on

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
it doesn't actually cut on or come on

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.940 
it doesn't actually cut on or come on
very<00:06:41.539> quickly<00:06:41.720> and<00:06:42.020> cause<00:06:42.320> the<00:06:42.440> particles<00:06:42.860> to

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
very quickly and cause the particles to

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.649 
very quickly and cause the particles to
explode<00:06:43.310> but<00:06:43.940> instead<00:06:44.240> is<00:06:44.390> applied

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:44.659 
explode but instead is applied

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:45.820 
explode but instead is applied
constantly

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
constantly

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.740 
constantly
and<00:06:46.310> you<00:06:46.430> can<00:06:46.580> use<00:06:46.700> that<00:06:46.910> the<00:06:47.120> particle<00:06:47.600> bomb

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
and you can use that the particle bomb

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.870 
and you can use that the particle bomb
set<00:06:48.080> to<00:06:48.110> cylindrical<00:06:48.500> to<00:06:49.280> actually<00:06:49.550> pull<00:06:49.730> your

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
set to cylindrical to actually pull your

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.220 
set to cylindrical to actually pull your
particles<00:06:50.300> back<00:06:50.480> in<00:06:50.630> towards<00:06:50.930> the<00:06:50.990> central

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.230 
particles back in towards the central

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.320 
particles back in towards the central
axis<00:06:51.650> and<00:06:51.830> that<00:06:51.920> will<00:06:52.040> actually<00:06:52.070> contract<00:06:52.730> the

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
axis and that will actually contract the

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.940 
axis and that will actually contract the
centrifugal<00:06:53.930> forces<00:06:54.410> applied<00:06:54.680> to<00:06:54.890> the

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:54.950 
centrifugal forces applied to the

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.510 
centrifugal forces applied to the
particles<00:06:55.400> by<00:06:55.610> this<00:06:55.790> this<00:06:56.180> motor<00:06:56.450> force<00:06:56.780> here

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
particles by this this motor force here

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.880 
particles by this this motor force here
if<00:06:58.520> we<00:06:58.910> turn<00:06:59.150> on<00:06:59.330> a<00:06:59.690> particle<00:07:00.380> effect<00:07:00.620> range

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:00.890 
if we turn on a particle effect range

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.620 
if we turn on a particle effect range
and<00:07:01.250> actually<00:07:01.520> bring<00:07:01.730> that<00:07:01.880> in<00:07:02.000> a<00:07:02.180> little<00:07:02.480> bit

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
and actually bring that in a little bit

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.990 
and actually bring that in a little bit
smaller<00:07:02.960> you'll<00:07:03.770> find<00:07:04.040> know<00:07:04.340> if<00:07:04.580> we<00:07:04.760> press

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 
smaller you'll find know if we press

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.730 
smaller you'll find know if we press
play<00:07:05.270> let's<00:07:06.080> just<00:07:06.140> go<00:07:06.350> back<00:07:06.380> to<00:07:06.530> the<00:07:06.620> beginning

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
play let's just go back to the beginning

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.760 
play let's just go back to the beginning
and<00:07:07.390> press<00:07:08.390> play<00:07:08.570> and<00:07:08.810> as<00:07:08.900> you<00:07:09.020> can<00:07:09.140> see<00:07:09.170> now<00:07:09.500> it

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
and press play and as you can see now it

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.640 
and press play and as you can see now it
has<00:07:09.950> a<00:07:09.980> much<00:07:10.220> smaller<00:07:10.520> area<00:07:11.120> of<00:07:11.210> effect<00:07:11.650> based

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:12.650 
has a much smaller area of effect based

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.380 
has a much smaller area of effect based
on<00:07:12.860> that<00:07:12.980> that<00:07:13.250> the<00:07:13.490> range<00:07:13.790> that<00:07:14.030> we've<00:07:14.180> just

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:14.390 
on that that the range that we've just

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.500 
on that that the range that we've just
set<00:07:14.540> up<00:07:14.690> there<00:07:15.280> okay<00:07:16.280> so<00:07:16.340> that's<00:07:16.850> the<00:07:17.090> motor

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:17.510 
set up there okay so that's the motor

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.900 
set up there okay so that's the motor
force<00:07:17.840> and<00:07:18.110> as<00:07:18.830> you<00:07:18.980> can<00:07:19.130> see<00:07:19.160> it's<00:07:19.640> very

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:19.910 
force and as you can see it's very

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.970 
force and as you can see it's very
specialized<00:07:20.690> just<00:07:21.170> useful<00:07:21.350> producing

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:21.980 
specialized just useful producing

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.950 
specialized just useful producing
rotation<00:07:22.460> on<00:07:22.550> our<00:07:22.670> particles<00:07:23.120> but<00:07:23.720> you<00:07:23.810> can

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 
rotation on our particles but you can

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.450 
rotation on our particles but you can
see<00:07:24.080> it's<00:07:24.200> actually<00:07:24.440> quite<00:07:24.800> flexible<00:07:25.100> and

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:25.460 
see it's actually quite flexible and

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.720 
see it's actually quite flexible and
it's<00:07:25.610> actually<00:07:25.850> more<00:07:25.970> flexible<00:07:26.510> than<00:07:26.570> the

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:27.730 
it's actually more flexible than the

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.560 
it's actually more flexible than the
parameters<00:07:28.730> which<00:07:28.850> are<00:07:28.910> actually<00:07:29.030> similar<00:07:29.360> to

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:29.570 
parameters which are actually similar to

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.780 
parameters which are actually similar to
it<00:07:29.660> in<00:07:29.840> the<00:07:29.870> in<00:07:30.110> the<00:07:30.140> vortex<00:07:30.380> so<00:07:31.250> you<00:07:31.340> can<00:07:31.670> see

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:31.790 
it in the in the vortex so you can see

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.860 
it in the in the vortex so you can see
that<00:07:31.910> you've<00:07:32.000> actually<00:07:32.120> got<00:07:32.360> more<00:07:32.510> control<00:07:32.840> of

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:32.870 
that you've actually got more control of

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.890 
that you've actually got more control of
a<00:07:33.020> rotational<00:07:33.620> speed<00:07:33.920> using<00:07:34.340> the<00:07:34.490> motor<00:07:34.900> okay

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:35.900 
a rotational speed using the motor okay

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.840 
a rotational speed using the motor okay
let's<00:07:36.140> move<00:07:36.350> on<00:07:36.530> now<00:07:36.560> and<00:07:36.920> have<00:07:37.430> a<00:07:37.460> look<00:07:37.610> at<00:07:37.730> the

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:37.850 
let's move on now and have a look at the

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.890 
let's move on now and have a look at the
next<00:07:38.090> force<00:07:38.420> the<00:07:38.990> push<00:07:39.560> force
