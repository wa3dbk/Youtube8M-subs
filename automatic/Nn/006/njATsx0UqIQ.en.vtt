00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.500
 beyond these people the duplicates 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hi everybody 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.999
 but went back carried to his height reached a shot 

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:11.000
 so this is a game of hunting and fishing developed by fellag and edited by 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.740
 activision so if you want to get it you need not oven because 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.090
 call to naïve sweden american declaration french epa 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.830
 the tenant on one side and a rifle to hunt despite a 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.149
 side a fishing rod to go 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.989
 quite so I hope that just now a peace will be very big 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.440
 fish well I'll tell you we'll try 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.600
 the heavier club without being hit but very nice rifle to learn to 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.390
 to chase them 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.539
 for this match 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.239
 its mission for the moment it's dirty it'll leave some pretty simple things I 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:42.990
 Assumed 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.710
 that's his gesture 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.830
 raja a game at the time so this is of course it's specific 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.870
 two years ago, even without being too much of a big game 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.540
 same chapel st he does not hold 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.390
 but in itself so it's about to hatch but these incidents schools 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.610
 so the papaladen the antelope quite blow 1 his club to taste 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.180
 was in mode the hunter would agree that 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.340
 for 100 th year amended by your reactions remove the game that it's not 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.290
 always easy so you really have to wait to be able to appeal 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.920
 to his patience at the end of these stamps wait 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.950
 expect 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.970
 the battle head lurking in a corner 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.700
 for his kindle me I will not stop one day one thing is that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.520
 we kill animals it's not necessarily super pretty pretty his fear or 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.090
 create some people born 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.740
 for me I reiterate that lately also some games so violent cause 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.760
 like some fps or missy not kill him 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.010
 he resided street st 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.650
 a guy everything comes out of marriage a lot of care and know nobody me to me I 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.170
 prefers to use over ankle boots routed to iss armstead 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.700
 that she is a rat's head and a music head to dr 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.520
 so the same piece comment on the pictures 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.399
 no actually I found my team percent 19 times out of 20 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.640
 I'm there if his role in this farce for a guy who asked that 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.230
 to be calibrated so I was really surprised by the game because 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.419
 we stop 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:16.729
 practice in his opinion cycling is a 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.539
 for you what made it was really surprised by this power play 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.200
 when i started the pc 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.489
 the males is actually playing I really want 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.200
 their healthy credit balances you have a very mind they are made when 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.599
 displacements during the colors of the game during the maps in fact that's it 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.029
 that's what you do in the lab 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:38.699
 it appears as though the game celebrates graphically in fact we see some 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.379
 it is built as and when 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.209
 that's a shame 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.080
 hurry to do something else anyway 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.240
 e lol that for some to mistreat him 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:53.649
 c the only message what a good time together 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:55.999
 quite the same 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.030
 this is a young officer 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.330
 his dictations by activision blizzard and then I can do is pray very roger 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.260
 laüt it really makes the military thing and thank you but we believe 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.900
 really in nature is what you really have a greater freedom in 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.590
 throwing herself into the water as much more feminine as I was saying actually it's 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.190
 that's his game since it was so for these vegetables we are really limited 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.260
 for the blues that is finally fire in the day this is it's done 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.809
 pity 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:21.869
 that's the reason why it's great I read the newspaper 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:25.860
 I also want to make you see all the gaudy colors 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.410
 the gesture nothing so what he wants it's a matter of doing some fishing she has 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.380
 a small side in my opinion I would like to ask an ethical question and concerts 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.309
 and this game 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:40.150
 so we have all the other ways of life including the diovan all people 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:43.149
 who would like to hunt people who can not do it I know 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.609
 the title is retired this team who knows people who 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.090
 do not arrive and that sooner makes it clear why people 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.939
 experience difficulties 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:58.129
 no rare site people who are suffering abbas so there i'm j I'm firm door 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.849
 no doubt this chessboard of the big fish raseteurs at the site recruitment 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.549
 two players for the fish 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.040
 what I mean is that this game is it's a game that's when 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.039
 even enough 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:13.189
 10 who help us available in a short time we have returned to the world 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:15.780
 who rose% of the game's developers 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.009
 we can do certain movements with the crisis provides for example 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.759
 we want to do 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.759
 also things in fact is that which m 

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:28.509
 we have been throughout the game between regions 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.240
 enough it's very smart in terms of but someone like a leader side 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.589
 business etc we are sitting we attended this show is also enjoyable 

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:40.360
 like google print or to do outside a little less than two small track 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.990
 from sakineh 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.550
 during the game as nice too and again a way and that 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.170
 graphically it's here it's really impressive 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.480
 a risk and what it is what you mean what you are and what you want 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.080
 show us something else for us there 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.300
 a manger next to 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.630
 in e2 stay on these images there I think we do not see too much what I'm worth 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.490
 to be clear 6 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.490
 and therefore one 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.720
 so in the us and you are if you do a little bit all the states 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.440
 to note that another a real shot is not to show all the 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.880
 shelves he's right to take his place in this case we can do the 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.120
 hunting after all the game we can just as well in fact 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.069
 in fact no mood montreal hunting duck 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.139
 to be convinced if that's why it's not necessary for that 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.200
 the others in terms of employment a little complete cycle the cards 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.900
 we have lots of little things like that that makes the game fun 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.610
 so that's it 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:49.710
 the whole town of longueuil to fish a fish I hope he fished a 

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:52.899
 second time his name with support offered five highlights of your offer 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.050
 ok but we will leave you on these images we will tell you very soon 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.560
 for a new live and I was clear from the end of August to the request 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.030
