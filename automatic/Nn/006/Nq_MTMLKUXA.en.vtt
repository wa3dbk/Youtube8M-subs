 right foot in this game that has come out 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.960
 very little in which we have it 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:25.169
 almost all the people who are fans of 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.449
 this fifa because the truth is a great 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.159
 game and what draws our attention to 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.749
 everyone is the ultimate team which is what 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.880
 let's talk now about how to start 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:36.750
 with a right foot how to start from the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.030
 best way of advice that I'm going to 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.330
 give is armen if a team like that 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.310
 we see in depth what this team means 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.290
 this team from players I've 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.720
 chosen me gold players not 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.880
 bright shiny silver players 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.890
 or as you see two only bright of 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.470
 gold but because the fich this player the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.720
 I've really decided I 'm very players 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.880
 easy to get in the market and for 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.760
 what price for the price of how you see here 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.129
 the arabi is for 300 coins 300 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.719
 Arabic coins that means to stay 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.650
 there nothing has come out because if 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:10.170
 let's throw 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.390
 of the davis we sell it for 300 too 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.040
 coins but we have available 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.960
 of the number of matches we can 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.060
 play with him and neither in this way 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.530
 we would spend the same contract I say for 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.630
 the rest of the players as you see here 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.540
 that I 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.340
 ms de garcía bought by 300 coins 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.250
 and when we go to see the price of 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.830
 discard we download it for 316 coins 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.230
 in any case we have won coins with him 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.050
 they are very few coins but we have also 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.060
 could play games with this team 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.470
 that nothing has happened to us because in 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.270
 how much we discard all the players 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.010
 we will continue to have the same 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.900
 amount of coins this is a key 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.180
 to start the ultimate team for 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.340
 put together coins and not lose absolutely 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.290
 none since if we spend the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.200
 contract how do you come here mountain 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.090
 signed for 550 coins are very Thursday 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.150
 easy to get we spend the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.729
 mountaineering contract of 550 coins 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.860
 we can sign another one quietly and 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.080
 we discard this to 600 coins too 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.240
 we can sign it to 600 coins and 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.580
 discard it to the same thing and then go 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.989
 officiate another I did with all the 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.780
 players and also with the players of 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.360
 silver that are resting at 250 coins the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.690
 I have signed for 250 as you see here the case 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.370
 of btm and silva are players that we 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.370
 serve to start this download by 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.660
 249 we would lose a single coin but 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.330
 with the matches that we can play the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.670
 there is no difference they are all 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.170
 easy players to get in the 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.680
 easy market to sign for 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.390
 coins in both the golden players not 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.850
 bright by 300 in the silver ones 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.739
 vision of x 250 and in these videos 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.410
 bright for 600 coins as you see here 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.330
 the case of anv rabat a key player is 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.220
 a very good player of the bea that the 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.950
 trade for 600 coins and when we go to 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.660
 discard what we discard for 616 coins 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.970
 make such a team to start the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.350
 last and you have very key is one of the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.489
 The best advice I can give you is 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.380
 something that I am doing for 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.330
 point me the coins to buy a 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.090
 team later on the players that 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.200
 I obviously want this I do not aim and what 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.450
 can do with Spanish players 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.130
 as I did in this last and thymus 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.690
 you can also choose your template the 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.299
 truth has been measured by Spaniards because 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.670
 look for players look for players and I 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.700
 it has seemed the best way 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.230
 with this team also the best advice 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.970
 what can I give them is that they play 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.310
 seasons of a player who like 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.890
 I am doing I have played little game 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.900
 for now but the truth with this team 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.520
 they are very easy to win the seasons 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.200
 player I do not think anyone has a problem 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.360
 with that or you can also start the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.370
 online season the division 10 that does not 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.190
 it is not difficult because there is not yet 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.840
 great teams and you can win the 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.540
 season to the end of a couple of coins 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.040
 in an easy way with a team like this 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.410
 single player tournament can also 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.080
 play some or challenge the team the 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.790
 Legendary week that the truth is not 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.670
 it's easy but it's not something either 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.709
 difficult to beat him and we would gather a thousand 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.880
 more good little coins this is the first 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.670
 advice that I can give you so that 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.370
 start the last team of the best 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.959
 so that they are a team like the one 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.730
 I just explained and do not lose 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.799
 absolutely not a coin but that 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.810
 win as the 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.030
 time and go buy the players 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.769
 that you said they are going to 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.180
 use in the future on your computer that 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.180
 they will use forever 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.380
 good and the other key that I can give you 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.690
 is that they go here to the catalog of 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.500
 steve to 15 that go to the party 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.050
 academic and make them buy these 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.730
 wonderful letters that we to the catalog 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.730
 which are reward increases of 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.350
 fut coins for five matches we 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.300
 they will give my coins at the end of the match 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.250
 they will not give us all the coins in a row 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.350
 but for every game he will give me my 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.840
 coins and here are several letters of this 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.850
 like this one that is another for ten parties 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.310

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.560
 coins here there is another 200 coins for 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.240
 five games here there is another one thousand 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.980
 coins for five matches the truth that 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.350
 There are many letters of this as you see here 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.210
 they also have players to loan as 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.490

 that for those parties give us a 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.630
 reward of which we buy in the

 keys that I showed you to serve 15 last 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.220
 tips on how to start from because for me 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.050
 is the best way is because the truth 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.120
 I do it because I do not like to lose 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.680
 a lot of time bringing in the market and if 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.690
 I do not like to play anymore and win 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.520
 coins playing but I do not like it either 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.230
 lose coins by signing players who 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.940
 then I'm going to sell and that's why I 've 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:12.210
 explained all this and this has been the 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.670
 today's video are videos that we are going to go

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.219
