use equal amounts as I've just shown you

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.760 
use equal amounts as I've just shown you
of<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.500> seven<00:04:40.860> basic<00:04:41.100> grains<00:04:41.970> or<00:04:42.660> you<00:04:43.590> could

here's<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.910> couple<00:04:48.330> of<00:04:48.510> suggestions<00:04:48.960> that<00:04:49.380> I

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
here's a couple of suggestions that I

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.219 
here's a couple of suggestions that I
have<00:04:49.680> based<00:04:50.310> on<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.700> hundreds<00:04:51.200> well

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
have based on the hundreds well

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.920 
have based on the hundreds well
thousands<00:04:52.919> of<00:04:53.010> batches<00:04:53.490> of<00:04:54.090> crackers<00:04:54.750> that

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
thousands of batches of crackers that

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.380 
thousands of batches of crackers that
I've<00:04:55.050> made<00:04:55.289> in<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:55.500> past<00:04:55.970> you<00:04:56.970> might<00:04:57.180> consider

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
I've made in the past you might consider

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.450 
I've made in the past you might consider
using<00:04:57.900> half<00:04:58.380> millet<00:04:58.860> because<00:04:59.190> it's<00:04:59.370> a

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
using half millet because it's a

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.670 
using half millet because it's a
beautiful<00:05:00.030> golden<00:05:00.419> color<00:05:00.450> and<00:05:01.200> it's<00:05:01.530> an

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
beautiful golden color and it's an

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.340 
beautiful golden color and it's an
expensive<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:03.300> might<00:05:03.510> want<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:03.930> start<00:05:04.200> out

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
expensive you might want to start out

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.279 
expensive you might want to start out
with<00:05:04.380> a<00:05:04.680> little<00:05:05.130> less<00:05:05.340> buckwheat<00:05:05.910> or<00:05:06.450> Israeli

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
with a little less buckwheat or Israeli

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.560 
with a little less buckwheat or Israeli
couscous<00:05:07.860> because<00:05:08.669> they're<00:05:08.910> larger<00:05:09.330> grain

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
couscous because they're larger grain

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.440 
couscous because they're larger grain
size<00:05:09.870> makes<00:05:10.260> it<00:05:10.440> slightly<00:05:10.919> harder<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.490> tip<00:05:12.300> the
