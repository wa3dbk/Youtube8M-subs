00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.660
 hi guys today let's see how 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.000
 make a manga style guy 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:13.650
 as usual we start from the head and 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.480
 let's create a more or less round circle 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.340
 it doesn't have to be perfect because then 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.980
 we all go to correct this is alone 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.580
 the base and the sketch we need for 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.580
 to start 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.320
 after which we sit the point where 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.800
 we want the chin to finish then 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.800
 the whole face 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:44.140
 remember that the male face and more 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.350
 square and squared so angular 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.050
 of the female face that as in the 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.240
 previous video if you haven't seen that 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.250
 the coffee 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:58.110
 as you can see the icon is much rounder 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.580
 softer the female face instead of a 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.810
 the male one we need a little 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.810
 harden the lines 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.430
 beautiful you can do it how you want not not 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.380
 has nothing to do with this here 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.520
 female one male because male can 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.880
 to have 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.880
 long hair 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.049
 or for example in fantasy style 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.060
 also own hair combing 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.540
 long are the peculiarities of 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.540
 character 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.560
 the very many manga are present 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.810
 these particularities then then 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.090
 we trace the features of the face then eyes 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.399
 nose and mouth that in this case we will do 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.409
 more rigid so if the eyes if 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.350
 female eyes make them big 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.289
 brilliant rounds in humans we make them 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.110
 more squared more a moment more 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.539
 small always from the center of the circle 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.520
 let the famous one start from the axis 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.680
 central and then 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.660
 we decide where to start the neck on 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.900
 neck should be bigger is that 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.349
 of the female 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.010
 because in fact the man in itself 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.370
 it's the biggest neck 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.659
 we also want to make shoulders 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.659
 shoulders must be wide 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.670
 this sign where we want to do 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.080
 then finish the bust where exactly 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.080
 then the legs will start 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.090
 then we trace the bones that are part 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:48.260
 of the shoulders of the neck so as to mark 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.079
 good muscles that is nice to show 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.620
 in in man and then slowly 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.329
 we also trace the chest 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.629
 now i'm doing it a bit like it here 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:03.019
 if it were just the body then later 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.560
 obviously we will design it and also the 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.560
 clothes 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.390
 your arms I recommend you do the 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.660
 muscled because obviously he must 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.850
 stand out 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.150
 from the female arm 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.190
 male arm must be muscular 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.820
 obviously if you have to draw a man 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:37.680
 maybe more meat do it rounder 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:40.320
 sure if he's a bit more of a character 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.000
 plump you can't do for sure 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.820
 muscles marked the same thing if 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.880
 a young boy if a young boy 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.590
 maybe 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.970
 the teenager can't do who knows 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:57.140
 which muscles you decide for a while 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.140
 how to make the body 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:25.000
 then leave the legs as you can see 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:29.290
 they are two signs 1 and 2 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.830
 then part of the leg and then the 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.050
 calf and ankle shoes for 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.150
 now draw a moment in one 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.860
 sketch because we will think about it later 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.659
 make them more realistic 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.520
 so we make them a little crushed 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:47.949
 down because they are a little more 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.949
 view from the front then in front 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.060
 let me make a shirt and the 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.060
 sweater on 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:48.940
 I chose to make jeans pretty 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:52.240
 wide then below you will see how it is 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.660
 they become a little more ticino fold 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.270
 because in the end the jeans fold 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.400
 always take a little bit even a little 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.460
 more realistic the thing is otherwise 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.920
 too fake too hard ok 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.960
 and then the shoes we make the shoes 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.260
 usual sports shoes with these laces 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:15.360
 he is a bit converse all star 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.360
 we say a lot of glues 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:22.759
 ok we made all the clothes 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.080
 we are ready for the inca agony in 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:29.779
 inking you can make it a century 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.369
 famous nib that I told you and 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:33.019
 then I start the ink action in 

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:34.939
 this case I'm making it blue because 

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:38.119
 it's something that gets angry from one 

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:40.569
 studio i 'm doing no matter whether blue or 

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:40.569
 black 

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.160
 or we ask for shadows to begin with shadows 

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.970
 they are made with these dashes a little 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.970
 diagonal 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.460
 I want to do them directly with the pen 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.830
 because a style that I really like 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.960
 though 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.440
 i never do it is just pop review 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.440
 various techniques 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.449
 but I really like the affection you give 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.090
 because really 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:42.319
 it looks like it's really designed 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.319
 the warmth it has from the design 

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.760
 guys this tutorial finished by 

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.890
