the<00:00:57.600> key<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.199> good<00:00:58.440> burger<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.859> think<00:00:59.430> is

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
the key with a good burger I think is

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.639 
the key with a good burger I think is
just<00:01:00.120> starting<00:01:00.480> with<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:00.960> good<00:01:01.109> meat<00:01:01.440> if

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
just starting with really good meat if

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.619 
just starting with really good meat if
you<00:01:01.859> start<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.309> good<00:01:02.640> ground<00:01:02.940> beef<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.210> has

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
you start with good ground beef that has

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.509 
you start with good ground beef that has
a<00:01:03.660> nice<00:01:04.110> amount<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.500> fat<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.890> at<00:01:05.040> least<00:01:05.280> ten

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
a nice amount of fat in it at least ten

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.990 
a nice amount of fat in it at least ten
percent<00:01:05.670> fat<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.619> probably<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.130> think<00:01:08.250> 15

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
percent fat so probably I think 15

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000 
percent fat so probably I think 15
percent<00:01:09.479> fat<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> best<00:01:10.229> amount<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.860> your

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
percent fat is the best amount in your

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.260 
percent fat is the best amount in your
ground<00:01:11.220> beef<00:01:11.369> you're<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> good

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
ground beef you're going to have a good

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.390 
ground beef you're going to have a good
burger<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:13.080> really<00:01:13.380> all<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.560> need<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.950> add<00:01:14.070> is

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
burger so really all you need to add is

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.660 
burger so really all you need to add is
a<00:01:14.460> sprinkle<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.150> salt<00:01:15.950> maybe<00:01:16.950> two<00:01:17.250> sprinkles

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
a sprinkle of salt maybe two sprinkles

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.740 
a sprinkle of salt maybe two sprinkles
of<00:01:17.850> salt<00:01:18.530> some<00:01:19.530> black<00:01:19.560> pepper<00:01:20.369> freshly<00:01:21.299> ground

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
of salt some black pepper freshly ground

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.060 
of salt some black pepper freshly ground
will<00:01:21.990> make<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> big<00:01:22.380> difference<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.040> have

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
access to that and then I like adding a

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.380 
access to that and then I like adding a
little<00:01:27.090> Worcestershire<00:01:27.509> sauce<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.979> soon<00:01:32.390> so
