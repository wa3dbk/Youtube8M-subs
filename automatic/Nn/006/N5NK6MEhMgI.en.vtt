last week and I was able to record some
of<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.230> demonstrations<00:00:31.920> they<00:00:32.160> did<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:33.079> so

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
of the demonstrations they did and so

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.760 
of the demonstrations they did and so
before<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:34.980> take<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.219> look<00:00:35.489> at<00:00:35.790> at<00:00:36.120> how<00:00:36.770> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
before we take a look at at how the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.190 
before we take a look at at how the
whole<00:00:37.980> thing<00:00:38.010> actually<00:00:38.430> works<00:00:38.910> let's<00:00:39.480> take<00:00:39.960> a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
whole thing actually works let's take a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.150 
whole thing actually works let's take a
closer<00:00:40.620> look<00:00:40.980> at<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:42.390> DJO<00:00:43.170> live<00:00:43.590> transmitter

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
closer look at the DJO live transmitter

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.630 
closer look at the DJO live transmitter
it<00:00:44.579> has<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.940> size<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.539> suitcase<00:00:46.129> and<00:00:47.129> has

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it has the size of a suitcase and has

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.389 
it has the size of a suitcase and has
its<00:00:47.940> own<00:00:48.000> power<00:00:48.420> source<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:50.100> two

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
its own power source so you can have two

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.410 
its own power source so you can have two
batteries<00:00:50.610> connected<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.940> it<00:00:53.940> can

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
batteries connected to it and it can

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.720 
batteries connected to it and it can
interface<00:00:55.020> with<00:00:55.079> pretty<00:00:55.590> much<00:00:55.829> any<00:00:56.160> camera<00:00:56.579> on

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
interface with pretty much any camera on

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.150 
interface with pretty much any camera on
the<00:00:56.820> market<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:58.050> SDI<00:00:58.559> connectors

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the market so you have SDI connectors

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.310 
the market so you have SDI connectors
analog<00:00:59.760> connectors<00:01:00.289> HDMI<00:01:01.760> firewire<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.320> if

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
analog connectors HDMI firewire and if

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.679 
analog connectors HDMI firewire and if
you<00:01:04.710> want<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.339> transmit<00:01:05.729> your<00:01:05.909> live<00:01:06.330> video

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
you want to transmit your live video

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.630 
you want to transmit your live video
signal<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.130> three<00:01:08.400> ways

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
signal you can do it in three ways

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.789 
signal you can do it in three ways
either<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.210> use<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.780> Ethernet<00:01:10.320> connection

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
either you use the Ethernet connection

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.560 
either you use the Ethernet connection
or<00:01:11.299> you<00:01:12.299> use<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.900> Wi-Fi<00:01:13.740> connection<00:01:13.970> now<00:01:14.970> when

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
or you use the Wi-Fi connection now when

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.840 
or you use the Wi-Fi connection now when
you're<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.110> field<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.860> may<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.549> all

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
you're in the field you may not have all

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.289 
you're in the field you may not have all
this<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.259> where<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.189> de<00:01:20.340> 0<00:01:20.610> box

this so this is where the de 0 box

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.660 
this so this is where the de 0 box
really<00:01:22.049> stands<00:01:22.470> out<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:23.340> uses<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.240> 3G<00:01:24.840> network

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
really stands out it uses the 3G network

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.420 
really stands out it uses the 3G network
inside<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.820> box<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.240> will<00:01:27.390> find<00:01:27.720> four<00:01:28.650> modems

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
inside the box you will find four modems

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.690 
inside the box you will find four modems

there's<00:02:45.600> also<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.960> preview<00:02:46.350> window<00:02:47.030> this

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
there's also a preview window this

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.490 
there's also a preview window this
window<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.510> reflection<00:02:48.960> of<00:02:49.230> what<00:02:49.380> the

window is a reflection of what the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.760 
window is a reflection of what the
camera<00:02:49.740> sees<00:02:49.920> not<00:02:50.780> not<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.930> throughput<00:02:52.200> so

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
camera sees not not the throughput so

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.680 
camera sees not not the throughput so
it's<00:02:52.950> just<00:02:53.070> whatever<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.240> camera<00:02:54.570> is

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
it's just whatever that the camera is

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.440 
it's just whatever that the camera is
seeing<00:02:54.870> at<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.290> time<00:02:56.150> you'll<00:02:57.150> know<00:02:57.300> what<00:02:57.390> it

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
seeing at this time you'll know what it

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.950 
seeing at this time you'll know what it
says<00:02:57.630> preview<00:02:58.110> in<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.380> upper<00:02:58.800> right<00:02:59.040> corner

that's<00:03:00.960> an<00:03:01.110> indicator<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.640> we're<00:03:02.640> not

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
that's an indicator that we're not

into<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.890> the<00:04:50.190> top<00:04:50.400> of<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.700> transmitter<00:04:52.220> and

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
into the the top of the transmitter and

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:02.200 
into the the top of the transmitter and
at<00:04:53.970> this<00:04:54.120> point<00:04:54.390> I'll<00:04:54.780> go<00:04:54.810> ahead<00:04:55.140> and<00:04:55.410> hit<00:04:55.530> play

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.490 

you<00:05:03.210> know<00:05:03.330> see<00:05:05.690> indicator<00:05:06.690> bar<00:05:06.960> there<00:05:07.200> that

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
you know see indicator bar there that

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.820 
you know see indicator bar there that
the<00:05:07.740> modem<00:05:08.490> connections<00:05:08.970> are<00:05:09.120> testing

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
the modem connections are testing

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.930 
the modem connections are testing
they're<00:05:10.830> just<00:05:11.010> doing<00:05:11.130> a<00:05:11.310> quick<00:05:11.430> bandwidth

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
they're just doing a quick bandwidth

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.300 
they're just doing a quick bandwidth
test<00:05:12.270> it's<00:05:13.200> now<00:05:13.380> synchronizing<00:05:14.070> with<00:05:14.190> the

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
test it's now synchronizing with the

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.300 
test it's now synchronizing with the
server<00:05:14.550> and<00:05:16.550> we<00:05:17.550> are<00:05:17.670> now<00:05:19.010> broadcasting<00:05:20.010> on

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
server and we are now broadcasting on

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.250 
server and we are now broadcasting on
the<00:05:20.520> air<00:05:20.640> with<00:05:21.000> a<00:05:21.260> three-second

glass-to-glass latency as we can see on
our<00:05:25.770> throughput<00:05:26.640> there<00:05:28.130> so<00:05:29.130> what's<00:05:29.310> happening

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
our throughput there so what's happening

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.230 
our throughput there so what's happening
here<00:05:30.150> is<00:05:31.010> the<00:05:32.330> combined<00:05:33.330> wireless<00:05:33.930> signals

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240

travel to the telco wireless towers or

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.760 
travel to the telco wireless towers or
base<00:05:40.920> stations<00:05:42.140> once<00:05:43.140> they<00:05:43.410> hit<00:05:43.560> those

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
base stations once they hit those

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.710

the<00:05:46.050> same<00:05:46.260> as<00:05:46.410> Internet<00:05:46.800> traffic<00:05:48.110> and<00:05:49.110> then

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
the same as Internet traffic and then

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.640 
the same as Internet traffic and then
they<00:05:50.190> hit<00:05:50.940> the<00:05:51.090> server<00:05:51.330> those<00:05:52.050> signals<00:05:52.470> hit

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
they hit the server those signals hit

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.430 
they hit the server those signals hit
the<00:05:52.770> server<00:05:53.010> which<00:05:53.340> is<00:05:53.550> located<00:05:54.210> in<00:05:54.540> your<00:05:54.840> in
