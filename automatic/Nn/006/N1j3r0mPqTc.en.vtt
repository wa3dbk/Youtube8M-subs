00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.650
 all and all and welcome to a 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.440
 line up tablet points like 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.869
 today a new test concerning 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.939
 an accessory for the ipad from the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.250
 third generation so it concerns 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.630
 ipad 3 and 4 so that's the ipad 4 that 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.050
 we have to the editorial 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.529
 so this is this rotating cover 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.260
 for ipad 3 this is the manufacturer targus 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.760
 who offers this cover then we go the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.710
 discover together 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.980
 so I show you quickly 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.660
 how does it work so here we have a 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.980
 little rotating system that I'm going 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.410
 show you a little bit more detail 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.930
 here a little flap that allows you to 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.460
 secure 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.320
 the accessory is really of the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.390
 turn into a little book 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.649
 transportable i will remove it as 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.239
 those here and there if I open here is there 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.059
 we have a shell that allows you to fix 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.559
 ipad 3 or 4 alas after I you 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.420
 to show the different positions that 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.220
 we can get 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.320
 so to do you because that's it 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.040
 more than the most important on the ipad 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.850
 on its accessories etc that the hull is 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.840
 fixed and perfectly clipped 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.090
 so here I show you in detail 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.250
 but this is really great set 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.140
 and no problem it does not move at all 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.520
 you see is then after what is 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.080
 interesting is that we can see it 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.570
 so you have it like these in 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.640
 closed position that makes you a little 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.290
 transportable book and especially where 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.650
 it's interesting that we can 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.009
 to put 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.740
 like this under several positions so 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.200
 you have a position like these in 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.399
 first a second position there and a 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.770
 third position that you have like 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.689
 this is the thing that is really 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.640
 interesting is that so besides the fact 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.740
 to have it in position like these one 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.600
 can put it also seen his tour 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.840
 if you see we can put it in 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.149
 position like these like this or 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.520
 again like this it's really 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.219
 the real interest of 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.929
 of this accessory if you have precisely 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.879
 this part there that is completely 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.700
 independent is totally rotating 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.319
 it is very practical and where it becomes 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.390
 really interesting is that you 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.129
 fix like this and there hop and there you 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.870
 have a real little book that you 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.330
 can carry another trump 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.849
 interesting is that targus you 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.230
 offers here to door if the air or do 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.629
 see there I took a pencil to do 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.269
 see just slide like this 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.709
 so there is no problem and the other 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.599
 little advantage is that these magnets 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.690
 also here so it is also 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.810
 your ipad 3 during transport 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.880
 we're going so this is the room is 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.680
 indirectly so that's so it's a 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.690
 product that we find that is especially 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.120
 very good especially very good 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.239
 finished what we tested other redheads of 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.560
 the kind for the ipad usually the 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.530
 finish left a little to be desired 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.910
 especially the cache here was not very very 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.360
 well done so but there really it is 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.170
 perfect that the hull is really very 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.260
 very successful we find this product 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.910
 between 40 and 50 euros 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.310
 whether on the fnac or amazon 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.139
 we will put the links on on the test 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.090
 and that's really a small product 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.090
 very very practical and very interesting
