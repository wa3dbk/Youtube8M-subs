00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:10.719
 Today we have the final part of the test 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.849
 Renault Duster we are rehabilitated before 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.820
 readers over the fact that the cork is not 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:18.279
 be sure to wear on the key and tell 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.090
 more about what can be done 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.090
 less fuel consumption 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.570
 some readers especially owner 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.309
 logans criticized our 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.469
 sayings about the traffic jam 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.030
 be sure to wear on the key on the very 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.250
 actually it really is not and can 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.530
 remove including hang on the flap 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.500
 but it seems to me not very convenient 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.010
 much easier to open the gas tank of 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.710
 salon 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.960
 despite the fact that it will give a budget for all 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.830
 the same crossover is amazing to see here 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.810
 and hydraulic stops for the hood 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.030
 this is not typical for low-cost cars 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.429
 throat for topping the windscreen 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.729
 fluid located in this place 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:16.509
 surnames is another family trait 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.670
 got from logan 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.090
 or sander is not really very 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.830
 convenient because when you top up 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.350
 have to use a watering can otherwise 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.600
 spill all past the oil level 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.200
 check easy forelock is located on 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.200
 familiar place 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.509
 dwell on the consumption mhat 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.670
 fuel the beginning of our test he was 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.450
 indecent about 18 liters per hundred 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.399
 then this figure began to decline and 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.550
 the end of my trips 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.619
 reached about 16 liters of course 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.170
 too big for a two-liter car 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.619
 in the winter with an automatic box 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.039
 principle, our other is acceptable today 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.739
 test editor traveled in a mixed style 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.110
 both on the highway and in the city he has 

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:07.690
 fuel consumption was about 10 11 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.209
 liters per 100 kilometers in my opinion 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.489
 acceptable duster trunk especially by 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.910
 compared to Chevy's main rival 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.099
 fields 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.560
 looks very big not very comfortable 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.970
 the curtain is located it does not collect 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.629
 springs and need 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.400
 fold it folds like that 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.400
 folds 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.599
 peering trunk again see the little things on 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.650
 which saved 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.670
 this is the buzz edge of the trunk which is nothing 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.680
 not dwelling 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.140
 and is a solid metal 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.239
 the same thing by the way you can see 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.020
 in sander but if in sander it 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.970
 excusably 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.319
 no one would ever think to carry there 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.959
 boards or some heavy stuff here 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.120
 easy to scratch transport length 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.840
 folded backs do not form even 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.290
 surface remains a small hump 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.989
 here charge does not have any spare wheel cover 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.680
 hidden under the bottom on one side this 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.739
 not comfortable it will always be dirty 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.440
 other side if you are driving the farthest 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.690
 the road will show you here you will not have to 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.750
 disassemble it in order to change 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.910
 wheel only which taynichok 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.799
 can find the trunk located with 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:30.640
 right side there is a jack and 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:32.110
 Balon key with South Korean 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.900
 manufacturers advertise their 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.130
 cars claims batteries 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.459
 high capacity 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.489
 saying that there is 45 or 50 amps an hour 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.200
 really not this not so here is an example 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.620
 battery really high 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.379
 capacity here honesty 70 amperes hour 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.159
 and so it can be said summing up 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:57.080
 no blunders high 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:59.599
 ground clearance powerful engine 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.549
 unpretentiousness the doctor has it all 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.069
 necessary to be a hit 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.890
 Russian car market 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:10.599
 with you I was the publisher of the site 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.599
