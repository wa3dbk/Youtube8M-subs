00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.459
 health and indeed health was 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:06.030
 not ideal often visited doctors and 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.370
 sick doctors on the contrary advised sports 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.920

 show what you remember about the Olympics 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.340
 the trainer lebowski was preparing for the Olympiad 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.479
 Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.150
 trained deaf and on Tuesdays 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.960
 Thursdays and Saturdays we trained with 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.450
 hearing 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.669
 and no one told the coach about it 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.240
 I wanted us to go to the Olympics 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:41.310
 the load was big I was very tired 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.620
 with deafs trained and separately with 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.050
 hearing together with galea borisovoy 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.810
 we went to the gym every day 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.060
 the guys at school asked me getting ready 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.300
 I told the Olympiad that I did not 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.470
 can handle and not get to the Olympics 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.620
 competition was high especially 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.650
 were strong guys from Rostov 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.810
 I calmly treated such words 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.419
 the main thing is that I loved sports and gymnastics 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.979
 in general, I regularly attended training 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.139
 and once there were fees 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.660
 there is a lot of fuss coach for me 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.710
 worried he knew that I exercise on 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:19.020
 I do not tense very well 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.750
 I see that the coach is also tense but I 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:26.940
 completed all the exercises and took the second 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:29.550
 the place after that was the coach for me 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.960
 calm I got to the Olympiad 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:37.210
 and after I got to the Olympiad 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:46.930
 I received a gold medal for supporting pro 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:50.380
 Zhok Borisova Galya received five medals 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:53.319
 but the complete set consisted of 6 medals 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.960
 one medal turned out to be my gal strongly 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:58.060
 upset and even she cried very 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.460
 I wanted to win a full set of medals 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.009
 but I was lucky I did it right 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.860
 technique performed by the coach then her 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:09.009
 reassured then still vaganova connected 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.039
 the process was not easy but everything 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:18.389
 settled down it was fate I was lucky 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:18.389
 win one gold medal in 1969 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.979
 memoria you turn 65 you 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.229
 happy with your life 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:32.020
 when was the restructuring in the nineties 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:34.449
 it was very difficult to live the value of money 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:41.830
 there was a crisis the salary was 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:43.900
 there was not much work even at the factory 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.630
 we hung around and we were paid 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:50.590
 it was hard to pay a penny for an apartment 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:52.690
 I was forced to apply for a subsidy 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.509
 bosses bad i'm all of them 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.639
 dismissed and now the chiefs are young and 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:07:02.460
 everything got better they are attentive and 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.460
 fair and I support their opinion 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:10.750
 Now I am pretty now living 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:13.120
 better than before i'm happy i like 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:16.500
 my life was not like this before 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.500
 good as it is now 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.750
 but
