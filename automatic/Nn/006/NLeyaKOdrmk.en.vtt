00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.720 

I<00:02:57.900> usually<00:02:58.900> only<00:02:59.650> leave<00:02:59.860> them<00:03:00.099> on<00:03:00.310> for<00:03:00.640> about

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
I usually only leave them on for about

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.089 
I usually only leave them on for about
20<00:03:01.090> minutes<00:03:01.599> but<00:03:01.989> you<00:03:02.110> can<00:03:02.290> also<00:03:02.530> wear<00:03:02.890> them

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
20 minutes but you can also wear them

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.479 
20 minutes but you can also wear them
overnight<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:05.290> is<00:03:05.470> how<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.709> end<00:03:06.010> result

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
overnight and this is how the end result

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.289 
overnight and this is how the end result
looks<00:03:06.610> like<00:03:07.709> it's<00:03:08.709> very<00:03:08.920> important<00:03:09.819> to<00:03:10.060> care
