 Spanish on this occasion I give you the 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.529
 welcome to a little special video 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.610
 you know about these things called 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.710
 unboxing 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.700
 the last time I realized that they 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.460
 it bothered a little 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.310
 what it took me to open it this package 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.500
 I got it from light cake 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.020
 from change in china 'or as it is said 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.990
 that thing girls work of hans and soy 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.240
 Chinese and I took the freedom of 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.880
 previously open it to notice give us 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.550
 both in the unboxing this package is 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.850
 special because I asked for it to test 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.520
 see in which state the cubes came 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.860
 when you ask for the free parcel 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.790
 in light take and good I've taken a 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:11.300
 pleasant surprise here I came to look 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.210
 without show that you can then 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.640
 you know how this wonderful cube is like 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.450
 can notice well in perfect condition to 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.030
 Although he came for free parcel service 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.440
 free from aita and china 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.050
 this because several subscribers 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.600
 they asked about why it is 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.520
 Free shipping thought they could 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.420
 have something bad or something but good 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.510
 we take advantage of this one boxing of these 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.250
 Steps 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.030
 Well, see how the conditions of 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.310
 the cubes good this project comes 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.440
 immaculate is a great thing the 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.630
 performance that this cube has already 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.060
 made the revision before them 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.760
 I leave the link of the review of this video 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.010
 in the description part so that 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.500
 give him a little check and good as you can 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.440
 see well in very good condition the second 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.920
 step that came to me in this package of 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.069
 light cake 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.179
 is nothing more and nothing less than my expected 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.629
 and dear 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.000
 to room and get out of there this wonderful 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.250
 master more fix 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.590
 that is very cool by the way is 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.680
 transparent let's see it in high 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.610
 fucking definition how are you 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.720
 beautiful pieces transparent good 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.650
 I like them very much 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.090
 and the stickers are metallic type 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.680
 looking at it bright 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.510
 very metallic I would say I shine pretty 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.050
 although in the camera does not reach very well 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.720
 to give the effect this is these stickers 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.790
 They are metallic and well, I give them the 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.030
 first impressions of this master more 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.430
 fix 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.940
 that as we see the box if it comes a bit 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.340
 damaged here is 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.940
 tight squeezed it looks like she had 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.730
 some treatment and half doubtful in the shipment 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.640
 in transport but good the truth is 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.450
 that it was very economical to buy them from 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.640
 light take and then the shipment went free 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.940
 for all those subscribers that I 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.150
 they asked about 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.550
 because it was free shipping by light and 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.680
 that if I could bring some flaws 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.380
 I asked for this package not to test a 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.630
 boy pack two cubes to see if 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.180
 something was wrong and good the truth 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.120
 buckets because at first glance they come with a 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.100
 very very good performance at least well 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.950
 whole if the box comes a bit 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.540
 damaged as the step comes but in 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.230
 perfect conditions and I think the cube 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.720
 is what matters 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.190
 I say the box is a factor but if the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.830
 cube is good because there is no reason why 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.460
 complain the first impressions of 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.680
 this master more fix then 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.080
 at first it is very beautiful that is 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.110
 undoubtedly the stickers I tell you that 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.160
 They have a shiny metallic type finish 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.050
 that give something special this to this 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.660
 cube because it does not equal the model 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.240
 of the master more fix base black or base 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.260
 white or the blusher that will come out 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.620
 market through 51 morphium ones in 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.200
 a few more months we will have the same show 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.610
 master more fix color that is this model 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.020
 of bucket but in colors version of 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.910
 zhengzhou tour very well apparently it comes 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.490
 pre-lubricated 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.850
 that's how they sent it pre-lubricated comes 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.770
 I came with very good performance and because as 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.380
 all you know are cubes that are 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:44.560
 they deform in a very special way 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.720
 and let's give it back a little 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.160
 seems to be reduced a bit in 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.169
 your corner cutters do not have 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:55.060
 Absolutely nothing about cutting corners 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:58.090
 but it is something that does not affect much in the 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.540
 performance of this cube since it is not 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.150
 one step for speed is not something 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.540
 reference to do it in competition 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.330
 official in official tournament 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.760
 and then with that turn very well and the 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.920
 plastic quality be good we will have 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.500
 a great grandiose grandiose 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.370
 puzzle for the collection of cubes 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.529
 rubik and good as you can see 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.769
 first glance 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:27.869
 it's a very good step that came without 

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:31.259
 problems and without any defect despite 

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:34.049
 that the shipment was free and then in 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:36.539
 a few days we will upload the final revision 

00:05:34.049 --> 00:05:40.229
 of the master more fix and then 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:43.589
 we will understand a little how it works 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:46.259
 it's because he throws you that good as 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:48.989
 we all know is a variation one 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:51.869
 modification of the 3 by 3 traditional and 

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:53.879
 I'll tell you in the next video how 

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:57.469
 I was with the final impressions of 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:06:01.320
 masters more fix you have to be a boxing 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:04.050
