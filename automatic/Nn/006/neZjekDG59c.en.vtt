00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:11.750
 and with friends as they are I am Carlos or 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.480
 of my marx and welcome to a new 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.630
 video of lessons and guitar tips 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.539
 here on ropes united well in this 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.910
 video I bring you more than anything an advice 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.910
 to play easier the finger will be 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.670
 good for those who do not know the finder 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.320
 style or filner picking is about a 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:35.480
 technique for playing in the sun or alone 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.269
 touching what is both the rhythm and the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.820
 melody in the same way as it does 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:44.450
 a piano one more than with the guitar 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.450
 all right 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.980
 this advice is essential to touch 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.620
 finger style because it's about each 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.969
 guitar string has a finger on 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.519
 specific to touch is to say that the 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.530
 little finger has to touch the first 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:07.460
 rope 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:14.110
 and the ring finger you have to touch the 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:19.540
 second with the middle or middle finger 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:24.600
 have to touch the third string and the 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.600
 index finger touches the fourth string 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.010
 the strings 5 and 6 are touched by the finger 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.010
 thumb 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.580
 these strings are called low good 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.850
 and also the string rope 4 can be 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.549
 consider it can be considered as 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 low but this depends on the song 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:58.409
 It depends a lot on the song 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.109
 good on rope guard well 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.840
 this technique serves more than anything to give 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:06.149
 fluency when touching 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.239
 it does not always have to be fulfilled 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.340
 advice or is it fixed good rule no 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.160
 I think it's just this advice well 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.830
 You not always have to comply ie 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.019
 that if the song has a melody only 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.370
 the first two ropes as per 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.370
 example of titanic 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.550
 well only brings the melody to the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.540
 two first strings and good what I do 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.760
 here is that I touch the finger with my finger 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.400
 heart did not give me the first rope and 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.190
 with the index finger the second if here already 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.050
 change the advice yes because only 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.760
 we use melody of the two 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.160
 first strings so let's go to 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.920
 use our first two fingers 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.470
 this is optional voucher can use 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.010
 these two fingers to touch like this is 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.850
 optional 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.450
 this is this is for easier ok 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.849
 another example is that yes 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.790
 the song takes the first melody 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.920
 three strings let's touch the finger 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.069
 cancel then let's touch the string to 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.090
 one with the ring finger the rope two with 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:28.030
 the middle finger and the three rope with the 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:30.790
 index finger well the position of the 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.519
 fingers given the position of the fingers with 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.170
 the strings depends on the song 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:40.770
 It depends on how many strings go to 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:43.970
 occupy ok ok we already saw 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.710
 melody with the first two strings and 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.070
 with the first three strings that do not 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.070
 I have 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.500
 well, it does not make me a yes but good 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.319
 you already know how to end the state or 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.819
 pinguel picking ok thank you very much for 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.819
 watch this video see you
