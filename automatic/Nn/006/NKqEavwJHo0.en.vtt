00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.040
 so now especially to confirm the goodness of Italy's work 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.940
 gymnasts change but it is always a very high level result 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.700
 height difference that instead is noted with other countries such as China as 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.980
 we could see with the same russia when something changed 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.380
 it happens it is not Italy that trembles to see ropes pen spy but this time the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.890
 word instead of emanuela maccarani goes directly to the gymnasts now 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.020
 I really need the microphone 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.279
 to captain elisa santoni and then we feel the others gradually added 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.930
 please elisa 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.200
 this is the first time we have seen it and certainly from outside 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.750
 it is completely different than feeling on the platform 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.570
 and we made a very good and solutions as well as that of 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.890
 circles was 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.860
 it is not a small imprecision manager ita recovered very well 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.180
 ours was therefore almost imperceptible and went on 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.740
 very well 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.040
 for the rest, the execution must be performed in a very very precise manner 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.210
 - ads since I am drinking water we see the error 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.760
 Avangem on TV 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.760
 is 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.820
 the presence however I am very satisfied of the and of ours 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.130
 performance certainly as we said before would have been nice 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.000
 also confront me 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.580
 with the Russians but 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.650
 we always download our best on the platform 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.910
 and we do it for ourselves and the work we have done for it all 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.390
 staff and surely ne russell will meet soon then 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.259
 we are satisfied kideo giulia galtarossa then who I remember 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.369
 restore this text p500 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.369
 maps the impression from outside 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.990
 presented not always without pause and you saw very united and very much 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.079
 compact was but at what time there are however in the basement of 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.500
 nothing apart from the group anyway at 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.810
 showed that the same goes on 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.650
 angelica you have made this great recovery 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.880
 as before he points out banks elisa in santorini there is not so much thinking 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.939
 you need to do enough 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.120
 for the rest 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.069
 it is the same question that we did before elisa blanchi 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.090
 always live what is it that you don't have to do in fly what is the mistake 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.090
 we must not be absolutely convinced 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.709
 but even if I'm pregnant 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.919
 giving concentrations 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.329
 art 103 pears if you mark me 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.459
 do it in a simple and flexible way 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.639
 160 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:43.159
 if we think basically bonfire put to make the cashier
