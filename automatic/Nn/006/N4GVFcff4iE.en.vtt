00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.130

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.910
 could see from the title as well as 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.220
 according to the miniature it is about luis 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.900
 suare the Uruguayan monster to 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.250
 the striker of FC Barcelona in passing 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.019
 the dedication kg his jersey on the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.699
 shoulders to suarez luis which is a kind 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.050
 the caf a very very good season despite 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.399
 the fact that he did not play 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.230
 all matches this year with the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.700
 barÃ§a remains that he had started for the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.780
 clasico due to its suspension 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.940
 I think you know everything for 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.020
 what in the world in passing guys 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.120
 as you can see in this team 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.890
 I also have a neymar toth so if you 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.079
 want to see the arrival of neymar 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.270
 tomorrow I invite you to expose the 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.370
 lightning 6 c to halal video reaches 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.219
 the 400 secular tonight I direct balance 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.719
 tomorrow afternoon so Friday the video 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.640
 on the review of neymar who also 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.800
 absolutely exceptional stats so 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.629
 for this region will be interested in eight 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.920
 evenings to buy 2 million credits 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.780
 so I will put you prices like 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.610
 usually insures as well as on 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.869
 playstation since that's if he was 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.070
 very complicated to find him on the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.049
 transfer market as at every 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.240
 once a tonne this sport at the level of 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.560
 stages still 92 speed 99 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.310
 shot 92 pass 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.630
 98 of dribbles and 94 antique with the 4 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.000
 stars the technical gesture as well as of 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.560
 bad foot for 1 meter 80 votes that's 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.689
 an ultra striker already full his card 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.830
 regular game love it and there this card 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.390
 really gives me I got very 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.270
 pleasure with as you can see the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.560
 level of ratios ten matches 16 goals 6 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.210
 assists maybe you 're not 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.040
 not found that exceptional but I 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.270
 I knew how to play with Ronaldo 'record' 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.000
 breaker so I had mostly tested it in 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.009
 4 4 2 and in the end I did some 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.590
 matches in this composition on 4 3 3 4 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.210
 Convoy stories between + May 13th with 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.680
 two attackers it was absolutely radio 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.520
 phenomenal maybe I think I 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.290
 will even live a video 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.579
 with these two players so we will do 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.680
 as usual show you the scenes 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.960
 in-game next as well as the clips that 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.579
 I did with either remained evasive 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.869
 story to give you my opinion we're going 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.159
 start without further delay with the 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.560
 statins even as can see it 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.600
 everything is in the green 99 in placement 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.229
 offensive 97 years vista as well as a 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.880
 acceleration 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.680
 if you want to see again the stages I 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.349
 invites you to pause 99 in 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.610
 dribbles in 98 finish in precision of 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.010
 the 93-year-old's head is pulling from afar 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.150
 96 years penalty 95 in short passes 4 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.830
 star technical gestures and bad 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.840
 foot with acrobats and fearsome 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.670
 finisher luis suarez for me it's 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.930
 the ultimate attacker already that his card 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.270
 regular low is one of my cards 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.520
 favorite scorer this card toth 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.140
 well we will say his voice knows we can not 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.030
 really improved perfection but 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.590
 this card high this one like 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.450
 guys as serious assets compared 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.010
 to the regular card I found particular 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.810
 that his finish to me still seemed 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.670
 more impressive than on his map 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.440
 regularity even as on this clip if 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.209
 does not necessarily end there he has the rebound and 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.800
 managed to score a head is enough 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.270
 easy to suarez it's an attacker 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.890
 very complete we will say but also at 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.930
 level of the passes I was very surprised 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.940
 since the tooth the beginning of this review 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.770
 I had it nick played in 4-4-2 with 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.970
 ronaldo and he has like books and no 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.830
 sore assists with that 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.239
 place very well whether it's in the heart of 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.489
 the defense to make a call like on 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.620
 this call he made served by gary 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.540
 cahill and finish on a flat foot that makes 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.459
 purpose of without worry but also when he 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.620
 knows how to temporize and wait to make 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.239
 the pass is just to his teammate 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.830
 suarez has very good stats 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.310
 password everyone to report for 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.900
 an attacker 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.370
 why not make it play in one word 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.810
 it's even if it's not we're going to say the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.370
 best possible and I think that 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.140
 will be a bit messed up when we see the 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.970
 call like that for a scorer without 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.709
 problem even the finish of the left foot 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.330
 compared to free kicks and shots 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.470
 by far I've put you there that 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.239
 was unfortunately for me on the 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.560
 bar and that far shot that's going 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.000
 to be hijacked by the guardian I am 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.049
 not really the specialist since months 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.910
 the young attackers were mostly 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.769
 in the surface but there after 6 in the 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.420
 rest is not to worry about is 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.739
 really a monster that is all is 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.170
 because he calls me the passes 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.670
 decisive even if the ronaldo was out 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.269
 game on that goal as well as there also 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.350
 was out of play 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.880
 but it's just to show you 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.560
 how bad the finish is 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.120
 of evening that is to say that if it him 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.190
 give the ball at the right time well it will do 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.810
 goal on it's just a 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.760
 formidable attacker because here we are 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.959
 to 99 in finish anyway we will 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.760
 you can not expect other 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.560
 thing that on goals is over his 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.390
 care foot right foot left or the 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.950
 head it poses no problem 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.930
 now that I spoke to you a little 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.730
 little of all that I see myself there for you 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.709
 talk about the only negative that I have 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.850
 found against this map tons 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.709
 we will say for me it was the 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.560
 speed since on the map this has 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.150
 announced 92 but in game it's not worth them 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.890
 really i find after that rest my 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.209
 opinion but I was a little disappointed by 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.130
 report to speed even if it's not 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.840
 necessarily the most important stat 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.060
 for me since here are the shots when we 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.810
 sees them at 99 room and you look on 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.460
 7 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.870
 printed to neutral no problem 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.790
 on it but the speed for me 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.200
 it was the only downside but it's 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.060
 as an extremely fast forward 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.040
 but for me it's not worth the 92 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.410
 pulled roughly 1 88 a bit like a 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.300
 regular guru that's why I'm here 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.560
 found that this map in relation to 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.030
 speed but just a little disappointed 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.160
 but for the rest it's just happiness 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.600
 these two cards go this todd card 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.490
 if it's great look at that on 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.080
 openings the foot finish control 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.090
 left there is no problem 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.620
 this is one of the attackers here are the most 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.510
 dangerous on this I see I really 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.190
 loved playing with especially after when 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.229
 I played in the second part of re view 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.270
 in 4 3 3 4 so with just one 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.410
 attacker and suarez he was doing very very 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.030
 well the ground he has no worries 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.590
 on that he scored quite a lot 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.790
 of goals is also addressed as 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.750
 assists it's always 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.520
 important for an attacker 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.990
 and at the level of the finish that's for 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.669
 me it's something fantastic 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.900
 to have a player who is able to 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.000
 score as much as he does not need 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.560
 a lot to score it's great 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.070
 call you still look in the middle 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.139
 of the defense 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.150
 now that's going to be the end of this 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.610
 I hope you will have a better time 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.810
 for me the suarez tots and not very 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.310
 very big change we'll say by 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.870
 report to regular even though as if 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.460
 some of his stats are still 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.200
 well improved and his map appears 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.419
 better so for me it's the attacker 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.160
 the most complete game and it's something 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.539
 absolutely crazy thing to be able to 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.400
 to test having been able to offer you this 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.200
 review so you can capitulate to 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.360
 level of these benefits obviously its 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.979
 finish that absolutely deadly as well as 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.150
 his physique and his head game 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.950
 since he is very good with 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.720
 defenders the four stars of gc cnic 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.370
 as well as bad foot it makes him 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.050
 a complete attacker and there is no 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.240
 need a lot more than that and 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.860
