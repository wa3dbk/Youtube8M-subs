 hi friends youtubers i am diana de vÃ©lez 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.090
 and in this video I will show you how to download 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.759
 and use a great game like it's metal 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.590
 slug for PC fully full portable and 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.360
 with very few requirements 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.090
 I know you ever want someone what 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.980
 you played in the little machines xd 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.750
 this is a pack with six of these games 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.339
 that although they have low quality you 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.160
 It entertains a lot because it's very 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.960
 fun the way you play good 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.970
 first we will open our browser 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.949
 default and we will copy and paste 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.409
 the links that I leave in the description 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.570
 of the video I open two windows for more 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.850
 presentation in the video and understand more 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.440
 or less what I do although it's optional 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.119
 you can copy and paste a game and 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.110
 then the other but as you 

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:01.089
 want 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.309
 I'm sorry I divided the file in two 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.070
 links but it 's 4shared it only allowed me 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.750
 upload files of maximum 200 megabytes and 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.140
 I had to divide it but what 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.850
 I planned was to climb a single link 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.380
 well once we copy the guinchos we 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.259
 will open a window where we will do 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.420
 click on download after it will open 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.580
 another window where we will click now on 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.970
 free download and we will download the 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.040
 file automatically 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.040
 let's wait for us to download the 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.840
 two files well I also tell you that 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.970

 download folder and we will have two 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.010
 compressed files the only thing that 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.710
 we would have to do is to the first 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.750
 part give you right click and extract and 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.500
 click on it and the two will decompress 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.729
 files automatically once 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.710
