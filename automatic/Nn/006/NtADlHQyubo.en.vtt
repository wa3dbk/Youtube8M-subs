other way you get rid of all that will
get<00:02:47.040> rid<00:02:47.099> of<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.340> lot<00:02:48.650> basically<00:02:49.650> then<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.040> have

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
get rid of a lot basically then you have

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.009 
get rid of a lot basically then you have
to<00:02:50.250> get<00:02:50.340> really<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.670> rest<00:02:50.880> I'm<00:02:51.630> just<00:02:51.840> using

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
to get really the rest I'm just using

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.229 
to get really the rest I'm just using
this<00:02:52.170> up<00:02:52.500> here<00:02:52.739> right<00:02:52.980> now<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.700> already

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239
