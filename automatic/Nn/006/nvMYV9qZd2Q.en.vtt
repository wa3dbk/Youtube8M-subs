00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
pretty boring we almost got enough clips

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.050

to<00:01:33.090> finish<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.720> trailer<00:01:34.159> none<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.579> don't<00:01:35.939> think

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
to finish the trailer none I don't think

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.330 
to finish the trailer none I don't think
near<00:01:36.600> enough<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.020> finish<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.530> actual<00:01:37.920> montage

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
near enough to finish the actual montage

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.219 
near enough to finish the actual montage
I'd<00:01:38.610> say<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.000> about<00:01:39.329> twenty<00:01:40.079> five

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
I'd say we have about twenty five

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.899 
I'd say we have about twenty five
percent<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.710> clips<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.220> there's<00:01:41.400> there's<00:01:41.729> so

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
percent of clips and there's there's so

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.340 
percent of clips and there's there's so
many<00:01:42.090> more<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.509> we<00:01:42.570> want<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.780> get<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.170> many

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
many more that we want to get so many

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.530 
many more that we want to get so many
other<00:01:43.590> shorts<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.610> you'll<00:01:44.880> see<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
