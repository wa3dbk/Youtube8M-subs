00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 guys hello with you show spin the pedals with 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.370
 you andrew 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.919
 for there is a new finding this thing 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.519
 the computer is already speedometer here itself 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.830
 cycling computer he already works he me 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.199
 wired 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.900
 I 'll start with how to install it look 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.859
 mount the bike computer itself 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.170
 clamp retainer which holds it 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.189
 computer if i press the pedal down 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.460
 then I roll out of the guides 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.730
 let's go look like this two contacts as 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.480
 you see needles are shiny 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:42.840
 through them the data comes from the wheel by 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.079
 Movement speeds are just two buttons. 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.590
 on the button on top of the core 3z 2 mod 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.370
 manufacturer venza 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.770
 snaps into place very simply 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.510
 just inserting it automatically 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.760
 the latch itself fastens 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.010
 the wire goes only to the wheel 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.720
 I pass in the kit went to whom you 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.820
 issue price was 680 rubles further 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.360
 the wire goes here also on the clamps 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.710
 so that he did not get knitting needles and not Sharkova 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.470
 tire further we have a sensor 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.299
 who perceives a magnetic bath here 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.520
 actually the magnet itself which is fixed 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.880
 on the spokes and distance consequences of you 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.950
 I will still define myself 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.369
 the installation itself took me literally 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.490
 by ignorance more than 20 minutes somewhere with 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.930
 options that someone poorly fixed 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.450
 however the rubber seal which 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.270
 what's in the kit keeps it fine i 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.350
 already 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.090
 running around the computer keep it 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.490
 okay i think it is showing 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.740
 actual speed in advance 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.869
 warn you that the diameter of the wheel in it 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.060
 he is exposed to any wheel 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:02.560
 starts the smallest finishes 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.459
 of you the ninth of course that's how i 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.509
 fixed 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:09.640
 here also goes under the rubber sensor 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.160
 seals which holds very tight 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.190
 nothing is done to him they do not move 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.930
 shifted magnets are adjustable by 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.040
 height actually like this too 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.099
 exhibited height relative to the spokes 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:29.860
 It is very important to pay attention to 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:31.540
 the spokes did not touch the sensor itself, along with 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.200
 installed magnet because 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.680
 magnets 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.540
 act on the spokes even further 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.700
 very easy to tear down I left a gap 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:46.090
 literally millimeter that is if we 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:51.519
 compatible with all account when i 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.310
 I combined the sensor and the magnet I have a gap 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.590
 remained literally millimeter and a half 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.160
 actually it is the most reliable distance 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.410
 which empirically discovered if you 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.200
 make less clearance then it is possible 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.109
 at the moment the code and a sharp turn only 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.760
 a dream either happen maybe what 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.880
 the magnet will simply collapse into touch 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.609
 the sensor or the daughter will turn to break not 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.340
 it will break but it will be unpleasant as 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:21.010
 Parameters will get lost and all current 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.290
 speed will not be known here if you 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.489
 do further move above magnet 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.769
 knitting needles up it seems that the higher on 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.510
 diameter to lift the magnet will be more 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.730
 the speed of the show is actually the turnover 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.760
 apart from her even the very bottom here 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.769
 make the very top one turn and 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.790
 will be counted as one turn i 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:45.780
 put the number 24 because not a 24 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.489
 wheels skatki it can be looked at 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.430
 tire almost every tire 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.659
 specified size 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.670
 I have a bead 24 to 200 large 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.250
 figures show the speed of the current 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.370
 contacts give a signal what was 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.400
 computer is now cycling time 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.200
 indicates the current time once set 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.109
 on does not get off with it is very convenient 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.599
 really look at the options now 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:15.659
 what do we have by pressing the mod button 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:18.019
 several times we can scroll through what 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:22.310
 we have a villa computer by function 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:26.520
 clicking once i see the time it is 1:09 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:29.639
 a fraction of 47 is 1:09 it is so 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:34.830
 drove the last distance next 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.990
 press once it goes scan if the bike 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.150
 it means this computer is under it 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.030
 can see without a bike all 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.889
 parameters which are already new records and 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.289
 so you can see without the very 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:50.009
 bike just taking off well put in 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:52.229
 pocket allow next distance 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:57.330
 the distance was the last route and 13 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:59.630
 kilometers six nine tenths odometer 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.889
 it's so much 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.320
 this bike computer by the way is all 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:07.169
 updated every function updated 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.139
 separately this is very convenient actually 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.659
 currently covered 17 kilometers 700 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.280
 meters 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:16.380
 top speed and the most important 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.470
 thought 8 disto parameter maximum 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.770
 I have speed with a single star 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.020
 which currently stands 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.060
 I promise to put a triple star she 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.340
 same bought bought panties bought 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.990
 shirts tips so on left 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.120
 buy combo knobs and the switch itself 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.639
 front 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.889
 maximum speed of 34 kilometers and 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.199
 nine-tenths well you can when you see 35 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.539
 this is the maximum that your can 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.300
 the bike is currently up to this 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:50.370
 very little I did not like it 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.370
 Of course, I want the speed above 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.740
 next is the average speed 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.560
 My average speed was 11 8 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.450
 Now we are looking at the next parameter. 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.050
 us church it 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.740
 pedal speed 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:10.870
 morning this feature however turned out to be gods 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:13.710
 because the sensor is the opposite and it is not 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:16.659
 The idea is to set a magnetic sensor on 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.419
 frame and it is attached to the pedal pedal 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:22.710
 also magnet proper working principle 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:25.090
 as on the wheel itself, you can see a magnet 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.419
 flashing past the sensor once 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.610
 counted once and already computer 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:34.539
 What is the speed and so on? 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:38.050
 on an asterisk, it's easier there 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:40.449
 revolutions passed so much and you will indicate 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.219
 he will not need to take into account anything 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.469
 general bike computer I am very pleased 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:47.020
 when I go to cool it straight to me all 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:49.900
 shows average maximum length 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.330
 distance time for how much and passed me 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.159
 I like it very much that 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.719
 light up on this computer 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:58.360
 and not just on the rate it was 

00:06:55.719 --> 00:07:00.190
 turtles so that when i put the triple 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.050
 the connecting rod was not clear how much 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.030
 speed increases to all who 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.279
 like my idea to put the connecting rod relay 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.349
 put likes subscribe to my videos 

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:12.930
 on what you can not know the goat and it 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:12.930
 made everyone happy bye 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.770
 let be 

00:08:10.729 --> 00:08:13.870
 it won't
