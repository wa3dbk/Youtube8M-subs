00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
put some light to the bottom right there

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.369 
put some light to the bottom right there
because<00:00:50.690> there<00:00:51.289> it<00:00:51.829> gets<00:00:51.980> dark<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:53.379> so

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
because there it gets dark so and so

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.380 
because there it gets dark so and so
yeah<00:00:54.559> there's<00:00:54.859> a<00:00:54.980> little<00:00:55.190> design<00:00:55.519> you<00:00:55.850> swim

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
yeah there's a little design you swim

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.779 
yeah there's a little design you swim
and<00:00:56.809> you<00:00:57.230> come<00:00:57.410> up<00:00:57.530> here<00:00:57.739> go<00:00:58.010> down<00:00:58.190> there<00:00:58.429> and

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
and you come up here go down there and

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.529 
and you come up here go down there and
all<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.329> way<00:00:59.420> around<00:00:59.839> to<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.219> exit<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.300> this

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
all the way around to the exit so this

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.630 
all the way around to the exit so this
is<00:01:02.690> technically<00:01:03.260> not<00:01:03.679> really<00:01:03.739> water<00:01:04.220> park<00:01:04.489> or

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
is technically not really water park or

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.399 
is technically not really water park or

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
by drowning parkour you have to get to a

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.000 
by drowning parkour you have to get to a
certain<00:01:06.650> point<00:01:07.010> before<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:07.520> drown<00:01:07.880> so<00:01:09.010> what

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
along alright nope I can't fly

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.080 
along alright nope I can't fly
hey<00:01:57.469> go<00:01:57.649> so<00:01:58.070> you're<00:01:58.159> swimming<00:01:58.399> along<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.969> get

hey go so you're swimming along you get

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.420 
hey go so you're swimming along you get
through<00:01:59.420> you<00:02:00.200> cannot<00:02:00.530> fit<00:02:00.770> through<00:02:00.920> there<00:02:01.070> so

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
through you cannot fit through there so

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.980 
through you cannot fit through there so
you<00:02:01.490> have<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.850> get<00:02:02.149> rid<00:02:02.270> of<00:02:02.329> those<00:02:02.509> and<00:02:02.869> it's

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
you have to get rid of those and it's

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.539 
you have to get rid of those and it's
still<00:02:03.320> hard<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.619> fit<00:02:03.859> through<00:02:04.070> this<00:02:04.250> little

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
still hard to fit through this little

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.429 
still hard to fit through this little
thing<00:02:04.789> so<00:02:05.119> that<00:02:05.450> makes<00:02:05.689> it<00:02:05.780> even<00:02:05.899> more<00:02:06.020> hard

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
thing so that makes it even more hard

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.460 
thing so that makes it even more hard
but<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.429> can't<00:02:07.670> still<00:02:07.909> get<00:02:08.060> through<00:02:08.210> so<00:02:09.170> let's

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470

kind<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.740> quick<00:03:08.030> well<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.300> let's<00:03:09.540> say<00:03:09.690> maybe

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
kind of quick well so let's say maybe

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.680 
kind of quick well so let's say maybe
three<00:03:11.459> hearts<00:03:11.790> less<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.150> maybe<00:03:12.330> would<00:03:12.660> have

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
three hearts less I maybe would have

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.210 
three hearts less I maybe would have
gotten<00:03:12.900> out<00:03:13.080> with<00:03:13.230> maybe<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.530> half<00:03:13.740> heart<00:03:14.010> maybe

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
a heart so yeah that's how that works

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.460 
a heart so yeah that's how that works

put the parkour helmet on so we can get

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.820 
put the parkour helmet on so we can get
through<00:03:20.240> game-mode<00:03:21.240> one<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.840> that's<00:03:22.680> right

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
through game-mode one and that's right

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.490 
through game-mode one and that's right
it's<00:03:23.130> pretty<00:03:23.310> easy<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.640> make<00:03:23.840> if<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:25.140> follow

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
it's pretty easy to make if you follow

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.620 
it's pretty easy to make if you follow
the<00:03:25.709> patterns<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.490> should<00:03:26.790> not<00:03:26.970> be<00:03:27.240> hard<00:03:27.450> at

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
the patterns it should not be hard at

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.160 
the patterns it should not be hard at
all<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:28.500> doesn't<00:03:28.680> cost<00:03:28.980> much<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.430> make<00:03:29.610> and

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
all it doesn't cost much to make and

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.780 
all it doesn't cost much to make and
yeah<00:03:31.170> let's<00:03:31.440> get<00:03:31.560> your<00:03:31.739> ah<00:03:31.920> oh<00:03:32.250> wait<00:03:32.489> no<00:03:32.640> we're
