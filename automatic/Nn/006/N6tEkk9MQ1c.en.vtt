00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 prejudice to all boys rooms 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.460
 welcome to this new video 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.859
 finally boy do we make a video 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.840
 on mario kart 8 really a game that 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.330
 I've been waiting for those guys for a long time 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.400
 we will make a match online it will be mine 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.490
 first time at the moment I simply 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.020
 so made a first fair race for 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.240
 see the checks with him a while 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.900
 gamepad since it is not easy indeed 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.550
 manage something so big anyway 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.349
 as I said in the previous video in 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.150
 I did a worldwide unboxing 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.189
 I know we run I don't know what the hell 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.530
 combine we choose mario because al 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.540
 moment i think i have to be one among 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.940
 the few characters I unlocked 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.980
 this setup for now is fine maybe 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.360
 I recommend something in the comments 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.100
 some setups 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.289
 I don't know if setup is the right word 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.469
 however let's say a few karts 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.030
 particular that they are wheels 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.949
 pussies to put because anyway it's the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.600
 first time I play it seriously 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.340
 in fact, as I said, I did it alone 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.530
 an online match 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.180
 ok guys as you can see right now 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.190
 we are four players we can 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.570
 very few I find it very strange to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.129
 moment I am the only Italian 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.869
 so even if we went out of the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.260
 worldwide boys we can do anyway 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.780
 be worth 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.330
 unfortunately we are in 4 here twisted 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.640
 mansion so maybe kids and that 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.409
 which I said I will be a set track 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.040
 so among other things I started already already 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.720
 good luck, then I unfortunately have it 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.880
 played really very little got to 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.820
 just play with it as i know one 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.680
 quarter of an hour so you are just not 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.090
 you are bad in precisely commenting on 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.009
 my game choices 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.900
 here someone already struck me then 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.479
 I too launch my shell is included 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.210
 that poor guy who really is 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.000
 this path is very cool 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.040
 like a bang let's see what it is 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.810
 I can move this water 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.850
 in the water we see attention we see myself 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.899
 I move and / or try to catch that 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.450
 bradley 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.250
 let's see if she has chosen one 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.770
 different path I want to launch this 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.040
 fungus that is not running away fucking 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.689
 I wanted to say this this shell sometimes 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.900
 I confuse these things 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.980
 let's see I can come back in 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.509
 at the bottom on the track we would say of 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.430
 throw it now so this is it 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.040
 red so he should catch it let's see 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.540
 if caught very well then I have to 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.030
 try to play it anyway 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.670
 on the drift because the boys and also 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.010
 a bit the fulcrum of the various mario karts or 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.740
 at least it was the centerpiece of the mario karts in 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.490
 past take a good curve precisely 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.200
 with a skid was really salvation 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.780
 what the fuck did I do not know why but there is 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.520
 It was a kind of gila time we see 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.150
 battleship in third position someone me 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.640
 he passed it 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.320
 let's see if I can take the first one 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.820
 place something that can serve you 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.130
 against constructed and right in front 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.750
 unfortunately we see nothing of 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.010
 detail that here 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.130
 maybe I fell on a peel of 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.990
 banana damn is waiting for us 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.480
 I have to be able to recover it can go 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.209
 okay it goes from the left I wouldn't want to hit 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.490
 put the passage just not some 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.430
 miserable sometimes I do a bit of trouble 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.340
 of the drift we see jump if we see 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.300
 that comes out we see a little well we have 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.370
 three possibilities precisely of the turbo ne 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.700
 I wasted one in practice va well 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.370
 obviously there are no problems for boys 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.410
 here is his past if you want to get at least 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.480
 among the first two I do not say we are in 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.150
 four came to the last position 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.870
 really crap we see peck at him 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.239
 no what was not he did not know why 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.739
 I didn't get it anyway, let's see now 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.320
 if you want a position guys I have to 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.739
 Japanese take if my blog I 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.140
 sorry but i will really destroy you 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.310
 let's see if he puts me a coin that 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.010
 in reality it is of little use 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.010
 let's see, let's get over guys , hopefully 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.400
 I don't get pissed that cabbage is a pity 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.230
 damn it doesn't wait then I have to 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.239
 take well if curved because in the water 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.560
 I don't know why but maybe they seem more 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.190
 difficult I do not know you have an impression 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.799
 my mistake still so cool 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.799
 that hang glider how to call it not 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:06.350
 I know with that thing about mario I have to do 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.940
 well the curves qua porca misery manage 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.310
 drift is much more difficult 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.720
 damn no second position 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.330
 let's see I wouldn't 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.190
 here 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.950
 I'm second goal I expected a 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.930
 little better but unfortunately boys is 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.910
 precisely what I managed to do 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.500
 for now therefore big guy in this short 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.450
 video to show you even a little 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.790
 simple gameplay of the game if it concludes 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.380
 here if you want others they are not played 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.760
 by me but also by me and my girlfriend I 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.950
 I recommend you write it down here 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.540
