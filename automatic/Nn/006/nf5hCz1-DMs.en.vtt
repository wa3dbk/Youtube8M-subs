00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.889
 so how are you hoping they are very 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.270
 well you know we compare with a new 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.430
 video and well then this time we're going 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.160
 to be teaching him to play with 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.900
 sniper or sniper like everyone else 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.970
 they know what is being black ops 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.620
 2 and well, I already had a series before 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.300
 that was called learning about the sniper 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.220
 and well, this time he changes 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.019
 very much changed drastically what is 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.730
 the sniper since then the people were 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.009
 used to or was getting used to 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.710
 what was the sniper in the modern 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.720
 warfare 3 then good this one in the 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.579
 main street of the marginalized of what 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.379
 have to see first is that it is a 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.300
 hyper will get used to start 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.809
 the best card for my taste I do not know 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.760
 you the truth is that of that ere 50 or 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:47.149
 what is being this is the boom 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.160
 osb as but for me for my taste the 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.440
 ballista or the hurdler like you 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.980
 know is one of the best sniper 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.120
 because because good has less 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.429
 difficulty when shooting a quiz 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.730
 with different things then good for 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.040
 start what you have to do is 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.629
 use a sniper with which you 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.550
 want to dock in this case I'm going to 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.080
 use the ballista and good things 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.000
 that they have to use more or less 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.300
 that they have to go unlocking is the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.040
 ballistic CPU that is for the sniper 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.259
 do not sway so much and this helps you 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.729
 have better control of him then good 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.590
 this is going to help you a lot others 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.140
 accessories that you will need to 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.420
 having this level would be your variable for 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.610
 which is a variable because if you put 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.840
 another thing that has been the rest 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.220
 things well then you will not see the 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.780
 quisco as such 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.070
 you can put the technical average that is not 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.110
 thermal medium flame has another name 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.680
 Well, there's also what's coming 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.600
 being this the bow and the other things 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.460
 but well it does not matter very much in the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.960
 secondary is the main thing that they put 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.970
 one hour more the secondary one is being 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.500
 pistols in this case I'm going to put what 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.840
 is the crossbow so that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.190
 I do not know when I'm bored eating 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.110
 is from one ip you want to show the other 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.550
 I'm just going to change and we're not going to 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.740
 be with that same one since here there is no 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.119
 tanks not what can kill you that of 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.190
 the tanks is very good since a lot 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.180
 people were bored or angry 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.210
 very much with the 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.400
 until things exploded here or 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.590
 the advantages that you make well known 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.450
 as perk are not necessary as of 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.910
 greenish monegros as it has been in the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.820
 welfare crop 2 or 3 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.980
 because I bite the 2 or the 3 in the 9 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.020
 injury offer you put twitter not yet 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.750
 you could do the pisco so easily and 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.180
 in the call of duty modern warfare 2 yes 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.410
 you did not put in law off and play off and 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.270
 This pro did not come out what was this 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.890
 maybe cop with one I would like then in this 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.470
 case is not the exception this can 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.489
 use any country does not happen any 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.050
 problem 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.480
 one of the things that have to go 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.980
 seeing is that good will cost a 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.320
 a little more work for people who 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.350
 already played the call of duty 4 or the call of duty 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.459
 duty modern warfare 1 is a help 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.840
 great very important because then 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.910
 good at that at the time of making the 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.250
 you had to keep pressed 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.860
 a little faster what it was then the 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.600
 hand as you can see here we have is not 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.270
 as fast as modern warfare 3 but 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.040
 neither is it as slow as the el morro 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.420
 but one then well this is going to be the 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.530
 exception to the people who have the call 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.990
 of duty 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.069
 but it's not going to be a huge help anymore 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.290
 Well, it's not going to be difficult 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.400
 whether or not they are going to feel so lost 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.379
 as 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.390
 maybe I felt the moment to use of 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.560
 black ops one of the things since 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.150
 good what they have to do as 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.640
 always measure the four points that in 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.870
 this occasion are also here to measure 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.269
 the four points that we have to 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.280
 continuation in the opposite 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.319
 as you can see there are one two three four 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.609
 points and well the only thing they have 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.189
 what to do is the same as before 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:35.260
 have with the pisco selected with the 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.810
 the east or in this case I do not know with that 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.150
 go play playstation press the 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.209
 lt button and well a little more 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.730
 slow or faster you could say that 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.530
 when you had died for 31 of the cases 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.720
 As you can see it is first to put the sight 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.340
 select and as you can see look 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.680
 where he gave the shot look, look, look 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.970
 it was this cunning and good we're going to 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.099
 try it and throw your head as in 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.689
 this case they could have seen that it has 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.310
 the head in this case well let's go 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:02.500
 to remove a little more from the treasury to 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.329
 that you go see the way more 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.829
 easy to do this is to practice it 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.049
 very much since people sometimes do not 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.030
 practice I was with many people 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.639
 that the truth wants to make the discs 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.109
 but not practical or want to do the 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.760
 discs but we just go gogh the 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.989
 sniper do not practice it then good 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.250
 that will help them a lot for the 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.000
 people who want to learn to play 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.370
 peking black ops is a lot of practice is 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.050
 something very important here because if 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.730
 they want to learn then simply nothing 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.860
 more you have to practice practicing it and 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.570
 practice using the people who most 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.860
 agree or that fits more and then 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.300
 good share these and others for today 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.310
 I hope you like the video I know that 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.990
 you should not forget to subscribe comment 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.400
 and favorites for more videos of this type 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.690
 and well, while we are going to be 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.290
 practicing what are being the 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.030
 kiosks with this weapon the truth very 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.220
 good I recommend it full that what 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.960
 practice here in mante so they go 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.180
 seeing with the other weapon this weapon is a 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.580
 little slower than the balista but 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.400
 Well, nothing that changes so much 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.750
 like us carlos routing and it was good 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.130
 with this has been all for today we 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.250
 we see until the next 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.250
 bye
