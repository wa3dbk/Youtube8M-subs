00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.940 
I'm thinking here is that each of my
pages<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.060> going<00:03:27.210> to<00:03:27.270> have<00:03:27.450> just<00:03:27.750> one<00:03:27.950> sidebar

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
pages is going to have just one sidebar

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.290 
pages is going to have just one sidebar
so<00:03:29.370> what<00:03:29.520> I'm<00:03:29.610> going<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.790> do<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:30.030> I'm<00:03:30.120> going<00:03:30.210> to

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.170 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
use<00:03:30.390> an<00:03:30.540> ID<00:03:30.840> selector

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
use an ID selector

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.929 
use an ID selector
I'm<00:03:33.599> gonna<00:03:33.750> go<00:03:33.930> with<00:03:34.140> number<00:03:34.650> sign<00:03:34.939> sidebar

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:35.939 
I'm gonna go with number sign sidebar

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.390 
I'm gonna go with number sign sidebar
and<00:03:36.209> then<00:03:36.840> throw<00:03:37.109> in<00:03:37.260> your<00:03:37.409> curly<00:03:38.010> brackets

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
and then throw in your curly brackets

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.339 
and then throw in your curly brackets
there<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.329> think<00:03:39.510> maybe<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.930> first<00:03:39.959> thing

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
there and I think maybe the first thing

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.770 
there and I think maybe the first thing
that<00:03:40.469> I<00:03:40.500> want<00:03:40.739> to<00:03:40.799> do<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.310> apply<00:03:41.780> some

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
that I want to do is apply some

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.619 
that I want to do is apply some
dimensions<00:03:43.739> on<00:03:43.980> my<00:03:44.430> sidebar<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.269> I'm<00:03:45.359> gonna<00:03:45.450> go

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
dimensions on my sidebar so I'm gonna go

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.869 
dimensions on my sidebar so I'm gonna go
width<00:03:45.959> four<00:03:46.650> colon<00:03:46.980> space<00:03:47.099> I'm<00:03:47.340> not<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.519> hundred

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
width four colon space I'm not a hundred

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.729 
width four colon space I'm not a hundred
percent<00:03:48.120> sure<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.659> you're<00:03:49.019> never<00:03:49.260> really<00:03:49.530> a

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
hundred percent sure exactly what values

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.240 
hundred percent sure exactly what values
you're<00:03:52.049> gonna<00:03:52.139> wind<00:03:52.439> up<00:03:52.590> using<00:03:52.799> but<00:03:53.040> I'm<00:03:53.129> gonna

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
try a width of 250 and I'm not gonna

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.860 
try a width of 250 and I'm not gonna
bother<00:03:55.889> setting<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.400> height<00:03:56.639> on<00:03:56.670> this<00:03:56.969> guy<00:03:57.239> but

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
bother setting a height on this guy but

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.899 
bother setting a height on this guy but
maybe<00:03:58.109> I'm<00:03:58.319> gonna<00:03:58.409> throw<00:03:58.739> in<00:03:58.889> some<00:03:58.920> padding<00:03:59.700> as

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
maybe I'm gonna throw in some padding as

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.179 
maybe I'm gonna throw in some padding as
well<00:03:59.939> maybe<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.569> padding<00:04:01.019> value<00:04:01.379> of<00:04:01.560> 10<00:04:01.920> pixels

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
well maybe a padding value of 10 pixels

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.819 
well maybe a padding value of 10 pixels
there<00:04:03.060> we<00:04:03.180> go<00:04:03.299> and<00:04:03.510> let's<00:04:04.109> see<00:04:04.379> what<00:04:04.530> else<00:04:04.650> well

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
there we go and let's see what else well

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.589 
there we go and let's see what else well
let's<00:04:05.040> throw<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.280> boarder<00:04:05.700> on<00:04:05.879> I'm<00:04:06.299> gonna<00:04:06.419> go

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
let's throw a boarder on I'm gonna go

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.869 
let's throw a boarder on I'm gonna go
border<00:04:07.079> full<00:04:07.349> colon<00:04:07.680> space<00:04:08.069> and<00:04:08.400> I'm<00:04:08.489> gonna<00:04:08.609> go

border full colon space and I'm gonna go
to<00:04:09.510> pixel<00:04:09.959> solid<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:11.639> want<00:04:11.790> to<00:04:11.849> use<00:04:11.970> kind<00:04:12.120> of

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
to pixel solid and I want to use kind of

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.360 
to pixel solid and I want to use kind of
a<00:04:12.269> dark<00:04:12.540> blue<00:04:12.959> I've<00:04:13.230> decided<00:04:13.620> so<00:04:14.069> the

a dark blue I've decided so the
hexadecimal<00:04:14.790> color<00:04:15.269> value<00:04:15.659> that<00:04:15.750> I'm<00:04:15.870> gonna

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
hexadecimal color value that I'm gonna

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.659 
hexadecimal color value that I'm gonna
use<00:04:16.199> here<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.500> gonna<00:04:16.590> be<00:04:16.680> three<00:04:17.130> three<00:04:17.459> zero

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
use here is gonna be three three zero

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.469 
use here is gonna be three three zero
zero<00:04:18.150> F<00:04:18.750> F<00:04:19.079> something<00:04:19.979> like<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.609> okay<00:04:21.269> let's

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
zero F F something like that okay let's

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.320 
zero F F something like that okay let's
save<00:04:21.870> this<00:04:22.109> up<00:04:22.320> here<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:23.030> now<00:04:24.030> I<00:04:24.060> actually

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
save this up here and now I actually

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.310 
save this up here and now I actually
want<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.690> go<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:25.110> apply<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:26.250> ID<00:04:26.550> selector

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
want to go and apply the ID selector

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.020 
want to go and apply the ID selector
sidebar<00:04:28.320> which<00:04:28.530> we've<00:04:28.710> created<00:04:28.949> here<00:04:29.130> to<00:04:29.610> the

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
div so once again we've created the rule

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.310 
div so once again we've created the rule
but<00:04:32.849> we<00:04:32.970> haven't<00:04:33.270> told<00:04:33.479> our<00:04:33.630> page<00:04:33.930> where<00:04:34.199> we

but we haven't told our page where we
want<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.560> use<00:04:34.620> it<00:04:34.949> so<00:04:35.220> I'm<00:04:35.550> just<00:04:35.639> gonna<00:04:35.729> scroll

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
want to use it so I'm just gonna scroll

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.939 
want to use it so I'm just gonna scroll
down<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.270> little<00:04:36.509> bit<00:04:36.690> I'm<00:04:37.139> gonna<00:04:37.320> look<00:04:37.590> for

that opening div tag drop my cursor in

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.770 
that opening div tag drop my cursor in
there<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.430> remember<00:04:41.580> how<00:04:41.789> to<00:04:41.849> apply<00:04:42.210> an<00:04:42.510> ID

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
there to remember how to apply an ID
