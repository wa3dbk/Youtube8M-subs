 curious because I like hell and 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.579
 my surprise morning was when I saw this 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.920
 look at the cool little joquey graphic 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:12.009
 interesting the platform game of 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.960
 terror in the best clean style you played 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.430
 Clean is another excellent game here. 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.670
 available on xbox live 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.020
 then it will be the turn of 13 is also the pc 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.060
 You know what kind of game I'm talking about. 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.340
 you seem this perspective is 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.759
 platform with so using graphics 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.780
 to a river in niterói 33 graphics very 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:34.030
 good even very easy gameplay 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.649
 better together , not really, not really 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.479
 these crap that has been lately 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:42.579
 so you tried to be jealous in that 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.549
 Turned Fashion Make Zombies Movie Game 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:48.640
 lately but sad can rescue 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.429
 a little of that feeling horror 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.340
 You're in a horror game right now. 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.049
 It's cool zombies since they are zombies. 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.960
 classic even did not want a bis 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.600
 marathoners and zombies strong as hell 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.119
 who are really putting the games 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.469
 resident evil video for example is that 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.899
 I think after the code veronica 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:11.540
 shit is over and the game is not right 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.700
 sumbe nerd that they weather their neighborhood 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.090
 that had a resident was the way 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.920
 was finalized in the code and monica towers 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.900
 led lighting background 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.090
 I really liked this game. 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.049
 I recommend even people took a 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.150
 to do the service because 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.950
 I was finishing the game, I finished. 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.239
 so I can give all the support to 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.220
 respect of the story of the game takes place in 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.459
 1909 in the 80's is because I have 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.819
 afraid now are 84 86 at the beginning on the river 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.700
 seems to pay attention if this 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:47.239
 So it's a zombie infection and you 're 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.010
 having as our objective is to rediscover 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.700
 your family will try to save you 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.069
 then at that time zombie lips that so much 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.170
 Speak nowadays, do this game like that. 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.480
 the city is very lively too 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.859
 the serial dead walking who already 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.980
 You know that I'm talking about what's happening. 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:06.230
 in this region and there a series and 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.689
 many scenes of the city destroyed 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.639
 of the roads you make the places 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.560
 you do but that much remembered 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.419
 serial the walking dead 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.299
 there is also the game the walking dead but 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:19.400
 it came out as game advent the famous one that is 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.069
 click on goiânia you click for you 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.590
 walking is good too a game but I 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.400
 I think it should lights that represent 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.319
 better so the content of Sumbe system 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.049
 survival horror even i think he 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.709
 managed to portray for fear of a better 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.650
 way 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.180
 so this zombie apocalypse yes in 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.549
 destroyed cities 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.319
 survivors and trying to seek refuge 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.290
 seek help by trying to find out 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.479
 reason for this is the game 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.510
 it is a simple chart until you can 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:53.389
 view 1.92 gbits more or less away from it 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.650
 but it gives eight hours thing of game 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.299
 more or less I took to finish 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.370
 this game because I did almost everything 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.169
 discovered almost everything I did a lot 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.609
 achievements in this game I already did 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.620
 Have to find out as much as I can to play. 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.970
 for the second time to get all the 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.569
 secrets that I did not find the first 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.190
 time on tv that cool light system and 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.019
 shadow of the game so I guess it 's 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.200
 a whole different mood in the game no 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.450
 survival horror horror so-and-so 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.430
 Truth even looks cool graphics 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.410
 the game is an NGO is old but 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.690
 can be very well used in 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.000
 games this proves you do not need to do 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.350
 Giant 40-gigabyte games look like 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.210
 already used good games 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.310
 Look how nice the scene I've been doing. 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.729
 in the background it has several parts so the 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.610
 game even not bringing own precise 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.220
 Giant 40 50 gigabytes will be a game 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.800
 good weight match should light with less than 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.650
 2 gigabytes can do this a new 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.630
 the same game really first and me 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.669
 I really surprised this award is a 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.770
 of the best games this year so 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.470
 arcade games sure is a type worth 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.320
 It pays you to spend the valuable microsoft 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.510
 2009 points because I was reading things 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.310
 50 reais on xbox live 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.050
 then it is an excellent investment that 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.120
 you can do if you like 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.580
 zombie was looking for a game of weight 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.010
 Look at this literally speaking is a game 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.710
 weight is even a game of those to 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.560
 you play two three times you 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.470
 addicting an easy-to-follow story 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.729
 You understand is the character so until 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.370
 In a way, it 's 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.960
 charismatic character who told the 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.630
 if you are in search of your family 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.180
 end of the game is amazing can i 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.430
 say to you do not go from choice 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.020
 more the end of the game surprising this 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.820
 part of the controversial the first time 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.710
 I played a secret and not even an example. 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.330
 you scour the entire scenario that you 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.820
 will find enough secrets 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.710
 hidden and collectible items you 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.400
 will find it is a game that you 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.440
 really explore yourself as you said 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.030
 his graphics are very good very good 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.530
 same time I was impressed with 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.020
 this game honestly then the game that 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.610
 really recommends something I 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.470
 I realized not a thing so you have to 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.720
 whenever you have water look for a way 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.150
 to go over the floor as I am 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.820
 doing so in various game plans 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.560
 are very creative the plans of the game I 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.229
 Can I say that I finished the game? 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.000
 so I saw all the game plans some 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.289
 they're simple enough, but we 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.250
 end up thinking about crazy things 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:18.020
 when a very simple resolution is a 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.030
 I started fresh until easy but then with 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.039
 after the game you will see a 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.090
 a little more trouble makes you 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:25.340
 think 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.169
 as a survivor to you capable of 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.389
 certain trappings of the game of monsters 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.370
 From the beginning I do not have any more weapons. 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.699
 then you'll get an ax and you 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.960
 take a gun a shot gun if you go 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.490
 get in line for firearms 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.080
 help look that cool zombies 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:44.360
 then I noticed in the submenu asking now only 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.400
 so it 's almost killed me and now it's a 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.100
 choose only you can escape too 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.750
 push it in only the entire system 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.570
 survival in a game not all 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.430
 that you find anti-gambling in 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.729
 various parts of action so shares 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.110
 even in this game can 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:01.120
 make the attention even when 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.470
 you find other survivors 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.570
 when you find out if the resistance 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.220
 That's really good, I 'm not going to tell you 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.020
 do not ruin that in the game, huh? 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.790
 but I say the game is amazing 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.540
 even in all the details in all 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.940
 questions 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.070
 ahmed kit so against several night game 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.590
 so look what cool zombies on the bottom it 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.539
 it is really the very first game of the 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.070
 first game I did not expect 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:24.199
 it was that good 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.760
 Good people but that's it to discuss at 

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:28.490
