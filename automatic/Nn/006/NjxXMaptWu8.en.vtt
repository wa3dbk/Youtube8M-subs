00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
won't know it's curl safe to actually

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.770 
won't know it's curl safe to actually
tell<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> way<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.850> curl<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.239> actually<00:01:00.570> like<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.289 
curled up I actually I'm liking it like
this<00:01:37.530> straight<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.130> think<00:01:38.400> I'll<00:01:38.549> wetware<00:01:39.119> it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
this straight I think I'll wetware it

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.690 
this straight I think I'll wetware it
straight<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> little<00:01:40.110> bit<00:01:40.320> maybe<00:01:40.680> sit<00:01:41.490> for

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
straight for a little bit maybe sit for

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.170 
straight for a little bit maybe sit for
a<00:01:41.729> week<00:01:41.880> or<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.540> see<00:01:42.780> how<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.170> can't<00:01:44.180> hang

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
a week or so to see how it can't hang

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.210 
a week or so to see how it can't hang
and<00:01:45.659> then<00:01:46.560> uh<00:01:48.619> then<00:01:49.619> after<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.040> i'll

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
and then uh then after that i'll

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.010 
and then uh then after that i'll
probably<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.579> curl<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:51.750> simple

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
probably just curl it up and it's simple

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.230 
probably just curl it up and it's simple
to<00:01:52.140> curl

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
to curl

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.649 
to curl
I'll<00:01:54.930> probably<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:56.060> show<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.119> guys<00:01:57.360> how<00:01:57.420> I

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
I'll probably do show you guys how I

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.080 
I'll probably do show you guys how I
curl<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.079> up<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.409> next<00:01:58.649> video<00:01:58.890> maybe<00:01:59.520> I'm<00:01:59.909> not
