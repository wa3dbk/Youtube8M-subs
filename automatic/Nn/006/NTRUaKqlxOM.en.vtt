kind<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.069> evil<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.969> think<00:01:24.389> and<00:01:24.600> my<00:01:24.869> character

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:25.139 
kind of evil I think and my character

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:27.889 
kind of evil I think and my character
can't<00:01:25.530> stand<00:01:25.799> her<00:01:25.889> at<00:01:25.979> all<00:01:26.069> hate<00:01:26.609> sir<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.119> mean

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
can't stand her at all hate sir I mean

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.539 
can't stand her at all hate sir I mean
it's<00:01:28.079> hard<00:01:28.350> because<00:01:28.499> they've<00:01:28.709> all<00:01:28.889> got<00:01:29.249> a

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
it's hard because they've all got a

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.279 
it's hard because they've all got a
vision<00:01:29.819> of<00:01:29.969> Ashley<00:01:30.359> and<00:01:30.509> their<00:01:30.630> imaginations

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
vision of Ashley and their imaginations

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.069 
vision of Ashley and their imaginations
and<00:01:31.469> she<00:01:31.859> could<00:01:32.039> look<00:01:32.189> nothing<00:01:32.639> like<00:01:32.670> me<00:01:32.850> act<00:01:33.749> I

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
and she could look nothing like me act I

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.959 
and she could look nothing like me act I
mean<00:01:34.439> hopefully<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.009> act<00:01:35.279> like<00:01:35.459> she<00:01:35.670> would<00:01:35.819> act

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
mean hopefully I act like she would act

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.459 
mean hopefully I act like she would act
with<00:01:36.179> she<00:01:36.810> could<00:01:36.959> be<00:01:37.049> completely<00:01:37.259> different

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
with she could be completely different

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.219 
with she could be completely different
for<00:01:37.889> me<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.490> hard<00:01:38.789> it's<00:01:39.359> hard<00:01:39.840> to

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
for me and so it's hard it's hard to

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.989 
for me and so it's hard it's hard to
like<00:01:40.950> when<00:01:41.100> people<00:01:41.340> already<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.759> like<00:01:41.969> a

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:41.999 
like when people already have like a

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:44.389 
like when people already have like a
preconceived<00:01:42.420> idea<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.929> what<00:01:43.079> someone<00:01:43.289> is<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
preconceived idea of what someone is to

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.819 
preconceived idea of what someone is to
