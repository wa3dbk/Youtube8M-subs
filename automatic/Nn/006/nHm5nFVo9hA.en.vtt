00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.930
 we are on the newest boat the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.030
 very last as our yard at 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.940
 to make which is called the ix pay 38 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.470
 this boat is both capable of 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.850
 win regattas and it is designed to 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.770
 regattas and the one that is presented 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.390
 in front of you in particular shows a 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.860
 deck hardware that is perfectly suited 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.940
 to the most advanced crews that we 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.769
 can meet in regatta 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.390
 thanks to the use of technologies 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.129
 sophisticated the boat is in 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.570
 very stiff with the canvas 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.159
 that means he is capable 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.650
 to cash in difficult conditions 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.720
 without asking his crew 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.420
 so it's a perfect boat to go out 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.259
 on weekends or holidays for two so 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.940
 it's this duality regattas and capacity 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.619
 of the league and in family who is I 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.619
 believe the big success of this model 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.530
 everything on the outside all this 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.630
 who is on the bridge is perfectly 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.640
 optimized by rays win so we 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.610
 find all the returns under the bridge 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.150
 in areas that are clear of 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.770
 cockpit 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.000
 we have what is called in older 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.880
 that is to say the possibility of settling 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.320
 the genoa when we are in very 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.290
 close with a very strong of 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.700
 multiplications that comes back to the piano 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.080
 we have a carbon racket at 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.600
 the front which usefully replaces a 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.640
 retractable dozer to be able to carry 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.150
 code- like sails on the edges of 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.950
 reaching 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.410
 everything is designed on the boat so that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.100
 the ergonomics of a racing crew 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.360
 at the top level at the same time we have 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.399
 equipped the boat with a winch 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.350
 electric for the main halyard 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.280
 for when you go out alone or 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.770
 couple 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.899
 we are not a laborious maneuver 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.970
 to send the mainsail 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.430
 the ergonomics of a regatta boat and 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.140
 paradoxically extreme well suited to the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.120
 crew navigation reduced when 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.560
 really wants to go out to two what 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.840
 characterizes the interior of this boat 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.190
 it's once again looking for a 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.010
 boat that hurts for the regatta so a 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.690
 looking for weight so the elements of 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.790
 furniture contribute to the structure of the 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.860
 boat which means that in this 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.290
 boat we chose to have to 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.670
 surfaces still polyester we will say 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.209
 important enough that contribute to the 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.239
 structure 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.890
 we tried to lighten the furniture and we 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.870
 also sought to give an impression 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.870
 of light and clarity in the frame 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.640
 the innovation found inside 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.109
 it is the chart table that we have 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.879
 made the choice to have a chart table 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.920
 which can be both in the sense of 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.480
 walking 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.549
 when one is in navigation but one 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.049
 can slide to bring back against 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.150
 partitions in order to clear a more 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.439
 large bench of the square as to 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.569
 the hour of the aperitif we want to 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.859
 find at 10 around the table and not 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.810
 to have a table that clutter in 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.090
 midway this boat reconnect with 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.040
 the DNA of the society that is to make 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.099
 boats of very high level 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.099
 performance
