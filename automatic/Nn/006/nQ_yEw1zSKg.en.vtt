skills first of all three shall week for

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.550 
skills first of all three shall week for
it's<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.600> fantastic<00:01:45.899> but<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.380> works

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
it's not fantastic but it works

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.590 
it's not fantastic but it works
perfectly<00:01:47.040> for<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.280> center<00:01:47.610> mid<00:01:47.759> I'm<00:01:48.210> kind<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
perfectly for a center mid I'm kind of a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600 
perfectly for a center mid I'm kind of a
bit<00:01:48.750> disappointing<00:01:49.380> i<00:01:49.500> naturally<00:01:50.220> fed<00:01:50.399> him<00:01:50.520> in

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
bit disappointing i naturally fed him in

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.069 
bit disappointing i naturally fed him in
a<00:01:50.670> sensor<00:01:50.939> attacking<00:01:51.270> mid<00:01:51.390> when<00:01:51.600> really<00:01:51.810> had

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
a sensor attacking mid when really had

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.929 
a sensor attacking mid when really had
the<00:01:52.200> chance<00:01:52.229> again<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:53.009> probably<00:01:53.490> would<00:01:53.759> play

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the chance again I probably would play

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.850 
the chance again I probably would play
man<00:01:54.180> center<00:01:54.540> mid<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.530> didn't<00:01:55.799> have

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
man center mid and I just didn't have

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.350 
man center mid and I just didn't have
sentiment<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> formation<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> team

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
sentiment in the formation of the team

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.179 
sentiment in the formation of the team
but<00:01:58.020> when<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.259> comes<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.530> outside<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> box

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
but when it comes to outside the box

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.789 
but when it comes to outside the box
finishes<00:01:59.640> he's<00:01:59.850> absolutely<00:02:00.270> insane<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
finishes he's absolutely insane but the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.929 
finishes he's absolutely insane but the
amount<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.070> times<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.369> guy<00:02:02.520> hit<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> pole

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
amount of times this guy hit the pole

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.429 
amount of times this guy hit the pole
Schmidt<00:02:03.240> out<00:02:03.329> that's<00:02:03.509> why<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.659> sole

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
Schmidt out that's why the sole

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.469 
Schmidt out that's why the sole
little<00:02:05.189> goldfish<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.790> hit<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.030> pole<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.360> many

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
little goldfish to hit the pole so many

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.700 
little goldfish to hit the pole so many
times<00:02:06.659> up<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:06.960> didn't<00:02:07.110> want<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.320> put<00:02:07.439> them<00:02:07.590> in

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
times up and didn't want to put them in

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.680 
times up and didn't want to put them in
so<00:02:08.220> that's<00:02:08.369> why<00:02:08.520> kinda<00:02:09.119> was<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> bit<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.569> issue

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
so that's why kinda was a bit of issue

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.270 
so that's why kinda was a bit of issue
so<00:02:10.020> its<00:02:10.170> clinical<00:02:10.410> but<00:02:10.770> here<00:02:10.950> he<00:02:11.009> goes<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.160> his

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
so its clinical but here he goes to his

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.520 
so its clinical but here he goes to his
passing<00:02:11.610> he's<00:02:12.420> probably<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.989> best<00:02:13.140> password

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
passing he's probably the best password

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.830 
passing he's probably the best password
again

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
