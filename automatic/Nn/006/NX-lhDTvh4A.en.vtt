00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.240
 we are in 1983 chrysler presents 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.100
 in the usa the traveler a vehicle 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.140
 of a new kind derived from the valves 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.600
 American but based on a chassis 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.020
 passenger car offering this 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.810
 square 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.630
 it is launched six months before the space of 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.270
 renault since the traveler has passed 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.490
 to more than 13 million units in 120 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.530
 country making him the reference of 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.570
 minivans in 2009 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.790
 the traveler celebrates 25 years of career 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.800
 2009 is also the year of the alliance 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.870
 between the chrysler and fiat groups 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.880
 an alliance that signs the end of the 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.070
 chrysler brand in europe but not the 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.050
 disappearance of these models since those 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.210
 will now be marketed under 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.400
 the brand launched an alliance against 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.590
 nature for some especially with regards to 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.540
 regards the charm and glamor of these 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.579
 lines but a boon for arnaud 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.239
 belloni the director of the former france 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.530
 of the time 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.570
 when you are calm and only 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.010
 big minivans but I prefer they 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.240
 be a little bit because and corrupts 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.750
 because if the gap she is 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.170
 functional 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.729
 their fault if heroin is not alas 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.890
 I prefer it to be and in this case 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.200
 phedra it was rather square states 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.090
 it was rather square and and their 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.000
 success is that they were functional 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.280
 and glamorous then lancia has he managed to 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.380
 make the traveler glamorous and to him 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.630
 instill a little Italian charm 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.740
 to find out we took him on 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.740
 the touraine routes 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.740
 and the least we can say is 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.080
 that externally lancia was content 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.550
 the bare minimum of knowing 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.680
 slightly enveloping bumper 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.170
 reshaped compared to the American model 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.320
 replacing the chrysler logo with the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.330
 logo lancia and that's pretty much everything 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.700
 so finds the big ribs on the 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.350
 bonnet and all the attributes of the 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.830
 last generation of chrysler 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.830
 travelers 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.740
 in profile we see the big 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.830
 glazed surfaces guarantee visibility and 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.080
 of brightness of the windows darkened on 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.030
 all the back part of series on 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.010
 all levels of finish just like 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.440
 the 17-inch aluminum wheels 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.240
 polished and bottom door moldings 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.500
 chrome 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.360
 the whole is elegant and meets 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.370
 perfectly up to the highest standards 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.790
 desired by the old one must say 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.420
 only 5 m 21 long 1 m 99 wide 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.720
 and 1 m 75 in height the traveler in 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.770
 impose and force respect 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.860
 unfortunately his measurements a 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.530
 reverse his weight over two tons 2 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.209
 and his maladjustment in the city center or 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.580
 to small European roads 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.800
 the lancia travelers is clumsy 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.739
 especially as its small diesel engine 2 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.110
 liters 8 263 horses is just showing 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.430
 sufficient coupled to a box 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.880
 six-speed automatic 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.739
 it turns out sweet but slow at the 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.600
 end of the year an evolution of 4 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.660
 cylinders should however appear 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.940
 carrying power to 190 horses 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.500
 the suspensions were reworked 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.110
 to adapt to European roads 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.540
 with notably harder springs 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.070
 a bigger stabilizer bar and 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.290
 a reduction in ground clearance 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.760
 unfortunately the suspensions remains 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.220
 loose especially at the back 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.440
 if we add that the engine tends 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.390
 to manifest loudly when you 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.760
 pushes for an overtaking for example 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.680
 that the announced consumption of 7 liters 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.820
 nine to one hundred kilometers it is rather 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.299
 approaching 10 liters 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:43.330
 during our test that the 207 g per km 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.420
 of rejected co2 imposes a penalty of 2300 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.160
 euros and that noises of the rounds 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.349
 tendency to appear above 110 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.599
 km hour the balance sheet of our test 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.880
 could appear gained from advanced with 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.430
 a beautiful failure is the main 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.360
 strong point of the traveler lies in 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.660
 the cockpit its generous dimensions 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.640
 ensures an excellent habitability to 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.920
 each of seven seats offered two 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.770
 series this place that does not condemn 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.760
 the chest which then has 934 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.100
 cubic decimetres 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.380
 better thanks to the stop and go system 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.989
 each of the five back seats 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.579
 store with one hand under the floor 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.690
 thus freeing up a formidable space of 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.100
 flat load offering 2394 decimetres 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.820
 cubes when the third row is 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.560
 folded even 3912 cubic decimetres 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.690
 when the two back rows are 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.639
 folded and when the seats are 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.139
 used they release new 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.270
 storage volumes that come 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.060
 add to the many spaces already 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.460
 present in the cockpit a cockpit 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.229
 who breathes luxury and elegance with 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.840
 two sets of seats partially in 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.430
 individual leather wrapping and 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.400
 heaters for both front rows 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.960
 a redesigned dashboard integrating 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.850
 two 12 volt socket 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.860
 the telematic system connects us 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.860
 bluetooth compatible with command 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:05.640
 voice and GPS navigation a system 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.940
 2 276 watt audio with mp3 cd and even 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.039
 dvd and hard drive of 40 giga or 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.229
 still the cruise control the steering wheel 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.090
 heating the adjustable pedal and 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.350
 the tire pressure indicator for 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.080
 offer the greatest comfort to 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.610
 small flat drivers however the 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.860
 traveler was a lot less 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.470
 reworked that the tma from the first 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.300
 qualitative impression goes quickly with 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.770
 many hard plastics not at the 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.650
 height of lancia pretensions 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.090
 a shame because next to that the traveler 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.490
 has standard air conditioning 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.800
 tri-zone of opening and closing 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.550
 electric rear side doors 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.930
 and even from the safe the big class 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.539
 our trial version also features 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.880
 of the multimedia video system comprising 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.320
 including two 9-inch screen for 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.870
 that all occupants can look 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.200
 comfort pack movies including 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.000
 wolf 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.710
 arthur and keyless boot the 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.810
 rain detector and the handles of 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.360
 silver doors as well as pack 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.520
 security grouping the angle detector 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.650
 dead and multifunction mirrors 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.690
 chrome specify that the traveler has 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.640
 already serial the system helps to 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.700
 parking with backup camera 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.770
 in the end because of its size and 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.500
 benefits the former travelers is 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.300
 without a real competitor if he keeps the 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.610
 main flaws of the American model 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.710
 the traveler can also keep them 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.810
 assets that allowed him to become the 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.330
 world reference for minivans and 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.890
 even a true legend 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.630
 remember also that states and 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.270
 phedra and comes from the collaboration 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.070
 from lancia and psa and that they were 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.550
 similar in every way to the model 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.620
 French 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.570
 this reuse of the chrysler model 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.730
 is not heresy in itself and 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.590
 even allows lancia to benefit from the 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:47.580
 know-how of the leader of the segment 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:49.380
 finally billed 42400 euros the traveler 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.150
 remains cheaper than a big renault 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.850
 space while offering benefits 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.920
 far superior to the exception though 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:59.030
 dynamic services that remains in 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.030
 on the traveler
