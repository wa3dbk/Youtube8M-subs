00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.170
 and then people connected here on the good channel and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.789
 cheap good supplements 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.500
 Today I'm going to bring a very short video but 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.300
 very informative for you where I go 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.910
 It's talking about this supplement here. 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.919
 which is a protein fight world mix that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.900
 many of you asking me to record 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.369
 video has been asking to talk about it 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.769
 especially after I recorded that 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.210
 video and protein in court let 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.189
 here on the side if you want to click 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.720
 watch this video will cause will open 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.370
 the other in a new window you can 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.559
 watch while it 's right 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.449
 then this protein that does not feed the world 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.970
 in fact it is not a and pro has as if 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.040
 You think it's a protein blend that 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.260
 being a protein blend would be basically 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.940
 a mixture of proteins and here in 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.100
 ingredients of it we can see what 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.460
 proteins are used which are 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.530
 the following protein isolated from soybean 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.540
 collagen something mine protein isolated from 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.309
 whey only then such 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.489
 protein that it possesses from the collagen 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.689
 soybeans and milk whey to order 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.430
 that I mentioned here the order that the 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:07.920
 ingredients come in greater quantity or 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.750
 be the protein of soy protein that has 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.650
 higher in this protein than 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.000
 still nurses world 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.649
 a lot of people are going to give up on 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.210
 buy because they think the protein in the 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.000
 soybeans increases their levels of 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.590
 female hormone progesterone but 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.479
 guys, many articles have already been made 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.060
 that show that this is not 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.229
 It's true that people say that if you 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.460
 increase over the ona manager 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.649
 consequently their levels of 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.329
 testosterone will fall you will get less 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.369
 Protein synthesis will make you 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.710
 It has less muscle is to you 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.329
 Nor did you have too many people take 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.280
 This has already been done 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.899
 demystifying this but something that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.329
 I have against soy protein is the 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.310
 its biological value which is very poor value 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.740
 would be the source of the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.840
 food or from the source of the protein 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.609
 that it will be absorbed by your body 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.920
 whether the biological value of that food is 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.689
 high means that the body absorbs it 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.389
 your body makes the nutrients 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.859
 contained therein are well absorbed if 

00:01:57.389 --> 00:02:00.539
 of the rent but which is low 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:02.189
 nutrients are not so well absorbed 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.770
 how should the biological value in 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.539
 soy protein is not so cool but in 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.950
 The question of progesterone 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.569
 rest assured it does not have 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.370
 problem that's right for us okay 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.170
 understanding the product of the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.020
 Soybean prices we information 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.000
 nutritional value of the product it has 227 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.430
 calories that is an amount down 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.120
 so in the portion of 30 grams or 2 cups 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.069
 he has 22 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.890
 - protein per dose a quantity like that 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.690
 in 6 grams of carbohydrate 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.700
 that is not so loud is not so low so 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.650
 I think we are carbohydrates. 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.409
 difference if you are not on a diet 0 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.120
 he also has 150 milligrams of 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.329
 sodium is on the average of any protein 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.739
 has 535 74 milligrams and has no 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.810
 Calcium yet here the 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.940
 nutritional information or if you 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.640
 look at the nutritional chart so without 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.620
 tell the protein information or 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.409
 an ingredient which is composed of a 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.750
 great product but I spoke the same protein 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.730
 soybean the main compound of then is 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.010
 something then mines the isolated protein 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.390
 whey but the question of 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.579
 here because I got to 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.310
 buy it even make video of it because 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.230
 her price is very very good 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.909
 he looks like the one I bought one 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.769
 of 900 grams I picked up the strawberry flavor 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.950
 I'm talking, I like it later too. 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.209
 it cost me 34 reais plus fred 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.950
 only if you buy a certain 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.069
 amount fred ends up leaving thanks to 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.120
 you then pay 34 reais at an angle 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.859
 of protein 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.870
 It's okay that it's not the best protein in 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.609
 world by far is not the best protein in the world. 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.680
 world a mines album would be better than 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.900
 but this one also would albumin 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.180
 more expensive because 30 reais and with the package 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.340
 of 500 grams of albumin and this one 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.859
 with 30 reais we will round you off 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.540
 buy a pound then for you that does not 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.209
 have money for this protein that 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.040
 very worthwhile but only those 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.480
 You have no money, I will. 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.859
 let me make this conclusion from here 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.459
 little that still has some things to 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.109
 speak 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.180
 the product another very positive point 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.799
 His is that he comes with sorry I 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.900
 I always say that protein has to come 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.449
 with sculpture tell us the quantity 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.849
 a certain measure then every two clubs 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:02.680
 From here we will own 22 grams 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.900
 6 grams of carbohydrate or 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.650
 be a dose of this product is that 30 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.139
 grams 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.299
 another thing about it is the strawberry taste it 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.160
 I have something to talk about very much. 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.379
 Tell you guys I 'll see if I let 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.109
 a take from my last video blog that I 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.829
 I complained about this because the taste of 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.470
 Strawberry 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.690
 but when you buy it you mix 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.000
 I think it dilutes very well at 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.639
 seen but when you thin it out what 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.650
 it happens the following it does not turn pink 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.900
 I was so amazed by them 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.150
 I mixed business, it was kind of a 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.870
 Gray color knows a white almost 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.900
 leading to a 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.900
 O 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.660
 and whether or not it is a point 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.729
 negative the flavor is dating but the color 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.740
 is not and so many people would not find 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.870
 Your freshness I do not know what 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.000
 Dude, I've already done an article talking 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.039
 of the influence of colors on the 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.449
 consumer and I have already done it if you 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.500
 want to contact me I 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.319
 I send you 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.639
 so the question in color helps yes 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.979
 them if you're going to eat for example 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.050
 strawberry ice cream comes the face for you 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.419
 with blue ice cream you'll want to eat 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.860
 in the same way it is not different can 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.139
 seem fresh on my part 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.210
 It really is freshness but it's a point. 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.770
 so we have to take into account 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.680
 It's okay my conclusion for this 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.289
 product is a good product is more or less 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.910
 for the price and it is very good that I bought 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.190
 what he is very cheap and for that 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.690
 price is worth it you buy more 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.880
 only if you do not have the money to 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.590
 invest a better protein like mine 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.180
 for example, it is better that this product 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.800
 it will not protect better than this product 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.110
 a meat protein is better than this 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.550
 so he is not one of the best 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.620
 I already have taken but if you are in a 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.599
