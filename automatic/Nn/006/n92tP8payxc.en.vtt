I was very worried that there were going
to<00:02:36.070> be<00:02:36.130> no<00:02:36.310> changes<00:02:36.910> nothing<00:02:37.180> was<00:02:37.450> going<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.750> be

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
to be no changes nothing was going to be

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.410 
to be no changes nothing was going to be
different<00:02:39.070> before<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.550> crotas<00:02:39.910> end<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.300> that

different before it crotas end and that

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.960 
different before it crotas end and that
unfortunately<00:02:40.630> we<00:02:41.470> would<00:02:41.650> just<00:02:41.830> be<00:02:41.950> sent<00:02:42.700> into

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
unfortunately we would just be sent into

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.060 
unfortunately we would just be sent into
a<00:02:43.150> nerfing<00:02:43.690> cycle<00:02:44.170> where<00:02:44.380> no<00:02:44.620> one<00:02:44.800> would<00:02:44.920> get

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
a nerfing cycle where no one would get

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.400 
a nerfing cycle where no one would get
what<00:02:45.190> they<00:02:45.280> wanted<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.780> everyone<00:02:47.260> would<00:02:47.380> just

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
what they wanted and everyone would just

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.750 
what they wanted and everyone would just
feel<00:02:47.740> like<00:02:47.890> they<00:02:48.040> were<00:02:48.130> getting<00:02:48.250> weaker<00:02:48.730> and

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
feel like they were getting weaker and

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.420 
feel like they were getting weaker and
weaker<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.390> weaker<00:02:49.450> over<00:02:49.720> time<00:02:49.960> and<00:02:50.440> as<00:02:51.280> the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
weaker and weaker over time and as the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.420 
weaker and weaker over time and as the
dlcs<00:02:51.850> games<00:02:52.120> out<00:02:52.330> we<00:02:52.540> would<00:02:52.920> slowly<00:02:53.920> trend

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
dlcs games out we would slowly trend

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.130 
dlcs games out we would slowly trend
toward<00:02:54.820> everyone<00:02:54.970> using<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.570> same<00:02:55.750> weapon

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
toward everyone using the same weapon

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.720 
toward everyone using the same weapon
and<00:02:56.380> having<00:02:56.620> less<00:02:56.800> fun<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.400> blah<00:02:57.520> blah<00:02:57.550> blah

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.390 
you were doing something like the nexus
strike<00:03:49.570> you<00:03:49.750> would<00:03:49.900> get<00:03:50.050> taken<00:03:50.470> out<00:03:50.560> in<00:03:50.800> three

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
strike you would get taken out in three

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.080 
strike you would get taken out in three
bullets<00:03:51.850> you<00:03:52.540> know<00:03:53.160> from<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.460> nexus<00:03:54.880> mine

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
bullets you know from the nexus mine

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.990 
bullets you know from the nexus mine
instead<00:03:56.050> of<00:03:56.230> perhaps<00:03:56.470> being<00:03:56.800> able<00:03:57.070> to<00:03:57.220> tank<00:03:57.790> a

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
instead of perhaps being able to tank a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.800 
instead of perhaps being able to tank a
little<00:03:58.480> bit<00:03:58.890> every<00:03:59.890> single<00:04:00.730> strike<00:04:01.030> was<00:04:01.300> doing

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
little bit every single strike was doing

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.110 
little bit every single strike was doing
an<00:04:02.050> insane<00:04:02.770> amount<00:04:02.920> of<00:04:03.130> damage<00:04:03.400> to<00:04:03.430> you<00:04:03.580> so

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
an insane amount of damage to you so

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.920 
an insane amount of damage to you so
that<00:04:04.450> was<00:04:05.460> what<00:04:06.460> was<00:04:06.610> changed<00:04:06.910> there<00:04:07.360> so<00:04:07.630> the

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
that was what was changed there so the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.510 
that was what was changed there so the
reason<00:04:08.080> it<00:04:08.380> seemed<00:04:08.620> like<00:04:08.860> I<00:04:09.070> could<00:04:09.250> do<00:04:09.370> more

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
reason it seemed like I could do more

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.320 
reason it seemed like I could do more
damage<00:04:09.760> was<00:04:10.450> because<00:04:10.840> I<00:04:11.200> could<00:04:12.040> in<00:04:12.310> some<00:04:13.060> sense

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
damage was because I could in some sense

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.390 
damage was because I could in some sense
do<00:04:13.570> more<00:04:13.780> damage<00:04:13.990> while<00:04:14.350> peeking<00:04:14.800> out<00:04:14.920> before

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
do more damage while peeking out before

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.180 
do more damage while peeking out before
my<00:04:15.610> health<00:04:16.270> dropped<00:04:16.900> into<00:04:17.260> an<00:04:17.380> extremely

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
my health dropped into an extremely

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.260 
my health dropped into an extremely
dangerous<00:04:18.880> area<00:04:19.810> so<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.650> was<00:04:21.010> fantastic

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
dangerous area so that was fantastic

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.950 
dangerous area so that was fantastic
they<00:04:22.270> return<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.810> damage<00:04:23.169> to<00:04:23.320> be<00:04:23.410> easier

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
they return the damage to be easier

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.379 
they return the damage to be easier
overall<00:04:24.350> they've<00:04:25.310> seen<00:04:25.610> higher<00:04:25.940> survival

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
overall they've seen higher survival

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.120 
overall they've seen higher survival
rates<00:04:26.780> in<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.020> fire<00:04:27.199> teams<00:04:27.500> which<00:04:27.710> i<00:04:27.830> think<00:04:27.889> is

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
rates in the fire teams which i think is

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.320 
rates in the fire teams which i think is
good<00:04:28.340> oh<00:04:28.370> let's<00:04:28.699> see<00:04:28.819> if<00:04:28.910> we<00:04:29.030> can<00:04:29.180> actually

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
good oh let's see if we can actually

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.999 
good oh let's see if we can actually
finish<00:04:29.660> this<00:04:29.900> guy<00:04:30.080> off<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:30.500> don't<00:04:30.770> think<00:04:30.949> you

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
finish this guy off I don't think you

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.450 
finish this guy off I don't think you
can<00:04:31.220> but<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.120> will<00:04:32.150> be<00:04:32.389> fun<00:04:32.660> oh<00:04:32.900> yeah<00:04:33.770> pro<00:04:34.160> dunks

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
can but it will be fun oh yeah pro dunks

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.620 
can but it will be fun oh yeah pro dunks
um<00:04:35.949> they<00:04:36.949> did<00:04:37.250> change<00:04:37.669> everything<00:04:38.210> so<00:04:38.479> I<00:04:38.509> think

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
um they did change everything so I think

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.020 
um they did change everything so I think
that<00:04:38.780> that<00:04:38.900> is<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.139> fantastic<00:04:39.349> thing<00:04:40.009> they<00:04:40.819> also

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
that that is a fantastic thing they also

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.850 
that that is a fantastic thing they also
normalized<00:04:41.569> the<00:04:41.780> damage<00:04:42.050> values<00:04:42.319> across<00:04:42.530> all

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
normalized the damage values across all

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.890 
normalized the damage values across all
groups<00:04:43.130> sizes<00:04:43.550> so<00:04:43.669> the<00:04:43.759> player<00:04:43.970> didn't<00:04:44.690> feel

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
groups sizes so the player didn't feel

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.390 
groups sizes so the player didn't feel
like<00:04:45.080> grabbing<00:04:45.289> an<00:04:45.560> additional<00:04:46.009> Guardian

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
like grabbing an additional Guardian

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.860 
like grabbing an additional Guardian
made<00:04:46.610> them<00:04:46.759> that<00:04:46.880> we<00:04:46.940> could<00:04:47.210> that<00:04:47.690> is

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
made them that we could that is

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.570 
made them that we could that is
something<00:04:48.259> that<00:04:48.319> I<00:04:48.500> think<00:04:48.710> we<00:04:49.099> all<00:04:49.310> had

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
something that I think we all had

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.309 
something that I think we all had
experienced<00:04:50.150> in<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.330> nightfall<00:04:50.780> strikes<00:04:51.110> as

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
experienced in the nightfall strikes as

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.529 
experienced in the nightfall strikes as
well<00:04:51.530> you<00:04:52.160> feel<00:04:52.430> like<00:04:52.550> it's<00:04:52.759> easier<00:04:53.120> to<00:04:53.240> do<00:04:53.389> it

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
well you feel like it's easier to do it

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.529 
well you feel like it's easier to do it
solo<00:04:53.840> than<00:04:54.500> it<00:04:54.620> is<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:54.949> do<00:04:55.069> it<00:04:55.220> with<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.880> group<00:04:56.360> of

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
solo than it is to do it with a group of

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.080 
solo than it is to do it with a group of
people<00:04:56.900> because<00:04:57.289> that<00:04:58.099> damage<00:04:58.520> scaling<00:04:58.729> is

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
people because that damage scaling is

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.020 
people because that damage scaling is
already<00:04:59.750> awful<00:05:00.620> because<00:05:01.160> it's<00:05:01.370> nightfall<00:05:01.820> and

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
already awful because it's nightfall and

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.939 
already awful because it's nightfall and
then<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:02.270> have<00:05:02.419> a<00:05:02.449> burn<00:05:02.780> and<00:05:03.199> you<00:05:03.740> basically

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
then you have a burn and you basically

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.770 
then you have a burn and you basically
get<00:05:04.310> health<00:05:04.550> gated<00:05:04.849> every<00:05:05.000> time<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.300> get<00:05:05.419> shot

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
get health gated every time you get shot

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.400 
get health gated every time you get shot
so<00:05:06.940> soloing<00:05:07.940> strikes<00:05:08.270> as<00:05:08.509> a<00:05:08.570> side<00:05:08.870> effect<00:05:08.900> has

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
so soloing strikes as a side effect has

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.999 
so soloing strikes as a side effect has
become<00:05:09.889> more<00:05:10.130> difficult<00:05:10.400> but<00:05:11.830> working<00:05:12.830> as<00:05:12.979> a

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
become more difficult but working as a

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:14.800 
become more difficult but working as a
team<00:05:13.340> has<00:05:13.610> become<00:05:13.940> easier<00:05:14.270> and<00:05:14.330> I<00:05:14.449> think<00:05:14.690> that

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
team has become easier and I think that

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.960 
team has become easier and I think that
that's<00:05:14.919> honestly<00:05:15.919> the<00:05:16.039> goal<00:05:16.520> that's<00:05:16.820> what

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
that's honestly the goal that's what

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.930 
that's honestly the goal that's what
they<00:05:17.060> were<00:05:17.120> looking<00:05:17.479> for<00:05:17.720> when<00:05:18.229> they<00:05:18.289> were

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
they were looking for when they were

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.360 
they were looking for when they were
doing<00:05:19.940> updates<00:05:20.509> and<00:05:20.860> making<00:05:21.860> this<00:05:21.979> game<00:05:22.190> they

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
doing updates and making this game they

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.730 
doing updates and making this game they
wanted<00:05:22.639> to<00:05:22.759> be<00:05:22.880> a<00:05:22.909> shared<00:05:23.630> world<00:05:24.050> where<00:05:24.349> it<00:05:24.590> is

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
wanted to be a shared world where it is

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.760 
wanted to be a shared world where it is
more<00:05:25.220> fun<00:05:25.639> and<00:05:25.940> easier<00:05:26.389> to<00:05:26.479> cooperate<00:05:27.199> than<00:05:27.680> it

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
more fun and easier to cooperate than it

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.129 
more fun and easier to cooperate than it
is<00:05:27.919> to<00:05:28.130> go<00:05:28.370> all<00:05:28.699> lone<00:05:29.210> rogue<00:05:29.599> and<00:05:29.990> do

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
is to go all lone rogue and do

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.260 
is to go all lone rogue and do
everything<00:05:30.259> by<00:05:30.680> yourself<00:05:30.789> so<00:05:31.789> these<00:05:32.000> are<00:05:32.120> the

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270
