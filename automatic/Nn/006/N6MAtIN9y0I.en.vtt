00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.449 
so I learned real quick
that<00:02:12.410> this<00:02:12.560> color<00:02:12.800> wasn't<00:02:13.040> going<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.310> work<00:02:13.400> for

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
that this color wasn't going to work for

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.350 
that this color wasn't going to work for
me<00:02:13.760> because<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:15.380> washed<00:02:16.370> my<00:02:16.550> hair<00:02:16.700> too<00:02:16.910> much<00:02:16.940> and

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
me because I washed my hair too much and

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.430 
me because I washed my hair too much and
it<00:02:17.420> was<00:02:17.480> just<00:02:17.660> fading<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.170> was<00:02:18.290> already

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
it was just fading and I was already

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.610 
it was just fading and I was already
starting<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.950> see<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.160> blonde<00:02:20.260> coming<00:02:21.260> through

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
starting to see a blonde coming through

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.559 
starting to see a blonde coming through
so<00:02:21.980> what<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.250> did<00:02:22.490> is<00:02:22.670> I<00:02:22.790> went<00:02:22.970> with<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.300> same
