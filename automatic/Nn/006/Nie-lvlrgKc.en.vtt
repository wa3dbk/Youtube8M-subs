 kneading heroes with such a role 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.759

 carry weak at first powerful at the end 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.700
 games to become real 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.429
 killing machine heroes of this role 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.379
 must intensively farm gold that is 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.030
 finish off creeps 

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:12.299
 gold is needed for artifacts from which 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.430
 these heroes are very dependent on 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.049
 the hero of this role is more than once farm and 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.540
 the end of the game he will not have powerful 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:23.209
 artifacts then it becomes useless 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.209
 one of the most important roles in the game 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.700
 nannies 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:33.329
 these heroes in every way help and protect 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.549
 Allied Brew early stages of the game they 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:45.220
 make every effort to keep the cary 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:47.380
 got more experience and gold supports 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.900
 Supports are useful for your skills on 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.780
 throughout the game and they can be paid 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.780
 less attention to gold and their objects 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.360
 the task is to slow down to stop 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.440
 disable or even finish off 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.580
 enemy heroes 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.440
 make it easier for allies 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.020
 some support should be heal 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.020
 allied heroes skills or special 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.150
 objects difference support from nannies 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.880
 Only that supports helps 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.950
 to the whole team they are just heroes of the role of cary 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.950
 also a very responsible role 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.430
 designers have a skill and with which they 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.260
 can get stunned to stop or 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.890
 slow down enemies without giving them anything 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.890
 to make 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.370
 lockers she has a set of Kirov set 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.640
 skills with low recoil which they 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.290
 can quickly kill enemies 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.390
 some heroes of such a role can kill with 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.930
 prokasta that is to shower the enemy with these 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:00.280
 skills 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:02.530
 still and kill with this escaper and it's not 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.510
 quite a role in the team just have such 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.400
 heroes have a skill and that allow 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.290
 run away from the fight or vice versa 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.630
 break into it sometimes these skills can 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.959
 be damn useful and can save 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.959
 from death 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:26.740
 foresters such heroes can effectively 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.690
 farm and rock in the forest killing 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:34.360
 neutral creeps generally engage 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.130
 forestry can any hero but heroes 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.260
 with the role of the forester can go there with 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.500
 first level and farm much 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.970
 more efficient than others 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:51.770
 You will learn more about forestry in 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:53.629
 the following parts of the training are the pushers 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.449
 pusher and can quickly destroy 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:59.360
 enemy creep towers at all stages 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:02.090
 games as I said goal of the game 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.639
 destroy the throne which is well protected 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.800
 pushers punch this defense perfectly 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:11.680
 quickly destroying creeps and building 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.680
 having pushers in a team is very helpful 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.490
 and then you probably have a question with 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.420
 what role to start well or what 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.760
 hero try to play my advice to you 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.530
 start with support and tanks 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.290
 linking heroes for newbies there is
