show<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.229> hug<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.560> plus+<00:02:02.009> mean<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
show you hug it a plus+ mean but the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.850 
show you hug it a plus+ mean but the
idea<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.240> meant<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.659> would<00:02:03.780> reduce<00:02:04.619> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
idea is you meant you would reduce the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.920 
idea is you meant you would reduce the
amount<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.250> bleeding<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.570> don't<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.869> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
amount of bleeding you don't have to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.960 
amount of bleeding you don't have to
worry<00:02:07.049> about<00:02:07.110> timed<00:02:07.469> bleeding<00:02:08.099> now<00:02:08.250> if<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.849> do

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
worry about timed bleeding now if you do

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.760 
worry about timed bleeding now if you do
is<00:02:09.090> right<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.569> said<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.050> kitty<00:02:10.289> one<00:02:10.560> is

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
is right you said the kitty one is

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.860 
is right you said the kitty one is
fairly<00:02:11.250> straightforward<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:12.780> remove<00:02:13.140> this

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
fairly straightforward to remove this

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.320 
fairly straightforward to remove this
and<00:02:13.959> I<00:02:14.200> want<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.709> use<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> scalpel<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:16.060> can<00:02:16.209> use

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
and I want to use a scalpel you can use

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.030 
and I want to use a scalpel you can use
any<00:02:16.540> sharp<00:02:16.930> tool<00:02:17.019> by<00:02:17.319> put<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> scalpel

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
any sharp tool by put a scalpel

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.430 
any sharp tool by put a scalpel
especially<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:18.909> one<00:02:19.120> here<00:02:19.360> ah<00:02:19.690> not<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.379> I

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
especially this one here ah not that I

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.280 
especially this one here ah not that I
like<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:21.120> thin<00:02:22.120> one<00:02:22.330> it's<00:02:22.540> probably<00:02:22.840> someone

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
like the thin one it's probably someone

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.930 
like the thin one it's probably someone
who<00:02:23.409> use<00:02:23.650> because<00:02:24.599> it's<00:02:25.599> a<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.230> thin<00:02:26.470> edge

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
who use because it's a it's a thin edge

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.180 
who use because it's a it's a thin edge
and<00:02:27.940> because<00:02:28.360> you're<00:02:28.599> I<00:02:28.959> missed<00:02:29.799> it<00:02:29.920> talk

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
and because you're I missed it talk

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.490 
and because you're I missed it talk
about<00:02:30.340> what<00:02:30.459> it's<00:02:30.670> dead<00:02:31.079> and<00:02:32.079> because<00:02:32.319> you're

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
about what it's dead and because you're

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.319 
about what it's dead and because you're
very<00:02:32.739> unlocked<00:02:33.069> coordinated<00:02:33.670> it's<00:02:34.120> pretty

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
very unlocked coordinated it's pretty

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.020 
very unlocked coordinated it's pretty
hard<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.569> use<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.829> cutting<00:02:35.829> scalpel<00:02:36.400> so<00:02:36.610> using<00:02:36.849> a

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
hard to use a cutting scalpel so using a

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.910 
hard to use a cutting scalpel so using a
one<00:02:37.180> with<00:02:37.360> sharp<00:02:37.569> edge<00:02:37.810> if<00:02:38.079> you<00:02:38.440> can<00:02:38.560> get<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.799> is

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
one with sharp edge if you can get it is

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.539 
one with sharp edge if you can get it is
much<00:02:39.730> more<00:02:39.760> useful<00:02:40.170> as<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.829> real<00:02:42.069> scalpel

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
much more useful as of a real scalpel

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.130 
much more useful as of a real scalpel
I'm<00:02:42.819> not<00:02:42.940> really<00:02:43.060> fast<00:02:43.299> with<00:02:43.480> all<00:02:43.690> my<00:02:43.810> fingers

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
I'm not really fast with all my fingers

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.099 
I'm not really fast with all my fingers
I<00:02:44.290> just<00:02:44.470> three<00:02:45.190> my<00:02:45.370> fingers<00:02:45.730> okay<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:46.959> the

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
I just three my fingers okay so the

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:48.660 
I just three my fingers okay so the
first<00:02:47.140> part<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.650> aiming<00:02:48.010> is<00:02:48.129> in<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> right

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
first part of aiming is in the right

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.360 
first part of aiming is in the right
whoops<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.510> don't<00:02:49.690> do<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:49.989> is<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.709> bottom

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
whoops I don't do that is the bottom

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.220 
whoops I don't do that is the bottom
right<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:52.120> you<00:02:52.180> see<00:02:52.450> there's<00:02:52.629> a<00:02:52.720> little<00:02:53.019> bloody

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
right so you see there's a little bloody

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.800 
right so you see there's a little bloody
notch<00:02:53.530> there<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:53.980> I'm<00:02:54.459> going<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.810> remember

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
notch there and I'm going to remember

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.410 
notch there and I'm going to remember
lose<00:02:56.079> my<00:02:56.230> hair<00:02:56.650> there<00:02:57.010> we<00:02:57.069> go<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.459> we'll<00:02:58.150> put

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
lose my hair there we go and we'll put

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.479 
lose my hair there we go and we'll put
aim<00:02:58.629> at<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.140> part<00:02:59.409> there<00:02:59.680> so<00:03:00.040> just<00:03:00.159> give<00:03:00.370> that

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
aim at that part there so just give that

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.550 
aim at that part there so just give that
little<00:03:00.549> poke<00:03:00.849> and<00:03:01.120> if<00:03:01.989> you<00:03:02.079> do<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.319> right<00:03:02.500> you

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
little poke and if you do it right you

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.520 
little poke and if you do it right you
should<00:03:02.920> would<00:03:03.010> do<00:03:03.129> flick<00:03:03.459> nobly<00:03:03.909> damage<00:03:04.530> if

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
should would do flick nobly damage if

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.229 
should would do flick nobly damage if
you<00:03:05.739> can<00:03:05.920> do<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.129> right<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.549> fortune<00:03:07.120> that

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
you can do it right and fortune that

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.539 
you can do it right and fortune that
holding<00:03:07.659> the<00:03:07.750> scalp<00:03:08.319> of<00:03:08.379> the<00:03:08.470> wrong<00:03:08.620> way<00:03:08.799> so

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
holding the scalp of the wrong way so

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.339 
holding the scalp of the wrong way so
let's<00:03:09.909> get<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.120> jetpack<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.720> comes<00:03:10.930> off<00:03:11.140> and

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
let's get a jetpack it comes off and

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.740 
let's get a jetpack it comes off and
then<00:03:12.129> there's<00:03:12.459> one<00:03:12.760> site<00:03:13.090> here<00:03:13.390> on<00:03:13.569> the<00:03:13.720> other

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
then there's one site here on the other

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.849 
then there's one site here on the other
smaller<00:03:14.319> test<00:03:14.590> on<00:03:14.769> there<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:17.290> just<00:03:17.409> give<00:03:17.680> our

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
smaller test on there so just give our

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.729 
smaller test on there so just give our
jab<00:03:18.190> there<00:03:18.459> that's<00:03:19.419> good<00:03:19.720> cut<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.169> the<00:03:20.530> other

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
jab there that's good cut and the other

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.620 
jab there that's good cut and the other
path<00:03:21.010> from<00:03:21.130> test<00:03:21.400> line<00:03:21.519> is<00:03:21.669> in<00:03:21.880> here<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:22.389> good

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
path from test line is in here so good

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.319 
path from test line is in here so good
at<00:03:22.750> Polk<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.620> smaller<00:03:23.950> star<00:03:24.250> comes<00:03:24.519> out<00:03:24.790> now

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
at Polk the smaller star comes out now

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.420 
at Polk the smaller star comes out now
you<00:03:25.389> can<00:03:25.750> view<00:03:25.989> someone<00:03:26.410> shot<00:03:26.680> it's<00:03:27.220> much

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
you can view someone shot it's much

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.729 
you can view someone shot it's much
easier<00:03:27.639> to<00:03:27.970> do<00:03:28.180> much<00:03:28.359> up<00:03:28.540> by<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.750> way<00:03:28.930> but<00:03:29.169> just

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
easier to do much up by the way but just

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.440 
easier to do much up by the way but just
to<00:03:29.829> show<00:03:30.069> you<00:03:30.099> how<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.459> remove<00:03:30.669> the<00:03:30.970> intestine

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
to show you how to remove the intestine

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.869 
to show you how to remove the intestine
since<00:03:31.780> some<00:03:31.900> people<00:03:32.139> will<00:03:32.230> be<00:03:32.349> confused<00:03:32.879> and

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
since some people will be confused and

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.670 
since some people will be confused and
stopped<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.150> bleeding<00:03:34.329> for<00:03:34.629> now<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:34.989> believe

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
stopped the bleeding for now I believe

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.319 
stopped the bleeding for now I believe
you<00:03:35.799> get<00:03:35.919> completely<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.519> plus<00:03:36.790> plus<00:03:37.090> if

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
you get completely to a plus plus if

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.879 
you get completely to a plus plus if
only<00:03:37.599> six<00:03:37.840> hundred<00:03:38.079> bills<00:03:38.230> of<00:03:38.319> blood<00:03:38.500> missing

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
only six hundred bills of blood missing

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.190 
only six hundred bills of blood missing
so<00:03:39.099> it's<00:03:39.669> not<00:03:40.209> that<00:03:40.269> hard<00:03:40.569> but<00:03:40.720> it's<00:03:40.900> not<00:03:41.049> as
