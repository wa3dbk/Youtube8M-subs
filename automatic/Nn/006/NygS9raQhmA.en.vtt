00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.629
 it was once an iphone with 4 screen 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.400
 inches that I was kind of sad because 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.460
 your little friends with bigger screen 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.360
 They made fun of him too. 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.940
 the American people never great right 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.670
 every night before entering the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.150
 do not disturb iphone and make a request 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.340
 to his great creator the sovereign creator 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.460
 can one day have a screen 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.460
 great 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.809
 but as the boss now is the tim cook and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.980
 He likes money in the end. Day is good. 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.739
 be here 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.590
 the iphone 6 plus which is the biggest desmate 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.469
 phone created by apple so far 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.840
 So it was only 8, let's start with 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.390
 design to speak of in six bids but 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.750
 as it is exactly the same as the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.910
 and then you click on the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.010
 description of the video to watch that goes 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.399
 explaining the design is exactly the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.890
 same thing ok but the differences are and 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.850
 which is heavier the iphone 6 plus has 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:13.950
 172 grams and 7.1 millimeters thick 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.020
 against 129 grams of the iphone 6 and 6,9 thousand 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.900
 This is a little heavier but not 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.640
 It was a really cool experience. 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.439
 It's obvious to you that you have a hand. 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.509
 Little do you end up suffering a little 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.390
 more here to handle the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.009
 the menus and such but with customs ends 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.170
 using both hands most of the time 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.119
 this is an equal feature I know if the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.759
 two touches down here will go down to 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.670
 you can handle reaching with one hand 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.549
 it is a resource that the alternative but the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.560
 handling here is quiet it fits 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.450
 right in the hand the rounded edges here 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.600
 ended up providing a better 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.460
 footprint so it is much more comfortable 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.689
 use the iphone 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.430
 an interesting point that staff have 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.310
 discussed quite the iphone 6 plus 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.219
 bend looks at size if you sit 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.649
 on top of it he is finally able to bend 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.020
 but neither is it so it does not have to be 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.390
 something very heavy to power then take 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.090
 Care careful care more you go 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.510
 able to preserve the life of your 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.670
 device ok 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.209
 or played at the beginning of the video screen 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.080
 iphone 6 plus is bigger né 5.5 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.480
 inch resolution and the HD images 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.970
 on this screen that stand impressively 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.120
 beautiful iphone screen retina is 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.950
 so it's especially cool to 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.900
 who buy a phone s 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.690
 You who play like you like 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.069
 watch movies and serials on smartphone 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.040
 you will be able to check your content 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.200
 The subtitles are not small 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.730
 then you will be able to have an experience 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.329
 very cool 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.730
 an interesting feature is the way 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:54.269
 landscape so you can use as 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.680
 if it were on the ipad even then everyone - 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.420
 here you will have an access as if 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.510
 was a side-triggered ipad had 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.019
 so it gets easier on you 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.930
 handle that - and everything else has a 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.000
 important detail is the zoom of the 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.090
 display then hear himself 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.950
 the easier it is the default mode and the 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.769
 extended mode that the icons are 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.590
 on this screen here the extended mode 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.280
 It's cool because the meetings are clear. 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.980
 larger 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.130
 only you have a problem if you enable the 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.290
 mode, a landscape mode is 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.560
 automatically turned off and will not 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.989
 more power to use the iphone 6 plus 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.760
 in this position then this caveat is 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.919
 a pity because it increases the risks 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.410
 but also increases so much that it does not 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.180
 And I could not do that, so it's going to be 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.980
 a negative point for the iphone did 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:51.239
 landing on your performance with your 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:54.180
 new processor a8 all games all 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.699
 the applications could open several 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.919
 applications here that it will not have 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:01.620
 problem has several applications here 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:04.139
 open the cell wheel in a good games 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.720
 run smoothly, no problem too then 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.129
 the performance that will turn everything you do not 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.989
 will take place in the lion if it will not 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.549
 no problem then you can stay 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.549
 quiet that the performance is excellent 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.470
 the 8 megapixel camera of the iphone 6 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.959
 plus makes quality photos and videos 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.570
 similar to iphone 6 so everything 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.740
 However photos videos you will see colors 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.080
 well alive 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.470
 The result is pretty cool, it seems like you 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.000
 can record for example in slow motion 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.340
 240 front per second is also a 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.660
 established then you are watching 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.900
 It's very cool. 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.060
 the only difference of the 6 by 6 plus is that 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.060
 the sensor it brings a stabilizer 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.440
 then you will see images in the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.030
 recordings with the trembling practically 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.760
 they were greatly reduced then you 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.830
 almost did not feel I did some tests there and 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.830
 It works fine, cool for example. 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.510
 on the bike and that's where you 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.890
 I'm not balancing with a girl. 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.350
 poor phone, so it's tremendous 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.590
 pretty but the iphone 6 your se 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.630
 stabilize stabilized enough then 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.520
 with the camera a pretty cool image 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:16.160
 very cool result goes to that point 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.960
 positive for the managers camera 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:23.780
 the last but not least 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.400
 Let's talk about the battery she brings now. 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.980
 2,915 milan perez is the largest battery ever 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.710
 view on an iphone and the results in 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.230
 our tests were really cool or whatever 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.110
 iphone that is used to dying there 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.240
 you use a lot in the house of 3 4 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.130
 hours of the afternoon are of a new load with 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.770
 the iphone 6 points and manages to use it 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.260
 well and it will arrive at the end of the day for 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.570
 example I played there on a day of 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.510
 moderate to intense playing in the 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.550
 internet social networks taking pictures eu 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.510
 I managed to arrive at midnight even with 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.970
 20% battery then iphone 6 bid 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:03.180
 in this regard does not disappoint course 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.820
 if you use a lot more shape 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.280
 inter playing a lot watching a lot 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.560
 video there will not have a way there the battery 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.860
 it will end before even if you play 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.349
 16 for example all 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.169
 already had says that the battery ended up 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:19.389
 one afternoon so he used much more 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.819
 intensely ends soon you use 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.740
 moderately on a regular basis will 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:26.830
 the whole day and that's a good point. 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.800
 positive of your speech and then what you 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.960
 liked the iphone 6 plus too big can 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.810
 be an option if you are not thinking 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.300
 on mini ipad maybe just will ask me not 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.189
 phone that has large or so 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.889
 You do not like the apple itself for the 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:44.590
 since samboe only buys android you 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:46.210
