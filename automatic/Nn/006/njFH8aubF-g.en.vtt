00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
class is like I said one of the most

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.450 
class is like I said one of the most
useful<00:01:15.509> classes<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.259> just<00:01:16.530> about<00:01:16.770> any<00:01:17.130> game

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
useful classes in just about any game

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.969 
useful classes in just about any game
mode<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.479> probably<00:01:18.780> plays<00:01:19.320> best<00:01:19.680> when

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
mode but it probably plays best when

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.649 
mode but it probably plays best when
playing<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.030> game<00:01:21.150> modes<00:01:21.330> with

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
playing in and game modes with

objectives<00:01:22.320> such<00:01:22.770> as<00:01:22.830> domination<00:01:23.549> now<00:01:23.970> this

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
objectives such as domination now this

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.700 
objectives such as domination now this
is<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.299> perfect<00:01:24.659> spot<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.020> put<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> sentry<00:01:25.560> gun

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
is a perfect spot to put a sentry gun

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.050 
is a perfect spot to put a sentry gun
with<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> enemy<00:01:26.130> being<00:01:26.369> spawned<00:01:26.759> trapped

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
can see the effectiveness of the center

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.509 
can see the effectiveness of the center

acquisition is not an issue for the

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.270 
acquisition is not an issue for the
sentry<00:02:26.350> gun<00:02:26.530> that's<00:02:26.739> what's<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.069> beautiful

disperses of just about any target that

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.890 
disperses of just about any target that

problem<00:02:35.200> is<00:02:35.530> going<00:02:35.739> to<00:02:35.830> be<00:02:35.920> ghost<00:02:36.580> Pro<00:02:36.910> users

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
problem is going to be ghost Pro users

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.390 
problem is going to be ghost Pro users
as<00:02:37.480> they<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:38.260> course<00:02:38.290> will<00:02:38.709> not<00:02:38.890> be<00:02:39.040> picked<00:02:39.280> up

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
as they of course will not be picked up

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.720 
as they of course will not be picked up
by<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.640> infrared<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.170> sentry<00:02:41.530> gun<00:02:41.709> but<00:02:42.459> in

by the infrared of the sentry gun but in

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.640 
by the infrared of the sentry gun but in
that<00:02:42.880> sense<00:02:43.299> that<00:02:43.690> is<00:02:43.810> where<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.049> famas<00:02:44.410> is

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
that sense that is where the famas is

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.289 
that sense that is where the famas is
going<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.010> shine<00:02:45.220> because<00:02:45.549> it<00:02:45.940> literally

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
going to shine because it literally

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.020 
going to shine because it literally
outclasses<00:02:47.290> just<00:02:47.620> about<00:02:47.860> any<00:02:48.220> gun<00:02:48.640> in<00:02:48.880> the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030
