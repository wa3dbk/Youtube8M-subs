00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
let's see we get a good advantage point

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.070 
let's see we get a good advantage point
I<00:02:48.490> got<00:02:49.490> five<00:02:49.700> enemies<00:02:50.060> remaining<00:02:50.570> but<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.930> only

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
I got five enemies remaining but I only

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.170 
I got five enemies remaining but I only
see<00:02:51.530> two<00:02:51.560> right<00:02:52.010> now<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.400> there<00:02:52.520> must<00:02:52.610> be<00:02:52.730> some

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
see two right now so there must be some

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.950 
see two right now so there must be some
beyond<00:02:53.570> some<00:02:54.050> of<00:02:54.140> these<00:02:54.230> rooms<00:02:54.440> here<00:02:58.960> everyone

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
beyond some of these rooms here everyone

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.010 
beyond some of these rooms here everyone
turn<00:03:00.140> off<00:03:00.230> this<00:03:00.350> light<00:03:01.570> that<00:03:02.570> way<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.690> feel<00:03:02.960> a

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
turn off this light that way I feel a

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.690 
turn off this light that way I feel a
bit<00:03:03.230> more<00:03:03.380> stealthy

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.339 

I<00:03:07.790> think<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.480> best<00:03:08.629> way<00:03:08.840> would<00:03:08.989> be<00:03:09.050> to<00:03:09.230> go

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
I think the best way would be to go

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:21.720 
I think the best way would be to go
under<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:09.830> way

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
so we can get to the other side

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.129

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.300 
definitely love okay and we got two guys
remaining<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:35.710> it<00:04:35.800> looks<00:04:35.919> like<00:04:35.979> they're<00:04:36.190> both

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
remaining and it looks like they're both

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.420 
remaining and it looks like they're both
in<00:04:36.690> this<00:04:37.690> room<00:04:37.810> here<00:04:38.199> this<00:04:38.860> is<00:04:39.070> gonna<00:04:39.190> be<00:04:39.400> a

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
in this room here this is gonna be a

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.740 
in this room here this is gonna be a
little<00:04:39.669> red<00:04:39.940> this<00:04:40.180> is<00:04:40.240> gonna<00:04:40.389> be<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.540> little

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
little red this is gonna be a little

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.170 
little red this is gonna be a little
trickier<00:04:41.139> I<00:04:41.320> think<00:04:41.910> because<00:04:42.910> we're<00:04:43.090> gonna

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
trickier I think because we're gonna

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.120 
trickier I think because we're gonna
have<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:43.479> open<00:04:43.750> this<00:04:43.870> door<00:04:44.110> somehow<00:04:44.500> without

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
have to open this door somehow without

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.280 
have to open this door somehow without
getting<00:04:45.430> their<00:04:45.550> attention<00:04:45.669> I<00:04:46.479> don't<00:04:46.990> know<00:04:47.229> if

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
getting their attention I don't know if

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.810 
getting their attention I don't know if
we<00:04:47.410> have<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.590> do<00:04:47.710> it<00:04:47.830> like<00:04:47.979> the<00:04:48.130> main<00:04:48.340> co-op

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
we have to do it like the main co-op

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.330 
we have to do it like the main co-op
missions<00:04:49.000> where<00:04:49.330> you<00:04:49.360> have<00:04:49.479> to<00:04:49.570> breach<00:04:49.780> it

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
missions where you have to breach it

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.310 
missions where you have to breach it
looks<00:04:51.340> like<00:04:51.460> it'll<00:04:51.669> just<00:04:51.850> open<00:04:51.970> okay<00:04:52.960> that

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
looks like it'll just open okay that

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.680 
looks like it'll just open okay that
makes<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.650> just<00:04:53.979> a<00:04:54.100> little<00:04:54.310> bit<00:04:54.520> easier<00:04:54.669> but

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.570 

I'm<00:04:58.690> not<00:04:58.810> sure<00:04:59.050> if<00:04:59.169> these<00:04:59.290> guys<00:04:59.530> move<00:05:00.280> around

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
I'm not sure if these guys move around

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.080 
I'm not sure if these guys move around
at<00:05:00.820> all<00:05:02.070> so<00:05:03.070> I'm<00:05:03.430> gonna<00:05:03.520> give<00:05:03.669> it<00:05:03.760> a<00:05:03.850> just<00:05:04.030> a

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
at all so I'm gonna give it a just a

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.770 
around okay
so<00:05:51.830> now<00:05:52.610> we've<00:05:52.789> got<00:05:52.939> the<00:05:53.090> gist<00:05:53.270> on<00:05:53.419> these<00:05:53.569> two

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
so now we've got the gist on these two

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.529 
so now we've got the gist on these two
and<00:05:54.370> we<00:05:55.370> asked<00:05:55.610> we<00:05:55.699> can<00:05:55.849> take<00:05:56.030> them<00:05:56.180> out<00:05:56.270> right

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
and we asked we can take them out right

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.020 
and we asked we can take them out right
now<00:05:56.689> both<00:05:56.990> pretty<00:05:57.289> stealthy<00:05:57.830> but<00:05:58.610> I<00:05:58.669> want<00:05:58.970> to

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
now both pretty stealthy but I want to

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.279 
now both pretty stealthy but I want to
do<00:05:59.090> them<00:05:59.240> one<00:05:59.330> at<00:05:59.479> a<00:05:59.539> time<00:05:59.569> I<00:05:59.780> think<00:06:00.020> it's

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
do them one at a time I think it's

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:01.540 
do them one at a time I think it's
better<00:06:00.469> that<00:06:00.560> way<00:06:00.860> because<00:06:01.159> I<00:06:01.219> want<00:06:01.310> to<00:06:01.430> make

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
better that way because I want to make

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:08.050 
better that way because I want to make
sure<00:06:01.580> I<00:06:01.729> save<00:06:02.120> up<00:06:02.360> my<00:06:03.349> execute<00:06:06.789> so<00:06:07.789> really

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
sure I save up my execute so really

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
sure I save up my execute so really
we're<00:06:08.180> just<00:06:08.210> going<00:06:08.419> to<00:06:08.449> wait<00:06:08.629> till<00:06:08.810> this<00:06:08.900> guy

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
we're just going to wait till this guy

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.600 
we're just going to wait till this guy
comes<00:06:09.439> around<00:06:09.740> the<00:06:09.830> corner<00:06:10.129> here<00:06:10.340> I<00:06:10.370> think

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
comes around the corner here I think

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.300 
comes around the corner here I think
that's<00:06:10.759> the<00:06:10.879> best<00:06:11.060> option<00:06:11.449> for<00:06:11.479> us<00:06:12.099> then<00:06:13.099> again

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
that's the best option for us then again

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.219 
that's the best option for us then again
we<00:06:13.460> could<00:06:13.669> come<00:06:13.879> around<00:06:14.000> the<00:06:14.240> backside<00:06:14.509> and

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
we could come around the backside and

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:16.719 
we could come around the backside and
sneak<00:06:15.469> up<00:06:15.590> on<00:06:15.710> this<00:06:15.889> guy<00:06:15.979> but<00:06:16.280> since<00:06:16.490> this<00:06:16.580> guy
