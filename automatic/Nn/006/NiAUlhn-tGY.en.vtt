00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.930
 we just gathered these beautiful ones 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.050
 tea roses 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.160
 it is with such tea roses that they do not 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.059
 rose oil add a and in 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.559
 all kinds of lotions tonics and creams 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.449
 perfumes 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:44.000
 today I want to show you how 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:48.620
 make tonic out of tea rose petals 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.640
 for this we clean the heads of roses code 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.370
 petals we have here are 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.879
 sepals and stamens we are not 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:03.350
 throwing out we can also make them 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:06.020
 rose water or use them not 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:11.000
 live to make tonic and from tea 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:15.590
 roses use empty water tank 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.580
 and with alcohol I poured one-third 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:23.950
 alcohol and more water of course 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.530
 what we do we take petals 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.069
 neatly 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.069
 we are laying the bank 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:39.439
 such a beauty turned out to look 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:48.880
 decor and wonderful we are now a little bit 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:53.600
 mix combined alcohol and water and now 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:57.969
 add our jar our task 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:02.979
 fill a can 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:08.539
 so that no air left you closed 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:10.399
 21 days our jar should stand in 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.480
 dark place and every day of course 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.950
 preferably shake it or 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.250
 flip over like that for two or three 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.390
 enough liquid 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.950
 washed petals chose the most 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.650
 useful ones and then just stay 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.250
 pour into a convenient bottle and lubricate 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.250
