in<00:00:03.389> 2006<00:00:04.259> gigabyte<00:00:04.830> launched<00:00:05.220> our<00:00:05.370> ultra

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
in 2006 gigabyte launched our ultra

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.360 
in 2006 gigabyte launched our ultra
durable<00:00:06.060> technology<00:00:06.930> basically<00:00:07.680> our<00:00:08.160> whole

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
durable technology basically our whole

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.490 
durable technology basically our whole
concept<00:00:08.639> was<00:00:09.059> adding<00:00:09.599> higher<00:00:09.870> quality

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
concept was adding higher quality

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.470 
concept was adding higher quality
components<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.099> our<00:00:11.190> motherboards<00:00:11.700> because

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
components to our motherboards because

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.780 
components to our motherboards because
that<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:13.110> effect<00:00:13.530> made<00:00:14.009> higher<00:00:14.309> quality

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
that in effect made higher quality

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.849 
that in effect made higher quality
motherboards<00:00:15.389> for<00:00:15.450> our<00:00:15.660> customers<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.589> the

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
motherboards for our customers so the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.189 
motherboards for our customers so the
idea<00:00:17.189> was<00:00:17.579> to<00:00:17.609> develop<00:00:18.329> this<00:00:18.749> testing

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
idea was to develop this testing

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.829 
idea was to develop this testing
facility<00:00:19.710> at<00:00:20.099> our<00:00:20.369> Factory<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.149> Taiwan<00:00:21.509> and

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:21.839 
facility at our Factory in Taiwan and

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.829 
facility at our Factory in Taiwan and
actually<00:00:22.679> do<00:00:23.220> full<00:00:23.519> system<00:00:23.939> testing<00:00:24.479> for<00:00:24.689> each

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:24.839 
actually do full system testing for each

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.259 
actually do full system testing for each
single<00:00:25.109> motherboard<00:00:25.649> so<00:00:26.640> that's<00:00:26.819> what<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.089> did

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
single motherboard so that's what we did

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.769 
single motherboard so that's what we did
a<00:00:28.109> few<00:00:28.439> months<00:00:28.649> ago<00:00:28.739> we<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.759> built<00:00:29.999> a<00:00:30.449> new

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
a few months ago we we built a new

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.259 
a few months ago we we built a new
facility<00:00:30.989> within<00:00:31.800> our<00:00:31.919> factory<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.579> it's

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269 
facility within our factory and it's

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:35.240 
facility within our factory and it's
capable<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.929> testing<00:00:34.170> thousands<00:00:35.129> of

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
capable of testing thousands of

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.189 
capable of testing thousands of
motherboards<00:00:35.730> at<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.910> time<00:00:36.149> each<00:00:36.840> Black

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
motherboards at a time each Black

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.319 
motherboards at a time each Black
Edition<00:00:37.350> motherboard<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.280> tested<00:00:38.969> at<00:00:39.179> our

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
Edition motherboard is tested at our

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.279 
Edition motherboard is tested at our
facility<00:00:39.839> in<00:00:39.960> Taiwan<00:00:40.379> it's<00:00:40.890> tested<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:42.289> 168

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
facility in Taiwan it's tested for 168

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.239 
facility in Taiwan it's tested for 168
hours<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.339> this<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.670> one<00:00:44.940> week<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:46.019> full<00:00:46.679> system

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
hours so this is one week a full system

00:00:47.249 --> 00:01:50.530 
hours so this is one week a full system
testing

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.480 

so<00:01:50.990> gigabytes<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:51.560> only<00:01:51.920> motherboard

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
so gigabytes the only motherboard

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.800 
so gigabytes the only motherboard
manufacturer<00:01:53.000> that<00:01:53.149> still<00:01:53.420> has

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
manufacturer that still has

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.170 
manufacturer that still has
manufacturing<00:01:54.619> in<00:01:54.710> Taiwan<00:01:55.130> we've<00:01:56.000> got<00:01:56.149> a

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
manufacturing in Taiwan we've got a

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.870 
manufacturing in Taiwan we've got a
factory<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.229> taou<00:01:58.009> yuen<00:01:58.340> which<00:01:58.580> is<00:01:58.700> about

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
factory and taou yuen which is about

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.270 
factory and taou yuen which is about
oates<00:01:59.180> hour<00:01:59.720> outside<00:02:00.049> of<00:02:00.259> taipei<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:01.220> know

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
oates hour outside of taipei you know

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.880 
oates hour outside of taipei you know
production<00:02:01.790> quality<00:02:02.330> is<00:02:02.450> high<00:02:02.659> in<00:02:02.810> Taiwan<00:02:03.229> we

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
production quality is high in Taiwan we

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.219 
production quality is high in Taiwan we
have<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.130> good<00:02:04.700> staff<00:02:05.000> of<00:02:05.329> workers<00:02:05.990> at<00:02:06.140> our
