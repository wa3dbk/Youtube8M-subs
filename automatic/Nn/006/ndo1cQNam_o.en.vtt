let's see what you think of the sound
that's<00:02:03.210> coming<00:02:03.270> out<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:05.329> so<00:02:06.329> now<00:02:06.509> it's<00:02:06.689> seen

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
that's coming out of it so now it's seen

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.790 
that's coming out of it so now it's seen
and<00:02:09.280> we<00:02:09.459> put<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.700> volume<00:02:09.880> 4<00:02:10.360> so<00:02:10.869> if<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.530> just

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
and we put the volume 4 so if you just

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.370 
and we put the volume 4 so if you just
the<00:02:11.980> volume<00:02:12.280> on<00:02:12.430> your<00:02:12.459> actual<00:02:12.700> iphone<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:14.170> will

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
the volume on your actual iphone it will

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.400 
the volume on your actual iphone it will
adjust<00:02:14.500> on<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.010> ipod<00:02:15.640> dock<00:02:15.819> itself<00:02:16.319> so<00:02:17.319> they

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
adjust on the ipod dock itself so they

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.979 
adjust on the ipod dock itself so they
put<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.770> half<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.420> if<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.510> just<00:02:19.660> hit<00:02:19.840> play

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
put it to half and if you just hit play

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.729 
put it to half and if you just hit play
with<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.380> remote<00:02:21.300> start<00:02:22.300> playing<00:02:25.530> just<00:02:26.530> max

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
with the remote start playing just max

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:34.580 
with the remote start playing just max
it<00:02:26.950> out

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.339 

this<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.580> technology<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.720> Diane<00:02:37.110> gun

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
this is the technology and to Diane gun

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.199 
this is the technology and to Diane gun
so<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:37.860> will<00:02:38.069> give<00:02:38.099> you<00:02:38.280> some<00:02:38.550> idea<00:02:38.910> on<00:02:39.030> the

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
so that will give you some idea on the

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.930 
so that will give you some idea on the
sound<00:02:39.560> I've<00:02:40.560> gotta<00:02:40.830> say<00:02:41.069> this<00:02:41.340> does<00:02:41.670> produce

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
sound I've gotta say this does produce

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.900

toggling with the subwoofer for a few
minutes<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.760> finding<00:02:48.180> out<00:02:48.300> how<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.080> make<00:02:49.319> it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
minutes and finding out how to make it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.979 
minutes and finding out how to make it
sound<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.830> best<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.970> sounds<00:02:51.360> brilliant<00:02:51.599> at

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.050 
sound the best it sounds brilliant at
first<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.440> wasn't<00:02:52.620> too<00:02:52.799> keen<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.220> but<00:02:53.519> after

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
first I wasn't too keen on it but after

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.940 
first I wasn't too keen on it but after
turning<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.720> sub<00:02:54.959> off<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.349> really<00:02:55.680> do<00:02:55.799> get

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
turning the sub off you really do get

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.820 
turning the sub off you really do get
that<00:02:56.129> nice<00:02:56.310> base<00:02:56.610> effect<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.360> also<00:02:58.319> there<00:02:58.799> is

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
that nice base effect and also there is

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:09.729 
that nice base effect and also there is
FM<00:02:59.340> radio<00:03:03.620> auxiliary<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:05.370> that's<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.640> radio

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.009 

so<00:03:10.739> that's<00:03:10.920> four<00:03:11.190> blasts<00:03:11.459> radio<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.450> ipod

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
so that's four blasts radio so the ipod

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.949 
so that's four blasts radio so the ipod
ipod<00:03:13.200> dock<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.620> on<00:03:13.739> full<00:03:13.980> blast<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.489> minute
