00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.339
 hi people thank you for your decision 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.320
 get to my display check of the 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.690
 blackberry cruz we'll see each other now 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.000
 look how is the sharpest meadows 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.070
 the details we are the angles and 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.050
 called the color representation is there any 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.300
 something to complain yes or no 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.410
 We'll start with that first 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.470
 Show us that we have the maximum 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.210
 brightness level have been adjusted 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.610
 it must be said that the brightness at 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.830
 blackberry always and always really 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.309
 is automatically regulated and indeed over 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.460
 the included or installed 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.260
 light sensor 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.879
 that means we can get down here in the 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.159
 Settings only roughly a rough one 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.339
 Setting the direction he says in the high 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:43.210
 area or less well 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.010
 accordingly, the whole 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.109
 now too bad for that 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.449
 can be shown dark because that 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:52.030
 until we get darker with it it is 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.559
 That's why the light stays on here 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.210
 stay light and we'll take a look now 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.750
 the details of 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.989
 in blackberry q10 is a 3.1 inch 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.330
 big super amoled panel with 24 bit 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.640
 processed color depth that means it 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.990
 no total of 16.7 million colors 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.880
 720 pixels x 720 pixels are displayed 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.050
 is the resolution that we achieve 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.210
 a pp share of 330 and because it is a 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.800
 square completely square 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.759
 format, we also have a one too 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.290
 one picture format 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.149
 Let's have some pictures 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.159
 I look at a few of them 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.740
 have already pre-installed and how 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.210
 always, we start with the range of what 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.340
 we can see here 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.979
 of course it is now from the resolution 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.080
 Absolutely not for this picture 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.850
 made because it is a square 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.830
 format is we can say but that 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.780
 we 'll say a few on the right and left 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.179
 sometimes gray bars see what actually 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.250
 for the oled panels relatively unusual 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.560
 is because it does not produce artificially 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.810
 otherwise one has to say likewise 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.970
 that the colors are really very beautiful 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.539
 are the color rendering looks neat 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.850
 out 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.890
 that yes, I say, white is so 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.439
 Little to the camp gray if you ask me 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.509
 so no nice course is white 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.220
 all other colors are very strong 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.729
 while luminosity how to make it of super 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.519
 amoled amoled panel or may know 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.290
 Watch the colors briefly through the 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.030
 is blue and the blue really looks 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.950
 very nice is screen is 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.470
 completely lit there is no 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.329
 great color defect or the edges 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.220
 are higher illuminated than others 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:28.670
 so here everything is in order of the blue 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.260
 value in itself is beautiful and looks exactly 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.780
 even when the green is out of the green has 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.090
 is very very strong I would say 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.769
 almost unnatural because 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.510
 the amoled panel will be there 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.730
 colors are always a little oversaturated 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.579
 shown the yellow also looks 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.920
 very very beautiful very strong and you what 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.720
 you say they are with us from watching 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.820
 when the red is still red at the end 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.100
 I like it very much again 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.989
 really very good 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.570
 beautiful color shown here 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.970
 Let's have a look at everyday photos 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.220
 for example what so it is grill time 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.739
 So you need a little salad 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.510
 of course also a grill and 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.069
 nice weather as well as meat but that 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.439
 does not matter here 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.239
 what should i say to see the details 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.219
 They are all very beautiful , they drive 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.590
 a wonderful and the picture is 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:19.819
 super sharp the resolution for this 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.659
 Of course, small display is also something like that 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.159
 I say 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.799
 we can do a little the 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:28.639
 look at the angle so it is up to us 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.739
 in front of us we turn the whole time and 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:33.290
 something falls on the one or the other 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.450
 display is in matters yes 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.489
 viewing angle stability very good 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.319
 if it is light then it reflects 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.659
 of course here and there a little bit but 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.340
 sharpness colors and also the details 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.530
 even in a high way, stay with him 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.079
 you still have to get there 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.849
 absolutely no worries keep on going 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.799
 with the potato salad the colors here 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.299
 look a bit stale 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.060
 So the potato salad could already 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.659
 Otherwise, everything is fine for three days 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.750
 very well 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.579
 the cucumber salad but that looks nice 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.379
 from there you can ever pure white 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.819
 if you do not eat meat or just 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.239
 wants to have a great addition 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.680
 wonderful here, too, the colors okay 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.949
 one of my favorite pictures is this 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.150
 here with the sheep rolls on 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:16.370
 I have a specific name 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.959
 but just do not know the details 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.729
 look very good as well as here 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.799
 the sharpness and the colors, too 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:26.530
 do you see already here is everything 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:29.060
 wonderful and now we come to 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.120
 main player to the protagonist for 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.280
 meat the meat stands a little over 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.900
 set that does not really mean 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.550
 Of course the colors are very nice 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.970
 nice in itself and still work well 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.729
 together 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.070
 but a natural color rendering is 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.289
 That if you do not ask me as I said 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.570
 It looks nice but not necessarily 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.969
 Of course, how does it look with the sharpness 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.560
 Generally made out of the colors and pictures 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:53.300
 we are really hot 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.009
 already seen but how is that with 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.469
 text like schaumann has in the browser 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.039
 and here you can see right now 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:59.960
 nothing more 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.280
 but if it turns sharp now and then 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.469
 already a few pixels 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.909
 that's really grumpy though 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.560
 High level because I believe if you 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.690
 There , then do not pay attention 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.820
 you can not see that , but it is something 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.509
 which of course I have to show you 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.830
 I want and want what we still have in 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.719
 you can see that in the settings as well 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.430
 again here at the different 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:20.710
 heading 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.240
 that's a bit pixelated you are 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.550
 but it only recognizes if you 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.650
 really pay attention to it again and again 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.800
 short in the text messages and want 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.300
 Write a new text message here 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.620
 what do we see here or 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.420
 Let's make it an old one 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.530
 we also recognize reading here 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.890
 great pixel 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.350
 So that's ok if you do not have any 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:44.350
 problem with that has the display resp 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.960
 font is a bit pixelated every now and then 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.580
 but the colors absolutely yes 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.590
 really been shown very nice 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.810
 will not work very realistically 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.400
 with 1 series strong colors look like 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.500
 a lot and sharpness can be important then 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.420
 you look at the blackberry q10 ever 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.000
 if you look in the anyway 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.920
 direction otherwise yes 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.390
 maybe to say that's one 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.150
 to one format so this square 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.130
 not really i say it's practical 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.540
 for the reproduction of photos and videos 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.390
 but I think so is one 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.920
 blackberry also did not do it well me 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.630
 think that it should have been, I hope 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.520
 I could help you a little bit 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.100
 give a few tips or show if 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.840
 had her questions and answer them 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.430
 I thank you again now encourages time 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.750
 and I'm glad if you have another one 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.750
 It's good
