00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.460
 the marines fought well 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.419
 for the show 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:09.059
 it makes you laugh 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.659
 better late than never 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:13.449
 so here is the place for free 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.449
 what they say they were above 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.980
 he knows it for the moment 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:33.479
 we know it 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.950
 replacements 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.510
 after all he is due 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.790
 for me he is listened to 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.180
 it does not cost less 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.690
 and I like it 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.010
 the orders are the orders of demolition 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.010
 I am the most important that that of the order 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.500
 I'm skipping my turn 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.500
 same problematic and massa 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.340
 that's why this reform 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.340
 this friendship is his team to pick up 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.540
 curious again that one 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.820
 it's perfect 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.820
 penultimate place of the same 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.590
 but what's the thing that bothers me 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.410
 it's madam secret services 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.760
 the first place 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.600
 Igo has also completed the afp 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.850
 the Serbian remains 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 get ready for the beach 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.420
 since 2005 the club of excellence bc are increasing 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.990
 we know we have to 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.750
 so 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.600
 it's always difficult to know how to cash without flinching
