because I am working svelte if you know
I'm<00:01:58.560> saying<00:01:58.890> blue<00:01:59.430> sharks<00:01:59.729> are<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.450> skinny

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
I'm saying blue sharks are so skinny

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.709 
I'm saying blue sharks are so skinny
that<00:02:01.560> they<00:02:01.740> fit<00:02:02.070> between<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.939> bars<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.420> most

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
that they fit between the bars of most

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.289 
that they fit between the bars of most
shark<00:02:04.110> cages<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:04.860> there's<00:02:05.219> really<00:02:05.430> no<00:02:05.729> purpose

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
shark cages so there's really no purpose

to even being in the cage with blue
shark<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.340> very<00:02:08.580> unlikely<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.599> blue
