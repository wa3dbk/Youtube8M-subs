00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
last thing this is what i got for this
was<00:02:58.840> 12<00:02:59.200> 99<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:00.010> this<00:03:00.550> is<00:03:00.730> what<00:03:00.850> I<00:03:00.880> got<00:03:01.090> for<00:03:01.680> my

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
was 12 99 and this is what I got for my

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.830 
was 12 99 and this is what I got for my
coffee<00:03:03.160> drawer<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:04.060> reason<00:03:04.330> for<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.510> is

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
coffee drawer the reason for that is

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.300 
coffee drawer the reason for that is
because<00:03:04.870> I've<00:03:05.200> got<00:03:05.440> little<00:03:05.680> pieces<00:03:05.890> from

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
because I've got little pieces from

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.650 
because I've got little pieces from
things<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:06.820> I<00:03:06.880> want<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.120> keep<00:03:07.239> it<00:03:07.390> in<00:03:07.510> here

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
things and I want to keep it in here

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.690 
things and I want to keep it in here
like<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.290> frother<00:03:08.830> thing<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.489> stuff<00:03:09.610> like

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
like the frother thing and stuff like

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.949 
like the frother thing and stuff like
that<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.120> want<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.360> keep<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.570> in<00:03:10.660> here<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:10.930> I

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
that so I want to keep it in here and I

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:11.880 
that so I want to keep it in here and I
thought<00:03:11.050> this<00:03:11.230> would<00:03:11.350> be<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.500> fun<00:03:11.709> way<00:03:11.739> to

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
thought this would be a fun way to

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.040 
thought this would be a fun way to
organize<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:13.000> drawer<00:03:13.239> size<00:03:13.480> itself<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:13.989> a

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
organize it the drawer size itself is a

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.009 
organize it the drawer size itself is a
little<00:03:14.290> awkward<00:03:14.350> it's<00:03:14.770> like<00:03:14.890> 8<00:03:15.100> x<00:03:15.370> 13<00:03:15.850> so<00:03:16.570> I<00:03:16.840> had

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
little awkward it's like 8 x 13 so I had

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.229 
little awkward it's like 8 x 13 so I had
to<00:03:17.049> get<00:03:17.200> creative<00:03:17.350> I'm<00:03:18.280> hoping<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.209> can

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
to get creative I'm hoping that I can

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.410 
to get creative I'm hoping that I can
configure<00:03:19.780> something<00:03:20.140> from<00:03:20.650> these<00:03:21.010> choices

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
configure something from these choices

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.820

steel shot like that this isn't a
different<00:04:47.830> drawer<00:04:48.070> but<00:04:48.640> with<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:48.940> kites<00:04:49.210> wow

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980
