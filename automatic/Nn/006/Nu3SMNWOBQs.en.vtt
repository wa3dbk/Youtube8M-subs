00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
let's talk about why hotkeys are so

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.460

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
important now there's really two main

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.030 
important now there's really two main
reasons<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:54.180> first<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.690> speed<00:00:55.140> being

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
reasons here the first is speed being

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.920 
reasons here the first is speed being
able<00:00:56.130> to<00:00:56.340> use<00:00:56.520> hotkeys<00:00:56.790> effectively<00:00:57.570> will
