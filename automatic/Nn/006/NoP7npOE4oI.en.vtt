and didn't even need an instruction
manual<00:01:09.540> now<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.260> got<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.500> see<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.799> can

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
manual now I just got to see if we can

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.520 
manual now I just got to see if we can
put<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.130> mesh<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.549> there<00:01:11.810> this<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.229> goal

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
put this mesh on there this is the goal

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.270 
put this mesh on there this is the goal
net<00:01:13.770> looks<00:01:14.430> pretty<00:01:14.729> sturdy<00:01:15.110> there<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.770> blue

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
net looks pretty sturdy there is a blue

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.520 
net looks pretty sturdy there is a blue
tab<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.240> top<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.020> red<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
tab at the top and a red one at the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.999 
tab at the top and a red one at the
bottom<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.040> think<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.460> might<00:01:20.640> mean<00:01:20.850> something

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
bottom I think that might mean something

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.560 
bottom I think that might mean something
see<00:01:23.009> if<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.250> figure<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.520> out<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.880> put<00:01:24.479> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
see if we can figure this out and put it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.020 
see if we can figure this out and put it
on<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.810> net<00:01:25.159> so<00:01:26.159> pretty<00:01:26.430> sure<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:26.700> figure<00:01:26.909> this

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
on the net so pretty sure we figure this

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.060 
on the net so pretty sure we figure this
out<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.600> little<00:01:27.810> red<00:01:28.049> tag<00:01:28.320> right<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:28.740> goes

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
out this little red tag right here goes

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.679 
out this little red tag right here goes
to<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> top<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.670> middle<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.119> then<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
to the top in the middle and then if you

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.800 
to the top in the middle and then if you
look<00:01:30.840> over<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.439> there<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.700> sort<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.570> double

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
look over here there is a sort of double

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.109 
look over here there is a sort of double
section<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.280> part<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.610> really<00:01:35.670> thick<00:01:36.000> I

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
section so this part it's really thick I

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.730 
section so this part it's really thick I
think<00:01:36.360> that's<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.659> supposed<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> run<00:01:37.200> right

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
think that's just supposed to run right

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.890 
think that's just supposed to run right
along<00:01:37.979> these<00:01:38.130> top<00:01:38.369> parts<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.909> then<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.720> grab

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
along these top parts and then just grab

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.980 
along these top parts and then just grab
this<00:01:40.110> string<00:01:40.680> here<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.090> lace<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.329> all<00:01:42.540> through

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
this string here and lace it all through

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.630 
this string here and lace it all through
and<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.649> might<00:01:43.829> take<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.009> while<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.430> we'll

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and that might take a while but we'll

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.200 
and that might take a while but we'll
get<00:01:44.820> started

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
get started

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.450 
get started
we<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.409> mesh<00:01:46.590> pretty<00:01:46.979> much<00:01:47.159> set<00:01:47.430> up

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
we have the mesh pretty much set up

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.190 
we have the mesh pretty much set up
there<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.000> looks<00:01:48.600> pretty<00:01:48.780> good<00:01:48.899> than<00:01:49.110> that

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
there and looks pretty good than that

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.630 
there and looks pretty good than that
and<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:49.890> see<00:01:50.189> we've<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.549> taken

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and you can just see we've just taken

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.609 
and you can just see we've just taken
the<00:01:50.880> string<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.420> laced<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.020> through<00:01:52.259> every

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the string and laced it through every

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.950 
the string and laced it through every
Square<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.909> skipped<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.240> few<00:01:54.270> squares<00:01:54.659> you

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
Square and I skipped a few squares you

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.910 
Square and I skipped a few squares you
should<00:01:55.110> probably<00:01:55.259> hit<00:01:55.409> every<00:01:55.590> single<00:01:55.680> one

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
should probably hit every single one

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.260 
should probably hit every single one
because<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.610> ended<00:01:56.790> up<00:01:56.850> with<00:01:56.969> some<00:01:57.090> extra

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
because I ended up with some extra

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.230 
because I ended up with some extra
string<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.290> if<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.920> did<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.100> again<00:01:59.310> hit<00:01:59.969> every

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
string so if I did it again hit every

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.310 
string so if I did it again hit every
single<00:02:00.509> square<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.250> attach<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.549> right<00:02:03.049> there

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
single square and attach it right there

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.889 
single square and attach it right there
then<00:02:04.860> go<00:02:05.009> through<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.250> next<00:02:05.399> square<00:02:05.899> and

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
then go through the next square and

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.440 
then go through the next square and
through<00:02:07.200> there<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.920> next<00:02:08.190> Square<00:02:08.450> through

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
through there in the next Square through

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.869 
through there in the next Square through
there<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.050> keep<00:02:10.200> doing<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.470> and

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
there and just keep doing that and

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.830 
there and just keep doing that and
that's<00:02:11.879> it

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
that's it

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.240 
that's it
we<00:02:14.840> have<00:02:14.960> that<00:02:15.200> all<00:02:15.410> set<00:02:15.680> up<00:02:15.800> here

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
we have that all set up here

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.060 
we have that all set up here
looks<00:02:16.670> pretty<00:02:17.090> sturdy<00:02:17.540> not<00:02:18.410> wobbly<00:02:18.830> like<00:02:19.040> a

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
looks pretty sturdy not wobbly like a

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.250 
looks pretty sturdy not wobbly like a
lot<00:02:19.490> of<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:20.000> cheaper<00:02:20.420> Nets<00:02:20.600> that<00:02:20.750> I<00:02:20.810> have<00:02:21.020> used

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
lot of the cheaper Nets that I have used

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.100 
lot of the cheaper Nets that I have used
and<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:22.070> mesh<00:02:22.340> looks<00:02:22.970> really<00:02:23.330> thick

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
and that mesh looks really thick

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.750 
and that mesh looks really thick
compared<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.980> some<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.310> other<00:02:25.460> cheaper

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
compared to some of the other cheaper

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.360 
compared to some of the other cheaper
ones<00:02:25.940> as<00:02:26.090> well<00:02:26.270> I'd<00:02:26.870> imagine<00:02:27.020> with<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.860> lot<00:02:28.190> of

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
ones as well I'd imagine with a lot of

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.060 
ones as well I'd imagine with a lot of
shots<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:29.180> would<00:02:29.480> get<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.900> hole<00:02:30.170> in<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.500> but<00:02:31.010> you

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
shots I would get a hole in it but you

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.680 
shots I would get a hole in it but you
can<00:02:31.100> always<00:02:31.370> sort<00:02:31.520> of<00:02:31.640> replace<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.090> Nets<00:02:32.300> but

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
can always sort of replace the Nets but

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.540 
can always sort of replace the Nets but
we'll<00:02:33.200> see<00:02:33.350> how<00:02:33.830> long<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.100> takes<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.340> get<00:02:34.490> a

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
we'll see how long it takes to get a

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.940 
we'll see how long it takes to get a
hole<00:02:34.760> in<00:02:34.790> there<00:02:34.970> keep<00:02:35.750> eye<00:02:36.260> on<00:02:36.530> our<00:02:36.650> videos<00:02:36.920> and

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
hole in there keep eye on our videos and

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.030 
hole in there keep eye on our videos and
I<00:02:37.940> also<00:02:38.090> want<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.510> test<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.200> foldability

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
I also want to test the foldability

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.520 
I also want to test the foldability
of<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.790> net<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.510> we<00:02:41.600> do<00:02:41.930> still<00:02:42.110> have<00:02:42.320> the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
of the net and we do still have the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.200 
of the net and we do still have the
backstop<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.430> set<00:02:43.790> up<00:02:43.880> as<00:02:44.030> well

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
backstop to set up as well

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.880 
backstop to set up as well
we'll<00:02:44.870> do<00:02:44.960> that<00:02:45.020> but<00:02:45.320> first<00:02:45.590> thing<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.770> takes

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
we'll do that but first thing it takes

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.290 
we'll do that but first thing it takes
four<00:02:46.070> shots<00:02:46.250> in<00:02:46.370> this<00:02:46.490> net<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.970> we'll<00:02:47.180> show

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
four shots in this net and we'll show

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.600 
four shots in this net and we'll show
you<00:02:47.330> how<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.780> folds<00:02:48.110> as<00:02:48.200> well

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
you how it folds as well

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
you how it folds as well
[Applause]

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
[Applause]

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.050 
[Applause]
you<00:02:52.590> have<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.890> easy<00:02:53.040> goal<00:02:53.250> all<00:02:53.400> set<00:02:53.640> up<00:02:53.820> and

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
you have the easy goal all set up and

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.310 
you have the easy goal all set up and
this<00:02:54.240> is<00:02:54.360> what<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.570> looks<00:02:54.720> like<00:02:54.900> when<00:02:55.170> it's

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
this is what it looks like when it's

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.900 
this is what it looks like when it's
folded<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:56.070> can<00:02:56.190> see<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.430> nice<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.580> flat

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
folded you can see it's nice and flat

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.130 
folded you can see it's nice and flat
you<00:02:56.970> could<00:02:57.240> easily<00:02:57.360> tuck<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:57.990> behind

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
you could easily tuck this in behind

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.330 
you could easily tuck this in behind
something<00:02:58.770> or<00:02:58.950> also<00:02:59.790> have<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.420> laying<00:03:00.990> flat<00:03:01.340> so

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
something or also have it laying flat so

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.410 
something or also have it laying flat so
if<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.520> want<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.760> lay<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:02.880> flat<00:03:03.030> somewhere

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
if you want to lay it flat somewhere

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.210 
if you want to lay it flat somewhere
that's<00:03:03.870> what<00:03:04.020> it<00:03:04.110> looks<00:03:04.260> like<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.710> this<00:03:05.070> is

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
that's what it looks like and this is

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.010 
that's what it looks like and this is
perfectly<00:03:05.730> setup<00:03:05.940> if<00:03:06.240> you<00:03:06.630> want<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.870> play

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
perfectly setup if you want to play

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.620 
perfectly setup if you want to play
hockey<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.950> takes<00:03:08.460> less<00:03:08.790> than<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.030> minute<00:03:09.060> all

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
hockey it takes less than a minute all

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.300 
hockey it takes less than a minute all
you<00:03:09.780> do<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:09.960> fold<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:10.290> part<00:03:10.500> up<00:03:10.680> here<00:03:10.740> and

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
you do is fold this part up here and

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.630 
you do is fold this part up here and
then<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.390> top<00:03:12.570> part<00:03:12.780> pull<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.470> up

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
then this is the top part pull that up

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.980 
then this is the top part pull that up
not<00:03:14.640> just<00:03:14.700> snapped<00:03:15.120> into<00:03:15.300> place<00:03:15.360> right<00:03:15.750> there

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
not just snapped into place right there

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:22.520 
not just snapped into place right there
and<00:03:16.770> you<00:03:16.920> grab<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.250> bottom<00:03:17.640> here<00:03:21.110> put<00:03:22.110> that<00:03:22.290> in

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
and you grab the bottom here put that in

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.810 
and you grab the bottom here put that in
it's<00:03:22.830> easier<00:03:23.070> if<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.190> do<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.400> from<00:03:23.460> the<00:03:23.610> front

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
it's easier if you do it from the front

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.460 
it's easier if you do it from the front
but<00:03:24.030> I'm<00:03:24.180> just<00:03:24.330> trying<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.570> rip<00:03:25.110> in<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.320> back

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
pins and you just put them down here

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.490 
pins and you just put them down here
keep<00:03:32.400> this<00:03:32.520> locked<00:03:32.760> in<00:03:33.050> that's<00:03:34.050> easy<00:03:34.320> just

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
dent down there so that would be

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.040 
dent down there so that would be
shooting<00:05:34.490> about<00:05:34.820> point-blank<00:05:35.300> with<00:05:35.660> a<00:05:35.690> slap

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
shooting about point-blank with a slap

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.620 
shooting about point-blank with a slap
shot<00:05:36.080> and<00:05:36.560> there's<00:05:36.680> are<00:05:36.890> a<00:05:36.920> 10<00:05:37.100> feet<00:05:37.280> away<00:05:37.630> over

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
shot and there's are a 10 feet away over

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.000

here<00:05:39.050> we<00:05:39.710> have<00:05:39.860> just<00:05:40.580> a<00:05:40.760> scuff<00:05:41.320> so<00:05:42.320> you<00:05:42.440> can<00:05:42.680> see

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
here we have just a scuff so you can see

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.330 
here we have just a scuff so you can see
right<00:05:43.610> there<00:05:43.810> that's<00:05:44.810> with<00:05:45.650> a<00:05:45.680> slap<00:05:45.980> shot<00:05:46.010> as

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
right there that's with a slap shot as

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.560 
right there that's with a slap shot as
well<00:05:46.490> you<00:05:46.580> actually<00:05:46.700> see<00:05:46.910> the<00:05:47.000> imprint<00:05:47.360> of<00:05:47.510> the

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
well you actually see the imprint of the

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.600 
well you actually see the imprint of the
puck<00:05:47.870> and<00:05:48.470> then<00:05:48.680> it<00:05:48.860> up<00:05:49.010> there<00:05:49.220> is<00:05:49.430> another

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
puck and then it up there is another

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.760 
puck and then it up there is another
scuff<00:05:49.940> so<00:05:50.120> if<00:05:50.210> you<00:05:50.300> just<00:05:50.450> Nick<00:05:50.630> the<00:05:50.750> post<00:05:50.990> it's

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
scuff so if you just Nick the post it's

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.740 
scuff so if you just Nick the post it's
not<00:05:52.010> going<00:05:52.160> to<00:05:52.220> do<00:05:52.340> any<00:05:52.550> heavy<00:05:52.820> damage<00:05:53.300> I<00:05:53.570> will

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
not going to do any heavy damage I will

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.200 
not going to do any heavy damage I will
go<00:05:53.870> over<00:05:53.960> here<00:05:54.430> that's<00:05:55.430> probably<00:05:55.730> the<00:05:55.910> worst

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
go over here that's probably the worst

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.080 
go over here that's probably the worst
one<00:05:56.390> right<00:05:56.600> there<00:05:56.810> so<00:05:57.020> that's<00:05:57.110> a<00:05:57.260> dent<00:05:57.530> and

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
one right there so that's a dent and

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.390 
one right there so that's a dent and
that's<00:05:59.090> a<00:05:59.240> direct<00:05:59.540> hit<00:05:59.800> probably<00:06:00.800> about<00:06:00.920> 75

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
that's a direct hit probably about 75

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.750 
that's a direct hit probably about 75
miles<00:06:01.610> per<00:06:01.850> hour<00:06:01.940> slap<00:06:02.600> shot<00:06:02.870> and<00:06:03.610> maybe<00:06:04.610> about

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
miles per hour slap shot and maybe about

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.640 
miles per hour slap shot and maybe about
10<00:06:05.090> feet<00:06:05.270> away<00:06:05.360> from<00:06:05.480> the<00:06:05.660> net<00:06:05.840> and<00:06:06.080> then<00:06:06.470> you

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
10 feet away from the net and then you

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.820 
10 feet away from the net and then you
see<00:06:06.890> below<00:06:07.130> that<00:06:07.460> is<00:06:08.360> another<00:06:08.600> one<00:06:08.810> then<00:06:09.140> just

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
see below that is another one then just

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.320 
see below that is another one then just
a<00:06:09.950> scuff<00:06:10.190> so<00:06:10.400> maybe<00:06:10.580> it<00:06:10.700> just<00:06:10.760> wasn't<00:06:10.970> such<00:06:11.300> a

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
a scuff so maybe it just wasn't such a

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.600 
a scuff so maybe it just wasn't such a
hard<00:06:11.780> slap<00:06:12.050> shot

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.530 

overall<00:06:15.610> thought<00:06:15.910> the<00:06:16.030> net<00:06:16.180> was<00:06:16.330> great

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
overall thought the net was great

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.080 
overall thought the net was great

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
to dent the post and I was shooting from

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.400 
to dent the post and I was shooting from
at<00:06:44.590> 10<00:06:44.770> feet<00:06:44.920> away<00:06:45.070> so<00:06:45.790> they<00:06:46.540> will<00:06:46.720> dent<00:06:46.990> if<00:06:47.260> you

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
at 10 feet away so they will dent if you

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.610 
at 10 feet away so they will dent if you
get<00:06:47.530> them<00:06:47.650> hard<00:06:47.830> enough<00:06:48.010> but<00:06:49.110> the<00:06:50.110> quality<00:06:50.530> of

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
get them hard enough but the quality of

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.410 
get them hard enough but the quality of
this<00:06:50.740> net<00:06:50.950> is<00:06:50.980> really<00:06:51.580> good<00:06:51.760> compared<00:06:52.210> to

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.420 
this net is really good compared to

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.760 
this net is really good compared to
other<00:06:52.720> ones<00:06:52.840> that<00:06:53.170> you<00:06:53.260> just<00:06:53.470> get<00:06:53.590> at<00:06:53.680> the

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770 
other ones that you just get at the

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.710 
other ones that you just get at the
store<00:06:53.980> I<00:06:54.250> would<00:06:54.610> say<00:06:54.850> this<00:06:55.090> is<00:06:55.300> top<00:06:55.540> quality

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
store I would say this is top quality

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.930 
store I would say this is top quality
for<00:06:56.260> the<00:06:56.380> ones<00:06:56.680> that<00:06:56.860> are<00:06:56.980> just<00:06:57.010> cheap<00:06:57.670> ones

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940 
for the ones that are just cheap ones

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.850 
for the ones that are just cheap ones
and<00:06:58.180> the<00:06:58.720> next<00:06:58.930> step<00:06:59.110> up<00:06:59.290> from<00:06:59.530> this<00:06:59.620> type<00:06:59.830> of

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
and the next step up from this type of

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.440 
and the next step up from this type of
net<00:07:00.130> would<00:07:00.280> be<00:07:00.310> the<00:07:00.790> pro<00:07:01.000> nets<00:07:01.210> that<00:07:01.360> you

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.450 
net would be the pro nets that you

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.750 
net would be the pro nets that you
actually<00:07:01.600> use<00:07:01.900> in<00:07:02.230> hockey<00:07:02.500> arenas<00:07:02.920> so<00:07:03.370> I<00:07:03.400> mean

actually use in hockey arenas so I mean

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.950 
actually use in hockey arenas so I mean
those<00:07:03.850> ones<00:07:04.060> are<00:07:04.150> really<00:07:04.180> bulky<00:07:04.600> really<00:07:04.780> heavy
