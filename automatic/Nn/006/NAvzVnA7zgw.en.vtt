00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.570
 make it easy on yourself 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.480

 now full than for yourself 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.590
 no calm always calm light 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.790
 and try to focus your attention on you 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.790
 breathing

 breathe resignation and consciously exhale 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.150
 with all thoughts stiff after the 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.150
 go background 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.750
 and then let the next exhalation through 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.750
 go from your body to your feet 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.509
 breathe out to your feet full of awareness 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.259
 feet 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:22.940
 your toes are all over the top and the 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.470
 bottom of your feet and then imagine 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.149
 for that they are at the bottom of you 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.350
 feet 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:32.830
 the shutters for which flower 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.830
 open up 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.490
 and from that opening you can your 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:47.060
 let them grow roots 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:50.600
 roots from a tree and view 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:56.270
 your roots agree this is how they look 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.700
 so there is even deeper the earth in you 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.090
 roots can go all the way to the core of 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.090
 the earth 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:12.130
 and in the core is mother earth 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.130
 to get your roots to her 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.720
 so your roots are firmly connected with 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.720
 mother Earth 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.400
 agree with yourself that even though you are 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.489
 less consciously engaged in being connected 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.489
 will be with mother earth 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.230
 go back with you once in a while 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.230
 thoughts to your roots in the earth 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.740
 how to feel your connection again 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.330
 through this connection you will do more 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.330
 be present in the here and now 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.120
 So you want to be aware before we get in and out 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.120
 happening around you 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.440
 by connecting yourself with mother 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.440
 Earth 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:39.140
 you will stand even more in your power 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.330
 literally 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.330
 firmer powerful stand 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.760
 by connecting yourself 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.760
 you protect yourself 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:13.550
 actually let the earth energy flow 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.550
 additionally as needed 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.319
 for you connected to mother earth 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.150
 you bring a calm to that again 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.150
 back to your breathing 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.540
 for more consciously your body never what to 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.540
 to move
