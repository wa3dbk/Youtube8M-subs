 it's true that it's been a long time since 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.140
 I did not make a video - today we 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.099
 going to talk about one of the most 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.889
 important for a young 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.630
 the school naturally that says school 10 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.660
 professors and who says professor 10 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.980
 stuff a little weird heap for example this 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.930
 kind of teachers who gives you 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.750
 questionnaires like that question 1 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.949
 but where is so ornicar good it's not 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.410

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.820
 questions 2 helping you with the answer 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.090

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.439
 question 3 helping you with the answer 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.000
 2 of shit 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.130
 there is also something that is a bit 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.170
 weird at school is the number of 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.090
 course that's it then you'll have 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.820
 so then french maths science 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.079
 geological a riff dactylo dutch 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.200
 english chemistry and economics 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.910
 this is monday no but you imagine a 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.680
 little size binder should be 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.559
 have for all these courses yeah that you 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.120
 speak after I come home and with any 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.430
 this mass of work students have 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.770
 need respect to decompress and 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.189
 for that there is the recreation fat you 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.189
 decompresses during what happened 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.180
 and of course the school without questioning 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.430
 would not be school the interrogations 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.470
 that's when your friends can become 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.210
 your enemies notice especially when you 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:34.770
 asks for an answer to true thuringia 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:41.759
 like that but deep down inside you would like 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.619
 react like that which is good also to 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.940
 school is that reality is not 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.649
 always those we think for example 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.430
 when there are exams or interruptions 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.710

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.240
