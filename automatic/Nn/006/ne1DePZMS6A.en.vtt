re-emerges got my my front facing line

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.749 
re-emerges got my my front facing line
right<00:01:25.990> here<00:01:26.320> where<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.679> the<00:01:27.039> two<00:01:27.189> side<00:01:27.429> planes

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
right here where the the two side planes

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.880 
right here where the the two side planes
would<00:01:27.969> meet<00:01:28.149> and<00:01:29.850> I'm<00:01:30.850> going<00:01:31.030> to<00:01:31.679> throw<00:01:32.679> these

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
would meet and I'm going to throw these

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.999 
would meet and I'm going to throw these
little<00:01:33.340> tracer<00:01:34.210> lines<00:01:34.479> back<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.829> one

little tracer lines back to the the one
point<00:01:36.369> one<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:36.850> two<00:01:37.030> on<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.329> horizon<00:01:42.119> now

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
point one and two on the horizon now

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.459 
point one and two on the horizon now
where<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.869> Third<00:01:44.079> Point<00:01:44.109> comes<00:01:44.710> in<00:01:45.130> is

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
where the the Third Point comes in is

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.739 
where the the Third Point comes in is
instead<00:01:47.469> of<00:01:47.530> simply<00:01:48.249> making<00:01:48.429> these<00:01:48.759> sidelines

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:49.749 
instead of simply making these sidelines

would<00:02:53.660> maybe<00:02:54.290> maybe<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.160> could<00:02:55.280> utilize<00:02:55.640> this

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
would maybe maybe you could utilize this

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.720 
would maybe maybe you could utilize this

kind of shot from a bird's eye view it
also<00:03:03.770> will<00:03:04.040> work<00:03:04.160> in<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:04.700> reverse<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:08.300> over

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
also will work in the reverse and over

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:18.730 
also will work in the reverse and over
here<00:03:15.370> got<00:03:16.370> my<00:03:16.550> horizon<00:03:17.150> line<00:03:17.360> set<00:03:17.930> lower<00:03:18.530> to

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
here got my horizon line set lower to

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.050 
here got my horizon line set lower to
the<00:03:18.830> bottom<00:03:19.160> edge<00:03:19.280> of<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.520> paper<00:03:19.700> in<00:03:19.910> this

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
the bottom edge of the paper in this

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:30.059 
the bottom edge of the paper in this
case<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:21.680> once<00:03:22.100> again<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.850> start<00:03:23.420> out<00:03:24.940> with

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.850 

the<00:03:30.849> line<00:03:31.060> that's<00:03:31.360> basically<00:03:32.019> directly<00:03:32.680> in

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
the line that's basically directly in

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.319 
the line that's basically directly in
front<00:03:33.099> of<00:03:33.219> you<00:03:33.340> where<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.640> two<00:03:33.819> side<00:03:34.030> planes

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
front of you where the two side planes

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:42.179 
front of you where the two side planes
will<00:03:34.540> meet<00:03:40.319> throw<00:03:41.319> the<00:03:41.439> lines<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.890> are<00:03:42.040> going

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.189 
will meet throw the lines that are going

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:53.250 
will meet throw the lines that are going
to<00:03:42.840> become<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.890> side<00:03:45.819> points<00:03:52.109> actually<00:03:53.109> I<00:03:53.140> got

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
to become the side points actually I got

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.660 
to become the side points actually I got
a<00:03:53.290> little<00:03:53.530> carried<00:03:53.739> away<00:03:53.859> forgot<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.400> put<00:03:54.549> my

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
a little carried away forgot to put my

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.170 
a little carried away forgot to put my
third<00:03:54.879> point<00:03:55.090> in<00:03:55.329> but<00:03:55.599> it's<00:03:56.079> not<00:03:56.200> too<00:03:56.379> late

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
third point in but it's not too late

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:11.150 
third point in but it's not too late
just<00:03:58.180> point<00:03:58.450> number<00:03:58.689> three<00:03:59.760> directly<00:04:00.760> above

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.090 

throw<00:04:12.160> that<00:04:12.310> down<00:04:12.460> to<00:04:12.670> either<00:04:12.820> side<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.270> that

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
throw that down to either side of that

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:23.610 
throw that down to either side of that
and<00:04:15.750> then<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:16.989> just<00:04:18.180> simply<00:04:21.900> lock<00:04:22.900> in<00:04:23.260> the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
and then you just simply lock in the

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.880 
and then you just simply lock in the
side<00:04:24.400> plans<00:04:24.700> here<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:29.050> what<00:04:29.230> if<00:04:29.350> this<00:04:29.500> ends<00:04:29.830> up

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
side plans here so what if this ends up

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.740 
side plans here so what if this ends up
giving<00:04:30.130> you<00:04:30.430> is<00:04:30.670> basically<00:04:31.210> kind<00:04:31.510> of<00:04:31.660> an

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
giving you is basically kind of an

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.260 
giving you is basically kind of an
effect<00:04:32.110> of<00:04:32.320> being<00:04:32.560> low<00:04:33.130> to<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.370> ground<00:04:33.460> sort

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
effect of being low to the ground sort

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.720 
effect of being low to the ground sort
of<00:04:34.360> a<00:04:34.500> well<00:04:35.500> I<00:04:35.710> guess<00:04:35.980> the<00:04:36.130> opposite<00:04:36.520> of<00:04:36.610> a

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
of a well I guess the opposite of a

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.940 
of a well I guess the opposite of a
bird's-eye<00:04:37.450> view<00:04:37.480> would<00:04:37.870> be<00:04:37.930> like<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.650> bug's

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
bird's-eye view would be like a bug's

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.140 
bird's-eye view would be like a bug's
eye<00:04:39.160> view<00:04:39.460> so<00:04:39.760> if<00:04:39.910> we<00:04:40.060> can<00:04:40.180> call<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.480> that<00:04:41.100> and

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
eye view so if we can call it that and

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.820 
eye view so if we can call it that and
that's<00:04:43.150> pretty<00:04:43.480> much<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.320> basics<00:04:44.680> of

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
that's pretty much the the basics of

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.040 
that's pretty much the the basics of
three-point<00:04:45.340> perspective<00:04:45.840> thanks<00:04:46.840> for

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
three-point perspective thanks for

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:57.239 
three-point perspective thanks for
thanks<00:04:47.530> for<00:04:47.650> watching

00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:57.249 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:59.309
