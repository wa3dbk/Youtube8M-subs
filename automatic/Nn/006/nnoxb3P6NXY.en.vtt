00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.790
 inspector miguel what is our mission 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.430
 we must find a tab that you 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.130
 my puzzle is missing because without it 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.160
 I can change my house, you're going to 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.880

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.080
 important you see 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.020

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.250
 tab you have to inspect the room 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.250
 To find it 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.560

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.560
 date we were missing 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.369
 observing this tab very well I came to 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.150
 the conclusion that it does not belong to this 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.840
