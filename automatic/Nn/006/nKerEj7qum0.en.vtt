00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.940
 The origin of Spain is located in 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.590
 wales in the UK was born there 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.230
 the breed of different types 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.250
 and parking with the worldwide pony 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.050
 also known by the name of the world 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.240
 they have become so called 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.430
 Celtic ponies can develop 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.170
 they were sure-footed they were right 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.260
 small strong could be against the 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.360
 protect harsh climate and with these 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.330
 little ponies evolved later 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.970
 the other sections are there 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.550
 four sections of different world in the 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.010
 city ​​bus plus their parking space that is 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.930
 the mixture with other races once 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.170
 are the wild mountain ponies up there 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:56.059
 to a stick of 122 there are 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.170
 the pony was up to 137 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.469
 is registered 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.300
 then there are the ponies in section c 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.129
 that stand in the head that is the in 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.950
 you are standing on this heavy working day 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.680
 stock size is also up to 1 meter 37 and 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.600
 in addition, over a meter 37 there are 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.399
 the stronger working animals the cops 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.440
 those in agriculture in the 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.119
 economy at that time in wales and also at 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.890
 the families and the courage families 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.259
 was held around them for example to 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.729
 church to drive or shopping too 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.450
 drive or just in the hunt 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.450
 to use sport 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.799
 in the breeding of the individual sections 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.829
 will be very important for the maintenance of the 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.229
 specific race characteristics just laid that way 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.850
 the respective type can be unadulterated as well 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.130
 received over the next centuries 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.299
 The more and more popular are those who stay 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.369
 park booked 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:46.060
 that's how the world influenced, among other things 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.520
 the german riding pony in his yard in 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.820
 near aachen stefan benz 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.140
 completely dedicated to the World Cups 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.179
 the worldcup is special that he 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.640
 just over the years for centuries 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:00.209
 was pulled in the type and a very 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.979
 versatile horse is the reason 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.869
 claims that have a head to fulfill 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.420
 in the breeding are basically from 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.910
 mother city book set those are the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.799
 breed typical features strong 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.140
 It would be important to listen to the book if you can 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:17.560
 Now the exterior looks at you 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.150
 quite satisfactory groups 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.760
 depth must be present 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.890
 the group should be strong content 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.349
 strong muscles are almost melons 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.209
 formally followed and it should be 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.700
 compact value should be the head 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.799
 be appealing no frame nose 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.799
 have a lively eye 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.240
 if you look at the head it is 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.220
 a very typical breed but a very typical one 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.310
 noble head and from my point of view 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.810
 This mare embodies the almost 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.710
 perfect studies type because they are very 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.300
 is female and in breeding it is with 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.570
 quite an advantage that has grown up 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.830
 reported the mares to possible female 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.600
 or the very often on 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.670
 are most fertile and am 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.990
 most successful in breeding and that 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.910
 beautiful to the head is also that for 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.820
 there is something for everyone 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.940
 are represented by the cc youth mare and 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.290
 she will be two years old and soon 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.610
 You just do not see it that way 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.260
 shoot up quickly but 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.390
 but they also need their time now 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.100
 you actually see that in the study 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.410
 she'll get proper foundation 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.350
 And the color is also very good in Wales 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.750
 popular namely wearing the fox color 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.180
 You can see this stallion here now 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.980
 black you can see the lines breeding 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.660
 a meant welsh stallion the 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.730
 bring oneworld magic is here and 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.260
 You can see the stallion's head 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.230
 that this stallion is massive at the moment 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.180
 by inheriting these faces away 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.859
 these noble faces 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.959
 the areas of application of the cops are 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.090
 he is diverse for both 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.730
 driving as well as for dressage and 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.170
 jump balanced 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.480
 beings and his readiness for action 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.880
 make him a popular leisure time 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.250
 partner for children and adults 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.110
 the head makes character first 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.640
 once his intelligence out of that 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.530
 means for the rider or those 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.750
 the horses also trains though 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.830
 also that you do not overwhelm them 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.690
 Should she have a very awake 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.610
 but temperament are basically very 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.170
 you can do it well 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.150
 deduce that I just said that about 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.040
 centuries it just not in front of time 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.050
 a discipline was bred but 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.940
 in different divisions in the 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.100
 leisure as well as I say times in sports 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.870
 was used 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.220
 also the ponies from section b 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.690
 enjoy ever greater popularity 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.150
 which are the youngest section of the 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.370
 Welsh ponies and are in the type of 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.290
 modern riding ponies due to his 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.690
 expansive step of his good 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.670
 activity from the backhand and his 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.530
 excellent jumping ability is the 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:50.810
 type from section b on the 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.810
 tournament places are indispensable 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.240
 this section b has made of these 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.680
 original Welsh ponies 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.130
 mountain ponies developed by 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.380
 cross in that the world ponies in the head 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.690
 fit in the head and the head types mares 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.150
 and stallions is actually created and 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.030
 follow the call for a bigger one 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.550
 Children riding pony and children's tournament pony 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.360
 with excellent exterior values and 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.580
 above all things, too 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.780
 excellent interiors will be added 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.970
 corresponding size in the course of his 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.920
 development, the world pony adapted 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.610
 The climatic conditions of his native wales 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.950
 on 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.160
 this makes it one today 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.400
 sturdy pony that in his attitude 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.139
 straightforward 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.910
 We personally try it that way 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.860
 to implement that as much as possible 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.660
 of course, but at the same time 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.600
 also to get used to the people because 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.580
 that is what we actually as 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.039
 Target object namely a leisure partner 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.630
 for the human to breed that 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.910
 we try to implement that we 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.310
 say in the spring and summer months 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.979
 we keep our horses 24 hours 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.020
 out there in the meadows 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.910
 We try to time too 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.710
 clock that the mother mares are relative 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.120
 parallel to getting her foals so that 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.669
 the young horses from the beginning also 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.070
 Playmates have and behave appropriately 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.889
 to measure each other in a social association 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.050
 can and the remaining stages are in 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:14.250
 a great study holds together in the 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.539
 winter is shaping up 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.010
 of course in our broad 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.510
 a bit harder you could get them 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.490
 outside on paddocks all year round 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.490
 certainly hold 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.710
 we try that through the night 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.449
 grooming to optimize such 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.139
 We also say that to lower animals 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.070
 always a sufficient and good 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:35.009
 food or a dietary supplement 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.659
 ensured 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.879
 who a faithful companion in the 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:41.189
 leisure or sports looking for and one 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:43.259
 uncomplicated handling can be appreciated in the 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:45.149
 Smart rugged and working 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:48.439
 happy world the ideal 

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:48.439
 find leisure partners
