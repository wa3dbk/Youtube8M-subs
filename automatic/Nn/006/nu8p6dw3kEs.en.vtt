00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
have been installed and one of the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.280 
have been installed and one of the
things<00:01:30.340> I<00:01:30.550> love<00:01:30.909> so<00:01:31.420> much<00:01:31.600> about<00:01:31.840> these<00:01:32.020> guys

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.890 
things I love so much about these guys
is<00:01:32.680> that<00:01:32.710> they<00:01:32.890> are<00:01:33.130> motion<00:01:33.580> activated<00:01:33.900> so

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
is that they are motion activated so

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.930 
is that they are motion activated so
when<00:01:35.440> they<00:01:35.860> move<00:01:36.100> they'll<00:01:36.640> light<00:01:36.909> up

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
when they move they'll light up

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.870 
when they move they'll light up
otherwise<00:01:37.780> they<00:01:38.260> turn<00:01:38.500> off<00:01:38.610> pretty<00:01:39.610> neat<00:01:39.850> huh

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
gonna do is put some hot glue on each

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.710 
gonna do is put some hot glue on each
one<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.650> these<00:01:56.920> back<00:01:57.430> spokes<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.540> should

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
one of these back spokes and it should

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.620 
one of these back spokes and it should
hold<00:01:58.900> it<00:01:59.049> right<00:01:59.170> in<00:01:59.320> place<00:01:59.620> alright<00:02:00.580> so<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:01.270> put

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
hold it right in place alright so I put

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.360 
hold it right in place alright so I put
some<00:02:01.659> hot<00:02:01.930> glue<00:02:02.110> down<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.770> then<00:02:02.860> I<00:02:02.950> just<00:02:02.979> went

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
some hot glue down and then I just went

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.370 
some hot glue down and then I just went
ahead<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:03.700> set<00:02:04.120> the<00:02:04.450> circuit<00:02:04.780> board<00:02:04.960> on<00:02:05.080> top

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
ahead and set the circuit board on top

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.950 
ahead and set the circuit board on top
and<00:02:05.830> that's<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.520> guys<00:02:06.580> now<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.600> one<00:02:07.780> thing

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
and that's it guys now the one thing

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.009 
and that's it guys now the one thing
that<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:08.140> love<00:02:08.379> about<00:02:08.409> hot<00:02:08.799> glue<00:02:09.099> is<00:02:09.429> if<00:02:10.269> you

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
that I love about hot glue is if you

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.869 
that I love about hot glue is if you
really<00:02:11.440> want<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:11.980> can<00:02:12.159> easily<00:02:12.370> pull<00:02:12.760> it

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
really want to you can easily pull it

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.600 
really want to you can easily pull it
off<00:02:13.030> plastic<00:02:13.720> parts<00:02:14.140> but<00:02:14.680> for<00:02:15.159> now<00:02:15.280> it's

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
off plastic parts but for now it's

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.369 
off plastic parts but for now it's
strong<00:02:15.970> enough<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.269> actually<00:02:16.659> hold<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.019> LED

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
strong enough to actually hold the LED

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.140 
strong enough to actually hold the LED
on<00:02:17.409> there<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.340> only<00:02:18.489> thing<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.879> kind<00:02:19.029> of

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
on there the only thing that kind of

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.000 
on there the only thing that kind of
sucks<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.689> that<00:02:19.719> these<00:02:20.049> tires<00:02:20.319> don't<00:02:20.739> allow

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
sucks is that these tires don't allow

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.949 
sucks is that these tires don't allow
the<00:02:21.069> LED<00:02:21.549> to<00:02:21.730> stretch<00:02:21.999> out<00:02:22.180> far<00:02:22.450> enough<00:02:22.689> for<00:02:22.900> it

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
the LED to stretch out far enough for it

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.690 
the LED to stretch out far enough for it
to<00:02:23.019> be<00:02:23.079> seen<00:02:23.409> but<00:02:23.950> believe<00:02:24.370> me

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
to be seen but believe me

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.680 
to be seen but believe me
effect<00:02:25.360> will<00:02:25.630> be<00:02:25.660> very<00:02:26.260> very<00:02:26.980> cool<00:02:27.310> at<00:02:27.610> night

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
effect will be very very cool at night

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.260 
effect will be very very cool at night
so<00:02:28.690> all<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.200> have<00:02:29.349> to<00:02:29.470> do<00:02:29.590> now<00:02:29.800> is<00:02:30.160> slide<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
so all I have to do now is slide the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.449 
so all I have to do now is slide the
tire<00:02:31.450> back<00:02:31.690> on<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.230> reattach<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.250> four

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
tire back on and reattach the four

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.790 
tire back on and reattach the four
millimeter<00:02:33.910> nut<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.360> that's<00:02:34.599> it<00:02:34.959> now<00:02:35.410> when

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
millimeter nut and that's it now when

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.070 
millimeter nut and that's it now when
the<00:02:35.890> tire<00:02:36.069> spins<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.730> LED<00:02:37.090> will<00:02:37.270> come<00:02:37.480> on<00:02:37.690> when

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
the tire spins the LED will come on when

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.199 
the tire spins the LED will come on when
the<00:02:38.230> tire<00:02:38.440> stops<00:02:38.860> spinning<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.400> LED<00:02:39.730> goes<00:02:39.940> off

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
the tire stops spinning the LED goes off

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.080 
the tire stops spinning the LED goes off
pretty<00:02:41.020> darn<00:02:41.470> cool<00:02:41.800> now<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.459> just<00:02:42.550> gotta<00:02:42.850> do<00:02:42.970> the

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
same thing with the other three tires

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.650 
same thing with the other three tires
