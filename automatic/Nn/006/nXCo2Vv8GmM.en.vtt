are<00:03:37.060> fine<00:03:37.270> I<00:03:37.750> will<00:03:38.620> say<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:39.750> even<00:03:40.750> though<00:03:40.840> I

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
are fine I will say that even though I

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.510 
are fine I will say that even though I
am<00:03:41.020> an<00:03:41.170> infantry<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:41.500> can't<00:03:41.860> find<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.250> time<00:03:42.400> to

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
do it because like right now I probably

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.150 
do it because like right now I probably
could<00:03:43.959> have<00:03:44.050> brought<00:03:44.200> all<00:03:44.380> my<00:03:44.410> bills<00:03:44.770> order<00:03:45.040> to

to do it but now that I might have a

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:18.859 
to do it but now that I might have a
feel<00:05:16.740> how<00:05:16.979> her<00:05:17.459> doing<00:05:17.939> it<00:05:18.119> you<00:05:18.300> can<00:05:18.449> see<00:05:18.659> that
