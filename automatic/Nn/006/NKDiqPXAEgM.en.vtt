00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
which I get at level 70 every single job

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.840 
which I get at level 70 every single job
that<00:00:50.530> has<00:00:50.679> a<00:00:50.710> link<00:00:50.980> skill<00:00:51.190> will<00:00:51.370> come<00:00:51.519> at<00:00:51.640> level

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
that has a link skill will come at level

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.299 
that has a link skill will come at level
70<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:52.449> then<00:00:52.899> it<00:00:53.079> will<00:00:53.199> increase<00:00:53.620> its<00:00:53.890> level

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
70 and then it will increase its level

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.939 
70 and then it will increase its level
depending<00:00:55.089> on<00:00:55.239> how<00:00:55.480> high<00:00:55.899> your<00:00:56.109> character<00:00:56.800> is

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
I think get off level 2 at around 120

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.959 
I think get off level 2 at around 120
and<00:01:01.239> also<00:01:01.570> level<00:01:01.929> 3<00:01:02.260> at<00:01:02.499> 200<00:01:03.489> right<00:01:03.670> now<00:01:03.789> my

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
and also level 3 at 200 right now my

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.690 
and also level 3 at 200 right now my
characters<00:01:04.390> at<00:01:04.540> 186<00:01:05.350> as<00:01:05.620> why<00:01:06.010> it's<00:01:06.159> at<00:01:06.250> level<00:01:06.580> 2

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
characters at 186 as why it's at level 2

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.100 
characters at 186 as why it's at level 2
only<00:01:07.620> but<00:01:08.620> this<00:01:09.250> still<00:01:10.120> itself<00:01:10.600> gives<00:01:10.930> me

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
only but this still itself gives me

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.960

Mercedes the jet all the Cygnus lights

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.770 
Mercedes the jet all the Cygnus lights
they<00:01:30.040> all<00:01:30.219> come<00:01:30.490> with<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.729> same<00:01:30.969> ring<00:01:31.479> skill

so<00:01:32.200> there's<00:01:32.380> no<00:01:32.469> difference<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.070> I<00:01:33.700> think<00:01:33.969> the

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
so there's no difference and I think the

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.480 
so there's no difference and I think the
resistance<00:01:34.869> resistance<00:01:35.229> don't<00:01:35.920> have<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.130> lynx
