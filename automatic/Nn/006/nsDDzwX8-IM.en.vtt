I've already wound the camera which is
also

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
also

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.170 
also
something<00:04:28.099> that<00:04:28.220> I'm<00:04:28.310> going<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.550> need<00:04:28.669> to<00:04:29.000> load

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
something that I'm going to need to load

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.730 
something that I'm going to need to load
the<00:04:29.330> camera<00:04:29.509> I<00:04:29.840> have<00:04:30.289> the<00:04:30.380> direction<00:04:30.530> of

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
the camera I have the direction of

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.430 
the camera I have the direction of
travel<00:04:30.979> indicated<00:04:31.789> with<00:04:32.090> these<00:04:32.300> arrows<00:04:32.810> so<00:04:33.410> I

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
travel indicated with these arrows so I

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.350 
travel indicated with these arrows so I
know<00:04:33.680> which<00:04:34.009> way<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.610> film<00:04:34.849> actually<00:04:35.180> needs

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
know which way the film actually needs

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.360 
know which way the film actually needs
to<00:04:35.449> be<00:04:35.539> placed<00:04:36.229> I'm<00:04:36.919> going<00:04:37.039> to<00:04:37.099> start<00:04:37.250> by

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
to be placed I'm going to start by

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.080 
to be placed I'm going to start by
putting<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.729> film<00:04:38.080> onto<00:04:39.080> its<00:04:39.229> spindle<00:04:40.090> the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
putting the film onto its spindle the

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.640 
putting the film onto its spindle the
first<00:04:41.300> thing<00:04:41.419> I<00:04:41.479> need<00:04:41.630> to<00:04:41.720> do<00:04:41.840> though<00:04:42.050> is<00:04:42.229> to

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
first thing I need to do though is to

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.159 
first thing I need to do though is to
actually<00:04:42.770> cut<00:04:43.130> a<00:04:43.160> little<00:04:43.340> piece<00:04:43.460> of<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:43.819> film

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
actually cut a little piece of the film

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.990 
actually cut a little piece of the film
with<00:04:45.169> the<00:04:45.199> built-in<00:04:45.949> film<00:04:46.460> cutter<00:04:46.759> on<00:04:46.970> the

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
with the built-in film cutter on the

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.120 
bottom of the bowl X now that my films
cut<00:04:49.849> I'm<00:04:49.970> actually<00:04:50.150> ready<00:04:50.539> to<00:04:50.919> engage<00:04:51.919> the

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
cut I'm actually ready to engage the

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.430 
cut I'm actually ready to engage the

little<00:05:34.460> keeper<00:05:35.389> right<00:05:35.419> there<00:05:36.219> put<00:05:37.219> this<00:05:37.370> back

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
little keeper right there put this back

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.649 
little keeper right there put this back
on<00:05:37.880> there<00:05:38.229> there<00:05:39.229> we<00:05:39.349> go<00:05:39.560> now<00:05:40.550> as<00:05:40.820> an<00:05:41.240> assurance

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659 
on there there we go now as an assurance

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.230

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
I'm actually going to deactivate the

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.050 
I'm actually going to deactivate the
loop<00:05:47.419> setters<00:05:47.840> and<00:05:48.050> this<00:05:48.469> will<00:05:48.800> open<00:05:49.759> them<00:05:49.909> up

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
loop setters and this will open them up

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.879 
loop setters and this will open them up
this<00:05:50.449> is<00:05:50.630> how<00:05:50.659> I<00:05:50.780> want<00:05:51.080> to<00:05:51.110> operate<00:05:51.469> the<00:05:51.710> camera

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
this is how I want to operate the camera

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.850 
this is how I want to operate the camera
when<00:05:52.729> I'm<00:05:52.880> actually<00:05:53.090> filming<00:05:53.509> many<00:05:54.440> older

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860

Bowl X's have a manual release of the
loop<00:05:58.610> setters<00:05:59.000> so<00:05:59.270> I<00:05:59.300> want<00:05:59.569> to<00:05:59.599> make<00:05:59.750> sure<00:05:59.960> that

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
loop setters so I want to make sure that

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.399 
loop setters so I want to make sure that
it<00:06:00.680> becomes<00:06:01.250> partly<00:06:01.580> habit<00:06:02.060> that<00:06:02.569> I<00:06:02.630> open

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
it becomes partly habit that I open

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.140 
it becomes partly habit that I open
those<00:06:03.530> up<00:06:03.590> before<00:06:03.860> I<00:06:04.099> begin<00:06:04.340> filming<00:06:04.669> I'm

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
those up before I begin filming I'm

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.110 
those up before I begin filming I'm
going<00:06:05.389> to<00:06:05.449> give<00:06:05.630> it<00:06:05.719> a<00:06:05.780> couple<00:06:05.960> of<00:06:06.139> bursts<00:06:07.120> just

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
going to give it a couple of bursts just

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.459 
going to give it a couple of bursts just
to<00:06:08.210> make<00:06:08.330> sure<00:06:08.539> that<00:06:08.750> the<00:06:08.900> film<00:06:09.080> is<00:06:09.229> spooling

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:09.469 
to make sure that the film is spooling

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.409 
to make sure that the film is spooling
off<00:06:09.680> correctly<00:06:09.979> and<00:06:10.340> actually<00:06:10.940> taking<00:06:11.300> up

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
off correctly and actually taking up

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.839 
off correctly and actually taking up
that<00:06:11.599> I<00:06:11.659> haven't<00:06:11.990> lost<00:06:12.229> that<00:06:13.130> threading<00:06:13.610> there

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:13.849 
that I haven't lost that threading there

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:16.089 
that I haven't lost that threading there
because<00:06:14.659> otherwise<00:06:14.960> it<00:06:15.380> could<00:06:15.590> cause<00:06:15.800> a<00:06:15.830> jam

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
because otherwise it could cause a jam

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:18.430 
because otherwise it could cause a jam
later<00:06:16.400> on<00:06:16.580> once<00:06:17.330> I've<00:06:17.479> tested<00:06:17.840> everything<00:06:18.080> and

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
later on once I've tested everything and
