so the first color I'm using is this one
by<00:00:25.609> sinful<00:00:26.119> colors<00:00:26.330> and<00:00:26.900> it's<00:00:27.170> called<00:00:27.470> less

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
by sinful colors and it's called less

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:35.010 
by sinful colors and it's called less
talk<00:00:28.130> and<00:00:29.650> I<00:00:30.650> will<00:00:30.950> be<00:00:31.099> applying<00:00:31.310> this<00:00:32.739> using<00:00:33.739> a

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
talk and I will be applying this using a

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.830 
talk and I will be applying this using a
makeup<00:00:36.020> sponge<00:00:36.170> that<00:00:36.620> I<00:00:36.680> have<00:00:36.890> cut<00:00:37.220> in<00:00:37.840> two

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
makeup sponge that I have cut in two

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.350 
makeup sponge that I have cut in two
little<00:00:39.080> pieces<00:00:39.260> this<00:00:39.620> is<00:00:39.680> from<00:00:40.129> one<00:00:40.160> and<00:00:40.820> I

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360

let's talk on to the corner here and

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.770 
let's talk on to the corner here and
we're<00:00:57.229> just<00:00:57.350> going<00:00:57.470> to<00:00:57.680> sponge<00:01:01.360> and<00:01:02.360> give<00:01:02.600> the

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
we're just going to sponge and give the

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:10.179 
we're just going to sponge and give the
shot<00:01:04.330> right<00:01:05.330> at<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.600> base<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.750> if<00:01:09.740> you<00:01:09.920> can

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
shot right at the base and if you can

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.700 
shot right at the base and if you can
did<00:01:10.490> it<00:01:12.610> light<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:14.030> dark<00:01:14.990> or<00:01:15.200> dark<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.680> light

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.280 
did it light to dark or dark to light
that<00:01:16.250> would<00:01:16.460> be<00:01:16.610> preferable<00:01:17.020> but<00:01:18.020> if<00:01:18.170> you

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
that would be preferable but if you

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.260 
that would be preferable but if you
can't<00:01:18.560> just<00:01:18.830> don't<00:01:19.100> worry<00:01:19.310> about<00:01:19.369> it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.359 

just<00:01:24.539> kind<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.070> make<00:01:26.070> sure<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.460> fades<00:01:26.850> going

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
just kind of make sure it's fades going

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.300 
just kind of make sure it's fades going
upwards<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.670> goes<00:01:30.000> upwards<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.070> to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
upwards as it goes upwards so you to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.859 
upwards as it goes upwards so you to
look<00:01:32.460> something<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.329> don't<00:01:33.659> worry

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869

look something like that don't worry
about<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.850> white<00:01:36.119> around<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.289> because

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
about the the white around it because

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.490 
about the the white around it because
that's<00:01:37.950> part<00:01:38.429> of<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.880> design<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.289> that

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
that's part of the design just like that

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.090 
that's part of the design just like that
