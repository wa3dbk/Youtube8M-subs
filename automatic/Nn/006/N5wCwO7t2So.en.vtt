sentiment<00:03:49.920> but<00:03:50.459> he's<00:03:50.850> not<00:03:51.000> good<00:03:51.360> in<00:03:51.630> this<00:03:52.230> role

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
sentiment but he's not good in this role

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.789 
sentiment but he's not good in this role
you<00:03:53.010> not<00:03:53.130> mean<00:03:53.340> like<00:03:53.370> he<00:03:53.850> like<00:03:54.239> he<00:03:54.600> did<00:03:55.590> like

you not mean like he like he did like
this<00:03:55.920> formation<00:03:56.280> was<00:03:56.670> fairly<00:03:57.140> bad<00:03:58.140> when<00:03:58.530> it

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
this formation was fairly bad when it

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.170 
this formation was fairly bad when it
comes<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:58.920> midfield<00:03:59.100> because<00:03:59.700> there<00:04:00.030> was<00:04:00.120> only

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
comes to midfield because there was only

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.300 
comes to midfield because there was only
one<00:04:00.480> midfielder<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.200> inlet<00:04:01.560> couldn't<00:04:02.040> really

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
one midfielder and inlet couldn't really

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.759 
one midfielder and inlet couldn't really
feel<00:04:02.549> like<00:04:03.090> he<00:04:03.630> liked<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:03.930> wasn't<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.230> star<00:04:04.530> man

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
feel like he liked it wasn't a star man

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.410 
feel like he liked it wasn't a star man
the<00:04:05.010> midfield<00:04:05.400> you<00:04:05.519> know<00:04:05.670> obviously<00:04:06.120> that's

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
the midfield you know obviously that's

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.090 
the midfield you know obviously that's
the<00:04:06.510> only<00:04:06.720> person<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.230> was<00:04:07.350> in<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.500> midfield<00:04:07.680> I

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
the only person I was in the midfield I

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.890 
the only person I was in the midfield I
didn't<00:04:08.730> really<00:04:08.910> contribute<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.390> lot<00:04:09.510> really<00:04:09.870> I

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
didn't really contribute a lot really I

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.410 
didn't really contribute a lot really I
mean<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.440> mean<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.680> guess<00:04:10.829> he<00:04:11.430> did<00:04:11.670> get<00:04:11.880> free<00:04:12.209> goes

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
mean I mean I guess he did get free goes

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.840 
mean I mean I guess he did get free goes

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
in five games it was kind of weird for

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.449 
in five games it was kind of weird for
him<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.150> score<00:04:15.390> goals<00:04:15.420> but<00:04:16.010> this<00:04:17.010> team<00:04:17.310> was

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
him to score goals but this team was

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.150 
him to score goals but this team was
just<00:04:17.700> full<00:04:17.910> of<00:04:17.940> counter-attacks<00:04:18.890> that<00:04:19.890> we

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
just full of counter-attacks that we

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.130 
just full of counter-attacks that we
conceded<00:04:20.640> and<00:04:20.970> it's<00:04:21.120> been<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.299> penny<00:04:21.570> asked<00:04:21.810> but

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
conceded and it's been a penny asked but

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.600 
conceded and it's been a penny asked but
we<00:04:22.260> could<00:04:22.470> it<00:04:22.620> be<00:04:22.710> this<00:04:22.830> girl<00:04:23.070> quite<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.280> few<00:04:23.430> go
