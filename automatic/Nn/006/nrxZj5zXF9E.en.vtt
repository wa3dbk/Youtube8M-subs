00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
through these and then as soon as this

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.750 
through these and then as soon as this
is<00:02:51.990> over<00:02:52.230> we<00:02:52.680> will<00:02:52.770> be<00:02:52.830> asked<00:02:53.220> if<00:02:53.310> we<00:02:53.460> want<00:02:53.670> to

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
is over we will be asked if we want to

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.030 
is over we will be asked if we want to
evolve<00:02:54.240> upon<00:02:54.960> but<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.380> course<00:02:55.620> there<00:02:55.860> could<00:02:56.010> be

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
evolve upon but of course there could be

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.550 
evolve upon but of course there could be
a<00:02:56.100> certain<00:02:56.520> level<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.240> I<00:02:57.900> do<00:02:57.960> not<00:02:58.290> know<00:02:58.530> a

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
a certain level and I do not know a

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.410 
a certain level and I do not know a
certain<00:02:58.890> level<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.340> what<00:02:59.490> I<00:02:59.520> see<00:02:59.730> but<00:03:00.150> I

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
certain level this what I see but I

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.780 
certain level this what I see but I
guess<00:03:01.100> but<00:03:02.100> now<00:03:02.250> will<00:03:02.550> evolve<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.350> Zed<00:03:04.350> Strika

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
guess but now will evolve in Zed Strika

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.120 
guess but now will evolve in Zed Strika
and<00:03:05.790> we<00:03:05.970> can<00:03:06.180> rename<00:03:06.750> them<00:03:07.050> if<00:03:07.200> we<00:03:07.350> want<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.800> but

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
and we can rename them if we want to but

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.700
