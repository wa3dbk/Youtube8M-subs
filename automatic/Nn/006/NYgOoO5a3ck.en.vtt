00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.500
 batista70phone friends we continue the 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.430
 test on the new htc one e mail 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.750
 let's discover the new sense 6.0 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.070
 first and foremost as big news we have 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.710
 the motion launcher 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.080
 practically it is a series of gestures that 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.010
 they work when the display is off 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.169
 the first is the double tap on the display 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.870
 making the double tap display turns on 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.660
 only from the lock screen with the 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.910
 double tap the screen turns off though 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.890
 let's make a swipe on this side 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.890
 directly activate lab lynnfield if it is 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.430
 we do from the other we access 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.070
 directly to the home screen 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.140
 if we ask down we activate the 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.710
 voice dialing as you can see 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.860
 in this case we now bypass if we open 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.420
 an application to recall the last one 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.750
 open application we can have 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.280
 left in 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.720
 the phone and stand by and remained 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.140
 the last open application does not do 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.960
 another who speaks a swipe upwards 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.240
 if instead you swipe to the right or 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.740
 to the left as you see 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.729
 the application is bypassed a 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.010
 second time there is 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.140
 perfect jam ok 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.760
 the application is bypassed comes 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.070
 closed and automatically find yourself 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.880
 on the home screen 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.770
 or on the other side the blink feed 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.320
 that there are other big differences in the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.910
 my show launcher there is a function that a 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.759
 sometimes it works sometimes i do n't understand 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.770
 how come in case you place it in 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.380
 horizontal press the volume key 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.180
 the camera is automatically operated 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.860
 I have to understand how it works because every 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:54.539
 so it doesn't 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:57.360
 maybe I need to first turn it off and on 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.660
 go to click on the volume ok button 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.440
 this case the camera has been refined 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.229
 probably ours is a model 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.450
 still test and there are some things 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.280
 that does not work in the camera then there 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.780
 I will show that a 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.580
 lots of news let's say there are 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.470
 many new features for example in post 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.940
 production 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.560
 we can see in the editing phase are 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.920
 been introduced rhode ofurist 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.989
 new tools a focus to put into 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.880
 close up part of the photo too 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.700
 after the first floor the seasons 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.049
 dimension plos sticker copy paste but 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.239
 this I will not do you can see in the 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.130
 full video review 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.450
 then other novelty of the 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:40.360
 the new sense on 6.0 are the themes if 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.760
 let's go to the screen in settings 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.190
 in personalize there is the possibility of 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.360
 use the themes as you can 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.220
 see combine to make this go to 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.510
 color for example the writings there 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.920
 like this color we want to pass 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.150
 apply the background to the launch 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.080
 pleasure or not pleasure can be changed 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.300
 as you wish 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.710
 you see it is thematized in a manner 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.600
 different 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.270
 or we don't like we want something 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.850
 more sober we always go in the themes 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.940
 let's go to choose the dark one 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.250
 yes this is very minimal as you see 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.600
 here too, the brightness becomes 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.600
 green 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.740
 you can see it you can change it then to 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.440
 pleasure you can safely go 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.310
 in the settings besides changing the 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.950
 theme 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.090
 you can safely change it 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.800
 background from various backgrounds you are not 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.130
 obliged to use the background that you 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.160
 proposes went quietly into the 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.720
 home screen wallpaper htc wallpapers ad 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.250
 example and choose the one that best suits you 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.950
 like in my case this is what 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.920
 I prefer you go to theming it 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.380
 as you prefer we say that then a 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.200
 part some htc mini type news which is 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.340
 a kind of external controller there 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.620
 I recommend going to see on the internet 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.000
 how as not to 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.550
 layout 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.870
 we basically see what the is 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.610
 main difference between the two senses 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.800
 practically in 5.5 the screen 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.800
 main is the pink blink screen 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.820
 challenges in the sense 6.0 lab 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.280
 lynnfield has been positioned 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.560
 sideways and the main screen 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.530
 it becomes the home screen which I have 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.880
 done on the max by putting it as before 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.950
 screen on the right 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.080
 here instead we say back to one 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.210
 more traditional screen with the 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.160
 possibility of having lab lynnfield on 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.080
 left this we say only the 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.310
 main differences associated with 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.930
 motion l'on 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.460
 then there are small differences 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.890
 like for example the themes and some 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.330
 change in settings and 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.160
 photographic part that I have with my 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.180
 said it was enriched especially in 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.340
 post production phase of the photos 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.220
 however the fluidity remains the 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.030
 same very fast very practical with 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.400
 the usual widgets very much enriched 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.770
 ok here i just wanted you to see how the 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.960
 sense 6.0 since of things to say there is 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.450
 I'm really many, I'm preferring 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.730
 split a bit between software and hardware 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.290
 then do the full video review 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.900
 just not to have to do one 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.390
 40 45 minute review that could 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.160
 I don't think I can get very heavy 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.500
 it will be very short because in the camera 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.480
 there is a lot to say with this conclusion 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.770
 only you from 6am slammed 70 for 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.770
