00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.900
 flying sausage actually at the base when 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.940
 you look like that it could be 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.720
 a sausage but in fact it's a 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:42.060

 so miss this is a rocket 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.340

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.540

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.920
 cool and then it turns out that a 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.369
