00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:48.500 

I<00:00:45.920> enrolled<00:00:46.920> my<00:00:47.310> son<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.820> Alpha<00:00:48.120> Academy

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
I enrolled my son in Alpha Academy

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.080 
I enrolled my son in Alpha Academy
because<00:00:48.870> he<00:00:49.110> was<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.410> public<00:00:50.010> school<00:00:50.310> and<00:00:50.580> even

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
because he was in public school and even

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.790 
because he was in public school and even
though<00:00:51.180> he's<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.660> good<00:00:52.080> public<00:00:52.470> school

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
though he's in a good public school

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.860 
though he's in a good public school
there<00:00:53.250> was<00:00:53.370> too<00:00:53.580> many<00:00:53.760> other<00:00:54.030> kids<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
there was too many other kids for the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.430 
there was too many other kids for the
teachers<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.740> be<00:00:56.160> able<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.340> focus<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.880> him

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
teachers to be able to focus on him

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.870 
teachers to be able to focus on him
so<00:00:58.440> I'd<00:00:58.560> heard<00:00:58.740> about<00:00:58.830> Alpha<00:00:59.280> Academy<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.820> I

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
so I'd heard about Alpha Academy and I

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.390 
so I'd heard about Alpha Academy and I
knew<00:01:00.030> his<00:01:00.210> smaller<00:01:00.540> classes<00:01:00.930> more<00:01:01.860> attention

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
knew his smaller classes more attention

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.910 
knew his smaller classes more attention
and<00:01:02.550> definitely<00:01:03.000> more<00:01:03.180> structure<00:01:03.720> and<00:01:03.920> that's

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and definitely more structure and that's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.770 
and definitely more structure and that's
exactly<00:01:05.369> what<00:01:05.519> he<00:01:05.610> needed<00:01:05.820> back<00:01:06.509> when<00:01:06.689> we

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
exactly what he needed back when we

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.050
