00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
my altas mordekaiser and everything in

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.200 
my altas mordekaiser and everything in
one<00:01:47.939> target<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.840> clone<00:01:49.049> and

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
one target so we can get the clone and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.569 
one target so we can get the clone and
then<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.570> we<00:01:51.990> get<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.380> clone<00:01:52.649> then<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.250> easy

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
then if we get the clone then it's easy

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.030 
then if we get the clone then it's easy
when<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:54.090> us<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.420> think<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:55.320> effectively

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
when for us I think but effectively

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.010 
when for us I think but effectively
didn't<00:01:56.490> even<00:01:56.850> get<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.060> corner<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.780> many

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
didn't even get the corner of that many

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.050 
didn't even get the corner of that many
times<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.500> wasn't<00:01:58.799> really<00:01:58.950> necessary<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.790> I

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
times it wasn't really necessary and I
