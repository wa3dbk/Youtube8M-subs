00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.600 

so<00:00:00.870> nowadays<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.469> getting<00:00:01.770> so<00:00:02.070> easy<00:00:02.370> to

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
so nowadays is getting so easy to

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.210 
so nowadays is getting so easy to
implement<00:00:02.850> electromechanical<00:00:03.540> actuators

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:04.220 
implement electromechanical actuators

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.619 
implement electromechanical actuators
because<00:00:05.220> companies<00:00:05.549> like<00:00:05.879> intelligent

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
because companies like intelligent

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.799 
because companies like intelligent
actuator<00:00:07.020> are<00:00:07.610> developing<00:00:08.610> actuator<00:00:09.179> systems

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
actuator are developing actuator systems

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.930 
actuator are developing actuator systems
as<00:00:10.019> opposed<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.740> using<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.099> component<00:00:11.490> approach

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
as opposed to using a component approach

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.289 
as opposed to using a component approach
so<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:13.469> product<00:00:13.889> here<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.429> ball<00:00:14.820> screw<00:00:15.089> a

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
so this product here is a ball screw a

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.689 
so this product here is a ball screw a

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
then you connect that up to a drive

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.900 
then you connect that up to a drive
that's<00:00:27.810> paired<00:00:28.170> with<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.470> actuator<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.760> when

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
that's paired with that actuator so when

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.720 
that's paired with that actuator so when
you<00:00:30.000> order<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.689> system<00:00:31.160> this<00:00:32.160> Drive<00:00:32.460> will

type<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.500> when<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.190> go<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.340> when<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.610> sit<00:00:44.789> down

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
type so when you go to when you sit down

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.959 
type so when you go to when you sit down
to<00:00:44.969> configure<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> drive<00:00:46.489> you<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
to configure the drive you just have to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.330 
to configure the drive you just have to
enter<00:00:48.090> an<00:00:48.360> application<00:00:49.110> data<00:00:49.350> such<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.100> linear

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
enter an application data such as linear

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.660 
enter an application data such as linear
speeds<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:51.750> set<00:00:52.050> points<00:00:52.670> accelerations

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
speeds for set points accelerations

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.360 
speeds for set points accelerations
decelerations<00:00:54.570> things<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.129> it

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
decelerations things like that so it

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.459 
decelerations things like that so it
just<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.760> becomes<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.180> easy<00:00:57.210> now<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.289> this

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
just it becomes so easy now and in this

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.740 
just it becomes so easy now and in this
application<00:00:59.070> we're<00:00:59.760> gonna<00:00:59.879> open<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
application we're gonna open up the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.360 
application we're gonna open up the
actuator<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.289> show<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.530> what's<00:01:01.680> inside<00:01:01.859> and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
actuator and show you what's inside and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.520 
actuator and show you what's inside and
then<00:01:02.940> we're<00:01:03.300> also<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.750> configure<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
then we're also going to configure the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.280 
then we're also going to configure the
drive<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.670> very<00:01:06.060> basic<00:01:06.270> application<00:01:06.990> just

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
drive for a very basic application just

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.990 
drive for a very basic application just
so<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.010> show<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.220> how<00:01:08.520> quickly<00:01:08.850> you

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
so you just to show you how quickly you

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.730 
so you just to show you how quickly you
can<00:01:09.360> get<00:01:09.420> off<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.570> ground<00:01:09.689> with<00:01:10.590> these

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
can get off the ground with these

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:25.640 
can get off the ground with these
systems<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.760> let's<00:01:12.450> take<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> look<00:01:12.750> at

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.100 
mates up to be a coupling here on the
mechanism<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.300> back<00:02:10.450> of<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.720> stepper

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
mechanism on the back of the stepper

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.520 
mechanism on the back of the stepper
it's<00:02:11.710> got<00:02:11.980> an<00:02:12.550> encoder<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.270> you<00:02:13.630> know<00:02:13.720> chip

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
it's got an encoder and you know chip

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.320 
it's got an encoder and you know chip
basically<00:02:15.160> for<00:02:15.459> collecting<00:02:16.180> and

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
basically for collecting and

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.770 
basically for collecting and
distributing<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.560> information<00:02:18.160> so<00:02:19.150> this<00:02:19.630> is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
distributing that information so this is

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.949 
distributing that information so this is
truly<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.380> closed-loop<00:02:21.030> product<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.270> it's<00:02:22.840> an

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
truly a closed-loop product and it's an

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.480 
truly a closed-loop product and it's an
all-encompassing<00:02:23.230> product<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.160> you've<00:02:24.310> got

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
all-encompassing product so you've got

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.229 
all-encompassing product so you've got
mechanism<00:02:25.150> motor<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.140> feedback<00:02:26.980> so<00:02:27.520> now<00:02:28.180> that

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
mechanism motor and feedback so now that

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.180 
mechanism motor and feedback so now that
you<00:02:28.360> understand<00:02:28.750> what<00:02:29.440> it's<00:02:29.590> comprised<00:02:29.950> of

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
you understand what it's comprised of

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.300 
you understand what it's comprised of
let's<00:02:30.670> take<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:30.970> look<00:02:31.180> at<00:02:31.420> an<00:02:31.630> application<00:02:32.310> now

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
let's take a look at an application now

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.030 
let's take a look at an application now
in<00:02:33.459> this<00:02:33.550> exercise<00:02:33.700> we're<00:02:34.630> going<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.980> kind<00:02:35.980> of

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
in this exercise we're going to kind of

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.470 
in this exercise we're going to kind of
step<00:02:36.280> through<00:02:36.489> a<00:02:36.520> common<00:02:36.880> application<00:02:37.450> for

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
step through a common application for

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.199 
step through a common application for
electromechanical<00:02:38.080> actuators<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.850> that<00:02:40.060> is

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
electromechanical actuators and that is

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.030 
electromechanical actuators and that is
the<00:02:40.360> replacements<00:02:40.989> of<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.320> pneumatic<00:02:41.590> or

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
the replacements of a pneumatic or

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.860 
the replacements of a pneumatic or
hydraulic<00:02:42.100> you<00:02:43.090> know<00:02:43.180> fluid<00:02:43.540> powered

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
hydraulic you know fluid powered

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.340 
hydraulic you know fluid powered
actuator<00:02:45.120> with<00:02:46.120> an<00:02:46.330> electromechanical<00:02:46.810> one

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
actuator with an electromechanical one

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.280 
actuator with an electromechanical one
and<00:02:47.530> so<00:02:47.980> what<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.280> often<00:02:48.730> entails<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.330> just<00:02:50.110> a

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
and so what that often entails is just a

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.140 
and so what that often entails is just a
simple<00:02:50.709> two<00:02:50.890> position<00:02:51.340> application<00:02:51.970> in

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
simple two position application in

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.150 
simple two position application in
extended<00:02:52.660> position<00:02:52.810> in<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.650> retracted

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
extended position in a retracted

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.460 
extended position in a retracted
position<00:02:54.570> so<00:02:55.570> that's<00:02:55.989> what<00:02:56.110> we're<00:02:56.200> gonna<00:02:56.290> go

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
position so that's what we're gonna go

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.229 
position so that's what we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.620> do<00:02:56.769> now<00:02:57.640> if<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.820> look<00:02:57.940> over<00:02:58.030> here

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
ahead and do now if you look over here

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.610 
ahead and do now if you look over here
in<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.360> software<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:58.959> can<00:02:59.230> see<00:02:59.380> that<00:02:59.500> we've

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
in the software you can see that we've

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.770 
in the software you can see that we've
got<00:02:59.769> a<00:02:59.830> point<00:03:00.250> table<00:03:00.459> down<00:03:00.760> here<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.269> we've

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
got a point table down here and we've

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.240 
got a point table down here and we've
got<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:01.930> bunch<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.200> controls<00:03:02.590> up<00:03:02.769> here<00:03:03.070> and

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
got a bunch of controls up here and

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.740 
got a bunch of controls up here and
things<00:03:03.610> like<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:03.790> but<00:03:04.480> for<00:03:04.600> this

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
things like that but for this

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.940 
things like that but for this
application<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.440> don't<00:03:05.620> even<00:03:05.739> need<00:03:05.890> to

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
application you don't even need to

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.380 
application you don't even need to
really<00:03:06.190> worry<00:03:06.519> too<00:03:06.610> much<00:03:06.790> about<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.330> stuff

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
really worry too much about that stuff

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.900 
really worry too much about that stuff
so<00:03:08.230> we're<00:03:08.980> just<00:03:09.010> gonna<00:03:09.190> teach<00:03:09.550> it<00:03:09.580> to

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
so we're just gonna teach it to

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.180 
so we're just gonna teach it to
positions<00:03:10.390> so<00:03:10.720> I'm<00:03:10.870> gonna<00:03:11.050> physically<00:03:11.739> pull

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
positions so I'm gonna physically pull

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.710 
positions so I'm gonna physically pull
the<00:03:12.400> loops<00:03:12.760> I<00:03:13.030> have<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.209> turn<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.480> power<00:03:13.660> off

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
the loops I have to turn the power off

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.110 
the loops I have to turn the power off
the<00:03:13.930> servo<00:03:14.200> here<00:03:14.380> I'm<00:03:15.100> gonna<00:03:15.220> physically<00:03:15.610> pull

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
the servo here I'm gonna physically pull

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.860 
the servo here I'm gonna physically pull
the<00:03:16.390> rod<00:03:17.350> out<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.800> actuator<00:03:18.370> like<00:03:18.670> that

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the rod out of the actuator like that

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.940 
the rod out of the actuator like that
and<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:19.930> might<00:03:20.080> call<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.260> our<00:03:20.530> extended

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
and I might call that our extended

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.890 
and I might call that our extended
position<00:03:21.340> so<00:03:21.580> imagine<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.450> we've<00:03:22.660> got<00:03:22.870> a

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
position so imagine that we've got a

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.229 
position so imagine that we've got a
machine<00:03:23.410> here<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:23.980> we're<00:03:24.610> pulling<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.090> rod

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
machine here and we're pulling the rod

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.810 
machine here and we're pulling the rod
into<00:03:25.480> position<00:03:26.019> so<00:03:26.860> that<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.040> meets<00:03:27.310> up<00:03:27.610> with

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
into position so that it meets up with

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.940 
into position so that it meets up with
you<00:03:28.690> know<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.930> mechanism<00:03:29.470> or<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.590> carriage

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
you know the mechanism or the carriage

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.440 
you know the mechanism or the carriage
or<00:03:30.070> whatever<00:03:30.340> in<00:03:30.640> its<00:03:30.820> extended<00:03:31.180> most

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
or whatever in its extended most

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.229 
or whatever in its extended most
position<00:03:31.989> or<00:03:32.650> its<00:03:32.920> you<00:03:33.430> know<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.700> position

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
position or its you know the position

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.710 
position or its you know the position
that's<00:03:34.570> optimal<00:03:34.959> for<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.139> process

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
that's optimal for the process

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.440 
that's optimal for the process
so<00:03:36.380> let's<00:03:36.890> we've<00:03:37.220> got<00:03:37.400> that<00:03:37.580> there<00:03:37.790> so<00:03:38.150> now<00:03:38.270> I'm

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
so let's we've got that there so now I'm

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.630 
so let's we've got that there so now I'm
gonna<00:03:38.600> simply<00:03:39.080> click<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.860> teach<00:03:40.310> button

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
gonna simply click the teach button

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.250 
gonna simply click the teach button
which<00:03:40.790> is<00:03:40.820> right<00:03:40.940> here<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:41.840> can<00:03:41.990> see<00:03:42.170> it

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
which is right here and you can see it

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.350 
which is right here and you can see it
just<00:03:42.290> populated<00:03:42.980> that<00:03:43.100> point<00:03:43.370> table<00:03:43.700> with<00:03:44.330> a

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
just populated that point table with a

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.780 
just populated that point table with a
position<00:03:44.860> of<00:03:45.860> one<00:03:46.040> hundred<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.340> forty<00:03:46.610> seven

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
position of one hundred and forty seven

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.730 
position of one hundred and forty seven
point<00:03:47.090> three<00:03:47.350> millimeters<00:03:48.350> and<00:03:48.620> that's

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
point three millimeters and that's

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.730 
point three millimeters and that's
editable<00:03:49.610> too<00:03:49.820> so<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:50.840> know<00:03:50.930> for<00:03:51.290> example<00:03:51.380> we

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
editable too so you know for example we

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.960 
editable too so you know for example we
could<00:03:51.890> just<00:03:52.010> change<00:03:52.250> that<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.430> one<00:03:52.610> forty<00:03:52.880> five

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
could just change that to one forty five

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.030 
could just change that to one forty five
if<00:03:53.210> we<00:03:53.330> wanted<00:03:53.600> to<00:03:53.660> if<00:03:53.960> we<00:03:54.530> were<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.680> little<00:03:54.860> bit

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
if we wanted to if we were a little bit

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.760 
if we wanted to if we were a little bit
too<00:03:55.460> far<00:03:55.640> extended<00:03:56.080> now<00:03:57.080> let's<00:03:57.410> teach<00:03:57.650> a

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
too far extended now let's teach a

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.020 
too far extended now let's teach a
retract<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:58.190> position<00:03:58.720> okay<00:04:00.610> teach<00:04:01.610> all

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
retract the position okay teach all

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.860 
retract the position okay teach all
right<00:04:02.270> now<00:04:02.690> download<00:04:03.140> it<00:04:03.230> to<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:03.410> controller

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
right now download it to the controller

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.270 
right now download it to the controller
okay<00:04:05.870> now<00:04:06.260> we're<00:04:06.380> gonna<00:04:06.440> turn<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.830> servo<00:04:07.100> on

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
okay now we're gonna turn the servo on

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.230 
okay now we're gonna turn the servo on
we're<00:04:07.670> gonna<00:04:07.760> home<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.150> really<00:04:08.360> quick<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:11.060> so

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
we're gonna home it really quick and so

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.750 
we're gonna home it really quick and so
what<00:04:11.360> you'll<00:04:11.450> see<00:04:11.630> in<00:04:11.690> that<00:04:11.810> home<00:04:11.990> routine<00:04:12.760> it

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
what you'll see in that home routine it

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.090 
what you'll see in that home routine it
basically<00:04:14.270> draws<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:15.080> rod<00:04:15.290> of<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.770> actuator

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
basically draws the rod of the actuator

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.970 
basically draws the rod of the actuator
into<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:17.000> frame<00:04:17.330> until<00:04:17.630> it<00:04:18.019> hits<00:04:18.170> a<00:04:18.320> softly

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
into the frame until it hits a softly

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.130 
into the frame until it hits a softly
hits<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.280> hard<00:04:19.489> stop<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.390> then<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.660> backs<00:04:20.900> off

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
hits a hard stop and then it backs off

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.990 
hits a hard stop and then it backs off
that<00:04:21.350> hard<00:04:21.620> stop<00:04:21.920> a<00:04:22.190> certain<00:04:22.730> amount<00:04:22.880> of

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
that hard stop a certain amount of

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.090 
that hard stop a certain amount of
encoder<00:04:23.360> pulses<00:04:23.570> which<00:04:24.290> results<00:04:24.710> in<00:04:24.770> a<00:04:24.860> very

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
encoder pulses which results in a very

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.870 
encoder pulses which results in a very
repeatable<00:04:25.730> homing<00:04:26.390> routine<00:04:27.520> so<00:04:28.520> now<00:04:28.640> we<00:04:28.700> can

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
repeatable homing routine so now we can

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.370 
repeatable homing routine so now we can
press<00:04:29.090> play<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:29.630> when<00:04:29.750> I<00:04:29.780> press<00:04:29.990> play<00:04:30.170> it's

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
press play and when I press play it's

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.630 
press play and when I press play it's
good<00:04:30.560> it's<00:04:30.740> just<00:04:30.800> going<00:04:31.040> to<00:04:31.100> cycle<00:04:31.280> through

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
good it's just going to cycle through

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.220 
good it's just going to cycle through
these<00:04:31.730> two<00:04:31.970> points<00:04:32.000> that<00:04:32.360> we<00:04:32.450> taught<00:04:32.750> in<00:04:33.110> a

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
these two points that we taught in a

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.960 
these two points that we taught in a
real<00:04:33.410> application<00:04:34.100> you<00:04:34.580> would<00:04:34.700> of<00:04:34.820> course

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
real application you would of course

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.000 
real application you would of course
assign<00:04:35.390> a<00:04:35.690> discrete<00:04:36.260> input<00:04:36.560> to<00:04:36.680> each<00:04:36.800> one<00:04:36.950> of

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
assign a discrete input to each one of

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.860 
assign a discrete input to each one of
these<00:04:37.070> positions<00:04:37.340> or<00:04:38.060> call<00:04:38.300> upon<00:04:38.540> them<00:04:38.720> with

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
these positions or call upon them with

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.390 
these positions or call upon them with
Ethernet<00:04:39.530> proto<00:04:39.830> or<00:04:40.040> with<00:04:40.160> that<00:04:40.280> I'm<00:04:40.370> sorry

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
Ethernet proto or with that I'm sorry

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.980 
Ethernet proto or with that I'm sorry
with<00:04:40.640> a<00:04:40.700> communication<00:04:41.360> protocol<00:04:41.720> such<00:04:41.930> as

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
with a communication protocol such as

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.740 
with a communication protocol such as
Ethernet<00:04:42.200> IP<00:04:42.940> so<00:04:43.940> let's<00:04:44.120> press<00:04:44.270> play<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:44.600> just

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
Ethernet IP so let's press play and just

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.220 
Ethernet IP so let's press play and just
look<00:04:44.870> at<00:04:44.960> every<00:04:45.110> minute<00:04:49.480> okay<00:04:50.480> that's<00:04:51.050> pretty

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
look at every minute okay that's pretty

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.010 
look at every minute okay that's pretty
fast<00:04:51.850> some<00:04:52.850> applications<00:04:53.419> need<00:04:53.600> to<00:04:53.690> be<00:04:53.780> fast

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
fast some applications need to be fast

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.170 
fast some applications need to be fast
let's<00:04:54.590> say<00:04:54.740> that<00:04:55.160> this<00:04:55.550> application<00:04:55.730> is<00:04:56.090> a

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
let's say that this application is a

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.240 
let's say that this application is a
little<00:04:56.390> bit<00:04:56.480> more<00:04:56.660> delicate<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:57.290> that<00:04:58.130> would

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
little bit more delicate and that would

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.060 
little bit more delicate and that would
be<00:04:58.370> to<00:04:58.580> herky-jerky<00:04:58.910> for<00:04:59.419> our<00:04:59.510> machine<00:05:00.070> so

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
be to herky-jerky for our machine so

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.890 
be to herky-jerky for our machine so
that's<00:05:01.370> this<00:05:01.880> this<00:05:02.150> will<00:05:02.300> highlight<00:05:02.600> some<00:05:02.660> of

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
that's this this will highlight some of

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.880 
that's this this will highlight some of
the<00:05:02.990> advantages<00:05:03.320> of<00:05:03.380> an<00:05:03.530> electromechanical

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
the advantages of an electromechanical

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.760 
the advantages of an electromechanical
actuator<00:05:04.930> had<00:05:05.930> you<00:05:06.020> headed<00:05:06.260> a<00:05:06.350> flute<00:05:06.590> power

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
actuator had you headed a flute power

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.080 
actuator had you headed a flute power
system<00:05:07.160> installed<00:05:07.490> here<00:05:07.640> you'd<00:05:07.850> have<00:05:07.910> to

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
system installed here you'd have to

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.480 
system installed here you'd have to
manually<00:05:08.930> adjust<00:05:09.020> some<00:05:09.350> flow<00:05:09.590> controls<00:05:10.070> or

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
manually adjust some flow controls or

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.400 
manually adjust some flow controls or
pressure<00:05:11.060> controls<00:05:11.570> to<00:05:11.960> you<00:05:12.050> know<00:05:12.140> to<00:05:12.200> change

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
pressure controls to you know to change

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.590 
pressure controls to you know to change
the<00:05:12.650> speed<00:05:12.919> and<00:05:13.070> force<00:05:13.340> the<00:05:13.580> system<00:05:13.790> here

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
the speed and force the system here

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.760 
the speed and force the system here
we're<00:05:14.780> just<00:05:14.810> gonna<00:05:14.960> go<00:05:15.140> into<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.410> point<00:05:15.620> table

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
we're just gonna go into the point table

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.440 
we're just gonna go into the point table
and<00:05:15.980> so<00:05:16.100> it<00:05:16.160> men<00:05:16.370> either<00:05:16.640> millimeters<00:05:17.300> per

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
and so it men either millimeters per

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.570 
and so it men either millimeters per
second<00:05:17.840> that<00:05:18.020> is<00:05:18.200> just<00:05:18.410> too<00:05:18.919> darn<00:05:19.040> fast

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
second that is just too darn fast

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.090 
second that is just too darn fast
I'm<00:05:19.700> going<00:05:19.880> to<00:05:19.940> turn<00:05:20.090> it<00:05:20.180> down<00:05:20.390> to<00:05:20.810> 100<00:05:21.380> for<00:05:21.980> the

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
I'm going to turn it down to 100 for the

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.480 
I'm going to turn it down to 100 for the
extended<00:05:22.810> for<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:23.870> extended<00:05:24.169> motion<00:05:25.130> and

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
extended for the extended motion and

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.950 
extended for the extended motion and
then<00:05:25.610> for<00:05:25.730> their<00:05:25.850> track<00:05:26.060> motion<00:05:26.450> maybe<00:05:26.690> we<00:05:26.840> can

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
then for their track motion maybe we can

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.030 
then for their track motion maybe we can
go<00:05:27.050> a<00:05:27.080> little<00:05:27.169> bit<00:05:27.290> quicker<00:05:27.500> maybe<00:05:27.890> we<00:05:27.980> don't

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
go a little bit quicker maybe we don't

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.409 
go a little bit quicker maybe we don't
have<00:05:28.220> product<00:05:28.700> on<00:05:28.790> the<00:05:28.910> machine<00:05:29.150> at<00:05:29.270> that

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
have product on the machine at that

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.650 
have product on the machine at that
point<00:05:29.660> so<00:05:30.440> let's<00:05:30.590> call<00:05:30.800> that<00:05:30.919> 200<00:05:31.490> and<00:05:32.360> again

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
point so let's call that 200 and again

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.820 
point so let's call that 200 and again
we're<00:05:32.810> just<00:05:32.840> gonna<00:05:33.110> download<00:05:33.290> that<00:05:33.500> to<00:05:33.650> that

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
we're just gonna download that to that

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.060 
we're just gonna download that to that
controller<00:05:34.190> okay<00:05:35.320> all<00:05:36.320> right<00:05:36.500> you've<00:05:36.860> taught

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
controller okay all right you've taught

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.740 
controller okay all right you've taught
the<00:05:37.220> controller<00:05:37.580> now<00:05:37.880> let's<00:05:38.180> press<00:05:38.360> play<00:05:38.419> and

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
the controller now let's press play and

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.330 
the controller now let's press play and
see<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:39.020> change

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.380 

okay<00:05:45.340> so<00:05:45.400> you<00:05:45.610> could<00:05:45.760> see<00:05:45.910> there<00:05:46.090> that<00:05:46.240> it<00:05:46.330> was

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
okay so you could see there that it was

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.680 
okay so you could see there that it was
much<00:05:46.690> slower<00:05:47.280> which<00:05:48.280> would<00:05:48.460> of<00:05:48.700> course<00:05:48.760> comply

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
much slower which would of course comply

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.530 
much slower which would of course comply
with<00:05:49.870> a<00:05:49.900> delicate<00:05:50.200> process<00:05:50.490> so<00:05:51.490> for<00:05:52.090> a<00:05:52.150> simple

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
with a delicate process so for a simple

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.510 
with a delicate process so for a simple
to<00:05:52.780> point<00:05:53.050> position<00:05:53.470> application<00:05:54.070> that's

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
to point position application that's

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.620 
to point position application that's
really<00:05:54.790> all<00:05:54.910> there<00:05:55.030> is<00:05:55.090> to<00:05:55.210> it

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
really all there is to it

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.210 
really all there is to it
and<00:05:55.720> if<00:05:56.140> it<00:05:56.290> gets<00:05:56.380> more<00:05:56.620> complex<00:05:56.980> than<00:05:57.160> that

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
and if it gets more complex than that

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.620 
and if it gets more complex than that
it's<00:05:57.520> just<00:05:57.760> a<00:05:57.820> matter<00:05:57.970> of<00:05:58.090> adding<00:05:58.240> in<00:05:58.480> more

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
it's just a matter of adding in more

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.720 
it's just a matter of adding in more
points<00:05:59.080> in<00:05:59.260> calling<00:05:59.980> upon<00:06:00.250> those<00:06:00.460> with

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:00.730 
points in calling upon those with

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.250 
points in calling upon those with
discrete<00:06:01.330> i/o<00:06:01.480> or<00:06:01.780> the<00:06:01.900> communication

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
discrete i/o or the communication

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.550 
discrete i/o or the communication
protocol<00:06:02.890> so<00:06:03.460> that's<00:06:03.610> about<00:06:03.790> it<00:06:04.350> so<00:06:05.350> now<00:06:05.470> that

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
protocol so that's about it so now that

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.790 
protocol so that's about it so now that
you've<00:06:05.710> seen<00:06:05.920> what<00:06:05.980> intelligent<00:06:06.790> actuators

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
you've seen what intelligent actuators

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.960 
you've seen what intelligent actuators
actuator<00:06:08.800> systems<00:06:09.220> are<00:06:09.370> comprised<00:06:09.760> of

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
actuator systems are comprised of

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.320 
actuator systems are comprised of
meaning<00:06:10.510> the<00:06:11.100> electromechanical<00:06:12.330> actuator

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
meaning the electromechanical actuator

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.170 
meaning the electromechanical actuator
which<00:06:13.510> is<00:06:13.660> the<00:06:13.810> the<00:06:14.290> screw<00:06:14.790> the<00:06:15.790> motor<00:06:15.970> and<00:06:16.090> the

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
which is the the screw the motor and the

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.060 
which is the the screw the motor and the
feedback<00:06:16.540> and<00:06:16.930> then<00:06:17.380> the<00:06:17.620> drive<00:06:17.830> that's

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
feedback and then the drive that's

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.380 
feedback and then the drive that's
paired<00:06:18.310> with<00:06:18.460> it

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
paired with it

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.060 
paired with it
you<00:06:19.960> may<00:06:20.110> have<00:06:20.230> some<00:06:20.410> ideas<00:06:20.740> of<00:06:20.890> your<00:06:20.920> own

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
you may have some ideas of your own

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.800 
you may have some ideas of your own
where<00:06:21.640> you<00:06:21.670> could<00:06:21.880> apply<00:06:22.060> this<00:06:22.120> technology<00:06:22.570> to

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
where you could apply this technology to

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.170 
where you could apply this technology to
improve<00:06:23.620> your<00:06:23.800> process<00:06:24.190> and<00:06:24.430> if<00:06:24.910> that's<00:06:25.060> the

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
improve your process and if that's the

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.420 
improve your process and if that's the
