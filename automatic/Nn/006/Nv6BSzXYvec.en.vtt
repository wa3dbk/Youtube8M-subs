00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:08.900
 this car is driving in circles 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:11.360
 but hear where the driver is 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.630
 we received a call about a car 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.430
 who was driving in circles 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.050
 you know maybe this is the most 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.140
 interesting to happen in this little 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.140
 people just watch a car spin 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.060
 and round and round 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.939
 You can see the sweater and the bag from the 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.169
 owner in the front seat but a 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.509
 where it gone 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.699
 he thought to leave the lever braked and I leave it 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.800
 in reverse and when he got out of his car the 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:39.040
 self hit her and started spinning and spinning 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.350
 in reverse in the parking lot 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.800
 the cops do some calculations of 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.800
 analysis 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.220
 here is the back window opens and 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.380
 you enter 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.470
 Of course they can not do it without breaking 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.470
 nothing 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.710
 but the door does not open at last it's 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.280
 Drastic action plan time is like 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.280
 the dukes of hazzard 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.030
 in 13 years this is the craziest thing I've ever 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.800
 done they saw it here a day that will live 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.570
 forever when the greatest 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.980
 indiana heroes beat the car 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.980
 ghost of the doom 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.680
 pulling the rope the maximum risk 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.050
 right away a thief thinks it was a 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.590
 easy and easy assault for the policeman who 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.929
 it fixed you move friend 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.020
 a robot policeman gets an arrest with 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.240
 the help of real policemen 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.530
 some criminals are so stupid that neither 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.690
 they can even jump well 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.250
 a kidnapper takes a hostage but his 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.110
 flight is about to be canceled 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.790
 and they are sure that they want to accompany 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.940
 a policeman in a chase 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.270
 maximum risk the toughest program in the 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.270
 world
