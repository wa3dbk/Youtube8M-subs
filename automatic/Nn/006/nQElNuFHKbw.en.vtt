what's up everyone I'm Vesper and today

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.940 
what's up everyone I'm Vesper and today
we<00:00:03.149> have<00:00:03.240> another<00:00:03.480> challenge<00:00:03.870> 30<00:00:04.230> using<00:00:04.740> I

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
we have another challenge 30 using I

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.160 
we have another challenge 30 using I
guess<00:00:05.420> we're<00:00:06.420> getting<00:00:06.629> pretty<00:00:06.779> close<00:00:07.049> now

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
guess we're getting pretty close now

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.259 
guess we're getting pretty close now
guys<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.649> only<00:00:07.950> have<00:00:08.189> three<00:00:08.490> left<00:00:08.519> including

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
guys I only have three left including

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.320 
guys I only have three left including
this<00:00:09.420> one<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.889> guess<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.460> challenge<00:00:11.910> 30<00:00:12.150> is

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
this one and I guess is challenge 30 is

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.870 
this one and I guess is challenge 30 is
actually<00:00:12.660> really<00:00:12.870> cool<00:00:13.219> it<00:00:14.219> requires<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.849> to

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
actually really cool it requires you to

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.060 
actually really cool it requires you to
do<00:00:15.150> every<00:00:15.599> single<00:00:15.929> move<00:00:16.109> she<00:00:16.379> has<00:00:16.650> her

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
do every single move she has her

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.840 
do every single move she has her
specials<00:00:17.699> all<00:00:18.029> her<00:00:18.480> dashes<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.340> her<00:00:20.340> supers

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
specials all her dashes and her supers

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.080 
specials all her dashes and her supers
all<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.510> single<00:00:21.689> combo<00:00:22.670> so<00:00:23.670> yeah<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.029> a

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
all in a single combo so yeah it's a

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.120 
all in a single combo so yeah it's a
pretty<00:00:24.300> big<00:00:24.689> puzzle<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.350> figure<00:00:25.680> out<00:00:25.800> your<00:00:26.010> own

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
pretty big puzzle to figure out your own

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.380 
pretty big puzzle to figure out your own
it's<00:00:26.640> really<00:00:26.970> unique<00:00:27.380> but<00:00:28.730> that<00:00:29.730> also<00:00:30.000> means

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
it's really unique but that also means

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.269 
it's really unique but that also means
that<00:00:30.480> there's<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.779> lot<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.230> ways<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.769> do<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.070> as

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
that there's a lot of ways to do it as

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.940 
that there's a lot of ways to do it as
well<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.840> arcs<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.350> Way's<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.800> they

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
well and the arcs this Way's that they

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.459 
well and the arcs this Way's that they
provide<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.030> uh<00:00:36.110> it's<00:00:37.110> pretty

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
provide to do it is uh it's pretty

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.410 
provide to do it is uh it's pretty
stupid<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.010> unnecessarily<00:00:38.640> hard<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.360> I

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
stupid it's unnecessarily hard so I

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.660 
stupid it's unnecessarily hard so I
don't<00:00:39.629> use<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.870> one<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.860> myth<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.280> chose

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
don't use that one the myth that I chose

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.330 
don't use that one the myth that I chose
to<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> lot<00:00:42.719> easier<00:00:42.860> but<00:00:43.860> there<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.129> some

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
to do is a lot easier but there is some

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.940 
to do is a lot easier but there is some
kind<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.360> finicky<00:00:45.719> timing<00:00:46.320> things<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.920> I

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
kind of finicky timing things that I

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.400 
kind of finicky timing things that I
have<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.250> mention<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:48.329> anyways<00:00:48.960> let's<00:00:49.289> get

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
have to mention but anyways let's get

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.600 
have to mention but anyways let's get
this<00:00:49.530> started<00:00:49.739> let<00:00:50.039> me<00:00:50.070> show<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.309> how<00:00:50.489> it's

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
this started let me show you how it's

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:05.020 
this started let me show you how it's
done

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.580 

so<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.420> see<00:01:06.600> even<00:01:07.110> though<00:01:07.320> there's<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
so as you can see even though there's a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.350 
so as you can see even though there's a
lot<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.890> moves<00:01:08.160> that<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.670> combo<00:01:09.240> it's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
lot of moves that the combo it's

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.810 
lot of moves that the combo it's
actually<00:01:09.660> really<00:01:09.990> short<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:11.160> there<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> lot

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
actually really short but there is a lot

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.370 
actually really short but there is a lot
of<00:01:11.850> different<00:01:12.240> inputs<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.840> short<00:01:13.140> amount

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
of different inputs and a short amount

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.240 
of different inputs and a short amount
of<00:01:13.500> time<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.690> let's<00:01:15.690> begin<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.020> combo<00:01:16.410> first

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
of time so let's begin this combo first

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.500 
of time so let's begin this combo first
thing<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.490> want<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.760> is<00:01:17.940> come<00:01:18.150> fairly

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
thing you want to do is come fairly

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.950 
thing you want to do is come fairly
close<00:01:18.690> to<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.260> dummy<00:01:20.000> don't<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.390> right<00:01:21.660> up<00:01:21.840> to

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
close to the dummy don't be right up to

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.630 
close to the dummy don't be right up to
them<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.440> you<00:01:22.530> know<00:01:22.560> sweeping<00:01:23.280> distance

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
them but just you know sweeping distance

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.400 
them but just you know sweeping distance
and<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.450> you'll<00:01:24.630> begin<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:25.080> quarter

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
and then you'll begin with quarter

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.580 
and then you'll begin with quarter
circle<00:01:25.770> back<00:01:25.980> a<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.960> this<00:01:27.960> will<00:01:28.140> launch<00:01:28.350> them

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
circle back a and this will launch them

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.920 
circle back a and this will launch them
up<00:01:28.650> there<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.100> then<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:30.120> wanna<00:01:30.300> as<00:01:30.630> soon<00:01:30.840> as

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
up there and then you wanna as soon as

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.030 
up there and then you wanna as soon as
possible<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.370> quarter<00:01:32.729> circle<00:01:32.880> forward<00:01:33.330> a

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
possible do a quarter circle forward a

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.100 
possible do a quarter circle forward a
because<00:01:35.120> if<00:01:36.120> you<00:01:36.270> do<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.420> little<00:01:36.660> too<00:01:36.780> slowly

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
because if you do a little too slowly

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.650 
because if you do a little too slowly
you<00:01:37.290> need<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:38.310> javelin<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.060> your<00:01:39.210> super

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
you need this the javelin of your super

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.480 
you need this the javelin of your super
to<00:01:39.930> connect<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.800> dummy<00:01:41.010> is<00:01:41.160> too<00:01:41.310> low

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
to connect and if the dummy is too low

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.450 
to connect and if the dummy is too low
to<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> ground<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:42.180> will<00:01:42.270> completely<00:01:43.110> whiff

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
to the ground it will completely whiff

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.580 
to the ground it will completely whiff
now<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:45.000> core<00:01:45.420> circle<00:01:45.720> forward<00:01:45.900> a<00:01:46.170> does

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
now the core circle forward a does

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.770 
now the core circle forward a does
multiple<00:01:47.070> amount<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.340> hits<00:01:47.520> well<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.570> want<00:01:48.750> to

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
multiple amount of hits well we want to

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.080 
multiple amount of hits well we want to
cancel<00:01:49.080> it<00:01:49.410> immediately<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.550> very<00:01:50.790> first

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
cancel it immediately on the very first

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.310 
cancel it immediately on the very first
hit<00:01:51.270> because<00:01:51.660> if<00:01:52.410> you<00:01:52.619> let<00:01:52.800> it<00:01:52.950> drag<00:01:53.240> then<00:01:54.320> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
hit because if you let it drag then the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.810 
hit because if you let it drag then the
dummy<00:01:55.560> will<00:01:55.770> slowly<00:01:56.040> get<00:01:56.340> lower<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
dummy will slowly get lower to the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.170 
dummy will slowly get lower to the
ground

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
ground

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.490 
ground
so<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.510> want<00:01:57.690> to<00:01:57.750> counsel<00:01:58.080> as<00:01:58.170> fast<00:01:58.380> as

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
so you want to counsel as fast as

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.650 
so you want to counsel as fast as
possible<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.950> keep<00:01:59.070> them<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.369> so<00:02:00.360> right<00:02:00.510> after

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660

the core circle forward a hits you want

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.419 
the core circle forward a hits you want

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
superin and then the javelin should

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
launch them up if you find that the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
missing too many times that just means

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.450 
missing too many times that just means
that<00:02:17.610> you're<00:02:17.790> you're<00:02:18.270> doing<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> super<00:02:18.870> or<00:02:19.380> I

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
that you're you're doing the super or I

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.770 
that you're you're doing the super or I
mean<00:02:20.460> you're<00:02:20.670> juggling<00:02:20.970> them<00:02:21.240> too<00:02:21.420> low<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.630> the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
mean you're juggling them too low to the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.000 
mean you're juggling them too low to the
ground<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.320> definitely<00:02:22.710> want<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.860> your

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
ground so you definitely want to your

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.550 
ground so you definitely want to your
core<00:02:23.280> circle<00:02:23.640> forward<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:24.120> sooner<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.110> cancel

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
core circle forward a sooner and cancel

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.360 
core circle forward a sooner and cancel
it<00:02:25.590> as<00:02:25.740> faster<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.810> um<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.890> first<00:02:29.100> kind<00:02:29.310> of

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
it as faster so um the first kind of

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.880 
it as faster so um the first kind of
tricky<00:02:29.730> timing<00:02:30.090> part<00:02:30.300> here<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.990> you'll

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
tricky timing part here is that you'll

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.740 
tricky timing part here is that you'll
notice<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.430> guess<00:02:32.640> when<00:02:33.120> she's<00:02:33.300> in<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
notice that I guess when she's in the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.720 
notice that I guess when she's in the
super<00:02:34.050> animation<00:02:34.560> here<00:02:34.740> she<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.069> actually<00:02:35.580> off

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
super animation here she is actually off

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.190 
super animation here she is actually off
the<00:02:35.760> ground<00:02:36.210> right<00:02:36.450> now<00:02:36.480> she's<00:02:36.840> slightly

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
the ground right now she's slightly

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.590 
the ground right now she's slightly
pulling<00:02:37.590> up<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.890> ground<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.430> our<00:02:39.090> next<00:02:39.300> move

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
pulling up the ground and our next move

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.040 
pulling up the ground and our next move
is<00:02:39.930> um<00:02:40.340> her<00:02:41.340> float<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.030> she<00:02:42.360> needs<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.690> be<00:02:42.780> on

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
is um her float and she needs to be on

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.890 
is um her float and she needs to be on
the<00:02:43.350> ground<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.680> do<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:45.090> you're<00:02:45.690> gonna<00:02:45.810> have

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
the ground to do it so you're gonna have

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.430 
the ground to do it so you're gonna have
to<00:02:46.140> delay<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.680> just<00:02:46.890> slightly<00:02:47.960> so<00:02:48.960> radius<00:02:49.319> she

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
to delay it just slightly so radius she

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.540 
to delay it just slightly so radius she
touches<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:49.740> ground<00:02:49.950> you'll<00:02:50.130> get<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.280> feel<00:02:50.520> for

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
touches the ground you'll get a feel for

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.720 
touches the ground you'll get a feel for
it<00:02:50.819> you<00:02:51.060> press<00:02:51.300> down<00:02:51.600> down<00:02:51.900> B<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.640> then<00:02:53.640> I'll

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
it you press down down B and then I'll

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.240 
it you press down down B and then I'll
make<00:02:53.850> her<00:02:53.970> hover<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:54.510> then<00:02:55.050> another<00:02:55.470> awkward

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
make her hover and then another awkward

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.370 
make her hover and then another awkward
timing<00:02:56.490> is<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.880> as<00:02:57.450> soon<00:02:57.569> as<00:02:57.690> she<00:02:57.780> hovers<00:02:58.170> up

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
timing is that as soon as she hovers up

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.320 
timing is that as soon as she hovers up
you<00:02:59.220> can<00:02:59.459> immediately<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.300> don't

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
you can immediately you don't

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.670 
you can immediately you don't
immediately<00:03:00.690> recover<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.470> can't

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
immediately recover you can't

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.260 
immediately recover you can't
immediately<00:03:01.980> do<00:03:02.340> whatever<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.730> tacking<00:03:03.120> one

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
immediately do whatever I tacking one

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.870 
immediately do whatever I tacking one
there's<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.510> slight<00:03:03.930> delay<00:03:04.170> but<00:03:04.610> it<00:03:05.610> doesn't

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
there's a slight delay but it doesn't

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.400 
there's a slight delay but it doesn't
really<00:03:05.970> matter<00:03:06.270> though<00:03:06.420> because<00:03:06.630> we<00:03:07.230> don't

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
really matter though because we don't

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.560 
really matter though because we don't
want<00:03:07.530> our<00:03:07.770> next<00:03:08.400> attack<00:03:08.640> we<00:03:08.880> do<00:03:09.120> is<00:03:09.240> it<00:03:09.390> is

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
want our next attack we do is it is

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.130 
want our next attack we do is it is
pressing<00:03:10.440> a

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
pressing a

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.390

and when you do your jumping a if you

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.390 
and when you do your jumping a if you
press<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:15.760> too<00:03:15.910> soon<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:16.570> dummy<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:16.930> gonna<00:03:17.080> be

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
press it too soon the dummy is gonna be

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.310 
press it too soon the dummy is gonna be
too<00:03:18.400> low<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.390> we<00:03:19.570> want<00:03:19.810> them<00:03:19.960> to<00:03:19.990> be

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
too low to you and we want them to be

too low to you and we want them to be
pretty<00:03:21.160> much<00:03:21.280> of<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.940> same<00:03:22.240> height<00:03:22.450> as<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:23.220> so

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
pretty much of the same height as you so

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.880 
pretty much of the same height as you so
you<00:03:25.210> want<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.480> just<00:03:25.690> give<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.320> slight<00:03:26.680> delay

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
you want to just give a slight delay

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.950 
you want to just give a slight delay
before<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.400> press<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:27.790> button<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.900> you

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
before you press the a button so you

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.160 
before you press the a button so you
press<00:03:29.140> a<00:03:29.610> her<00:03:30.610> a<00:03:30.820> does<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.330> multiple<00:03:31.840> hits<00:03:32.020> it

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
press a her a does a multiple hits it

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.420 
press a her a does a multiple hits it
doesn't<00:03:32.410> matter<00:03:32.560> if<00:03:32.650> it<00:03:32.740> doesn't<00:03:32.770> want<00:03:33.070> her<00:03:33.190> to

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
doesn't matter if it doesn't want her to

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.680 
doesn't matter if it doesn't want her to
that<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:33.970> don't<00:03:34.090> have<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.240> worry<00:03:34.390> about<00:03:34.510> that

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
that you don't have to worry about that

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.110 
that you don't have to worry about that
kind<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.900> stuff<00:03:35.080> so<00:03:35.320> you<00:03:35.740> notice<00:03:36.040> that<00:03:36.130> um<00:03:36.430> the

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
kind of stuff so you notice that um the

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.820 
kind of stuff so you notice that um the
dummy<00:03:37.450> is<00:03:37.600> actually<00:03:37.959> higher<00:03:38.230> than<00:03:38.470> me<00:03:38.620> the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
dummy is actually higher than me the

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.720 
dummy is actually higher than me the
higher<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.250> better

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
higher the better

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.170 
higher the better
so<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:40.750> delayed<00:03:41.080> this<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.290> lot<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:42.640> right<00:03:42.970> after

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
so I delayed this a lot so right after

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.550 
so I delayed this a lot so right after
that<00:03:43.300> it<00:03:43.480> connects<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:43.959> went<00:03:44.110> to<00:03:44.200> a<00:03:44.230> core

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
that it connects you went to a core

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.350 
that it connects you went to a core
circle<00:03:44.920> for<00:03:45.130> it<00:03:45.250> C<00:03:45.550> and<00:03:45.700> D<00:03:45.880> so<00:03:46.420> an<00:03:46.540> e^x<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:48.360> then

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
circle for it C and D so an e^x and then

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.940 
circle for it C and D so an e^x and then
during<00:03:49.630> this<00:03:49.810> animation<00:03:50.290> you<00:03:50.650> can<00:03:50.800> actually

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
during this animation you can actually

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.560 
during this animation you can actually
cancel<00:03:51.310> all<00:03:51.550> of<00:03:51.580> it<00:03:51.700> pretty<00:03:52.030> quickly<00:03:52.270> not

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
cancel all of it pretty quickly not

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.970 
cancel all of it pretty quickly not
right<00:03:52.810> away<00:03:53.050> but<00:03:53.230> just<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:53.500> little<00:03:53.709> bit<00:03:53.800> after

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
right away but just a little bit after

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.310 
right away but just a little bit after
and<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.489> want<00:03:54.640> to<00:03:54.700> press<00:03:54.850> a<00:03:54.910> core<00:03:55.840> circle<00:03:56.200> back

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
and you want to press a core circle back

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.310 
and you want to press a core circle back
into<00:03:56.620> D<00:03:56.830> so<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:58.270> moves<00:03:58.630> animation<00:03:59.050> is<00:03:59.140> still

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
into D so the moves animation is still

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.610 
into D so the moves animation is still
going<00:03:59.560> on

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
going on

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.370 
going on
so<00:04:02.620> another<00:04:03.280> tricky<00:04:03.700> part<00:04:03.940> here<00:04:04.120> is<00:04:04.360> um<00:04:04.720> right

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
so another tricky part here is um right

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.729 
so another tricky part here is um right
now<00:04:05.410> we<00:04:05.590> want<00:04:05.920> to<00:04:06.010> hover<00:04:06.690> so<00:04:07.690> it's<00:04:08.470> kind<00:04:08.709> of

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
now we want to hover so it's kind of

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.590 
now we want to hover so it's kind of
tough<00:04:09.010> with<00:04:09.160> all<00:04:09.310> this<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:09.730> know<00:04:10.330> on<00:04:10.480> the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
tough with all this you know on the

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.000 
tough with all this you know on the
screen<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:11.080> know<00:04:11.230> when<00:04:11.440> she's<00:04:11.590> hovering

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
screen to know when she's hovering

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.570 
screen to know when she's hovering
so<00:04:12.700> you<00:04:13.180> either<00:04:13.270> gonna<00:04:13.450> get<00:04:13.600> a<00:04:13.660> feel<00:04:13.959> for<00:04:13.989> it

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
so you either gonna get a feel for it

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.469 
so you either gonna get a feel for it
because<00:04:15.580> we<00:04:15.730> have<00:04:15.820> to<00:04:15.880> cancel<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.299> really

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
because we have to cancel it really

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.949 
because we have to cancel it really
quickly<00:04:16.870> or<00:04:17.290> just<00:04:18.070> um<00:04:18.269> look<00:04:19.269> on<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.570> screen

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
quickly or just um look on the screen

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.140 
quickly or just um look on the screen
here<00:04:20.530> where<00:04:21.040> it<00:04:21.130> says<00:04:21.160> hover<00:04:21.489> boost<00:04:21.790> and<00:04:22.030> then

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
here where it says hover boost and then

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.450 
here where it says hover boost and then
as<00:04:22.300> soon<00:04:22.510> as<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:23.530> letters<00:04:23.800> turn<00:04:23.979> black<00:04:24.220> you

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
as soon as the letters turn black you

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.790 
as soon as the letters turn black you
know<00:04:24.580> you<00:04:24.640> can<00:04:24.880> immediately<00:04:25.180> uh<00:04:25.800> start

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
know you can immediately uh start

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.860 
know you can immediately uh start
boosting<00:04:27.010> forward<00:04:27.550> so<00:04:28.150> what<00:04:28.450> we're<00:04:28.840> doing

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
boosting forward so what we're doing

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.780 
boosting forward so what we're doing
here<00:04:29.200> is<00:04:29.320> that<00:04:29.470> she<00:04:29.680> hovers<00:04:30.010> by<00:04:30.190> holding<00:04:30.460> up<00:04:30.610> so

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
here is that she hovers by holding up so

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.400 
here is that she hovers by holding up so
you're<00:04:30.910> holding<00:04:31.060> up<00:04:31.330> this<00:04:31.510> entire<00:04:31.780> time<00:04:32.080> and

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
you're holding up this entire time and

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.469 
you're holding up this entire time and
then<00:04:32.710> right<00:04:33.130> when<00:04:33.280> you<00:04:33.370> see<00:04:33.550> her<00:04:33.700> recover<00:04:34.090> and

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
then right when you see her recover and

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.520 
then right when you see her recover and
hover<00:04:35.340> right<00:04:36.340> here<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:37.840> move<00:04:37.990> is<00:04:38.110> done<00:04:38.290> and

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
hover right here the move is done and

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.140 
hover right here the move is done and
you're<00:04:38.620> good<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:38.860> go<00:04:38.890> and<00:04:39.250> then<00:04:39.640> you<00:04:39.729> just<00:04:39.940> hold

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
you're good to go and then you just hold

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.870 
you're good to go and then you just hold
forward<00:04:40.630> and<00:04:40.990> you'll<00:04:41.950> do<00:04:42.100> your<00:04:42.250> forward<00:04:42.550> boost

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
forward and you'll do your forward boost

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.490 
forward and you'll do your forward boost
here<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.750> don't<00:04:43.810> have<00:04:43.930> to<00:04:44.080> press<00:04:44.229> forward

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
here you don't have to press forward

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.469 
here you don't have to press forward
forward<00:04:44.800> you<00:04:44.950> can<00:04:45.130> if<00:04:45.250> you<00:04:45.340> want<00:04:45.520> but<00:04:45.669> just

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
forward you can if you want but just

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.380 
forward you can if you want but just
hold<00:04:46.630> forward<00:04:47.760> and<00:04:48.760> then<00:04:48.940> you<00:04:49.000> want<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.210> dash

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
hold forward and then you want to dash

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.680 
hold forward and then you want to dash
it<00:04:49.570> as<00:04:49.690> close<00:04:49.900> as<00:04:49.930> you<00:04:50.140> can<00:04:50.790> the<00:04:51.790> timing<00:04:52.450> is<00:04:52.540> not

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
it as close as you can the timing is not

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.690 
it as close as you can the timing is not
that<00:04:52.930> crazy<00:04:53.290> you<00:04:53.470> got<00:04:53.590> some<00:04:53.800> leniency<00:04:54.010> here<00:04:54.460> so

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
that crazy you got some leniency here so

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.690 
that crazy you got some leniency here so
get<00:04:55.450> get<00:04:55.810> pretty<00:04:56.050> close<00:04:56.370> and<00:04:57.370> you<00:04:57.490> want<00:04:57.640> to

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
get get pretty close and you want to

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.620 
get get pretty close and you want to
press<00:04:57.850> B<00:04:58.350> so<00:04:59.350> a<00:04:59.380> jumping<00:04:59.919> B<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:00.580> then<00:05:01.510> we're

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
press B so a jumping B and then we're

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.300 
press B so a jumping B and then we're
gonna<00:05:01.720> cancel<00:05:02.050> this<00:05:02.320> immediately<00:05:02.860> into<00:05:03.220> our

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
gonna cancel this immediately into our

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.719 
gonna cancel this immediately into our
escape<00:05:03.669> change<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.240> that's<00:05:05.050> pressing<00:05:05.380> B<00:05:06.370> and

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
escape change and that's pressing B and

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.469 
escape change and that's pressing B and
D<00:05:07.330> at<00:05:07.600> the<00:05:07.810> exact<00:05:08.050> same<00:05:08.229> time<00:05:08.500> and<00:05:09.450> then<00:05:10.450> you

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
D at the exact same time and then you

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.480 
D at the exact same time and then you
want<00:05:10.720> to<00:05:10.780> immediately<00:05:11.020> cancel<00:05:11.740> out<00:05:11.830> or<00:05:12.100> super

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
want to immediately cancel out or super

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.760 
want to immediately cancel out or super
core<00:05:12.850> circle<00:05:13.210> for<00:05:13.390> twice<00:05:13.950> using

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
core circle for twice using

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.110 
core circle for twice using
if<00:05:17.770> you<00:05:17.890> have<00:05:18.010> to<00:05:18.130> have<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:18.490> castle<00:05:18.850> pretty

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
if you have to have the castle pretty

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.060 
if you have to have the castle pretty
fast<00:05:19.390> so<00:05:21.720> the<00:05:22.720> reason<00:05:23.110> why<00:05:23.350> we<00:05:23.710> want<00:05:23.890> to<00:05:23.920> be

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
fast so the reason why we want to be

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.240 
fast so the reason why we want to be
close<00:05:24.430> when<00:05:25.090> we<00:05:25.120> land<00:05:25.480> that<00:05:25.690> B<00:05:25.960> is<00:05:26.250> because

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
close when we land that B is because

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.520 
close when we land that B is because
we're<00:05:27.370> gonna<00:05:27.490> OMB<00:05:27.910> the<00:05:28.090> super<00:05:28.720> and<00:05:28.930> you<00:05:29.050> own<00:05:29.260> B

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
we're gonna OMB the super and you own B

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.760 
we're gonna OMB the super and you own B
it<00:05:29.650> as<00:05:29.800> soon<00:05:30.100> as<00:05:30.250> the<00:05:30.340> super<00:05:30.640> hits<00:05:31.140> so<00:05:32.140> own<00:05:32.320> B<00:05:32.650> it

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
it as soon as the super hits so own B it

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.350 
it as soon as the super hits so own B it
and<00:05:32.890> you<00:05:33.070> should<00:05:33.340> be<00:05:33.370> close<00:05:33.700> enough<00:05:33.730> that<00:05:34.030> out

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
and you should be close enough that out

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.060 
and you should be close enough that out
it'll<00:05:34.630> make<00:05:34.780> contact<00:05:35.230> with<00:05:35.440> the<00:05:35.590> dummy<00:05:35.770> and

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
it'll make contact with the dummy and

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.910 
it'll make contact with the dummy and
bounce<00:05:36.610> them<00:05:36.850> up<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:39.240> then<00:05:40.470> yes<00:05:41.470> it<00:05:41.620> basically

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
circle forward up for a B so any

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.430 
circle forward up for a B so any
excursion<00:05:57.010> so<00:05:59.820> you<00:06:00.820> tiger<00:06:01.090> knee<00:06:01.360> it<00:06:01.480> and<00:06:01.660> then

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
excursion so you tiger knee it and then

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.520 
excursion so you tiger knee it and then
it<00:06:02.560> should<00:06:02.740> juggle<00:06:03.160> and<00:06:03.390> then<00:06:04.410> basically<00:06:05.410> at

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
it should juggle and then basically at

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.220 
it should juggle and then basically at
this<00:06:05.650> point<00:06:05.740> you<00:06:06.010> can<00:06:06.130> just<00:06:06.160> mash<00:06:06.520> back<00:06:06.880> -<00:06:07.230> just

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230 
this point you can just mash back - just

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.990 
this point you can just mash back - just
keep<00:06:08.410> going<00:06:08.680> back<00:06:08.860> back<00:06:09.010> fall<00:06:09.190> back<00:06:09.220> as<00:06:09.550> much

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
keep going back back fall back as much

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.210 
keep going back back fall back as much
as<00:06:10.060> you<00:06:10.180> can<00:06:10.420> and<00:06:10.630> then<00:06:10.780> that's<00:06:11.650> the<00:06:11.830> final

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
as you can and then that's the final

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.880 
as you can and then that's the final
move<00:06:12.370> which<00:06:12.550> is<00:06:12.670> the<00:06:12.790> back<00:06:12.940> -<00:06:13.150> and<00:06:13.570> uh<00:06:13.890> it'll

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
move which is the back - and uh it'll

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.590 
move which is the back - and uh it'll
actually<00:06:15.100> come<00:06:15.370> out<00:06:15.430> before<00:06:15.760> the<00:06:16.000> combo<00:06:16.300> ends

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
actually come out before the combo ends

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.290 
actually come out before the combo ends
so<00:06:16.780> it<00:06:17.050> clears<00:06:17.380> it<00:06:17.590> and<00:06:17.770> it<00:06:17.860> counts<00:06:18.150> which<00:06:19.150> is

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
so it clears it and it counts which is

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.500 
so it clears it and it counts which is
it's<00:06:19.420> not<00:06:19.570> pretty<00:06:19.900> funny<00:06:20.940> so<00:06:21.940> that's<00:06:22.120> it<00:06:22.300> guys
