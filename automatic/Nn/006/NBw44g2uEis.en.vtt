00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
hi EDX from LP bar here and welcome to

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.040 
hi EDX from LP bar here and welcome to
the<00:00:08.820> show<00:00:09.000> where<00:00:09.330> we<00:00:09.360> discuss<00:00:09.809> how<00:00:10.020> to

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
the show where we discuss how to

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.960 
the show where we discuss how to
translate<00:00:10.440> card<00:00:10.830> technology<00:00:10.980> from<00:00:11.550> real<00:00:11.760> life

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:11.970 
translate card technology from real life

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.199 
translate card technology from real life
into<00:00:12.300> Lego<00:00:12.740> this<00:00:13.740> time<00:00:14.010> we'll<00:00:14.549> take<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.760> look<00:00:15.000> at

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:15.209 
into Lego this time we'll take a look at

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.360 
into Lego this time we'll take a look at
the<00:00:15.330> multi<00:00:15.690> link<00:00:15.840> from<00:00:16.080> suspension<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:17.190> is

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:17.370 
the multi link from suspension this is

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.340 
the multi link from suspension this is
the<00:00:17.490> most<00:00:17.760> complex<00:00:18.300> suspension<00:00:18.870> type<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.200> can

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
the most complex suspension type we can

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.950 
the most complex suspension type we can
have<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:20.400> let's<00:00:20.610> see<00:00:20.850> why<00:00:21.300> we<00:00:21.480> would<00:00:21.570> want<00:00:21.810> to

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
have and let's see why we would want to

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.770 
have and let's see why we would want to
have<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.530> our<00:00:22.650> vehicle<00:00:23.210> the<00:00:24.210> point<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.690> the

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:24.780 
have it in our vehicle the point of the

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.690 
have it in our vehicle the point of the
suspension<00:00:25.320> obviously<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.070> not<00:00:26.370> to<00:00:26.550> add

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
suspension obviously is not to add

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.540 
suspension obviously is not to add
complexity<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.260> move<00:00:28.440> the<00:00:28.620> kingpin<00:00:29.070> pivot

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
complexity but to move the kingpin pivot

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
ball joints work inside the rim this is

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.720 
ball joints work inside the rim this is
the<00:00:41.519> way<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.699> go<00:00:42.230> to<00:00:43.230> understand<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.920> let

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the way to go to understand this let

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.899 
the way to go to understand this let
examine<00:00:45.359> the<00:00:45.480> geometry<00:00:46.109> first<00:00:46.550> here<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.699> see

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
examine the geometry first here we see

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.840 
examine the geometry first here we see
the<00:00:48.359> top<00:00:48.719> two<00:00:49.289> suspension<00:00:49.890> arms<00:00:50.190> they<00:00:50.670> have

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the top two suspension arms they have

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.090 
the top two suspension arms they have
two<00:00:51.120> pivot<00:00:51.539> points<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.679> suspension

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
two pivot points but the suspension

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.939 
two pivot points but the suspension
period<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.760> actually<00:00:54.300> where<00:00:55.109> the<00:00:55.140> imaginary

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
period is actually where the imaginary

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.389 
period is actually where the imaginary
extension<00:00:56.609> lines<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:57.059> both<00:00:57.359> arms<00:00:57.809> intersect

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
extension lines of both arms intersect

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.979 
extension lines of both arms intersect
so<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.699> little<00:00:59.940> more<00:01:00.149> than<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.569> stud

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
so it's a little more than a stud

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.880 
so it's a little more than a stud
further<00:01:01.350> away<00:01:01.739> than<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.280> would<00:01:02.399> otherwise<00:01:02.579> be

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
further away than it would otherwise be

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.530 
further away than it would otherwise be
notice<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:05.489> steering<00:01:05.729> arm<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.300> at<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
notice that the steering arm is at the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.050 
notice that the steering arm is at the
same<00:01:06.720> angle<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.590> bag<00:01:07.770> suspension<00:01:07.979> link<00:01:08.490> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
same angle the bag suspension link to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.539 
same angle the bag suspension link to
ensure<00:01:09.450> there<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:09.960> no<00:01:10.079> bumps<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.860> of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
ensure there is no bumps here and of

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.520 
ensure there is no bumps here and of
course<00:01:11.579> we<00:01:12.450> need<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.600> watch<00:01:12.899> the<00:01:13.229> obligatory

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
course we need to watch the obligatory

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.340 
course we need to watch the obligatory
video<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.640> see<00:01:14.850> how<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.299> behaves<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.930> motion

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.679 

the<00:01:19.350> same<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.770> true<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.219> the<00:01:20.520> lower<00:01:20.729> two<00:01:21.360> arms

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the same is true for the lower two arms

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.350 
the same is true for the lower two arms
I<00:01:21.899> do<00:01:22.590> think<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.610> gone<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.880> bit<00:01:24.000> overboard

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
I do think I have gone a bit overboard

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.319 
I do think I have gone a bit overboard
in<00:01:25.289> this<00:01:25.469> example<00:01:25.829> because<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.789> projected

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
in this example because the projected

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.429 
in this example because the projected
pivot<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.079> ground<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> bit<00:01:28.860> too<00:01:29.189> far<00:01:29.430> out

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
pivot on the ground is a bit too far out

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.349 
pivot on the ground is a bit too far out
when<00:01:31.439> watching<00:01:31.649> it<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.189> motion<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.329> see

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
when watching it in motion you can see

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.310 
when watching it in motion you can see
how<00:01:33.840> far<00:01:34.079> out<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.710> lower<00:01:34.890> pivot<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:36.320> when

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
how far out the lower pivot is when

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.830 
how far out the lower pivot is when
viewed<00:01:37.590> from<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.039> front<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:39.119> marked<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
viewed from the front I have marked the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.679 
viewed from the front I have marked the
virtual<00:01:40.560> pivot<00:01:41.250> points<00:01:41.640> with<00:01:42.030> red<00:01:42.270> dots<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
virtual pivot points with red dots and

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.289 
virtual pivot points with red dots and
you<00:01:43.289> can<00:01:43.469> see<00:01:43.680> how<00:01:44.009> far<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.030> imaginary

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
you can see how far out the imaginary

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.669 
you can see how far out the imaginary
kingpin<00:01:46.109> X<00:01:46.350> actually<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:48.170> when<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.320> put<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
kingpin X actually is when we put the

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.399 
kingpin X actually is when we put the
tire<00:01:49.920> back<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:51.179> can<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> pivot

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
tire back on you can see that the pivot

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.980 
tire back on you can see that the pivot
on<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.799> ground<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.609> the<00:01:53.789> outside<00:01:54.359> edge<00:01:54.659> of

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
on the ground is on the outside edge of

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.399 
on the ground is on the outside edge of
the<00:01:55.140> wheel<00:01:55.380> that's<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.460> bit<00:01:56.759> too<00:01:57.359> much<00:01:57.630> it

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
the wheel that's a bit too much it

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.349 
the wheel that's a bit too much it
should<00:01:58.710> be<00:01:58.859> ideally<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.609> center<00:02:00.000> which

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
should be ideally in the center which

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:02.239 
should be ideally in the center which
means<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.840> should<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.350> angled<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.070> lower

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249 
means I should have angled the lower

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:05.690 
means I should have angled the lower
arms<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.820> bit<00:02:03.030> more<00:02:03.710> in<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.950> side<00:02:05.189> view<00:02:05.490> here

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
arms a bit more in the side view here

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.690 
arms a bit more in the side view here
you<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.420> see<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.289> caster<00:02:07.740> angle<00:02:07.920> which<00:02:08.670> is

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
you can see the caster angle which is

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.969 
you can see the caster angle which is
quite<00:02:09.030> extreme<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.050> did<00:02:10.289> not<00:02:10.440> angle

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
quite extreme because I did not angle

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.550 
quite extreme because I did not angle
the<00:02:11.430> lower<00:02:11.580> suspension<00:02:11.700> arms<00:02:12.390> properly<00:02:12.840> you

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the lower suspension arms properly you

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.590 
the lower suspension arms properly you
can<00:02:13.769> fix<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.159> in<00:02:14.400> your<00:02:14.670> models

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
can fix that in your models

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.140 
can fix that in your models
and<00:02:15.690> since<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.650> suspension<00:02:17.190> also<00:02:17.490> has<00:02:17.850> two

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
and since the suspension also has two

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.000 
and since the suspension also has two
long<00:02:18.330> suspension<00:02:18.900> arms<00:02:19.200> on<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.470> bottom<00:02:19.830> and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
long suspension arms on the bottom and

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.300 
long suspension arms on the bottom and
two<00:02:20.700> short<00:02:21.030> ones<00:02:21.210> on<00:02:21.480> top<00:02:21.690> we<00:02:22.500> can<00:02:22.650> again<00:02:23.040> see

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
two short ones on top we can again see

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.940 
two short ones on top we can again see
how<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.850> wheel<00:02:24.120> stays<00:02:24.420> upright<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.260> keeps

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
how the wheel stays upright and keeps
