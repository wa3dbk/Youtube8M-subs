the opposite of a paper clip is so what

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.520 
the opposite of a paper clip is so what
we're<00:01:25.950> gonna<00:01:26.130> do<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.729> draw<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.869> paper<00:01:28.200> clip

we're gonna do is draw this paper clip
but<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.270> looks<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.630> its<00:01:30.990> flipped

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
but so that it looks like its flipped

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:42.410 
but so that it looks like its flipped
and<00:01:32.900> orange

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.980 

so<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:43.630> is<00:01:43.870> my<00:01:44.430> opposite<00:01:45.430> paper<00:01:46.000> clip<00:01:46.360> number

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
so that is my opposite paper clip number

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.700 
so that is my opposite paper clip number
three<00:01:47.530> aka<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.640> paper<00:01:49.030> clip<00:01:49.450> in<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:50.020> pocket

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
three aka the paper clip in the pocket

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.680 
three aka the paper clip in the pocket
scavenger<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:52.200> complete<00:01:53.200> I<00:01:53.850> think<00:01:57.150> okay<00:01:58.150> so

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
scavenger is complete I think okay so

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.410 
scavenger is complete I think okay so
this<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.380> what<00:01:59.590> remains<00:02:00.010> of<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.490> opposite

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
this is what remains of the opposite

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.000 
this is what remains of the opposite
paper<00:02:02.170> clip<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:04.470> there's<00:02:05.470> not<00:02:05.680> really<00:02:05.800> much
