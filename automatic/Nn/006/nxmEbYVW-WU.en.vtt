00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.620
 attention now begins the subject biology class of high school 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.290
 you will see up to the last moment 5 good studies 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.999
 He plays from the fox to my goal. 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.810
 there is still nothing 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.239
 each player 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.359
 finished the benfica back the hope is that the machine on the track 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.250
 the Germany 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.350
 feinstein 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.740
 biologically try to mark your 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.730
 neither me nor my mother 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.520
 the race breed no one wanted to say goodbye to revenue and expense grace 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.360
 pablo an agostina penguin is astonished to read some municipal chambers is the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.850
 people play will do more and better affirm than ever 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.820
 not yet dropped the clean slip is fooled next the idea is to increase their 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.170
 countries 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.300
 It's cool, and you're going 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.630
 Yeah 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.630
 today you will know some classic recipes 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.130
 will not learn how to do in some from the milk the idea that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.210
 we will pass to create chances of producing by a microorganism called 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.990
 who is to blame 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.130
 you will also learn a homemade bread recipe 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.380
 miguel macedo does not want to because of the action of other microorganisms. 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.870
 funds 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.900
 the flashlight 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.900
 now 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.110
 but it's not so 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.950
 so I deserved a little more 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.330
 because if it gets too hot it does not work 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.390
 now 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.200
 you'll have to earn a pot of natural yogurt 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.320
 It's great to mix milk that's already dead. 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.390
 the parts 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.520
 the farc yes the technopuc the promoter of the gaeco 5 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.759
 are open 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.999
 despite the world 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.999
 with them none 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:18.119
 I do not know if it will give a certain point of cocaine and now after mixing well 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.980
 you will leave and land in the bowl for at least six hours 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.219
 irreversible loss 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.759
 I see things to make short 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:30.780
 so you do not use it with a special taste and with the right consistency 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.849
 you need to pay attention to a very important detail 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.659
 the yogurt that mixes the milk it should be the natural type 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.549
 and must have within it all those responsible 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.399
 by the transformation of milk 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:43.619
 and root 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:45.289
 the subjects 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:50.249
 the games there is a variety of bacteria because they are microorganisms 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:54.799
 which we can not see with the naked eye when mixed yoghurt ready milk 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.929
 boiled bacteria begin to reproduce at least late 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:01.330
 they produce substances 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.249
 that turn the milk into a post 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.639
 even if you are already very well you will not be able to identify any of the 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.299
 bacteria that exist on the course 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.629
 because these organisms are microscopic can only be observed 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.769
 by edilson necroscopic 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.769
 so the name microorganisms 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.170
 like all living organisms, microorganisms also need 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.170
 foods for day terenos and carry out their activities 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:29.849
 growth 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.619
 the milk has the sugar that is known cat that sugar 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.619
 converted into fine agricultural sugar 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:42.339
 in their cells the bacteria the organic ones to obtain energy 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.129
 this process ends up forming also 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.129
 in another substance in a preface to the late 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.969
 contain an amount of lactic acid which were formed however that the mixture 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:55.899
 It gets more and more 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:59.779
 This acidity ends up altering the properties of the proteins contained in the 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:02.789
 months although forming groups like this 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.709
 the consistency 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.199
 it's solid 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:11.639
 as cobalt favor collaborates with scientific experience as 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.639
 missile experimental 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.419
 So what do you have? 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.349
 it's over sour 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:25.029
 this is the taste sour yogurt is related to the production of acid 

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.069
 lactic 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.639
 What other substances do you think have this taste similar to yogurt? 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.969
 he appeared with the vinegar 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:34.789
 I do not think he's orange 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.529
 basic things 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:41.520
 will it be that if we mix these acidic substances with milk 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.520
 We're going to get yogurt. 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.759
 bush 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.139
 We've been acting the canarinho do sertÃ£o 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:50.930
 until now 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.870
 in singapore she's out there 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.999
 it fit like you take 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:57.039
 bento bento 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.039
 to 1 with the secret agent 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.699
 no one here 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.620
 each type of art 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.410
 dudu is more or less the same teacher only that the lactic acid produced by 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.950
 bullets 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.159
 drs 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:15.730
 altered milk proteins 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.510
 since that consistency that you had a taste on the death of beautiful 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:22.349
 now 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.320
 who follows the river like this 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.860
 no date selected miguel macedo defended 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.550
 you just see we should get the last contest in the industry 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:35.319
 the right consistency takes two plastic 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.939
 which is made by bacteria 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:42.069
 how bacteria are living beings there are some secrets the recipe give 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:42.710
 right 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.830
 one of the instructions is to expect boiled milk this is a little 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:49.460
 Why is this important? 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.460
 yesterday is little 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.159
 Let's think a little 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:00.250
 like all the recipes that the guti recommend that let the bed cool 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.960
 the netherlands 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.840
 and why then 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.969
 well let's think dumas are living beings 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:08.889
 very high temperatures destroys the right living cells 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:13.909
 if we mix the yoghurt bacteria already ready with the very hot milk they 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:15.039
 died 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.370
 this is certainly one of the reasons for not souza very hot milk in the recipe 

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:19.719
 of yogurt
