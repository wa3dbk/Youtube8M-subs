00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
training in the first place is the fact

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.640 
training in the first place is the fact
that<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.180> watched<00:03:36.510> my<00:03:36.750> father<00:03:36.930> kill<00:03:37.350> himself

herself while she's still alive

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.800 
herself while she's still alive
I<00:03:41.430> watched<00:03:42.300> her<00:03:42.570> harm<00:03:42.990> herself<00:03:44.810> with

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
with that and between the two of those

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.040 
with that and between the two of those
things<00:03:53.100> my<00:03:53.250> brother<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.640> I<00:03:53.700> had<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.880> choice<00:03:54.150> we

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
things my brother and I had a choice we

things my brother and I had a choice we
can<00:03:55.260> either<00:03:55.290> go<00:03:55.740> this<00:03:56.640> way<00:03:56.700> our<00:03:57.330> own<00:03:57.510> way<00:03:57.720> we<00:03:58.470> go

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
can either go this way our own way we go

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.270 
can either go this way our own way we go
that<00:03:58.890> way<00:03:59.100> you<00:03:59.390> know<00:04:00.390> so<00:04:01.230> that's<00:04:01.560> that's<00:04:02.010> what

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
that way you know so that's that's what

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.690 
that way you know so that's that's what
I'm<00:04:02.370> pretty<00:04:02.640> much<00:04:02.880> looking<00:04:03.420> at<00:04:03.570> is<00:04:04.250> that<00:04:05.250> we

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
I'm pretty much looking at is that we

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.280 
I'm pretty much looking at is that we
just<00:04:05.970> didn't<00:04:06.270> want<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.720> be<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.080> average

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
just didn't want to be the average

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.900 
just didn't want to be the average
people<00:04:07.800> that's<00:04:08.190> what<00:04:08.370> drives<00:04:08.640> me

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
people that's what drives me

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.940 
people that's what drives me
another<00:04:09.540> thing<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:09.810> drives<00:04:10.200> me<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.650> fact

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
another thing that drives me is the fact

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.550 
another thing that drives me is the fact
that<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.370> believe<00:04:11.850> that<00:04:12.540> I'm<00:04:12.870> instilling<00:04:13.410> a

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
that I believe that I'm instilling a

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.140 
that I believe that I'm instilling a
work<00:04:13.740> ethic<00:04:13.920> in<00:04:14.250> my<00:04:14.400> kids<00:04:14.670> I'm<00:04:14.820> able<00:04:15.090> to

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
work ethic in my kids I'm able to

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.120 
work ethic in my kids I'm able to
perform<00:04:15.480> do<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:15.660> have<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:15.870> look<00:04:16.049> like<00:04:16.230> this<00:04:16.470> this

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
perform do I have to look like this this

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.650 
perform do I have to look like this this
actually<00:04:17.460> probably<00:04:17.580> hinders<00:04:18.000> my<00:04:18.120> performance

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
actually probably hinders my performance

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.450 
actually probably hinders my performance
a<00:04:18.750> little<00:04:18.840> but<00:04:19.410> my<00:04:19.530> brother<00:04:19.770> and<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:19.980> every

to<00:04:38.790> stay<00:04:39.180> active<00:04:39.330> it's<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:39.840> way<00:04:39.960> to<00:04:40.020> get<00:04:40.170> my<00:04:40.290> kids

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
to stay active it's a way to get my kids

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.470 
to stay active it's a way to get my kids
in<00:04:40.740> shape<00:04:40.920> keep<00:04:41.160> them<00:04:41.370> in<00:04:41.490> shape<00:04:41.520> because<00:04:42.300> it's

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
in shape keep them in shape because it's

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.740 
in shape keep them in shape because it's
been<00:04:42.660> shown<00:04:42.690> that<00:04:43.050> active<00:04:43.710> healthy<00:04:44.250> kids

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
been shown that active healthy kids

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.750 
been shown that active healthy kids
actually<00:04:45.750> score<00:04:46.050> better<00:04:46.260> on<00:04:46.470> academic<00:04:47.310> tests

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
actually score better on academic tests

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.490 
actually score better on academic tests
so<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.330> whole<00:04:48.479> dumb<00:04:48.720> jock<00:04:49.020> thing<00:04:49.350> is

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
so the whole dumb jock thing is

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.290 
so the whole dumb jock thing is
completely

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
completely

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.559 
completely
well<00:04:52.300> it's<00:04:53.169> a<00:04:53.319> it's<00:04:53.649> a<00:04:53.830> fallacy<00:04:54.119> so<00:04:55.119> my

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
well it's a it's a fallacy so my

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.729 
well it's a it's a fallacy so my
motivation<00:04:55.779> right<00:04:56.499> now<00:04:56.739> is<00:04:57.779> one<00:04:58.779> to<00:04:59.229> represent

00:04:59.729 --> 00:04:59.739
