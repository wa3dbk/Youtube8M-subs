there are 13 ribs in a steer first let's

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.019 
there are 13 ribs in a steer first let's
separate<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.070> hindquarter<00:00:29.670> from<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
separate the hindquarter from the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.759 
separate the hindquarter from the
four-quarter<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.080> always<00:00:31.260> happens

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
four-quarter and that always happens

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.880

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
between the 12th and 13th rib next we

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.860 
between the 12th and 13th rib next we
split<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.219> four<00:00:35.430> quarter<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.910> two<00:00:36.120> now<00:00:36.660> this
