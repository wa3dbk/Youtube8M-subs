for the past few years we started asking
ourselves<00:00:09.000> what's<00:00:09.929> important<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.590> TV<00:00:11.010> is

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
ourselves what's important in a TV is

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.339 
ourselves what's important in a TV is
the<00:00:11.730> block<00:00:11.910> levels<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.719> how<00:00:12.809> thin<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.230> is

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
the block levels is it how thin it is

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.250 
the block levels is it how thin it is
color<00:00:14.040> accuracy<00:00:14.389> media<00:00:15.389> streaming<00:00:15.750> maybe<00:00:16.020> or

color accuracy media streaming maybe or
apps<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.890> mean<00:00:17.430> what<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.970> people<00:00:18.150> look

apps I mean what is it the people look

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.420 
apps I mean what is it the people look
for<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:19.020> new<00:00:19.170> flat<00:00:19.439> panel<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.220> more

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
for in a new flat panel and more

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.950 
for in a new flat panel and more
importantly<00:00:20.880> what<00:00:21.090> should<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.510> be<00:00:21.660> looking

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
importantly what should you be looking

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.320 
importantly what should you be looking
for<00:00:21.990> well<00:00:22.740> honestly<00:00:23.130> we<00:00:23.670> can't<00:00:23.880> answer<00:00:24.119> that

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
for well honestly we can't answer that

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.609 
for well honestly we can't answer that
question<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.779> mean<00:00:24.869> some<00:00:25.050> people<00:00:25.289> want<00:00:25.439> one

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
question I mean some people want one

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.160 
question I mean some people want one
thing<00:00:25.859> some<00:00:26.160> people<00:00:26.189> want<00:00:26.609> another<00:00:27.119> but<00:00:27.750> some

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
thing some people want another but some

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.410 
thing some people want another but some
people<00:00:28.859> well<00:00:29.340> some<00:00:29.369> people<00:00:29.670> want<00:00:29.939> at<00:00:30.029> all

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
people well some people want at all

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.240 
people well some people want at all
and<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.869> guess<00:00:31.050> that's<00:00:31.289> what<00:00:31.470> Samsung<00:00:31.740> had<00:00:32.099> in

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
and I guess that's what Samsung had in

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.610 
and I guess that's what Samsung had in
mind<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.700> its<00:00:32.850> new<00:00:33.000> D<00:00:33.270> 8000<00:00:33.930> series<00:00:34.079> plasma

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
mind with its new D 8000 series plasma

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.610 
mind with its new D 8000 series plasma
TVs<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.309> really<00:00:35.850> does<00:00:36.090> seem<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.500> all

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
TVs it really does seem to have it all

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.220 
TVs it really does seem to have it all
the<00:00:38.399> TV<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.879> first<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.329> foremost<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.809> plasma

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
the TV is first and foremost the plasma

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.900 
the TV is first and foremost the plasma
so<00:00:40.379> it's<00:00:40.530> got<00:00:40.710> two<00:00:40.890> excellent<00:00:41.340> black<00:00:41.460> levels

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
so it's got two excellent black levels

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.850 
so it's got two excellent black levels
but<00:00:42.390> samsung<00:00:42.870> also<00:00:43.020> figured<00:00:43.469> out<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> way<00:00:43.829> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
but samsung also figured out a way to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.340 
but samsung also figured out a way to
make<00:00:44.070> an<00:00:44.190> incredibly<00:00:44.789> thin<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.690> TV<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.230> an

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
make an incredibly thin the TV is an

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.840 
make an incredibly thin the TV is an
inch<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> half<00:00:46.770> at<00:00:47.129> its<00:00:47.280> thickest<00:00:47.640> point

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
inch and a half at its thickest point

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.819 
inch and a half at its thickest point
but<00:00:48.149> most<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> TVs<00:00:49.020> right<00:00:49.230> around<00:00:49.500> just

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
but most of the TVs right around just

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.889 
but most of the TVs right around just
one<00:00:50.039> inch<00:00:50.430> now<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> plasma<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
one inch now for a plasma this is

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.569 
one inch now for a plasma this is
incredibly<00:00:52.320> impressive<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:53.219> kind<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.430> like

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
incredibly impressive it's kind of like

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.830 
incredibly impressive it's kind of like
a<00:00:53.640> supermodel

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
a supermodel

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.110 
a supermodel
we<00:00:55.199> had<00:00:55.410> first<00:00:55.710> seen<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.070> TV<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> 2011

hands on it it's a real work of art the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.950 
hands on it it's a real work of art the
outer<00:01:02.250> bezel<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.879> glass<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.480> an<00:01:03.570> inner<00:01:03.690> black

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
outer bezel is glass with an inner black

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.289 
outer bezel is glass with an inner black
brushed<00:01:04.409> aluminum<00:01:04.920> frame<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.970> great

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
brushed aluminum frame and it's a great

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.000 
brushed aluminum frame and it's a great
look<00:01:06.630> made<00:01:06.900> even<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:07.200> impressive<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
look made even more impressive with the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.800 
look made even more impressive with the
touch<00:01:08.250> capacitance<00:01:08.909> controls<00:01:09.299> located<00:01:09.720> in

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
touch capacitance controls located in

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.899 
touch capacitance controls located in
the<00:01:09.869> lower<00:01:10.020> left<00:01:10.320> corner<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> glass<00:01:11.549> frame

the lower left corner of the glass frame

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.789 
the lower left corner of the glass frame
but<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> think<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.960> inside<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.650> makes

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
but I think it's the inside that makes

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.429 
but I think it's the inside that makes
the<00:01:13.950> D<00:01:14.070> 8000<00:01:14.640> series<00:01:14.760> plasmas<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.810> impressive

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the D 8000 series plasmas so impressive

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.320 
the D 8000 series plasmas so impressive
and<00:01:16.560> there<00:01:17.100> are<00:01:17.220> two<00:01:17.400> aspects<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:17.970> first

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
and there are two aspects of this first

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.700 
and there are two aspects of this first
of<00:01:18.509> which<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.869> picture<00:01:19.110> quality<00:01:19.500> which<00:01:19.680> is

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
of which is the picture quality which is

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.740 
of which is the picture quality which is
well<00:01:20.369> for<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> lack<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.240> better<00:01:21.270> term

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
well for a lack of a better term

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.550 
well for a lack of a better term
flawless<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.159> blacks<00:01:23.430> are<00:01:23.700> well<00:01:24.600> black
