 Hello everyone, we are going to evaluate KastKing compound nylon fishing line today. 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.360
 Fishing friends who often use monofilament nylon or fluorocarbon wire may not be familiar with this new product. 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.060
 Composite nylon thread is made up of fluorocarbon thread and monofilament nylon thread 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.860
 This allows it to combine the fine features of the two lines 

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:33.098
 Composite nylon wire is far stronger than monofilament nylon wire 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.140
 Its price is more intimate than the fluorocarbon line 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.060
 Other unique features of composite nylon threads include 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.520
 Far superior to monofilament nylon thread for strength and wear resistance 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.420
 Lower ductility allows it to hold the hooks more firmly, avoiding broken lines at the wiring 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.540
 KastKing composite nylon thread is available in three colors: green, transparent, and brown 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.880
 Here I want to share my savings experience with Kastking composite nylon thread with my fishing friends. 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.240
 I will tie the composite nylon thread to the front of the braided wire when fishing with ordinary braided wire. 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:20.020
 I feel that this combination is much better than the ordinary fluorocarbon line on the market. It is not as hard as ordinary fluorocarbon lines. 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.100
 It is knotted and shaped very firmly 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.480
 The combination of composite nylon thread and ordinary knitting line is excellent on all kinds of fishing vessels. 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.220
 I highly recommend this KastKing composite nylon thread. 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.900
 Three colors, each with a pull selection from 1.8kg to 13.61kg 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.634
 Thank you all, next time video see you :) 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:48.240
 Actual performance 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.920
 Waist long fish! 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.780
 I wish you all a big fish every day! 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.420
