 cousin installed and updated 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.200
 remembering that to steal and steal a 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.240
 device must have 128 ram 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.620
 the organ, the cousin 2.0 does not run in this 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:15.370
 as well as in gps one fs 7 83 of 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.780
 cv and also comes with 128 ram 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:24.690

 wheel only fulfilling a point 2 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:36.310
