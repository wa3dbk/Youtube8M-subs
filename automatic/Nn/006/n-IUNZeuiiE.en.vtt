00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:13.690
 Czech Republic 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.429
 however, a solar eclipse can only 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.470
 in some parts of the globe 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.439
 in order to understand how is happening 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.449
 solar eclipse we have to think about 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.140
 what is shadow 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.580
 the sun illuminates the earth its eve 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.849
 biomed samples skates side is located 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.560
 Islamic Republic Khakassia Astana 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.780
 solar eclipse occurs at home 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.900
 apparently tuned Balkan to the ground 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.330
 we have it much less land 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.420
 as well as cancellation is significantly less 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.670
 tracks its shadow can cover the whole 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.670
 the revenue is a small part of the surface 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.940
 the recipe the same happens during 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.900
 solar eclipse it is written 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.470
 is in new moon passes between the earth 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.830
 and I cover you with the sun more 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.400
 small part of the earth's surface 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.030
 come not only those people who 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.790
 are directly 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.300
 totally not creating on one goal 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.460
 called full shadow sees completely 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.670
 change this step the same who is near 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.090
 the borders of Russia called receiving by 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.350
 the idea itself is a partial eclipse one major 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.880
 terrorist attack will not see the bill at all 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.800
 and solar eclipses occur on earth 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.300
 about once every six months 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.750
 more interesting confluence 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.430
 the circumstances of the 400 clone restoration are less 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.650
 little sun at the same time it is 400 times 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.200
 more land than the sun the theater puts 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.660
 that the sun and the moon she seems to me alone 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.940
 sizes sizes good at a distance 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.310
 arm outstretched 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.060
 the rest of the season she was before the transfer 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.780
 he would never be fully seen 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.380
 naturally since she was not 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.439
 would be so rich to close everything 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.759
 impostors if she were closer i don't 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.640
 received a day two to more than 09m bedspreads 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.829
 would be more than the surface of the earth and not so long ago 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.909
 didn't see the sun's crown during 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.580
 total eclipse 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.080
 target since solar eclipse 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.360
 visible only in most of the world 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.780
 note in a separate region can pass 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.620
 hundreds of years bye settings 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.330
 confirmed and plan your 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.920
 trips factories to swim away in the right 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.820
 place at the right time and seeing such 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.650
 rare occurrence i am one of the parties specially 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.800
 for the podcast save astronomers not bound 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.450
 tables from the science center 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.870
 are common
