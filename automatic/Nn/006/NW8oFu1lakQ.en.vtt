guitar<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:48.090> idea<00:01:48.539> I<00:01:48.659> had<00:01:48.929> was<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.380> put

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
guitar so the idea I had was to put

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.950 
guitar so the idea I had was to put
three<00:01:50.130> e<00:01:50.460> strings<00:01:53.090> on<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> guitar<00:01:54.210> neck<00:01:54.539> just

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
three e strings on a guitar neck just

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.630 
three e strings on a guitar neck just
three<00:01:55.200> strings<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> reason<00:01:56.220> I<00:01:56.310> did<00:01:56.520> this

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
three strings and the reason I did this

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.480 
three strings and the reason I did this
is<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.420> makes<00:01:57.689> our<00:01:57.899> page<00:01:58.170> really<00:01:58.770> easy<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.369> play

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
is it makes our page really easy to play

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.880 
is it makes our page really easy to play
and<00:01:59.819> to<00:02:00.479> me<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.750> whole<00:02:00.960> secret<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.619> playing

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
and to me the whole secret of playing

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.050 
and to me the whole secret of playing
fast<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.060> make<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.450> easy<00:02:03.720> so<00:02:04.610> for<00:02:05.610> example

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
fast is to make it easy so for example

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.380 
fast is to make it easy so for example
with<00:02:06.810> those<00:02:06.990> three<00:02:07.289> e<00:02:07.319> strings<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:09.269> do<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
with those three e strings I can do a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.970 
with those three e strings I can do a
real<00:02:09.660> simple<00:02:09.899> pull<00:02:10.259> off<00:02:11.780> just<00:02:12.780> an<00:02:13.319> E<00:02:13.530> minor<00:02:13.650> or

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980

major<00:02:14.310> triad<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.709> then<00:02:16.709> do<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:16.980> on<00:02:17.130> each

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
major triad and then do that on each

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.830 
major triad and then do that on each
string<00:02:17.580> same<00:02:17.940> frets<00:02:18.299> so<00:02:20.630> suddenly<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.720> have
