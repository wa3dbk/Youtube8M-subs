bunch of tissue in it that's keeping it

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.339 
bunch of tissue in it that's keeping it
at<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> slam<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.330> know<00:00:27.449> it's<00:00:27.599> at<00:00:27.750> an<00:00:27.930> angle

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
at a slam so you know it's at an angle

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.540 
at a slam so you know it's at an angle
instead<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.710> shooting<00:00:28.920> at<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> wall<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
instead of shooting at the wall and

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.939 
instead of shooting at the wall and
under<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:30.570> stacked<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.439> top<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
under that it's stacked on top of a

bunch of books and under that is two
cardboard<00:00:34.500> boxes<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.370> kind<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.610> weird

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
cardboard boxes so it's kind of weird

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.510 
cardboard boxes so it's kind of weird
but<00:00:36.030> surprisingly<00:00:36.600> working<00:00:37.050> pretty<00:00:37.530> well<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
but surprisingly working pretty well the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.889 
but surprisingly working pretty well the
problem<00:00:38.700> with<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> flip<00:00:39.149> camcorders<00:00:39.750> of

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
problem with the flip camcorders of

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.650 
problem with the flip camcorders of
course<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.379> does<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:41.070> macro<00:00:41.579> or<00:00:41.820> auto

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
course it does not have macro or auto

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.299 
course it does not have macro or auto
focus<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:43.410> not<00:00:43.500> going<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.680> focus<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:44.129> on

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
focus so it's not going to focus up on

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.160 
focus so it's not going to focus up on
close-up<00:00:44.760> things<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.660> I'm<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:45.840> going<00:00:45.989> to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.170 
close-up things so I'm just going to
keep<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> distance<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.120> said

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
