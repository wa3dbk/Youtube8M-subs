walkthrough<00:01:53.080> beforehand<00:01:53.860> as<00:01:54.040> this<00:01:54.520> may<00:01:54.729> just

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
walkthrough beforehand as this may just

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.760 
walkthrough beforehand as this may just
be<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.060> most<00:01:55.300> confusing<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:55.990> complex<00:01:56.560> game

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
be the most confusing and complex game

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.460 
be the most confusing and complex game
I've<00:01:56.979> ever<00:01:57.010> played<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.990> main<00:01:59.140> reason<00:01:59.410> for

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
I've ever played the main reason for

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.950 
I've ever played the main reason for
this<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.800> the<00:01:59.950> lack<00:02:00.100> of<00:02:00.130> a<00:02:00.310> heads-up<00:02:00.640> display

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
this is the lack of a heads-up display

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.030 
this is the lack of a heads-up display
obviously<00:02:01.960> they<00:02:02.110> did<00:02:02.320> this<00:02:02.410> to<00:02:02.590> immerse<00:02:02.890> the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
obviously they did this to immerse the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.800 
obviously they did this to immerse the
player<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.310> lot<00:02:03.550> more<00:02:03.700> in<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.880> game<00:02:04.090> but<00:02:04.690> it

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
player a lot more in the game but it

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.850

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
also means you're given very little
