forks<00:01:56.640> everything<00:01:57.640> is<00:01:57.790> cast<00:01:58.060> aluminum<00:01:58.240> on<00:01:58.660> it

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
forks everything is cast aluminum on it

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.109 
forks everything is cast aluminum on it
so<00:01:58.960> it's<00:01:59.140> lightweight<00:01:59.410> and<00:01:59.820> even<00:02:00.820> the

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
so it's lightweight and even the

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.280 
so it's lightweight and even the
handlebars<00:02:01.720> seriously<00:02:02.729> only<00:02:03.729> only<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.750> only

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
handlebars seriously only only the only

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.430 
handlebars seriously only only the only
the<00:02:05.380> fasteners<00:02:05.860> on<00:02:06.070> it<00:02:06.190> are<00:02:06.369> made<00:02:06.850> of<00:02:07.030> steel

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.400 

so<00:02:10.730> the<00:02:11.730> suspension<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:13.280> little<00:02:14.280> bit

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
so the suspension is a little bit

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.010 
so the suspension is a little bit
unrefined<00:02:16.410> on<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.860> but<00:02:17.270> but<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> very

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020

really easy to ride very easy to balance

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.840 
really easy to ride very easy to balance
at<00:02:23.910> low<00:02:24.090> speeds<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:25.470> got<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.740> lot<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.070> oomph<00:02:26.459> a

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
at low speeds it's got a lot of oomph a

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.710 
at low speeds it's got a lot of oomph a
lot<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.570> power<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.610> do<00:02:29.610> merging<00:02:30.240> in<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.510> city
