00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.429
 hello we are war cry and this is metal or 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.429
 view 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.460
 costs more 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.170
 We have put name for each disc 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.050
 why 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.180
 when looking for the titles of the 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.380
 records that we spent a lot in which 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.280
 it's the group's feeling 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.280
 what we want to transmit 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:46.300
 in this case the egypt cycle 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.720
 the permanent construction system what 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.070
 Well, he wants us to believe that after all 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.630
 the putting we see the single disk that 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.660
 we had done at the level of production 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.740
 level of even from chart search a 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.740
 name that came to hair 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.299
 for the cover of this latest album we have 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.170
 told with daniel alonso that comes 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:14.380
 working with us on the disks and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.340
 dvds and the truth is that many times it 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.930
 what we do with anyone is to give you an idea 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.729
 so that I work develop it I believe 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.710
 that most of the time that we 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.100
 face a little with your ideas and we 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.220
 brings a quite different approach 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.189
 we have used an introduction of a 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.250
 subject instruction to speak because to the 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:40.270
 time to work the recording topic 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.179
 we have to cut the text 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.399
 let's say sonorous base did not give 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.820
 greater packaging to the song but not 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.860
 we wanted to let that information that 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.009
 could relate the song will be 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.869
 empty we only ask for a 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.670
 spoken introduction introduction to the 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.079
 song or a thing that was part but 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.200
 in its intimacy, direct relationship with the 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.909
 song so that if someone did not know that 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.619
 was going to do the production will find out 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.170
 good to consider a grace like 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:13.569
 representative of the disc as you think 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:16.209
 modify because luckily we get a 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.680
 disk where that disk does not determine a 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.930
 just theme but luckily 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.579
 always they choose many issues both 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.920
 on our part of the idols 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.659
 because there are and are those who make and 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.150
 determines what are the issues 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:34.069
 have to import certain penalties makes a 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.959
 week that I made a solo for the 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.209
 operate it from each bank the second 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.879
 part the truth is that good and joaquin 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.609
 he had already counted on me for the first 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.889
 part of the opera called me I commented 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.120
 that what was starting to 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:51.170
 select people afraid to participate 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.170
 commenting on salt 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.280
 apart from being there 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.819
 maybe the last of the concerts that 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.939
 we have announced in Spain for this 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.819
 this immortal tour what happens that good 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.919
 that after this concert until 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.879
 come the concert of legends that is 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.730
 the other the next we have 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.170
 announced we have several plans 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.330
 and possibly some more concert in 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.680
 Spain and Latin America we do not have 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:30.220
 several negotiated dates negotiated in 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.500
 Latin America and before we leave 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.270
 a first time because this year this year 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.180
 we have the feeling that we will go 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.910
 minimum 2 2 3 times to Latin America and 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.260
 it will be a good time for them good 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.140
 We feel very happy since 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.140
 legends once again count on war cry 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.379
 we did not know how anecdote can be the 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.110
 fact that we are the only group that 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.110
 every year participating in 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:01.000
 them and very happy that they have us in 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.439
 account and that for them we are there with 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.519
 which as always as every year 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.980
 let's go with all the desire of the world 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.440
 give everything as each set 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.330
 well I think that everyone knows that 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.379
 As has gotten what the 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.810
 Recording a video clip as literal 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:20.620
 not what we are doing now because the 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.050
 concert mix things live has 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.879
 been a great experience 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.820
 work until we arrived in 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:30.010
 post-production is being mounted 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.950
 is very little very little we do not have 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.100
 a date still closed from when we are going to 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.020
 take that video clip we hope that this 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.870
 it is a suitable moment a moment 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.480
 interesting from manu cristian gÃ¡lvez that 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.220
 has been the person and the producer that 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.070
 has taken care of the grace to be 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.030
 videoclip has turned completely have 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.350
 counted 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.430
 I'm lucky enough to have 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.430
 actors like jesus olmedo 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.739
 nerea garmendia no and the truth is that 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:02.679
 we have varied a lot we are 

00:04:59.739 --> 00:05:06.839
 excited by the counter in asturias 

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:10.059
 It has been very intense with rain with cold 

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:12.159
 and I believe that the final result will be 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:14.259
 very much to thank especially for the 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:16.869
 40-year-old public, whether it's the first 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.189
 many and very important that they are 

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:19.809
 making goals next year 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:22.709
 because some prize 

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:22.709
 secondary
