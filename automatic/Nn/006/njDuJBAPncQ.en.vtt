what real hair looks like has been

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.619 
what real hair looks like has been
distorted<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:16.579> I'm<00:02:16.700> hoping<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.329> video

the thickness of your hair well there
are<00:02:33.590> two<00:02:33.769> factors<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.939> first<00:02:35.209> one<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.810> density

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
are two factors the first one is density

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.550 
are two factors the first one is density
the<00:02:37.280> actual<00:02:37.730> number<00:02:38.180> of<00:02:38.420> follicles<00:02:38.840> on<00:02:39.349> your

and here you can see this is not me but
this<00:02:44.060> is<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.239> volunteer<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:45.079> is<00:02:45.200> my<00:02:45.319> husband

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
this is a volunteer this is my husband

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.339 
this is a volunteer this is my husband
Kevin<00:02:45.889> he's<00:02:46.639> so<00:02:46.819> nicely<00:02:47.329> volunteered<00:02:47.810> for<00:02:48.200> me

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
Kevin he's so nicely volunteered for me

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.229 
Kevin he's so nicely volunteered for me
to<00:02:48.530> get<00:02:48.680> up<00:02:48.859> and<00:02:49.069> close<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.609> personal<00:02:50.090> with

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
to get up and close and personal with

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.720 
to get up and close and personal with
the<00:02:50.299> camera<00:02:50.750> on<00:02:50.810> his<00:02:51.079> head<00:02:51.379> and<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:52.280> chose<00:02:52.519> him

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
the camera on his head and I chose him

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.659 
the camera on his head and I chose him
because<00:02:53.269> it's<00:02:53.480> convenient<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.260> also<00:02:54.829> because

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:55.669 
because it's convenient and also because

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.119 
because it's convenient and also because
his<00:02:55.879> hair<00:02:56.150> is<00:02:56.180> usually<00:02:56.720> cut<00:02:56.959> really<00:02:57.200> short<00:02:57.290> so

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
his hair is usually cut really short so

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.979 
his hair is usually cut really short so
it's<00:02:58.340> easy<00:02:58.669> for<00:02:58.849> me<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.150> get<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.569> camera<00:02:59.900> in

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
it's easy for me to get the camera in

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.949 
it's easy for me to get the camera in
and<00:03:00.230> show<00:03:00.439> the<00:03:01.159> follicles<00:03:02.120> on<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.389> scalp

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
and show the follicles on the scalp

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.970 
and show the follicles on the scalp
I<00:03:04.419> think<00:03:05.419> we<00:03:05.540> often<00:03:05.720> forget<00:03:06.019> that<00:03:06.500> our<00:03:06.650> men

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
I think we often forget that our men

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.399 
I think we often forget that our men
practically<00:03:07.700> have<00:03:07.879> the<00:03:08.030> same<00:03:08.299> hair<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:09.169> we

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
practically have the same hair that we

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.589 
practically have the same hair that we
have<00:03:09.709> so<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.400> imagine<00:03:10.790> if<00:03:11.150> his<00:03:11.269> hair<00:03:11.480> were

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
have so I imagine if his hair were

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.409 
have so I imagine if his hair were
longer<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.470> would<00:03:12.620> probably<00:03:13.370> look<00:03:13.819> closer<00:03:14.150> to

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
longer it would probably look closer to

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.990 
longer it would probably look closer to
mine<00:03:14.569> probably<00:03:15.349> have<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.859> same<00:03:15.889> kinky<00:03:16.669> and

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
mine probably have the same kinky and

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.219 
mine probably have the same kinky and
curl<00:03:17.810> pattern<00:03:18.590> in<00:03:18.889> it<00:03:19.159> and<00:03:19.659> I'm<00:03:20.659> pretty<00:03:20.900> sure

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:21.229 
curl pattern in it and I'm pretty sure

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:22.869 
curl pattern in it and I'm pretty sure
he<00:03:21.379> has<00:03:21.560> about<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.949> same<00:03:22.190> amount<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.639> hair<00:03:22.849> on

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
he has about the same amount of hair on

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.479 
he has about the same amount of hair on
his<00:03:23.090> head<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.659> here<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:24.799> can<00:03:24.949> actually<00:03:25.129> see

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
his head and here you can actually see

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.869 
his head and here you can actually see

curlier<00:04:04.250> than<00:04:04.579> mine<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.540> it's<00:04:05.900> actually

curlier than mine and it's actually

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:08.679 
curlier than mine and it's actually
easily<00:04:06.560> detangled<00:04:07.459> but<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.150> interesting

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:08.689 
easily detangled but the interesting

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.589 
easily detangled but the interesting
thing<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:09.229> that<00:04:09.259> we<00:04:10.069> have<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.790> same<00:04:11.090> density

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
thing is that we have the same density

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.569 
thing is that we have the same density
of<00:04:11.689> hair<00:04:11.959> and<00:04:12.199> when<00:04:12.620> we<00:04:12.739> talk<00:04:12.949> about<00:04:12.979> our<00:04:13.280> hair

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.569 
of hair and when we talk about our hair
our<00:04:13.849> hair<00:04:14.449> is<00:04:14.599> like<00:04:14.900> loose<00:04:15.290> in<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.769> same<00:04:15.979> areas

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
our hair is like loose in the same areas

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.089 
our hair is like loose in the same areas
and<00:04:16.909> kinky<00:04:17.630> in<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:17.870> same<00:04:18.079> areas<00:04:18.500> it's<00:04:18.709> really

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
and kinky in the same areas it's really

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.170 
and kinky in the same areas it's really
cool<00:04:19.340> when

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
cool when

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.520 
cool when
you<00:04:20.389> can<00:04:20.570> compare<00:04:20.930> notes<00:04:21.169> with<00:04:21.320> your

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
you can compare notes with your

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.659 
you can compare notes with your
relatives<00:04:22.070> because<00:04:22.729> you<00:04:22.910> share<00:04:23.120> DNA<00:04:24.310> so<00:04:25.310> again

the<00:04:26.180> first<00:04:26.479> factor<00:04:27.020> of<00:04:27.169> hair<00:04:27.380> thickness<00:04:27.680> is

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
the first factor of hair thickness is

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.580 
the first factor of hair thickness is
the<00:04:28.370> actual<00:04:28.759> number<00:04:29.300> of<00:04:29.509> follicles<00:04:29.990> on<00:04:30.440> your

scalp and that's called density and you

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.909 
scalp and that's called density and you
can<00:04:33.770> range<00:04:34.009> from<00:04:34.190> high<00:04:34.940> density<00:04:35.630> average<00:04:36.590> to

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
can range from high density average to

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.279 
can range from high density average to
low<00:04:37.130> people<00:04:38.060> with<00:04:38.210> fewer<00:04:38.539> follicles<00:04:39.139> are

having thick density of hair now the

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.370 
having thick density of hair now the
other<00:04:46.880> factor<00:04:47.240> that<00:04:47.660> affects<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.289> appearance

other factor that affects the appearance
of<00:04:49.009> your<00:04:49.280> hair<00:04:49.580> is<00:04:49.759> its<00:04:50.500> texture<00:04:51.500> and<00:04:51.740> that's

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
image you see two strings well the top

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.140 
image you see two strings well the top
is<00:04:59.509> actually<00:04:59.990> a<00:05:00.320> strand<00:05:00.860> of<00:05:01.130> my<00:05:01.460> hair<00:05:01.490> and

is actually a strand of my hair and
below<00:05:02.780> it<00:05:02.960> is<00:05:03.110> a<00:05:03.169> string<00:05:03.770> of<00:05:03.979> thread<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:04.849> as

below it is a string of thread and as

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.749 
below it is a string of thread and as
you<00:05:05.870> can<00:05:05.990> see<00:05:06.050> my<00:05:06.440> hair<00:05:06.710> is<00:05:06.830> about<00:05:06.979> half<00:05:07.460> the

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 
you can see my hair is about half the

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.360 
you can see my hair is about half the
thickness<00:05:07.970> of<00:05:08.449> that<00:05:08.660> string<00:05:09.080> of<00:05:09.229> thread<00:05:09.560> so<00:05:09.800> my

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
thickness of that string of thread so my

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.260 
thickness of that string of thread so my
hair<00:05:10.639> can<00:05:10.880> be<00:05:10.910> classified<00:05:11.270> as<00:05:11.810> being<00:05:12.110> fine

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
hair can be classified as being fine

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.850 
hair can be classified as being fine
many<00:05:14.270> times<00:05:14.539> you'll<00:05:14.750> hear<00:05:14.900> someone<00:05:15.289> refer<00:05:15.440> to

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
many times you'll hear someone refer to

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.920 
many times you'll hear someone refer to
their<00:05:16.009> hair<00:05:16.220> as<00:05:16.370> being<00:05:16.610> cores<00:05:17.060> just<00:05:17.660> because

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
their hair as being cores just because

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.870 
their hair as being cores just because
it's<00:05:18.080> kinky<00:05:18.530> but<00:05:19.009> that's<00:05:19.160> usually<00:05:19.580> not<00:05:19.610> the

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
it's kinky but that's usually not the

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.839 
it's kinky but that's usually not the
case<00:05:20.090> it's<00:05:20.330> usually<00:05:20.570> very<00:05:21.349> fine<00:05:21.830> hair<00:05:22.250> that

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
case it's usually very fine hair that

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.149 
case it's usually very fine hair that
just<00:05:22.910> tangles<00:05:23.780> up<00:05:23.990> really<00:05:24.560> easily<00:05:24.949> because

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
just tangles up really easily because

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:29.260 
just tangles up really easily because
it's<00:05:25.550> very<00:05:25.880> tightly<00:05:26.240> coiled<00:05:26.690> and<00:05:27.020> curled<00:05:28.270> so

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
it's very tightly coiled and curled so

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.510 
it's very tightly coiled and curled so
in<00:05:29.419> conclusion<00:05:29.810> just<00:05:30.199> keep<00:05:30.800> this<00:05:31.039> in<00:05:31.280> mind

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
in conclusion just keep this in mind

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.180 
in conclusion just keep this in mind
