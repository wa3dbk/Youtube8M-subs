00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
been doping but he you know he still he

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.229 
been doping but he you know he still he
avoided<00:00:32.920> certain<00:00:33.130> subjects<00:00:33.670> I<00:00:33.790> mean<00:00:33.940> when

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
avoided certain subjects I mean when

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.150 
avoided certain subjects I mean when
when<00:00:34.540> his<00:00:34.809> first<00:00:35.110> admission<00:00:35.500> back<00:00:35.950> in<00:00:36.070> the

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
when his first admission back in the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.590 
when his first admission back in the
hospital<00:00:36.250> room<00:00:36.670> when<00:00:36.700> he<00:00:36.850> had<00:00:36.940> cancer<00:00:37.120> came<00:00:37.450> up

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
hospital room when he had cancer came up

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.690 
hospital room when he had cancer came up
he<00:00:37.720> basically<00:00:37.990> said<00:00:38.320> I'm<00:00:38.530> laying<00:00:39.250> down<00:00:39.310> on

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
he basically said I'm laying down on

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.220 
he basically said I'm laying down on
that<00:00:39.850> one<00:00:40.030> and<00:00:40.210> just<00:00:40.300> refused<00:00:40.720> to<00:00:40.810> answer<00:00:40.930> it

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
that one and just refused to answer it

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.200 
that one and just refused to answer it
and<00:00:41.410> so<00:00:41.620> I<00:00:41.890> think<00:00:42.160> people<00:00:42.580> are<00:00:42.640> looking<00:00:42.880> to<00:00:43.000> see

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
and so I think people are looking to see

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.520 
and so I think people are looking to see
what<00:00:43.390> he's<00:00:43.480> becoming<00:00:43.780> fully<00:00:44.050> clean<00:00:44.320> and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
what he's becoming fully clean and

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.460 
what he's becoming fully clean and
clearly<00:00:44.770> he<00:00:45.010> didn't<00:00:45.540> and<00:00:46.540> to<00:00:46.810> see<00:00:47.020> if<00:00:47.290> he

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
clearly he didn't and to see if he

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.290 
clearly he didn't and to see if he
started<00:00:47.950> making<00:00:48.100> specific<00:00:48.490> apologies<00:00:49.180> to

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
started making specific apologies to

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.360 
started making specific apologies to
people<00:00:49.600> who<00:00:49.720> he<00:00:49.870> tried<00:00:50.079> to<00:00:50.260> ruin<00:00:50.470> their<00:00:51.160> lives

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
people who he tried to ruin their lives

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.920 
people who he tried to ruin their lives
we<00:00:51.640> knew<00:00:51.850> they<00:00:52.000> were<00:00:52.090> telling<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.390> truth<00:00:52.450> and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
we knew they were telling the truth and

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.740 
we knew they were telling the truth and
in<00:00:53.079> large<00:00:53.290> part<00:00:53.590> he<00:00:54.220> didn't<00:00:54.550> so<00:00:54.760> I<00:00:54.790> think<00:00:54.910> know

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
in large part he didn't so I think know

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.300 
in large part he didn't so I think know
sort<00:00:55.930> of<00:00:55.960> gauging<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:56.320> Twittersphere<00:00:56.950> people

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
sort of gauging the Twittersphere people

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.010 
sort of gauging the Twittersphere people
were<00:00:57.399> following<00:00:57.579> it<00:00:57.910> did<00:00:58.390> not<00:00:58.540> go<00:00:58.780> well<00:00:58.810> for

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
were following it did not go well for

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.410 
were following it did not go well for
him<00:00:59.290> unanswered<00:01:00.220> questions<00:01:00.700> if<00:01:00.910> I<00:01:01.060> said<00:01:01.270> there

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
him unanswered questions if I said there

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.120 
him unanswered questions if I said there
are<00:01:01.480> two<00:01:01.510> of<00:01:01.840> them<00:01:01.960> what<00:01:02.500> would<00:01:02.649> be<00:01:02.800> the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
are two of them what would be the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.280 
are two of them what would be the
biggest<00:01:03.790> to<00:01:04.000> you<00:01:04.239> did<00:01:04.449> mention<00:01:04.629> some<00:01:05.079> things

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
biggest to you did mention some things

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.800 
biggest to you did mention some things
here<00:01:05.500> what<00:01:05.740> else<00:01:06.299> didn't<00:01:07.299> have<00:01:07.479> an<00:01:07.659> answer

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
here what else didn't have an answer

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.980 
here what else didn't have an answer
that<00:01:08.020> matched<00:01:08.920> up<00:01:09.240> well<00:01:10.240> first<00:01:10.509> of<00:01:10.630> all<00:01:10.749> he

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
that matched up well first of all he

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.739 
that matched up well first of all he
said<00:01:11.319> that<00:01:11.950> he<00:01:12.310> did<00:01:12.520> not<00:01:12.549> dope<00:01:13.210> after<00:01:13.600> his

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:13.749 
said that he did not dope after his

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:15.569 
said that he did not dope after his
comeback<00:01:14.170> which<00:01:14.799> is<00:01:14.920> important<00:01:15.399> for<00:01:15.460> a<00:01:15.549> number

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
comeback which is important for a number

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.069 
comeback which is important for a number
of<00:01:15.789> reasons<00:01:15.880> one<00:01:16.329> if<00:01:16.569> you<00:01:16.659> trying<00:01:16.929> to<00:01:16.990> do

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
of reasons one if you trying to do

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:18.690 
of reasons one if you trying to do
reduced<00:01:17.439> band<00:01:17.770> that<00:01:18.130> would<00:01:18.219> sort<00:01:18.399> of<00:01:18.490> change

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
reduced band that would sort of change

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.160 
reduced band that would sort of change
the<00:01:18.789> starting<00:01:19.210> line<00:01:19.329> ports<00:01:19.659> we<00:01:19.749> said<00:01:19.929> the<00:01:20.020> last

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
the starting line ports we said the last

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.980 
the starting line ports we said the last
time<00:01:20.319> you<00:01:20.469> dopest<00:01:20.770> 2005<00:01:21.429> and<00:01:21.759> his<00:01:22.689> blood

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
time you dopest 2005 and his blood

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.190 
time you dopest 2005 and his blood
profile<00:01:23.530> would<00:01:24.159> beg<00:01:24.369> to<00:01:24.399> differ<00:01:25.079> that<00:01:26.079> he

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
profile would beg to differ that he

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.109 
profile would beg to differ that he
doped<00:01:26.439> even<00:01:26.709> after<00:01:26.979> his<00:01:27.100> comeback<00:01:27.459> and<00:01:27.729> so<00:01:28.090> I

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
doped even after his comeback and so I

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.370 
doped even after his comeback and so I
think<00:01:28.270> there's<00:01:28.659> reason<00:01:28.959> to<00:01:28.990> believe<00:01:29.079> that

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
think there's reason to believe that

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.889 
think there's reason to believe that
he's<00:01:29.560> still<00:01:30.149> not<00:01:31.149> telling<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.509> full<00:01:31.659> truth

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
he's still not telling the full truth

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.410 
he's still not telling the full truth
and<00:01:32.139> he<00:01:32.200> sort<00:01:32.380> of<00:01:32.439> haven't<00:01:32.770> gotten<00:01:32.950> into<00:01:33.459> the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
and he sort of haven't gotten into the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.919 
and he sort of haven't gotten into the
issues<00:01:34.749> with<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:34.990> Cancer<00:01:35.319> Foundation<00:01:35.920> where

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
issues with the Cancer Foundation where

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.959 
issues with the Cancer Foundation where
you<00:01:37.929> know<00:01:38.049> they're<00:01:38.799> found<00:01:39.219> misconceptions

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
you know they're found misconceptions

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.269 
you know they're found misconceptions
about<00:01:40.179> what<00:01:40.959> the<00:01:41.200> foundation<00:01:41.709> did<00:01:41.920> in<00:01:42.100> terms

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:42.279 
about what the foundation did in terms

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:44.279 
about what the foundation did in terms
of<00:01:42.399> donated<00:01:42.789> cancer<00:01:43.090> research<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:43.659> and<00:01:43.929> I

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
of donated cancer research and and I

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:45.599 
of donated cancer research and and I
think<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.619> lot<00:01:44.799> of<00:01:44.829> people<00:01:44.920> are<00:01:45.159> curious<00:01:45.340> when

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
think a lot of people are curious when

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:47.519 
think a lot of people are curious when
he<00:01:45.759> decided<00:01:46.119> to<00:01:46.240> start<00:01:46.479> leveraging<00:01:46.869> cancer

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
soft and saw his detractors I guess

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.870

what's<00:02:27.790> next<00:02:27.880> for<00:02:28.210> Lance<00:02:28.390> Armstrong<00:02:29.850> well<00:02:30.850> I

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
what's next for Lance Armstrong well I

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.870 
what's next for Lance Armstrong well I
think<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:31.630> is<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:32.410> don't<00:02:33.160> think<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.640> is

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
think this is I don't think this is

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.400 
think this is I don't think this is
going<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.240> be<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.990> step<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.320> his

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
going to be the step in his

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.410 
going to be the step in his
rehabilitation<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:36.310> he<00:02:36.490> hoped<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.240> would<00:02:37.390> be

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
rehabilitation that he hoped it would be

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.490 
rehabilitation that he hoped it would be
publicly<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:38.980> think<00:02:39.100> he'll<00:02:40.050> he's<00:02:41.050> not<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.260> guy

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
publicly so I think he'll he's not a guy

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.800 
publicly so I think he'll he's not a guy
who<00:02:42.160> sits<00:02:42.370> back<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.640> lets<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.090> story<00:02:43.360> run<00:02:43.570> him

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
who sits back and lets the story run him

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.900 
who sits back and lets the story run him
he<00:02:43.990> wants<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.290> run<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.440> story<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.220> want

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
he wants to run the story and you want

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.580 
he wants to run the story and you want
to<00:02:46.030> be<00:02:46.120> in<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.270> spotlight<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.930> he<00:02:47.290> wants<00:02:47.530> to

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
to be in the spotlight and he wants to

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.410 
to be in the spotlight and he wants to
get<00:02:47.680> back<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:47.920> competing<00:02:48.040> if<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.060> want<00:02:49.210> to<00:02:49.300> get

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.520 
get back to competing if you want to get
back<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.630> competing<00:02:49.720> he's<00:02:50.170> going<00:02:50.320> to<00:02:50.380> have<00:02:50.500> to

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
back to competing he's going to have to

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.290 
back to competing he's going to have to
go<00:02:50.680> testify<00:02:50.980> under<00:02:51.220> oath<00:02:51.310> against<00:02:51.940> people<00:02:52.210> in

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
go testify under oath against people in

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.530

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
the highest level of organized cycling

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.200 
the highest level of organized cycling
and<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.720> think<00:02:55.900> he<00:02:56.140> can<00:02:56.320> he<00:02:57.060> decided<00:02:58.060> he

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.910 
and so I think he can he decided he
wants<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.630> do<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.110> he's<00:02:59.500> got<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.680> lot<00:02:59.890> of

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560

about<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.660> she<00:03:58.750> didn't<00:03:59.080> sort<00:03:59.200> of<00:03:59.260> seemed

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
about that and she didn't sort of seemed

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.790 
questions but I do think he was able to
sidestep<00:04:07.030> sort<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.780> at<00:04:07.989> his<00:04:08.380> will<00:04:08.590> when<00:04:08.739> you
