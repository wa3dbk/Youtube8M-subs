 hello if the space in Milan form will present the products of the canon ci 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.810
 they are very interesting things and very unusual also for how 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.550
 solution we pray together good morning to all in canon tr 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.670
 novelty of the photographic world 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.730
 the two new compact cameras. 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.490
 the powershot g12 of the new sx30 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.190
 g12 the heir of your laws 11 presents as the previous one a screen 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.530
 adjustable 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.150
 a 10 megapixel resolution with a hs system is also here 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.330
 here we see the latest news presented a few days ago ikea in the 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.530
 specific sx30 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.920
 powershot s95 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.890
 terranova ixus 1000 hs 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.420
 this tl 10 for the most compact optical zoom on the market today among the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.610
 the latest additions to this new p800 simple sublimation printer 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.540
 which today allows printing not only directly from the cards but also from 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.160
 for you 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.850
 normal qsb. com then here we present o 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.740
 the heroes camcorders toshiba next January particular this model case 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.420
 xf305 I will have a professional video camera that records on memory compact flash art 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.380
 the younger sister of the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.830
 the resolution was last June 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.040
 comment here dear launched new professional range 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.020
 the first the rite iple s with sensor not taken sidin but a distinction is made yes 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.730
 move 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.060
 listening we talk about a color sampling 4 2 2 ramps too 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.090
 2 therefore high quality guaranteed even during assembly 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.440
 It is an xf100 105e model which is mainly for connections 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.340
 brother cast present model 105 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.230
 they inherit everything I'm a developer we model xfs as well 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.440
 instead of 3 sensors moving, there will be a gnomic sensor known as mos 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.640
 medarot xf305 together with you center plateau + models interpretes of canon 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.180
 am between sensor moved - web 20 for 1080p full hd native what it does 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.329
 difference is 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.400
 and above all the modest optics is not that it has a 21 18 for but above all in optics 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.849
 20mm wide-angle lens 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.769
 all supported by memory cf and pure mpeg2 file was bought on 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.769
 re sampling 4 2 2 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.090
 models that also manage but in my opinion stabilizers so really the 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.590
 summary of all that I know if wolf of the caznone months earlier locks 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.919
 evolution thanks 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:39.089
 obviously sensor names show up 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:43.529
 new karogi consumer products we present the 32 tempering that if a 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.380
 model saw the current range expand p 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.480
 in particular we see the models with hc select them in this case we have a 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.080
 xena microphone 5 1 dolby surround that extends what is the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.050
 management inside the machine. they are characterized by 8 free optional non 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.149
 only microphones but also teleconverter wide angles 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:07.129
 among the lovers of the underwater world there is also the cessation that it is 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.089
 diving suit that goes up to 40 meters deep for those who wanted others 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:12.310
 retired underwater 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.800
 here we are today to present this new vintage at home and a 70 of eos 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.500
 60d a mid-range car somehow 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.650
 a mad public in the 1228 euro camera body with various solutions to this 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.610
 while ch'er dci 75 rather 18 centovent a 5 ho 18 555 always is the 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.650
 machine is characterized by having a body 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.470
 or the little one was 50 so read it on 744 grams a resolution 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.900
 with this monitor 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.889
 sorrento that the possibility of 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:50.449
 to be like saying also to completely tilt both axes 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:51.370
 therefore extreme 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.689
 fit also with the use of a tripod 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:59.040
 but surely so there are some very interesting numbers italy walls 18 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.439
 my and pixel on sensor moved atsc 5 had three shots per second 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.239
 madden of a senile accent ISO 4 spam idio 12008 so you can take photo in 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.369
 any light connection to the portal and then to print any entry 

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:19.169
 the novelty on this is or 60d and the extreme creativity appeal system in 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.789
 effects you have the option of actually choosing 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.919
 even a digital film system for the less experienced is called piobesi 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.839
 class this technology then choose solutions first 

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:30.729
 detail of this shot 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.589
 and above all in the post-production phase, therefore with taking pictures with 

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:35.430
 vos gold 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.289
 you can 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.120
 in some way to develop the users in this room 

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:41.779
 photos let's see 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:47.080
 a rapid acquittal we go into image processing erro 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.559
 let's get into the functionality inside 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:54.149
 and we have the possibility for example to go to slightly underexpose the 

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:58.499
 photo to give a little maybe more creativity and ciop yahoo sense of color 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:02.559
 we can go to modify or amplify present of the pictures style 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:06.679
 so somehow and with a solution axis even later go to 

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:12.559
 save it present either in a getpaint and even model s3 then 0 3 and make 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:15.020
 available therefore if the mind reduced 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.290
 last but not least, we need to activate creative filters 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.599
 or we can go h 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.300
 to handle single photo models 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.809
 and particular solutions let us try this miniature effect 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.400
 and we give you the car to go up 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.530
 to contrast more only one area always asks us to save second 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.960
 file and we see that we have given to the image 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.940
 unams completely different connotations are pro earth to give greater 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.840
 creativity in the end always for creativity I would like to mention the 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.590
 functionality of this flash art or the possibility of flash and to manage 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.009
 directly into 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:01.110
 we activate to manage other flashas high here it is to manage other delhi 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.530
 two flashchat groups 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.520
 personas placing below exposing therefore you will draw harnesses of strength 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.940
 so how to say a light compact camera large numbers by itself 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.240
 pd resolution speed 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.090
 it's one more step to be able to maybe spend time doing shots 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.630
 and then not having to work in post-production and so 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.820
 you will hear in front of our monitor approved land 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.250
 have an extension of your big eye of your hand 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:35.099
 last places from creativity well we could not say that this is me 60d 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:40.020
 all features ita dvd a full hd here mineo on tv 1080p iussum ubi 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.480
 the movements during all these 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.659
 video on a sd hc card rather than xc then 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:48.919
 with theoretically 2 terabytes of 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:50.499
 and availability 

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:55.279
 so not only photo but also of ovid in full hd with is with eos 

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.900
 movie 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.730
 resolution and take it is selectable 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.450
 for any information posted on his blog ciaoo
