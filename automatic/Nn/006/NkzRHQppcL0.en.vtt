00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.259
 Help me I am Said al-nahjan your project is back to Black Ops 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.039
 do not come from me 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.489
 I figured before it in the third prestige so you expect 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.550
 the glacier Ullrich 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.539
 and 4 it is too 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.730
 is a bit in Frederick Youngster's collaboration, it certainly is quite 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.819
 Interesting 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.950
 52 now just out 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.730
 the players rule 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.300
 with the exploration 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.920
 I saw that as well and set and see pumps 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.969
 picked one can already find said century I prefer then 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.969
 but it was exciting 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.000
 Moreover, some people like the map actually quite well I like them 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.780
 actually not so bad Bremen SID I actually know only what 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.140
 I do not like it that much 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.660
 but here 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.670
 If you ran a meter you saw Scott, you're dead 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.820
 b you too mild 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.070
 Strobl it is very cold he down again I'm right back Tuscan 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.710
 I already say that 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.590
 What I use while doing services 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.060
 No that's the samba the arc mouse image of the strategies is going to be soon 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.760
 and private rooms Cox as a partner country I still had that I still have 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.400
 while nimbleness pro 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.200
 Hardliner Brunner, of course, and maker Marathon, I still have 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.720
 not Robert StÃ¼tzle 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.590
 in the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.420
 standing next to Christ 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.479
 so and now it starts actually well in the doctors took importantly well 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.400
 to run 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.110
 but then I miss a bit 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.030
 but that does not matter 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.340
 sda now we are still watching b come in the window and while Iran 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.880
 Subotic 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.620
 Most of the time it is lately it is not so busy on ours 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.560
 channel 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.469
 simply for time school too long 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.999
 i had internship it was two weeks why has nothing 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.159
 It stood at 2 percent now 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.659
 Now I'll get to know what I'm doing now with Black Ops 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.319
 and I have prepared it very interesting now 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.509
 I only have ammunition, but if you have scanners with hard lane RPO 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.729
 5 4 percent and I now have the fighting dogs 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.009
 the distant discharges kidnapping now just about points again 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.669
 and the dogs help doctors until there's the confluence 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.739
 his Peoria has 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.739
 and the dogs go beautifully their houses and Bollmann Chopins 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:53.749
 here also not written as well but Shen Weis Ashton v 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.679
 good Keilson kills look 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:03:00.719
 and I want to show up too luckily, Swen's ankle could live 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.930
 make my beard a fist round or until you arrive 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.169
 his 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.439
 There was still something to say 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.439
 they do not get as busy as I said 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.729
 Blackouts Finish just makes a lot of savings 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.729
 it was also soon the mappack out I'm curious 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:24.279
 Although I'm not so excited, at least what costs 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:26.349
 but well 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.369
 Here I have to do now 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:29.819
 thunder 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.599
 if you are not so bad 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.509
 too bad that you did the funny Sebus because many mans 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:40.339
 on garbage cans hardcore mode no topic across the Met and wonder 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:44.149
 then that they are tilted I have now closer a team Kehl or me 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:47.059
 Of course I am innocent anyway 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.729
 now it's the same 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.859
 We are now two kilometers to 10 KitzbÃ¼hel 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.889
 for the Kia ray 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.039
 that was nothing 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:02.709
 and now I'm just going to keep going down until the 16 is so exciting 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.919
 I do not have to say it 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.389
 like to 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.779
 and it's even just eighth degree I was wrong 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.779
 not discovered yet and also applies the best 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.439
 Puhl in the bull 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.199
 I was fine and now it starts 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:25.809
 Strangely, I still got the points 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.860
 he does not come 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.699
 but well 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.520
 Although meant first grade 9 to Tuesday should change 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.669
 and then I have the same 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.189
 Bonus points com 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:45.189
 not wanted 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.849
 I'll tell you I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.610
 and how does Sperner always look surprised 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.729
 although always beautiful and healthy 9 b 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:00.569
