well<00:00:05.319> I<00:00:05.350> thought<00:00:06.130> I<00:00:06.160> could<00:00:06.370> be<00:00:06.460> tricky<00:00:06.700> and

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.000 
well I thought I could be tricky and

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.090 
well I thought I could be tricky and
just<00:00:07.690> grow<00:00:08.020> my<00:00:08.889> hydroponics<00:00:09.610> on<00:00:10.650> water<00:00:11.650> and

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.100 
just grow my hydroponics on water and

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.350 
just grow my hydroponics on water and
some<00:00:12.670> worm<00:00:13.480> casting<00:00:14.020> tea<00:00:14.230> but<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:15.670> wasn't

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
some worm casting tea but I wasn't

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.510 
some worm casting tea but I wasn't
really<00:00:16.480> working<00:00:16.720> the<00:00:16.960> wealth<00:00:17.170> that<00:00:17.380> will<00:00:17.680> this

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520

nothing<00:00:21.990> impressive<00:00:22.990> some<00:00:23.860> of<00:00:23.950> the<00:00:24.010> plants

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
nothing impressive some of the plants

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.160 
nothing impressive some of the plants
died<00:00:24.520> and<00:00:24.910> I<00:00:25.570> don't<00:00:25.690> know<00:00:25.750> if<00:00:25.810> they<00:00:25.900> were<00:00:26.020> get

little bit in the tank so hopefully we

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.410 
little bit in the tank so hopefully we
can<00:00:49.210> look<00:00:49.329> back<00:00:49.390> and<00:00:49.570> laugh<00:00:49.930> a<00:00:50.140> little<00:00:50.260> bit<00:00:51.420> Wow

zest stuff were great this is like two

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.799 
zest stuff were great this is like two
weeks<00:00:55.600> afterwards<00:00:56.230> and<00:00:57.180> some<00:00:58.180> of<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.329> plants

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
weeks afterwards and some of the plants

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.860 
weeks afterwards and some of the plants
that<00:00:59.290> I<00:00:59.320> died<00:00:59.710> off<00:00:59.920> earlier<00:01:00.540> didn't<00:01:01.540> come<00:01:01.719> back

00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:09.459 
grew very well these are the real small

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:11.550 
grew very well these are the real small
ones<00:01:09.729> at<00:01:09.880> first<00:01:10.119> and<00:01:10.450> then<00:01:10.689> the<00:01:10.719> larger<00:01:11.350> ones

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
ones at first and then the larger ones

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.590 
ones at first and then the larger ones
are<00:01:11.859> the<00:01:12.100> bottom<00:01:12.399> corner<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.179> top<00:01:13.359> right

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
are the bottom corner and the top right

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.899 
are the bottom corner and the top right
and<00:01:13.829> they<00:01:14.829> just<00:01:15.009> really<00:01:15.479> took<00:01:16.479> off<00:01:16.659> with<00:01:16.929> that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and they just really took off with that

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.879 
and they just really took off with that
hydroponic<00:01:18.909> mix<00:01:19.329> stuff<00:01:19.569> it's<00:01:20.380> just<00:01:20.619> the

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:20.889 
hydroponic mix stuff it's just the

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:23.429 
hydroponic mix stuff it's just the
general<00:01:21.310> hydroponics<00:01:21.959> company<00:01:22.959> i<00:01:22.990> just<00:01:23.229> put<00:01:23.409> a

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
general hydroponics company i just put a

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.980 
general hydroponics company i just put a
little<00:01:23.499> like<00:01:23.859> a<00:01:23.889> teaspoon<00:01:24.639> i<00:01:25.179> think<00:01:25.749> it<00:01:25.869> was<00:01:25.929> a

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
little like a teaspoon i think it was a

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.639 
little like a teaspoon i think it was a
teaspoon<00:01:26.439> per<00:01:26.649> gallon<00:01:27.009> of<00:01:27.189> each<00:01:27.459> one<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:28.649> it

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
teaspoon per gallon of each one and it

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.719 
teaspoon per gallon of each one and it
really<00:01:30.009> has<00:01:30.279> worked<00:01:31.240> well<00:01:32.249> you<00:01:33.249> can<00:01:33.399> see<00:01:33.549> it's

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
really has worked well you can see it's

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.099 
really has worked well you can see it's
kind<00:01:33.909> of<00:01:34.029> coming<00:01:34.389> out<00:01:34.509> of<00:01:34.569> the<00:01:34.719> container<00:01:34.959> a

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
kind of coming out of the container a

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:36.539 
kind of coming out of the container a
little<00:01:35.349> bit<00:01:35.529> which<00:01:35.649> is<00:01:35.799> good<00:01:35.979> i'm<00:01:36.159> just<00:01:36.340> been

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
little bit which is good i'm just been

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.429 
little bit which is good i'm just been
pulled<00:01:36.789> out<00:01:36.999> just<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.299> little<00:01:37.329> bit<00:01:37.509> so<00:01:38.200> there's

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
pulled out just a little bit so there's

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.309 
pulled out just a little bit so there's
a<00:01:38.469> little<00:01:38.529> bit<00:01:38.679> more<00:01:38.829> room<00:01:39.069> in<00:01:39.639> there<00:01:40.119> for<00:01:40.319> to

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
a little bit more room in there for to

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:46.080 
a little bit more room in there for to
grow<00:01:41.529> so<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:44.200> this<00:01:44.409> was<00:01:44.590> over<00:01:44.979> like<00:01:45.609> two<00:01:45.880> months

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
grow so so this was over like two months

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.809 
grow so so this was over like two months
just<00:01:46.929> kind<00:01:47.079> of<00:01:47.109> experimental<00:01:47.619> deal<00:01:48.099> first

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
just kind of experimental deal first

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.609 
just kind of experimental deal first
month<00:01:49.060> I<00:01:49.179> didn't<00:01:49.389> were<00:01:49.509> use<00:01:50.049> any<00:01:50.200> kind<00:01:50.469> of

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
month I didn't were use any kind of

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.260 
month I didn't were use any kind of
mixture<00:01:50.950> or<00:01:51.749> fertilizer<00:01:52.749> but<00:01:53.469> I<00:01:53.950> realize<00:01:54.639> it's

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
mixture or fertilizer but I realize it's

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.620 
mixture or fertilizer but I realize it's
pretty<00:01:55.599> key<00:01:56.139> in<00:01:56.319> this<00:01:56.469> equation<00:01:57.359> so<00:01:58.359> what<00:01:58.569> I'm

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
pretty key in this equation so what I'm

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.010 
pretty key in this equation so what I'm
going<00:01:58.749> to<00:01:58.810> do<00:01:58.929> probably<00:01:59.289> is<00:01:59.700> add<00:02:00.700> some<00:02:01.630> new

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
going to do probably is add some new

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.550 
going to do probably is add some new
seedlings<00:02:02.319> to<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:03.069> empty<00:02:03.310> pods<00:02:03.609> and<00:02:04.560> maybe

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
seedlings to the empty pods and maybe

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.050 
seedlings to the empty pods and maybe
add<00:02:05.889> some<00:02:05.950> different<00:02:06.639> types<00:02:06.789> of<00:02:07.380> vegetables<00:02:08.380> I

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
add some different types of vegetables I

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.050 
add some different types of vegetables I
also<00:02:10.060> got<00:02:10.539> some<00:02:10.810> other<00:02:11.349> types<00:02:11.980> of<00:02:12.310> plants

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
also got some other types of plants

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.880 
also got some other types of plants
growing<00:02:13.270> in<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.510> other<00:02:13.630> room<00:02:13.870> some<00:02:14.530> peppers

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
growing in the other room some peppers

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.770 
growing in the other room some peppers
and<00:02:15.160> tomatoes<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.700> stuff<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.210> i<00:02:16.240> might<00:02:16.510> do

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
and tomatoes and stuff so i might do

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.340 
and tomatoes and stuff so i might do
some

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
some

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.990 
some
try<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.500> do<00:02:17.620> some<00:02:17.770> seedlings<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.460> these<00:02:18.670> or

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
try to do some seedlings and these or
