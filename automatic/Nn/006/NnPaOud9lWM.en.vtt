00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.300
 The other 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.420
 The other 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.420
 Other things 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.279
 Alliance splits 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.609
 I think the same as blue sky 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.820
 Note 1 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.279
 Try to protect Bell kristen 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:23.900
 The other 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.109
 this is 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.849
 other than this 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.849
 this 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.489
 First half 2 minutes 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.489
 It's English but it's true 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.730
 Initially 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.370
 I have flowers 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.010
 The scene 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.010
 Go 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.730
 We say 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.340
 It is said that 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.340
 Already 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.360
 It is the capacity 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.790
 before that 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.790
 General department management method 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.310
 It is recommended for the purpose 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.610
 It matched automatically 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.820
 First of all 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.820
 Comment that 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.710
 Once 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.950
 Deep truth 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.260
 More than- 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
 Wear eye 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.700
 55 minutes 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.920
 I think it was googlebabybaby movement 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.620
 Arm and 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
 I think the next part is mostly 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.760
 1 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.110
 It is an application 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.070

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.559
 Start small movements at gate sales 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:10.689

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:14.769
 50 are many 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.259
 Softly show off this right hand 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.729
 South 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.739
 Because it has been extended to the point of falsehood with former exchanges 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:25.659
 all 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.619
 It is these days 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.619
 I spend a little 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.199
 Kikkoman is rainy 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.349

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.839
 I have a native language 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.959

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.689
 Same high 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:12.870
 It's a thousand winds 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.159
 It is size of foot, but this 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.699
 ELECOM 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:18.309
 I'm glad though 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:23.329
 It will be clear for two years around this unfinished book 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.739
 The eight of them 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.699
 If 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.699
 The DPP is unknown on 6th, too 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:34.569
 Panho 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.659

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.469
 To 1.5 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:49.469
 Otherwise, I once had a special occasion 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.349
 By email on the 6th 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:03.149
 Sports 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.349
 This possibility 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:13.989
 On the other hand 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.989
 Eri Tokunaga 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.919

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.730
 Whisper repeated double test 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:52.259
 here 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.259
 I forbid the same plan 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.900
 It is normal 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.800
 I will not be in dispute 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:12.969
 Here at first 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.930
 Hit in the score area and set an example update 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:19.539

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.650
 I have more water 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.960
 So 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.849
 Still people go 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.849
 Because we will go to the bubble period 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.050
 4 points first 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.150
 This can be done from now on 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.830
