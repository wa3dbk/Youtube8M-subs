 the 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.029
 pills 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.690
 valves and the safety that we have 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.230

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.230
 state 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.940
 of Tangier this time we are 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.600
 presenting one of 220 liters 20 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:31.190
 48 inches long 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.190

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.809
 we have a filling valve 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.910
 which is what allows us as its name 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.440
 the killer says it 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.440
 some people 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.930
 some other imagined a player who 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.240
 lets us know when the tank is 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.910
 at 90 percent capacity 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.980
 advisable to reach deeply is 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.980
 has its safety valve 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.880
 I would not know only in case of a 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.450
 fire 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.920
 many that something that will cause an excess 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.560
 of pressure inside my hands 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.030
 They are regularly designed to open 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.030
 to 250 pounds 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.920
 yd 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.920
 using the eyes 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.330
 also we have a valve 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.330
 service that as its name says 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.480
 I was with the account 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.100
 in the group 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.530
 incorporate the reasons into something 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.190
 we also have a level indicator 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.760
 which don marka 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.970
 by percentage of field capacity 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.050
 this is clear that a 50 we are 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.630
 talking about medium so much 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.210
 and in the same way a 10 or a 10 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.870
 hundred of the stay capacity and without 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.870
 measure is 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.180
 has its center 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.409
 for childbirth 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.409
 protector for me too 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.850
 the one eighth strip 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.530
 the deep and middle age 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.530
 For that 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.500
 to use lp gas as fuel and 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.100
 that way help the ecology of 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.100
 our country
