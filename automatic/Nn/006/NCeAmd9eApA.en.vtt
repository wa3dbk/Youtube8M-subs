00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
should contour there are a few ways to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.789 
should contour there are a few ways to
go<00:01:36.360> about<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:36.960> that's<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> fastest

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
go about it but that's just the fastest

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.740 
go about it but that's just the fastest
and<00:01:37.950> easiest<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.460> i<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.759> found<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.600> is

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
and easiest that i have found this is

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.210 
and easiest that i have found this is
also<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.049> good<00:01:40.229> time<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.500> define<00:01:40.890> your<00:01:41.040> nose

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
also a good time to define your nose

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.679 
also a good time to define your nose
running<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.790> contour<00:01:42.180> powder<00:01:42.420> down<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
running that contour powder down the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.990 
running that contour powder down the
sides<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.290> make<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.710> appear<00:01:43.799> more<00:01:44.250> narrow<00:01:44.640> and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
sides to make it appear more narrow and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.370 
sides to make it appear more narrow and
here<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.780> see<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.930> difference<00:01:46.320> between

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
here you can see the difference between

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.319 
here you can see the difference between
a<00:01:46.649> contour<00:01:47.220> cheek<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.759> lightly<00:01:48.090> bronze

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
a contour cheek and a lightly bronze

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.120 
a contour cheek and a lightly bronze
cheek<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.110> differences<00:01:49.470> are<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.799> subtle

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
cheek the differences are really subtle

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.510 
cheek the differences are really subtle
but<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.460> slightly<00:01:50.729> more<00:01:51.060> defined<00:01:52.520> alright

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
but just slightly more defined alright

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.370 
but just slightly more defined alright
so<00:01:53.670> at<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.909> point<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.420> when<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.600> will<00:01:54.750> apply<00:01:55.110> my
