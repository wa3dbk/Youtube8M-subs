00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
Disney film is made after that I watched

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.990 
Disney film is made after that I watched
tons<00:07:03.650> of<00:07:03.889> videos<00:07:04.130> since<00:07:04.430> each<00:07:04.610> movie<00:07:04.880> has<00:07:04.970> a

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 
tons of videos since each movie has a

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.740 
tons of videos since each movie has a
different<00:07:05.300> feel

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 
different feel

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.749 
different feel
I<00:07:05.780> was<00:07:06.500> watching<00:07:06.770> nothing<00:07:06.979> but<00:07:07.250> Disney<00:07:07.340> videos

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 
I was watching nothing but Disney videos

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.580 
I was watching nothing but Disney videos
for<00:07:07.940> six<00:07:08.150> months<00:07:08.539> I<00:07:08.690> study<00:07:09.440> the

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 
for six months I study the

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.050 
for six months I study the
characteristics<00:07:09.889> of<00:07:10.310> each<00:07:10.400> character<00:07:10.729> and

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.060 
characteristics of each character and

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.120 
characteristics of each character and
then<00:07:11.479> delivered<00:07:11.840> them<00:07:11.930> into<00:07:11.990> the<00:07:12.110> game<00:07:12.380> and<00:07:13.070> I

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
then delivered them into the game and I

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.040 
then delivered them into the game and I
think<00:07:13.400> that's<00:07:13.580> really<00:07:14.360> displayed

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050 
think that's really displayed

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.290 
think that's really displayed
beautifully<00:07:15.380> in<00:07:15.949> how<00:07:16.190> well<00:07:16.490> they<00:07:16.789> animated

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 
beautifully in how well they animated

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.450 
beautifully in how well they animated
the<00:07:17.389> characters<00:07:17.720> in<00:07:17.840> 3d<00:07:18.229> they<00:07:18.830> moved<00:07:19.190> just

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460 
the characters in 3d they moved just

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.250 
the characters in 3d they moved just
like<00:07:19.580> their<00:07:19.910> 2d<00:07:20.210> animated<00:07:20.660> a<00:07:20.810> lot<00:07:20.990> of<00:07:21.110> plays

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.260 
like their 2d animated a lot of plays

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.409 
like their 2d animated a lot of plays
and<00:07:21.500> so<00:07:22.160> those<00:07:22.520> chalk<00:07:22.820> talks<00:07:23.120> thing<00:07:23.300> really

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:23.419 
and so those chalk talks thing really

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:25.200 
and so those chalk talks thing really
paid<00:07:23.720> off

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.210 
paid off

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.340
