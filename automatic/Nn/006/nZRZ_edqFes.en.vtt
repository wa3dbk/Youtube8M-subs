00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
us a little about how you predict this

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.710 
us a little about how you predict this
match<00:00:24.779> will<00:00:24.990> go<00:00:25.820> shouldn't<00:00:26.820> be<00:00:26.910> too<00:00:26.939> hard<00:00:27.119> I

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
match will go shouldn't be too hard I

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.109 
match will go shouldn't be too hard I
mean<00:00:28.140> these<00:00:29.040> random<00:00:29.490> seedings<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.090> a

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
mean these random seedings for a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.910 
mean these random seedings for a
tournament<00:00:30.480> which<00:00:30.869> meant<00:00:31.110> that<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.770> other

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
tournament which meant that the other

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.910 
tournament which meant that the other
group<00:00:32.190> had<00:00:32.460> way<00:00:32.879> worse<00:00:33.480> worst<00:00:34.199> teams<00:00:34.500> if<00:00:34.800> you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
group had way worse worst teams if you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.700 
group had way worse worst teams if you
look<00:00:35.100> at<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.220> team<00:00:35.430> sling<00:00:35.930> like<00:00:36.930> even<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
look at the team sling like even the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.229 
look at the team sling like even the
second<00:00:38.010> team<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.460> group<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.940> it

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
second team in that group is it

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.820 
second team in that group is it
shouldn't<00:00:39.540> be<00:00:39.600> too<00:00:39.750> hard<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:40.080> a<00:00:40.140> match<00:00:40.320> they're

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
shouldn't be too hard of a match they're

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.049 
shouldn't be too hard of a match they're
playing<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.280> think<00:00:41.430> they're<00:00:41.550> playing<00:00:41.730> desk<00:00:41.940> to

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
playing I think they're playing desk to

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.229 
playing I think they're playing desk to
you<00:00:42.150> and<00:00:43.220> you<00:00:44.220> can't<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.519> little<00:00:44.730> random<00:00:45.030> map

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
you and you can't be a little random map

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.120 
you and you can't be a little random map
but<00:00:45.480> either<00:00:45.720> way<00:00:45.930> I'm<00:00:46.020> expecting<00:00:46.530> fairly<00:00:47.010> easy

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
but either way I'm expecting fairly easy

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.420 
but either way I'm expecting fairly easy
win<00:00:47.899> alright<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.380> also<00:00:49.559> hear<00:00:50.100> that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
win alright and I also hear that

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.299 
win alright and I also hear that
complexity<00:00:51.180> actually<00:00:51.989> tied<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.620> their<00:00:52.950> group

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
complexity actually tied in their group

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.569 
complexity actually tied in their group
so<00:00:54.090> how<00:00:55.079> did<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.410> feel<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:56.190> because<00:00:56.399> I

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
so how did you feel about that because I

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.220 
so how did you feel about that because I
know<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.790> guys<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.390> quite<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> bitter

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
know you guys have a quite a bitter

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.310 
know you guys have a quite a bitter
rivalry<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:59.160> complexity<00:00:59.750> well<00:01:00.750> they<00:01:01.079> tied

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
rivalry with complexity well they tied

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.920 
rivalry with complexity well they tied
the<00:01:01.469> first<00:01:01.649> match<00:01:01.950> with<00:01:02.160> Tuscan<00:01:02.700> so<00:01:03.120> he's<00:01:03.780> kind

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the first match with Tuscan so he's kind

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.299 
the first match with Tuscan so he's kind
of<00:01:04.050> random<00:01:04.410> playing<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> first<00:01:04.860> mess<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
of random playing the first mess of the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.660 
of random playing the first mess of the
tournament<00:01:05.789> playing<00:01:06.060> Tuscan<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:07.490> he<00:01:08.490> could

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
tournament playing Tuscan but he could

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.160 
tournament playing Tuscan but he could
end<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.970> bad<00:01:09.119> if<00:01:09.300> they<00:01:09.420> play<00:01:09.600> second<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
end it bad if they play second in the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.450 
end it bad if they play second in the
group<00:01:10.350> which<00:01:10.740> would<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:10.979> meant<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.310> they

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
group which would have meant that they

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.260 
group which would have meant that they
would<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.670> played<00:01:11.820> them<00:01:12.000> were<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.240> earlier

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
would have played them were you earlier

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.389 
would have played them were you earlier
than<00:01:12.869> everyone<00:01:13.350> would<00:01:13.530> expect<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.039> but<00:01:14.160> it

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
than everyone would expect it but it

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:15.529 
than everyone would expect it but it
doesn't<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:14.729> matter<00:01:14.880> because<00:01:15.149> they<00:01:15.360> still

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
doesn't really matter because they still

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:21.139 
doesn't really matter because they still
won<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> group<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:19.229> now<00:01:19.789> now<00:01:20.789> that<00:01:21.000> you've

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:35.849 
really easy to get used to once you're

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:37.609 
really easy to get used to once you're
attending<00:01:36.179> more<00:01:36.390> tournaments<00:01:36.959> because<00:01:37.050> a<00:01:37.380> lot

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
attending more tournaments because a lot

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.919 
attending more tournaments because a lot
of<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.740> time<00:01:38.039> almost<00:01:39.000> like<00:01:39.240> more<00:01:39.599> often<00:01:39.840> than

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
of the time almost like more often than

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.480 
of the time almost like more often than
not<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.440> really<00:01:40.679> loud<00:01:40.830> in<00:01:40.890> tournaments

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
not it's really loud in tournaments

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.309 
not it's really loud in tournaments
nowadays<00:01:41.849> he<00:01:42.030> used<00:01:42.179> to<00:01:42.300> be<00:01:42.390> better<00:01:42.569> a<00:01:42.690> couple

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
nowadays he used to be better a couple

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:44.749 
nowadays he used to be better a couple
years<00:01:43.440> back<00:01:43.709> but<00:01:43.770> now<00:01:44.039> it's<00:01:44.190> always<00:01:44.490> loved

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
years back but now it's always loved

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.070 
years back but now it's always loved
because<00:01:44.910> most<00:01:45.270> tournaments<00:01:45.450> are<00:01:45.750> using<00:01:45.959> like

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
because most tournaments are using like

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.419 
because most tournaments are using like
sexy<00:01:46.380> business<00:01:46.709> like<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:46.890> or<00:01:47.220> something

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
sexy business like this or something

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.050 
sexy business like this or something
like<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:49.280> like<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.610> some<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.819> the<00:01:50.910> things

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
like so like that some of the things

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.359 
like so like that some of the things
probably<00:01:51.300> gonna<00:01:51.569> annoy<00:01:52.530> some<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.039> people

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
probably gonna annoy some of the people

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.010 
probably gonna annoy some of the people
that<00:01:53.399> are<00:01:53.580> like<00:01:53.789> local<00:01:54.240> since<00:01:54.479> attending

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
that are like local since attending

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.990
