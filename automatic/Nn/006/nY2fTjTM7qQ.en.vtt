microphone right here you can see it and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.359 
microphone right here you can see it and
this<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.510> teeny<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.739> perfectly

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
this is so teeny and the perfectly

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.630 
this is so teeny and the perfectly
suitable<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.630> small<00:01:07.170> mini<00:01:07.470> copter<00:01:08.010> just

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
suitable for a small mini copter just

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.660 
suitable for a small mini copter just
like<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:12.350> this<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.830> parrot

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
like this and this is the parrot

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.050 
like this and this is the parrot
-<00:01:15.030> Henry<00:01:15.450> size<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.049> quadcopter<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.640> can

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
- Henry size the quadcopter and I can

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.480 
- Henry size the quadcopter and I can
directly<00:01:18.530> monk<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.830> camera<00:01:20.430> right<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.600> and

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
directly monk this camera right here and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.179 
directly monk this camera right here and
include<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.729> form<00:01:24.240> behind<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.290> give<00:01:25.619> enough

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
include a form behind it to give enough

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:33.499 
include a form behind it to give enough
shock<00:01:27.060> absorption<00:01:27.979> okay<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:31.759> this<00:01:32.759> camera<00:01:33.090> is

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
shock absorption okay so this camera is

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.130 
shock absorption okay so this camera is
also<00:01:33.930> 5<00:01:34.560> volt<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.579> by<00:01:36.150> using<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.110> can

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
also 5 volt so by using it you can

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.330 
also 5 volt so by using it you can
directly<00:01:37.829> poverty<00:01:38.640> up<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.920> power<00:01:40.920> from

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
directly poverty up with the power from

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.600 
directly poverty up with the power from
your<00:01:41.579> ESC<00:01:42.450> flight<00:01:42.899> control<00:01:43.380> or<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:44.310> power

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
your ESC flight control or a power

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.920 
your ESC flight control or a power
regulator<00:01:45.180> which<00:01:45.600> gives<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.259> 5<00:01:46.890> volt<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
regulator which gives out 5 volt and

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.139 
regulator which gives out 5 volt and
since<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.290> camera<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> small<00:01:50.520> lightweight

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
since this camera is a small lightweight

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.380 
since this camera is a small lightweight
and<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.049> comes<00:01:52.290> with<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:53.100> microphone<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:54.030> is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and it comes with a microphone it is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.499 
and it comes with a microphone it is
just<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.990> very<00:01:55.380> very<00:01:55.890> good<00:01:56.399> option<00:01:56.850> for<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
just a very very good option for the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.770 
just a very very good option for the
mini<00:01:57.659> culture<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.250> mini

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780
