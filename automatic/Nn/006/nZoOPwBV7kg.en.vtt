uploading<00:04:34.190> several<00:04:34.760> parts<00:04:35.150> not<00:04:35.300> several<00:04:35.720> but

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
uploading several parts not several but

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.020 
uploading several parts not several but
like<00:04:36.020> I<00:04:36.230> don't<00:04:36.650> know<00:04:36.740> 15<00:04:37.160> 20<00:04:37.280> min<00:04:37.550> increments

like I don't know 15 20 min increments
of<00:04:38.150> games<00:04:38.680> would<00:04:39.680> be<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.830> good<00:04:40.010> idea<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:40.640> would

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
of games would be a good idea and would
