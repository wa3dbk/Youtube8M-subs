00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
away from my face really simple and just

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.709 
away from my face really simple and just
allowing<00:02:38.469> it<00:02:38.739> to<00:02:38.769> sit<00:02:39.250> for<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.579> few<00:02:39.939> seconds<00:02:40.450> to

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:40.719 
allowing it to sit for a few seconds to

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.709 
allowing it to sit for a few seconds to
really<00:02:41.319> heat<00:02:41.530> up<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.980> hair<00:02:42.250> um<00:02:42.969> now<00:02:43.269> like<00:02:43.540> with

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:43.719 
really heat up the hair um now like with

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.679 
really heat up the hair um now like with
all<00:02:43.959> of<00:02:44.530> my<00:02:44.709> hair<00:02:45.040> crowing<00:02:45.370> tutorials<00:02:45.909> I<00:02:46.090> like

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
all of my hair crowing tutorials I like

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.199 
all of my hair crowing tutorials I like
to<00:02:47.049> release<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.889> curl<00:02:48.099> into<00:02:48.430> my<00:02:48.700> hand<00:02:48.969> and

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
to release the curl into my hand and

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.179 
to release the curl into my hand and
hold<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:49.719> for<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.959> few<00:02:50.019> seconds<00:02:50.530> after<00:02:50.980> I've

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
hold it for a few seconds after I've

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.009 
hold it for a few seconds after I've
removed<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.730> iron<00:02:51.909> because<00:02:52.299> I<00:02:52.510> feel<00:02:52.810> that

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
removed the iron because I feel that

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.929 
removed the iron because I feel that
this<00:02:53.409> allows<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.980> curl<00:02:54.159> to<00:02:54.400> further<00:02:54.609> SAT

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
this allows the curl to further SAT

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.899 
this allows the curl to further SAT
without<00:02:55.560> really<00:02:56.560> applying<00:02:57.189> more<00:02:57.459> heat<00:02:57.669> that

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
without really applying more heat that

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.929 
without really applying more heat that
invents<00:02:58.480> necessary<00:02:58.959> because<00:02:59.139> the<00:02:59.699> curl<00:03:00.699> will

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
invents necessary because the curl will

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.270 
invents necessary because the curl will
be<00:03:01.090> hot<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.719> the<00:03:01.750> touch<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.379> mean<00:03:02.949> not<00:03:02.980> burning

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
be hot to the touch I mean not burning

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.679 
be hot to the touch I mean not burning
or<00:03:03.430> anything<00:03:03.699> but<00:03:03.849> it<00:03:04.000> will<00:03:04.150> be<00:03:04.180> warm<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.659> the

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 
or anything but it will be warm to the

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.089 
or anything but it will be warm to the
touch<00:03:04.780> so<00:03:04.959> you<00:03:05.230> know<00:03:05.349> that<00:03:05.530> he<00:03:05.859> is<00:03:05.949> still

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
touch so you know that he is still

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.770 
touch so you know that he is still
working<00:03:06.609> and<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:07.209> just<00:03:07.359> feel<00:03:07.480> like<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.659> gives

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
working and I just feel like it gives

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.050 
working and I just feel like it gives
you<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.079> better<00:03:08.290> curl<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.829> way<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.310> I'm<00:03:09.849> just

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
you a better curl that way so I'm just

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.699 
you a better curl that way so I'm just
going<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.269> continue<00:03:10.329> with<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.469> same

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
going to continue with this the same

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.800 
going to continue with this the same
technique<00:03:12.159> just<00:03:12.849> pulling<00:03:13.239> my<00:03:13.269> hair<00:03:13.540> down

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
technique just pulling my hair down

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.500 
technique just pulling my hair down
through<00:03:14.199> the<00:03:14.319> iron<00:03:14.669> rolling<00:03:15.669> it<00:03:15.939> up<00:03:16.060> away<00:03:16.480> from

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
through the iron rolling it up away from

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.749 
through the iron rolling it up away from
the<00:03:16.750> face<00:03:17.079> and<00:03:17.409> I'll<00:03:17.919> be<00:03:18.069> right<00:03:18.219> back<00:03:18.400> as<00:03:18.639> soon

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:18.759 
the face and I'll be right back as soon

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:24.520 
the face and I'll be right back as soon
as<00:03:18.939> I<00:03:19.030> finish

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.300 

ok<00:03:25.520> so<00:03:25.580> my<00:03:25.819> bottom<00:03:26.209> layer<00:03:26.390> is<00:03:26.660> curled<00:03:27.080> now<00:03:28.040> and

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
ok so my bottom layer is curled now and

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.980 
ok so my bottom layer is curled now and
I've<00:03:28.400> taken<00:03:28.610> down<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.000> top<00:03:29.209> layer<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.750> curl

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
I've taken down the top layer to curl

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.270 
I've taken down the top layer to curl
this<00:03:30.200> I'm<00:03:30.350> gonna<00:03:30.470> do<00:03:30.590> things<00:03:30.800> a<00:03:30.890> little<00:03:30.920> bit

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
this I'm gonna do things a little bit

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.070 
this I'm gonna do things a little bit
differently<00:03:31.730> i'm<00:03:32.000> still<00:03:32.270> be<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.630> twist<00:03:32.930> it

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
differently i'm still be to twist it

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.260 
differently i'm still be to twist it
around<00:03:33.230> halfway<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:34.010> pull<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.310> down<00:03:34.459> but

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
around halfway and pull it down but

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.760 
around halfway and pull it down but
instead<00:03:35.569> of<00:03:35.720> curling<00:03:36.020> it<00:03:36.319> like<00:03:36.470> this<00:03:36.709> and

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
instead of curling it like this and

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.280 
instead of curling it like this and
rolling<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:37.340> up<00:03:37.490> i'm<00:03:38.240> going<00:03:38.300> to<00:03:38.510> lay<00:03:38.660> it<00:03:38.690> flat

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
rolling it up i'm going to lay it flat

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.350 
rolling it up i'm going to lay it flat
against<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:39.830> top<00:03:40.069> of<00:03:40.220> my<00:03:40.340> head<00:03:40.520> and<00:03:40.700> for<00:03:41.239> me

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
against the top of my head and for me

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.420 
against the top of my head and for me
this<00:03:41.540> just<00:03:41.840> gives<00:03:42.680> me<00:03:42.800> a<00:03:42.890> little<00:03:43.069> bit<00:03:43.280> more

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
this just gives me a little bit more

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.520 
this just gives me a little bit more
volume<00:03:43.880> and<00:03:44.390> i<00:03:44.510> like<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.900> way<00:03:45.020> that<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.319> curl

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
volume and i like the way that the curl

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.160 
volume and i like the way that the curl
turns<00:03:45.860> out<00:03:46.130> better<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:47.450> I'm<00:03:47.600> just<00:03:47.780> sitting<00:03:48.050> it

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
turns out better so I'm just sitting it

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.229 
turns out better so I'm just sitting it
with<00:03:48.319> it<00:03:48.500> perpendicular<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.730> top<00:03:49.910> of<00:03:49.940> my

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
with it perpendicular to the top of my

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.760 
with it perpendicular to the top of my
head<00:03:50.390> as<00:03:50.660> opposed<00:03:50.989> to<00:03:51.200> kind<00:03:51.410> of<00:03:51.560> more<00:03:51.739> like

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
head as opposed to kind of more like

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.699 
head as opposed to kind of more like
this<00:03:52.480> it's<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.660> slight<00:03:53.930> change<00:03:54.200> but<00:03:54.440> I<00:03:54.470> feel

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
this it's a slight change but I feel

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.910 
this it's a slight change but I feel
like<00:03:54.739> it<00:03:54.920> makes<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.220> difference

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.470 

I'm<00:04:01.920> doing<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.250> same<00:04:02.430> thing<00:04:02.730> same<00:04:03.090> technique

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
I'm doing the same thing same technique

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.380 
I'm doing the same thing same technique
where<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:03.720> just<00:04:04.050> hold<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.380> Pearl<00:04:04.560> afterwards

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
where I just hold the Pearl afterwards

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.970 
where I just hold the Pearl afterwards
just<00:04:06.390> for<00:04:06.570> my<00:04:06.690> experience<00:04:07.080> this<00:04:07.530> works<00:04:07.830> the

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
just for my experience this works the

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.070 
just for my experience this works the
best<00:04:08.100> for<00:04:08.280> me<00:04:10.520> so<00:04:11.660> I'm<00:04:12.660> just<00:04:12.870> going<00:04:12.990> to

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
best for me so I'm just going to

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.070 
best for me so I'm just going to
continue<00:04:13.200> doing<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.010> same<00:04:14.370> thing<00:04:14.960> bring<00:04:15.960> it

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
continue doing the same thing bring it

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.960 
continue doing the same thing bring it
down<00:04:16.110> about<00:04:16.470> halfway<00:04:16.799> through<00:04:17.610> the<00:04:17.760> hair

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
down about halfway through the hair

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.390 
down about halfway through the hair
keeping<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.049> clamp<00:04:19.290> slightly<00:04:19.739> open<00:04:20.100> as<00:04:20.250> I

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
keeping the clamp slightly open as I

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.120 
keeping the clamp slightly open as I
roll<00:04:20.610> it<00:04:20.790> down<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.360> then<00:04:22.080> up<00:04:22.350> against<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.950> top

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
roll it down and then up against the top

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.060 
roll it down and then up against the top
of<00:04:23.280> my<00:04:23.400> head<00:04:23.550> so<00:04:24.030> um<00:04:24.710> I'm<00:04:25.710> going<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:25.920> finish

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
of my head so um I'm going to finish

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
of my head so um I'm going to finish
curling<00:04:26.520> my<00:04:26.610> hair<00:04:26.640> and<00:04:26.970> I'll<00:04:27.150> be<00:04:27.300> right<00:04:27.480> back

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.330 

you

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.920 

now<00:04:38.880> I'm<00:04:39.000> actually<00:04:39.150> going<00:04:39.389> to<00:04:39.449> start<00:04:39.660> working

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
now I'm actually going to start working

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.390 
now I'm actually going to start working
on<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.169> braids<00:04:40.350> and<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.620> way<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:41.010> do<00:04:41.100> this

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
on the braids and the way that I do this

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.770 
on the braids and the way that I do this
is<00:04:41.639> I'm<00:04:41.790> just<00:04:41.880> going<00:04:41.970> to<00:04:42.090> take<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.300> section<00:04:42.600> of

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
is I'm just going to take a section of

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.280 
is I'm just going to take a section of
hair<00:04:42.840> underneath<00:04:43.800> this<00:04:44.130> top<00:04:44.400> layer<00:04:44.639> here<00:04:45.290> on

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
hair underneath this top layer here on

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.740 
hair underneath this top layer here on
top<00:04:46.590> of<00:04:46.620> my<00:04:46.860> ear<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:48.030> don't<00:04:48.330> want<00:04:48.510> to<00:04:48.570> take

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
top of my ear and I don't want to take

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.090 
top of my ear and I don't want to take
the<00:04:48.930> most<00:04:50.510> forward<00:04:51.510> facing<00:04:52.139> piece<00:04:52.500> because<00:04:52.919> I

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
the most forward facing piece because I

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.340 
the most forward facing piece because I
do<00:04:53.160> want<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.610> disguise<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.449> braids<00:04:54.660> obviously

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
do want to disguise the braids obviously

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.960 
do want to disguise the braids obviously
well<00:04:55.949> it<00:04:56.040> would<00:04:56.160> be<00:04:56.190> nice<00:04:56.370> if<00:04:56.430> I<00:04:56.610> pinned<00:04:56.850> on

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
well it would be nice if I pinned on

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.760 
well it would be nice if I pinned on
over<00:04:57.210> so<00:04:57.780> I'm<00:04:57.960> going<00:04:58.139> to<00:04:58.169> take<00:04:58.350> a<00:04:58.410> section

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
over so I'm going to take a section

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.330 
over so I'm going to take a section
starting<00:04:59.760> from<00:04:59.940> about<00:05:00.030> right<00:05:00.449> here<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:01.650> don't

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
starting from about right here I don't

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.640 
starting from about right here I don't
want<00:05:02.460> to<00:05:02.520> go<00:05:02.610> too<00:05:02.669> far<00:05:02.970> back<00:05:03.540> either<00:05:03.870> because<00:05:04.470> I

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
want to go too far back either because I

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.650 
want to go too far back either because I
just<00:05:04.770> want<00:05:05.130> it<00:05:05.220> to<00:05:05.280> be<00:05:05.370> a<00:05:05.490> really<00:05:05.790> nice<00:05:06.240> flat

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
just want it to be a really nice flat

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.810 
just want it to be a really nice flat
braid<00:05:06.960> so<00:05:07.530> as<00:05:07.650> you<00:05:07.800> can<00:05:07.919> see<00:05:08.220> i<00:05:08.250> have<00:05:08.370> about

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
braid so as you can see i have about

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.240 
braid so as you can see i have about
maybe<00:05:09.510> a<00:05:09.630> 1<00:05:09.840> in<00:05:09.960> section<00:05:10.380> of<00:05:10.500> hair<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:10.979> also

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
maybe a 1 in section of hair and also

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.770 
maybe a 1 in section of hair and also
i'm<00:05:11.310> going<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.520> do<00:05:11.700> is<00:05:11.729> just<00:05:12.180> do<00:05:12.330> a<00:05:12.360> really

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
i'm going to do is just do a really

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.879 
i'm going to do is just do a really
simple<00:05:12.900> basic<00:05:13.740> braid<00:05:14.150> starting<00:05:15.150> from<00:05:15.450> about

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
simple basic braid starting from about

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.860 
simple basic braid starting from about
here<00:05:16.889> and<00:05:17.370> then<00:05:17.490> just<00:05:17.669> going<00:05:17.970> down<00:05:18.210> and<00:05:18.510> I'm

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
here and then just going down and I'm

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.719

okay<00:05:27.090> so<00:05:27.150> now<00:05:27.360> that<00:05:27.389> I<00:05:27.599> have<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.960> braid<00:05:28.169> all

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
okay so now that I have the braid all

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.379 
okay so now that I have the braid all
completed<00:05:28.860> secured<00:05:29.460> I'm<00:05:29.940> just<00:05:30.090> going<00:05:30.240> to<00:05:30.300> go

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
completed secured I'm just going to go

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.379 
completed secured I'm just going to go
through<00:05:30.419> and<00:05:30.840> pull<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.699> hair<00:05:32.699> tight<00:05:32.970> just

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
through and pull the hair tight just

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.480 
through and pull the hair tight just
below<00:05:34.169> where<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:34.650> bottom<00:05:34.949> of<00:05:35.099> the<00:05:35.250> braid

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
below where the bottom of the braid

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.279 
below where the bottom of the braid
stops<00:05:36.270> because<00:05:36.539> I'm<00:05:36.810> going<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:36.990> go<00:05:37.110> through

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
stops because I'm going to go through

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:38.809 
stops because I'm going to go through
now<00:05:37.530> and<00:05:37.560> actually<00:05:37.860> wide<00:05:38.310> in<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:38.550> braid

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
now and actually wide in the braid

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:40.640 
now and actually wide in the braid
making<00:05:39.479> it<00:05:39.569> appear<00:05:39.810> thicker<00:05:40.080> than<00:05:40.500> it

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
making it appear thicker than it

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.320 
making it appear thicker than it
actually<00:05:40.770> is<00:05:41.039> making<00:05:41.699> it<00:05:41.789> look<00:05:41.940> a<00:05:42.000> little<00:05:42.120> bit

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
actually is making it look a little bit

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.869 
actually is making it look a little bit
Messier<00:05:42.750> and<00:05:43.050> just<00:05:43.919> kind<00:05:44.099> of<00:05:44.159> playing<00:05:44.430> with<00:05:44.669> it

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:44.879 
Messier and just kind of playing with it

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:47.869 
Messier and just kind of playing with it
to<00:05:45.150> to<00:05:45.720> to<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.650> point<00:05:46.889> where<00:05:47.039> I<00:05:47.220> like<00:05:47.580> the<00:05:47.759> way

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
to to to the point where I like the way

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.850 
to to to the point where I like the way
that<00:05:48.000> it<00:05:48.150> looks<00:05:48.180> now<00:05:48.930> you<00:05:48.990> can<00:05:49.500> experiment

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
that it looks now you can experiment

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.830 
that it looks now you can experiment
with<00:05:50.099> different<00:05:50.340> like<00:05:51.000> lengths<00:05:51.509> of<00:05:51.629> hair

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
with different like lengths of hair

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.719 
with different like lengths of hair
widths<00:05:52.800> of<00:05:52.889> hair<00:05:53.069> when<00:05:53.250> you're<00:05:53.370> doing<00:05:53.639> the

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
widths of hair when you're doing the

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.550 
widths of hair when you're doing the
braid<00:05:53.940> to<00:05:54.240> get<00:05:54.389> it<00:05:54.539> the<00:05:54.629> way<00:05:54.720> that<00:05:54.750> she<00:05:55.139> prefer

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
braid to get it the way that she prefer

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.230 
braid to get it the way that she prefer
but<00:05:55.860> I<00:05:55.889> like<00:05:56.250> a<00:05:56.280> smaller<00:05:56.610> piece<00:05:56.909> that's<00:05:57.150> just

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
but I like a smaller piece that's just

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.990 
but I like a smaller piece that's just
been<00:05:57.599> kind<00:05:57.780> of<00:05:57.900> pulled<00:05:58.080> apart<00:05:58.229> a<00:05:58.530> little<00:05:58.650> bit

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
been kind of pulled apart a little bit

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.950 
been kind of pulled apart a little bit
and<00:06:00.000> so<00:06:00.210> that's<00:06:00.330> what<00:06:00.569> you're<00:06:00.659> going<00:06:00.780> to<00:06:00.870> be

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
and so that's what you're going to be

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.779 
and so that's what you're going to be
left<00:06:01.169> with<00:06:01.349> like<00:06:01.560> this<00:06:01.800> so<00:06:02.400> I'm<00:06:02.520> just<00:06:02.550> going<00:06:02.729> to

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
left with like this so I'm just going to

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.240 
left with like this so I'm just going to
move<00:06:02.940> my<00:06:02.970> hair<00:06:03.300> back<00:06:03.720> all<00:06:04.020> the<00:06:04.139> way<00:06:04.229> down<00:06:04.470> and

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
move my hair back all the way down and

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.460 
move my hair back all the way down and

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
as you can see I just have this under

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.219 
as you can see I just have this under
side<00:06:07.680> braid<00:06:07.979> and<00:06:08.419> also<00:06:09.419> i'm<00:06:09.479> going<00:06:09.630> to<00:06:09.720> do<00:06:09.900> is

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
side braid and also i'm going to do is

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.379 
side braid and also i'm going to do is
just<00:06:10.259> bring<00:06:10.830> it<00:06:10.949> across<00:06:11.280> the<00:06:11.669> top<00:06:11.880> of<00:06:11.909> my<00:06:12.180> head

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
just bring it across the top of my head

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.110 
just bring it across the top of my head
and<00:06:12.599> then<00:06:13.169> pull<00:06:13.979> it<00:06:14.130> back<00:06:14.310> to<00:06:14.580> the<00:06:14.669> same<00:06:14.880> kind

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
and then pull it back to the same kind

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.959 
and then pull it back to the same kind
of<00:06:15.150> area<00:06:15.569> behind<00:06:15.780> my<00:06:16.139> ear<00:06:16.610> underneath<00:06:17.610> the<00:06:17.759> top

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:17.969 
of area behind my ear underneath the top

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:19.580 
of area behind my ear underneath the top
layer<00:06:18.180> of<00:06:18.300> hair<00:06:18.449> so<00:06:18.659> it's<00:06:18.780> more<00:06:18.930> disguised<00:06:19.349> and

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
layer of hair so it's more disguised and

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.370 
layer of hair so it's more disguised and
then<00:06:20.069> just<00:06:20.330> fasten<00:06:21.330> the<00:06:21.449> bobby<00:06:21.630> pins<00:06:21.960> in<00:06:22.169> a

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
then just fasten the bobby pins in a

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.680 
then just fasten the bobby pins in a
cross<00:06:22.650> fashion<00:06:23.490> crisscross<00:06:24.030> fashion<00:06:24.479> so<00:06:24.659> that

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
cross fashion crisscross fashion so that

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.089 
cross fashion crisscross fashion so that
it's<00:06:24.930> really<00:06:25.110> secure<00:06:25.500> and<00:06:25.590> it's<00:06:25.710> not<00:06:25.830> going<00:06:26.009> to

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
it's really secure and it's not going to

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:30.110 
it's really secure and it's not going to
move<00:06:27.800> okay<00:06:28.800> and<00:06:29.009> that's<00:06:29.190> it<00:06:29.430> just<00:06:29.669> really

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
move okay and that's it just really

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.450 
move okay and that's it just really
simple<00:06:30.509> just<00:06:30.659> brought<00:06:30.900> it<00:06:31.020> across<00:06:31.229> my<00:06:31.289> head<00:06:31.650> at

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
simple just brought it across my head at

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.980 
simple just brought it across my head at
this<00:06:32.580> point<00:06:32.819> I<00:06:33.000> feel<00:06:33.030> like<00:06:33.360> the<00:06:33.479> hairspray

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
this point I feel like the hairspray

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.570 
this point I feel like the hairspray
even<00:06:34.319> though<00:06:34.440> it<00:06:34.680> turned<00:06:34.889> out<00:06:35.039> to<00:06:35.190> be<00:06:35.280> a<00:06:35.310> big

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
even though it turned out to be a big

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.700 
even though it turned out to be a big
fan<00:06:35.759> of<00:06:35.789> hairspray<00:06:36.240> just<00:06:36.659> to<00:06:37.080> kind<00:06:37.319> of<00:06:37.409> get<00:06:37.560> it
