I've been practicing speaking Rhino it's

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.420 
I've been practicing speaking Rhino it's
a<00:04:25.340> difficult<00:04:25.639> language<00:04:25.910> but<00:04:27.220> once<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:28.310> get

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
a difficult language but once you get

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.629 
a difficult language but once you get
the<00:04:28.520> knack<00:04:28.699> of<00:04:28.729> it<00:04:29.020> it's<00:04:30.020> pretty<00:04:30.199> nice<00:04:30.520> even<00:04:31.520> on

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
the knack of it it's pretty nice even on

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.120 
the knack of it it's pretty nice even on
his<00:04:31.850> personal<00:04:32.389> merch<00:04:32.660> shop<00:04:33.020> he<00:04:33.289> sells<00:04:33.590> a<00:04:33.800> vegan

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
his personal merch shop he sells a vegan

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.249 
his personal merch shop he sells a vegan
leather<00:04:34.310> cuff<00:04:34.759> which<00:04:35.090> he<00:04:35.300> himself<00:04:35.750> even<00:04:35.960> likes

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
leather cuff which he himself even likes

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.439 
leather cuff which he himself even likes
to<00:04:36.410> wear<00:04:36.620> out<00:04:36.800> a<00:04:37.009> lot<00:04:37.280> now<00:04:37.669> I<00:04:37.699> think<00:04:37.970> this<00:04:38.330> is

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
to wear out a lot now I think this is

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.210 
to wear out a lot now I think this is
awesome<00:04:38.660> because<00:04:39.050> one<00:04:39.500> they<00:04:39.830> could<00:04:40.009> have<00:04:40.100> gone

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
awesome because one they could have gone

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.610 
awesome because one they could have gone
with<00:04:40.460> a<00:04:40.520> regular<00:04:40.970> leather<00:04:41.240> cuff<00:04:41.599> it<00:04:42.289> still

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
with a regular leather cuff it still

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.189 
with a regular leather cuff it still
could<00:04:42.860> have<00:04:42.889> been<00:04:42.979> vegan<00:04:43.430> but<00:04:44.419> the<00:04:44.780> fact<00:04:45.080> that

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
could have been vegan but the fact that

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.710 
could have been vegan but the fact that
they<00:04:45.410> label<00:04:46.009> it<00:04:46.130> vegan<00:04:46.789> you<00:04:47.120> can<00:04:47.270> tell<00:04:47.539> that

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
they label it vegan you can tell that

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.360 
they label it vegan you can tell that
jared<00:04:48.139> is<00:04:48.259> trying<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.680> make<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:48.860> statement

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
jared is trying to make a statement

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.270 
jared is trying to make a statement
having<00:04:50.180> this<00:04:50.389> product<00:04:50.930> on<00:04:51.080> his<00:04:51.259> merch<00:04:51.500> shop<00:04:51.860> so

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
having this product on his merch shop so

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.279 
having this product on his merch shop so
that's<00:04:52.490> why<00:04:52.639> I<00:04:52.669> support<00:04:53.150> Jared<00:04:53.539> Leto<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:53.840> think

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
that's why I support Jared Leto I think

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.439 
that's why I support Jared Leto I think
he's<00:04:54.800> been<00:04:55.009> eating<00:04:55.250> this<00:04:55.550> way<00:04:55.759> because<00:04:56.030> it

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
he's been eating this way because it

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.510 
he's been eating this way because it
clearly<00:04:56.900> is<00:04:57.169> healthier<00:04:57.740> than<00:04:57.919> eating<00:04:58.160> a

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
clearly is healthier than eating a

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.060 
clearly is healthier than eating a
standard<00:04:59.240> American<00:04:59.750> diet<00:04:59.990> he<00:05:00.530> is<00:05:00.650> a<00:05:00.680> huge

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
standard American diet he is a huge

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.670 
standard American diet he is a huge
advocate<00:05:01.280> for<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.940> environment<00:05:02.120> and<00:05:02.990> I<00:05:03.259> do

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
advocate for the environment and I do

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.290 
advocate for the environment and I do
think<00:05:04.009> deep<00:05:04.250> down<00:05:04.490> he<00:05:04.729> really<00:05:04.759> does<00:05:05.180> care

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
think deep down he really does care

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.120 
think deep down he really does care
about<00:05:05.509> the<00:05:05.690> animals<00:05:05.960> and<00:05:06.500> there<00:05:06.770> was<00:05:06.889> a<00:05:06.919> couple

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.890 
about the animals and there was a couple
