00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
oK we've taken off all the super

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.520 
oK we've taken off all the super
can<00:00:13.280> see<00:00:13.520> that<00:00:13.700> the

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
can see that the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.890 
can see that the
homemade<00:00:16.840> thermometer<00:00:18.700> is<00:00:19.700> now<00:00:19.970> connected

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
homemade thermometer is now connected

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.600 
homemade thermometer is now connected
left<00:00:22.620> to<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:25.280> left

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
subtle body and the right one is over

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.150 
subtle body and the right one is over
here<00:00:33.800> connected<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.480> the<00:00:37.040> right<00:00:38.040> frontal<00:00:38.400> body

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
here connected to the right frontal body

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.640 
here connected to the right frontal body
tend<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.250> start<00:00:41.489> her<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.059> how<00:00:42.650> the

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
tend to start her up and see how the

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.990 
tend to start her up and see how the
balance<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:46.100> okay<00:00:47.100> I've<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.460> started<00:00:47.700> her<00:00:47.850> up

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
balance is okay I've just started her up

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.100 
balance is okay I've just started her up
so<00:00:48.660> where<00:00:50.180> I've<00:00:51.180> been<00:00:51.330> out<00:00:51.480> for<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.690> ride<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
so where I've been out for a ride so the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.100 
so where I've been out for a ride so the
Indians<00:00:52.410> already<00:00:52.710> warm<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.839> clearly

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
Indians already warm and we can clearly

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.189 
Indians already warm and we can clearly
see<00:00:55.470> straight<00:00:56.010> away<00:00:56.720> then<00:00:57.720> the<00:00:57.809> left-hand

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
see straight away then the left-hand

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.340 
see straight away then the left-hand
column<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.620> rising

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.830 

very<00:01:02.950> small<00:01:03.220> fluctuations<00:01:04.030> in<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.330> fluid

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.300 

because<00:01:07.380> we've<00:01:07.560> used<00:01:07.770> something<00:01:07.950> with<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> good

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
because we've used something with a good

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.460 
because we've used something with a good
viscosity<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.270> rev<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> engine<00:01:10.229> slightly

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
viscosity I rev the engine slightly

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.859 
viscosity I rev the engine slightly
you

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.679 

so<00:01:18.439> if<00:01:18.560> you're<00:01:18.710> very<00:01:18.890> obviously<00:01:19.280> see<00:01:19.600> that<00:01:20.600> we

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
so if you're very obviously see that we

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:21.969 
so if you're very obviously see that we
need<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.930> do<00:01:21.049> some<00:01:21.259> work<00:01:21.409> on<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.649> webcam

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
need to do some work on the webcam

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.569 
need to do some work on the webcam
cylinder<00:01:22.509> okay<00:01:23.540> I<00:01:26.079> shall<00:01:27.079> go<00:01:27.229> get<00:01:27.409> the

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
cylinder okay I shall go get the

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.399 
cylinder okay I shall go get the
instruction<00:01:28.579> book<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:29.000> Haynes<00:01:29.270> manual<00:01:29.450> and

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
instruction book the Haynes manual and

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.060 
instruction book the Haynes manual and
we<00:01:30.560> will<00:01:30.649> begin<00:01:32.710> process<00:01:33.710> is<00:01:33.860> very

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
we will begin process is very

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.960 
we will begin process is very
straightforward<00:01:34.369> this<00:01:36.789> adjuster<00:01:37.789> here

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
straightforward this adjuster here

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.590 
straightforward this adjuster here
should<00:01:38.270> be<00:01:38.500> around<00:01:39.500> about<00:01:39.649> one<00:01:39.830> millimeter

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
should be around about one millimeter

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.490 
should be around about one millimeter
I've<00:01:41.600> got<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.899> correct<00:01:42.229> amounts<00:01:42.619> of<00:01:44.500> flew

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
I've got the correct amounts of flew

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.639 
I've got the correct amounts of flew
freeway<00:01:46.310> in<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.579> throttle<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:48.170> then<00:01:48.320> we<00:01:48.439> must

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
freeway in the throttle and then we must

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.180 
freeway in the throttle and then we must
loosen<00:01:51.100> this<00:01:52.100> little<00:01:52.429> knot<00:01:52.580> here<00:01:52.610> on<00:01:53.030> the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
loosen this little knot here on the

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.109 
loosen this little knot here on the
throttle<00:01:57.130> justice<00:01:58.130> is<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.459> right<00:01:58.759> hand<00:01:58.909> side

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
throttle justice is the right hand side

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.240 
throttle justice is the right hand side
the<00:01:59.959> left-hand<00:02:00.350> side<00:02:00.500> also<00:02:00.709> needs<00:02:01.039> to<00:02:01.159> be

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
the left-hand side also needs to be

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.190 
the left-hand side also needs to be
loosened<00:02:01.369> so<00:02:01.759> that<00:02:01.909> we<00:02:02.000> can<00:02:02.149> adjust<00:02:02.240> them<00:02:02.569> with

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
loosened so that we can adjust them with

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:27.600 
loosened so that we can adjust them with
the<00:02:03.319> engine<00:02:03.590> running

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.010 

right<00:02:28.610> having<00:02:29.030> now<00:02:29.150> adjusted<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:32.020> cable

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
right having now adjusted the cable

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.060 
right having now adjusted the cable
adjuster<00:02:33.410> screw<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:35.890> idle<00:02:36.890> mixture

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
adjuster screw and the idle mixture

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.030 
adjuster screw and the idle mixture
screw<00:02:38.440> have<00:02:39.440> achieved<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.920> result<00:02:40.220> we<00:02:40.310> expect

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
screw have achieved the result we expect

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.520 
screw have achieved the result we expect
so<00:02:43.040> there's<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.250> quick<00:02:43.490> look<00:02:43.640> at<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.850> manometer

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
so there's a quick look at the manometer

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.230 
so there's a quick look at the manometer
first<00:02:45.530> we<00:02:45.680> start<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.010> bike<00:02:48.490> now<00:02:49.490> observe

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
first we start the bike now observe

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.390 
first we start the bike now observe
there's<00:02:50.570> no<00:02:50.690> climbing<00:02:51.200> both<00:02:51.860> levels<00:02:52.220> are<00:02:52.340> the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
there's no climbing both levels are the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.710 
there's no climbing both levels are the
same

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.990 

that's<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.440> homemade

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.890 

$8.00<00:03:03.930> manometer

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:18.110 

we'll<00:03:08.900> call<00:03:09.080> that<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.290> result

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.180 

you
