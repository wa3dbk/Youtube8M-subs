00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.210
 dpa 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.359
 to 05 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:11.359
 Well 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:13.329
 4 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.070
 the streets under water 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.240
 v 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.019
 So that's exactly what happens when cold 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.199
 The tire is constantly being pulled aside, not one because of the pressure 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.869
 Constantly on the one hand, then he rubs off very quickly from 2 and 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.349
 4 the coat has completely stayed through and 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.349
 he complains 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.490
 However, it was very questionable from about 1 6 kilometers long 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.950
 no money anymore 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.810
 before the summer break 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.050
 Christina Weber is b 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.030
 Victor Vasarely will have no benefits years either has shaped them so 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.070
 proud that they have been listening 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.390
 or 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 possibly even direct 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.440
 more 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.380
 because when you join the vors project the percent of 4 4 percent 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.740
 I would be year of unity 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.790
 hardly anywhere it has to be heard for you and also the smell perceived 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.790
 and this small component here is frozen through 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.000
 what should come will be hiss and will now be his word 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.620
 and it could be so we are not sure but it could be 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.580
 that it was because 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.920
 and give the developers connected to the controller and the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.870
 Batteries go 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.060
 and then you take the batteries away then the fight goes and that's easy 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.060
 so he can not hurt if there are no batteries 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.930
 Now it may be that the battery management system needed to 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.640
 Protection of 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.310
 lithium ion batteries 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.530
 upstream 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.290
 because that has sealed 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.130
 then the federal government could demand that the driver cross the line and it could 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.740
 be the cause of this error 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.870
 but not 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.870
 v 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.150
 on
