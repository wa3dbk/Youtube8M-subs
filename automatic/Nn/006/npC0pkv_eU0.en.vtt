using a point 25 diameter nozzle first
starting<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.210> print<00:00:44.950> isn't<00:00:45.950> just<00:00:46.280> challenging

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
starting to print isn't just challenging

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.810 
starting to print isn't just challenging
which<00:00:47.090> I<00:00:47.210> thought<00:00:47.480> but<00:00:47.840> is<00:00:48.770> actually<00:00:49.490> a

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
which I thought but is actually a

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.230 
which I thought but is actually a
mistake<00:00:50.360> so<00:00:52.450> until<00:00:53.450> i<00:00:53.510> get<00:00:53.690> another<00:00:54.910> hot<00:00:55.910> end

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
mistake so until i get another hot end

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.190 
mistake so until i get another hot end
with<00:00:57.230> a<00:00:57.260> point<00:00:57.710> 35<00:00:58.360> nozzle<00:00:59.360> i'm<00:00:59.900> just<00:01:00.050> going<00:01:00.170> to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.110 
with a point 35 nozzle i'm just going to
have<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.410> try<00:01:00.740> and

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
have to try and

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.230 
have to try and
it's<00:01:02.239> gonna<00:01:02.420> hurt<00:01:02.600> nothing<00:01:03.469> really<00:01:03.590> so<00:01:04.479> let<00:01:05.479> me

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
it's gonna hurt nothing really so let me

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.290

clean<00:01:08.240> this<00:01:08.270> business<00:01:09.049> out<00:01:09.229> of<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.590> way

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
clean this business out of the way

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.840 
clean this business out of the way
is<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.870> moment<00:01:12.050> of<00:01:12.200> truth<00:01:12.260> I<00:01:12.800> hit<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.670> print

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
is the moment of truth I hit the print

00:01:13.850 --> 00:02:17.350 
is the moment of truth I hit the print
button<00:01:15.310> three<00:01:16.310> two<00:01:17.060> one<00:01:18.040> print

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.600 

okay<00:02:17.960> as<00:02:19.090> as<00:02:20.290> expected<00:02:21.290> it's<00:02:21.500> not<00:02:21.710> working

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
okay as as expected it's not working

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.590 
okay as as expected it's not working
precisely<00:02:23.060> correct

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.900 

but<00:02:28.200> at<00:02:28.320> least<00:02:28.440> it's<00:02:28.710> behaving<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.460> way<00:02:29.490> that

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
but at least it's behaving in a way that

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.510 
but at least it's behaving in a way that
was<00:02:30.120> print<00:02:30.600> alike<00:02:31.010> so

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.300 

kind<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.360> success

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.100 

I'll<00:02:42.849> let<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.030> go

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
I'll let it go

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.110 
I'll let it go
to<00:02:44.650> have<00:02:44.830> it

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:55.760 

you

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.610 

it's<00:02:56.400> putting<00:02:56.670> down<00:02:56.940> plastic<00:02:56.970> but<00:02:57.900> it's<00:02:58.080> not

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
it's putting down plastic but it's not

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.020 
it's putting down plastic but it's not
putting<00:02:58.950> down<00:02:59.130> in<00:02:59.370> mouth<00:02:59.610> plastic

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
putting down in mouth plastic

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.590 
putting down in mouth plastic
clearly<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:02.959> is

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.160 

I<00:03:05.660> mean<00:03:06.260> it's<00:03:06.410> working<00:03:06.890> it's<00:03:07.870> seems<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.020> be<00:03:09.140> a

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
I mean it's working it's seems to be a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:20.920 
I mean it's working it's seems to be a

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:22.969 
just seems not to be putting down enough

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:29.290 
just seems not to be putting down enough
plastic

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300
