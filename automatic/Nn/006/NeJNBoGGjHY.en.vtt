00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
pretty sure he would eventually take

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.700

over<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.219> family<00:00:35.399> business<00:00:36.059> but<00:00:36.300> he<00:00:36.840> also<00:00:37.110> had

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
over the family business but he also had
