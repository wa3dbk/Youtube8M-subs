got<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.660> balancing<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.469> books<00:00:43.649> at

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
got to be a balancing of the books at

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.180 
got to be a balancing of the books at
some<00:00:44.010> point<00:00:44.520> as<00:00:44.670> well<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.530> but<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> was<00:00:46.829> eager<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
some point as well so but I was eager to

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.950 
some point as well so but I was eager to
-<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.480> move<00:00:49.010> water<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.460> sign<00:00:50.969> straight<00:00:51.750> away

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
- to move water to sign straight away

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.319 
- to move water to sign straight away
but<00:00:52.250> it's<00:00:53.250> obviously<00:00:55.010> as<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.129> say<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:57.149> that

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
but it's obviously as I say think that

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.549 
but it's obviously as I say think that
I'm<00:00:57.420> not<00:00:57.750> quite<00:00:58.260> sure<00:00:58.320> about<00:00:58.530> the<00:01:00.469> with<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
I'm not quite sure about the with the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.260 
I'm not quite sure about the with the
reason<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> delay<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.399> never<00:01:03.059> say

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
reason for the delay but never say

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.660 
reason for the delay but never say
that's<00:01:03.570> all<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> past<00:01:04.049> now<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.470> I'm<00:01:05.430> here

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670

loved every minute of it people could

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.190 
loved every minute of it people could
say<00:02:20.209> that<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.570> know<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:20.720> weren't<00:02:20.959> playing

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
but you know after two years you know

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330 
but you know after two years you know
the<00:02:26.450> constant<00:02:26.810> bill<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.110> general<00:02:27.830> idea

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
the constant bill the the general idea

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.280 
the constant bill the the general idea
people<00:02:29.180> think<00:02:29.510> oh<00:02:29.570> we<00:02:29.660> never<00:02:29.870> played<00:02:30.080> or
