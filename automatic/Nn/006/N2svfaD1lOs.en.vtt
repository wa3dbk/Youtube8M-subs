00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
except for a little monkey puzzle here

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.130 
except for a little monkey puzzle here
and<00:03:46.190> there<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:47.120> must<00:03:47.420> have<00:03:47.600> made<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.810> nice

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
and there it must have made a nice

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.610 
and there it must have made a nice
grazing<00:03:48.770> ground<00:03:49.010> for<00:03:49.220> that<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.700> good<00:03:50.150> diet

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
grazing ground for that a good diet

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.670 
grazing ground for that a good diet
perhaps<00:03:51.620> ferns<00:03:52.070> very<00:03:52.340> similar<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.790> those<00:03:53.060> they

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
perhaps ferns very similar to those they

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.310 
perhaps ferns very similar to those they
must<00:03:54.680> have<00:03:54.800> loved<00:03:55.100> it<00:03:55.690> what<00:03:56.690> I<00:03:56.720> see<00:03:57.020> here<00:03:57.260> is

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
must have loved it what I see here is

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.320 
must have loved it what I see here is
something<00:03:57.860> like<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.760> know<00:03:58.790> if<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.090> have<00:03:59.180> to

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
something like you know if you have to

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.810 
something like you know if you have to
go<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.540> what<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.590> astronauts<00:04:01.010> wanted<00:04:01.550> to<00:04:01.640> find

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
go to what the astronauts wanted to find

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.130 
go to what the astronauts wanted to find
out<00:04:01.910> what<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:02.240> was<00:04:02.300> like<00:04:02.480> to<00:04:02.540> walk<00:04:02.780> on<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.050> moon

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
out what it was like to walk on the moon

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.050 
out what it was like to walk on the moon
so<00:04:03.500> they<00:04:03.620> went<00:04:03.710> to<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.040> Sahara<00:04:04.400> Desert<00:04:04.580> in

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
so they went to the Sahara Desert in

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.880 
so they went to the Sahara Desert in
order<00:04:05.300> to<00:04:05.450> find<00:04:05.780> that<00:04:06.050> environment<00:04:06.710> that

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
order to find that environment that

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.220 
order to find that environment that
evoked<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.340> moon<00:04:07.550> and<00:04:08.060> so<00:04:08.360> here<00:04:08.630> I<00:04:08.810> want<00:04:09.020> to<00:04:09.110> go

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
evoked the moon and so here I want to go

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.350 
evoked the moon and so here I want to go
to<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.440> Jurassic<00:04:09.880> then<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:10.910> would<00:04:11.180> take<00:04:11.330> a

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
to the Jurassic then I would take a

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.180 
to the Jurassic then I would take a
person<00:04:11.840> here<00:04:12.020> to<00:04:12.290> your<00:04:12.410> new<00:04:12.560> caledonia<00:04:13.100> and

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
person here to your new caledonia and

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.680 
person here to your new caledonia and
say<00:04:13.340> son<00:04:14.740> absorb<00:04:15.740> this<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.940> won't<00:04:17.299> be<00:04:17.480> exactly

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
say son absorb this it won't be exactly

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.229 
say son absorb this it won't be exactly
like<00:04:18.170> this<00:04:18.560> but<00:04:18.950> it's<00:04:19.130> going<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:19.489> be<00:04:19.640> a<00:04:19.790> lot

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
like this but it's going to be a lot

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.840 
like this but it's going to be a lot
like<00:04:20.690> it<00:04:20.900> get<00:04:21.380> used<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.890> it<00:04:21.950> because<00:04:22.280> this<00:04:22.640> is

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
like it get used to it because this is

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.120 
like it get used to it because this is

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
the underside of the tail vertebrae we

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:45.339 
the underside of the tail vertebrae we
can<00:05:43.939> say<00:05:44.089> that<00:05:44.239> this<00:05:44.360> animal<00:05:44.599> is<00:05:44.839> a<00:05:44.989> true

can say that this animal is a true

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:47.919 
can say that this animal is a true
sauropod<00:05:45.949> that<00:05:46.909> it<00:05:47.059> is<00:05:47.179> probably<00:05:47.659> the

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.019 
which followed it and which is much
larger<00:05:53.839> it's<00:05:54.829> amazing<00:05:55.159> to<00:05:55.429> think<00:05:55.579> that<00:05:55.849> these

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:56.029 
larger it's amazing to think that these
