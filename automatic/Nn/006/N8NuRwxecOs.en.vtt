00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
polyphonic electric pianos have multiple

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.390 
polyphonic electric pianos have multiple
notes<00:00:18.570> at<00:00:18.750> once<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:19.500> works<00:00:19.800> great

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
notes at once that works great

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.790 
notes at once that works great
there's<00:00:20.609> one<00:00:20.910> note<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.320> little<00:00:22.680> bit

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
there's one note that is a little bit

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.580 
there's one note that is a little bit
dead<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.970> kind<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.269> just<00:00:24.449> has<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> quick

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
dead and that kind of just has a quick

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.380 
dead and that kind of just has a quick
release<00:00:25.800> where's<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.849> others<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.180> more

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
release where's the others have more

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.870 
release where's the others have more
sustain<00:00:29.060> that's<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> only<00:00:30.330> one<00:00:31.730> it<00:00:32.730> sounds

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
sustain that's the only one it sounds

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.490 
sustain that's the only one it sounds
good<00:00:33.239> play<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.690> all<00:00:33.780> together<00:00:33.960> all<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> other

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
good play it all together all the other

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:53.240 
good play it all together all the other
keys<00:00:34.739> work

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.649 

so<00:00:54.250> right<00:00:54.460> now<00:00:54.609> it's<00:00:54.760> on<00:00:54.879> a<00:00:54.909> setting<00:00:55.329> where<00:00:55.479> it

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
so right now it's on a setting where it

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.380 
so right now it's on a setting where it
splits<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.409> the<00:00:57.190> keyboard<00:00:57.609> from<00:00:57.789> this<00:00:58.030> G

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
splits the the keyboard from this G

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.340 
splits the the keyboard from this G
downward<00:00:59.050> as<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.739> sort<00:01:00.129> of<00:01:00.159> bass<00:01:00.369> guitar<00:01:00.789> sound

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
downward as a sort of bass guitar sound

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.969 
downward as a sort of bass guitar sound
and<00:01:02.430> from<00:01:03.430> that<00:01:03.549> G<00:01:03.820> upward<00:01:04.269> it<00:01:04.390> has<00:01:04.570> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
and from that G upward it has the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.170 
and from that G upward it has the
supposed<00:01:05.979> pianos<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.920> looks<00:01:09.189> like<00:01:09.399> the<00:01:09.820> piano

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
supposed pianos it looks like the piano

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.810 
supposed pianos it looks like the piano
as<00:01:10.270> we<00:01:10.420> know<00:01:10.600> it<00:01:11.159> then<00:01:12.159> when<00:01:12.369> you<00:01:12.460> switch<00:01:12.640> it<00:01:12.789> to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
as we know it then when you switch it to

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.690 
as we know it then when you switch it to
piano<00:01:13.240> then<00:01:13.539> the<00:01:13.630> whole<00:01:13.780> thing<00:01:13.990> becomes<00:01:14.700> that

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
piano then the whole thing becomes that

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.910 
piano then the whole thing becomes that
sound

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
sound

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.310 
sound
so<00:01:17.760> I'll<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.060> see<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.810> base<00:01:19.020> here

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
so I'll just see the the base here

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:34.340 
so I'll just see the the base here
version<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.920> what's<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.580> up<00:01:20.700> here

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.569 

so<00:01:35.350> that's<00:01:35.500> sort<00:01:35.649> of<00:01:35.740> what<00:01:35.950> that<00:01:36.070> sounds<00:01:36.460> like

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
so that's sort of what that sounds like

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.030 
so that's sort of what that sounds like
there<00:01:36.990> I've<00:01:37.990> got<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.170> few<00:01:38.409> different<00:01:38.530> settings

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
there I've got a few different settings

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.700 
there I've got a few different settings
so<00:01:39.189> obviously<00:01:39.490> between<00:01:39.790> piano<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:40.960> bass<00:01:41.380> you

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
so obviously between piano and bass you

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.679 
so obviously between piano and bass you
can<00:01:41.860> you<00:01:42.130> can<00:01:42.280> turn<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:42.970> fader<00:01:43.180> up<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:43.539> when

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
can you can turn the fader up so when

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.749 
can you can turn the fader up so when
you<00:01:43.780> have<00:01:43.930> it<00:01:44.049> in<00:01:44.110> that<00:01:44.200> mode<00:01:44.439> if<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.340> bass<00:01:45.549> is

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
you have it in that mode if the bass is

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.880 
you have it in that mode if the bass is
a<00:01:45.789> bit<00:01:45.970> loud<00:01:46.180> you<00:01:46.899> can<00:01:47.020> pull<00:01:47.200> that<00:01:47.229> down<00:01:47.530> while

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
a bit loud you can pull that down while

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.710 
a bit loud you can pull that down while
the<00:01:48.039> stays<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.700> same<00:01:48.729> I<00:01:49.060> can<00:01:49.090> pull<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.450> piano

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
the stays the same I can pull the piano

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.960 
the stays the same I can pull the piano
down<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:51.580> bass<00:01:51.729> up<00:01:53.429> this<00:01:54.429> is<00:01:54.580> a<00:01:54.610> harpsichord

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
down the bass up this is a harpsichord

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.669 
down the bass up this is a harpsichord
setting<00:01:55.659> which<00:01:55.750> preneur<00:01:56.020> which<00:01:56.110> just<00:01:56.259> adds<00:01:56.439> a

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
setting which preneur which just adds a

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.840 
setting which preneur which just adds a
lot<00:01:56.799> of<00:01:56.860> brightness<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.610> keys<00:01:59.130> which<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.789> a

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
lot of brightness the keys which is a

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.700 
lot of brightness the keys which is a
pretty<00:02:01.119> cool<00:02:01.299> sound<00:02:01.509> that<00:02:01.810> actually<00:02:02.350> blends

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
pretty cool sound that actually blends

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:14.380 
pretty cool sound that actually blends
with<00:02:03.189> the<00:02:03.220> piano<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:03.939> bass

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.339 

so<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.450> can<00:02:15.569> see<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.750> lot<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.080> potential

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
so you can see a lot of the potential

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.720 
so you can see a lot of the potential
that<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.680> has<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:18.840> can<00:02:19.770> sound<00:02:19.950> pretty<00:02:20.250> plain<00:02:20.520> on

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
that it has it can sound pretty plain on

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.930 
that it has it can sound pretty plain on
its<00:02:20.880> own<00:02:21.030> but<00:02:21.330> running<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.020> into<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> guitar<00:02:22.410> amp

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
its own but running it into a guitar amp

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.390 
its own but running it into a guitar amp
you've<00:02:23.940> got<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.209> choice<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.569> reverb<00:02:25.400> whatever

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
you've got the choice of reverb whatever

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.800 
you've got the choice of reverb whatever
sort<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.700> effects<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.180> have<00:02:27.209> in<00:02:27.450> your<00:02:27.569> pedal

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
sort of effects you have in your pedal

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.990 
sort of effects you have in your pedal
board<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.709> other<00:02:28.830> effect<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.459> has<00:02:29.610> here

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
board the other effect that it has here

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.199 
board the other effect that it has here
is<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.690> sort<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.260> vibrato<00:02:31.709> speed<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.760> intensity

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
is a sort of vibrato speed and intensity

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:51.990 
is a sort of vibrato speed and intensity
that<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.720> can<00:02:33.930> just

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.580 

since<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.480> last<00:02:53.660> little<00:02:53.990> fader<00:02:54.290> here

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
since it and the last little fader here

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:10.180 
since it and the last little fader here
is<00:02:54.740> a<00:02:54.770> slide<00:03:07.989> shows<00:03:08.989> your<00:03:09.200> little<00:03:09.470> start<00:03:09.920> or

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
is a slide shows your little start or

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.660 
is a slide shows your little start or
flight<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.940> can<00:03:11.060> adjust<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:11.360> that<00:03:11.510> way<00:03:11.660> just

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
flight you can adjust it that way just

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.410 
flight you can adjust it that way just
about<00:03:13.670> covers<00:03:14.090> it

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
about covers it
