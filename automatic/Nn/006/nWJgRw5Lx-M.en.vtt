approximately 20 inches long and I

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.950 
approximately 20 inches long and I
folded<00:01:22.420> it<00:01:22.570> in<00:01:22.720> half

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
folded it in half

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.100 
folded it in half
and<00:01:23.440> I<00:01:23.560> placed<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.370> bead<00:01:24.550> on<00:01:24.790> there<00:01:25.090> okay

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
and I placed the bead on there okay

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.080 
and I placed the bead on there okay

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.790 
naved marker doesn't have to be black
just<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.280> marker<00:01:30.610> we're<00:01:31.540> going<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:31.930> wind<00:01:32.320> our

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
just a marker we're going to wind our

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.960 
just a marker we're going to wind our
wire<00:01:33.310> around<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:35.250> marker<00:01:36.250> we're<00:01:36.550> going<00:01:36.820> to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
wire around this marker we're going to

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.920 
wire around this marker we're going to
go<00:01:37.440> around<00:01:38.440> in<00:01:39.130> one<00:01:39.520> direction<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.240> then

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
here's what you have we have the wire we

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.399 
here's what you have we have the wire we
have<00:01:47.950> two<00:01:48.820> layers<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.240> wire<00:01:49.600> here<00:01:49.900> we<00:01:50.110> have<00:01:50.260> two

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
have two layers of wire here we have two

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.550 
have two layers of wire here we have two
bead<00:01:50.590> on<00:01:50.770> top<00:01:50.799> and<00:01:51.430> we<00:01:51.909> have<00:01:51.940> two<00:01:52.330> long<00:01:53.049> lengths

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
bead on top and we have two long lengths

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.590 
bead on top and we have two long lengths
extending<00:01:54.190> upward<00:01:54.670> okay<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:57.240> now<00:01:58.240> we're<00:01:58.450> going

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
extending upward okay so now we're going

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.960 
extending upward okay so now we're going
to<00:01:58.720> wind<00:01:59.049> these<00:01:59.619> wires<00:01:59.950> around<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.760> base<00:02:00.940> of

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
to wind these wires around the base of

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.350 
to wind these wires around the base of
the<00:02:01.180> bead<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:01.780> we're<00:02:01.960> going<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.200> take<00:02:02.440> one<00:02:02.799> wire

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the bead so we're going to take one wire

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.440 
the bead so we're going to take one wire
and<00:02:04.360> we're<00:02:04.479> going<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.780> go<00:02:04.990> around<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:06.549> we're

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
and we're going to go around and we're

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.719 
and we're going to go around and we're
going<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.690> have<00:02:07.960> an<00:02:08.200> end<00:02:08.709> sticking<00:02:09.129> out<00:02:09.429> here

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
going to have an end sticking out here

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.839 
going to have an end sticking out here
okay<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.650> we<00:02:11.860> went<00:02:12.040> around<00:02:12.430> in<00:02:12.700> that

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
okay and so we went around in that

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.449 
okay and so we went around in that
direction<00:02:13.200> with<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.409> wire<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:15.189> one

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
direction with that wire so this one

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.179 
direction with that wire so this one
will<00:02:16.120> go<00:02:16.269> in<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.720> opposite<00:02:17.230> direction<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:18.069> we

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
will go in the opposite direction so we

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.820 
will go in the opposite direction so we
went<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.640> way<00:02:18.909> so<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:19.870> one<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.319> going<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.620> go

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
went this way so this one is going to go

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.900 
went this way so this one is going to go
this

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
this

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
this
okay<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:25.110> again<00:02:25.430> we<00:02:26.430> end<00:02:26.640> with<00:02:27.420> one<00:02:27.690> wire

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
okay and again we end with one wire

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.400 
okay and again we end with one wire
sticking<00:02:28.350> out<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:30.420> now<00:02:30.600> we<00:02:30.660> can<00:02:30.900> take<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.110> off

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
sticking out so now we can take it off

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.100 
sticking out so now we can take it off
of<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.250> marker<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.000> here's<00:02:33.300> what<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.660> looks

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
of the marker and here's what it looks

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.960 
of the marker and here's what it looks
like<00:02:36.110> okay<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:38.280> now<00:02:38.460> you're<00:02:38.580> going<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.790> need

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.300 
like okay so now you're going to need
your<00:02:39.150> pliers<00:02:39.440> I'm<00:02:40.440> gonna<00:02:40.590> take<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.040> end

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
your pliers I'm gonna take this end

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.580 
your pliers I'm gonna take this end
we're<00:02:42.240> going<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.630> wind<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.170> around<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:44.580> ring

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
we're going to wind it around the ring

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.170 
we're going to wind it around the ring
so<00:02:46.590> let's<00:02:46.830> see<00:02:47.070> if<00:02:47.220> we<00:02:47.400> can<00:02:47.580> do<00:02:49.400> three<00:02:50.400> times<00:02:50.670> we

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
so let's see if we can do three times we

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.600 
so let's see if we can do three times we
probably<00:02:51.480> can<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.970> what<00:02:54.150> I'm<00:02:54.330> aiming<00:02:54.870> for<00:02:55.610> is

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
probably can and what I'm aiming for is

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.600 
probably can and what I'm aiming for is
I<00:02:57.000> want<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.510> end<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.590> right<00:02:58.770> of<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.220> wire

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
I want the end of the right of the wire

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.110 
I want the end of the right of the wire
to<00:02:59.640> end<00:03:00.150> on<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.480> inside<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.980> ring<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:03.090> that

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
to end on the inside of the ring so that

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.960 
to end on the inside of the ring so that
it<00:03:03.330> doesn't<00:03:03.660> catch<00:03:03.840> on<00:03:04.140> anything<00:03:04.200> or<00:03:05.010> it's<00:03:05.850> not

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
it doesn't catch on anything or it's not

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.150 
it doesn't catch on anything or it's not
necessary<00:03:06.690> but<00:03:06.990> I<00:03:07.020> just<00:03:07.260> find<00:03:07.500> it's<00:03:07.770> better<00:03:08.040> if

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
necessary but I just find it's better if

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.230 
necessary but I just find it's better if
you<00:03:08.250> do<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.490> that<00:03:08.640> way<00:03:10.040> okay<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.580> says<00:03:11.910> let<00:03:12.150> me

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
you do it that way okay that says let me

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.590 
you do it that way okay that says let me
check<00:03:12.530> nope<00:03:13.530> it's<00:03:13.860> fine<00:03:14.100> nothing<00:03:14.670> sharp<00:03:14.970> okay

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
check nope it's fine nothing sharp okay
