00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.180
 and for that everyone accumulate a scrap the piece of employment that I extract today 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.649
 Claudio Pizarro to inaugurate 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:16.740
 em good to continue the saga I had done standing for novices here 

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.719
 was the episode euros is pretty much abandoned up there to trumpet the 

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:20.579
 he resumed 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.989
 we have heeded these requests about the rest 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.050
 and good first of all use them peace 12 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.599
 mh a 52 1 tail with blades 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.890
 but see devote to comment the support to see em 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.970
 here as the right says we choose the same eleven from the closer and we are taking 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.700
 the flag must 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.229
 and we have killed the enemies of the birds 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:48.089
 how this is affected to its fundos of respomuso important chaos with this partner 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.850
 as you start to walk with a rapidity since according to your advanced the first 

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:52.460
 time 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.460
 we have today those points of remains as you see there 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.120
 that you have to keep them in mind because 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.930
 If you get caught at 13 restaurant point p you let yourself go to port you can appear 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.610
 like 4 5 what it turns out that this one was in leave there 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.000
 caught and punctually soon in a non-pure act 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.479
 so you have to have them or well controlled if the day indicated as 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.120
 good between these myths of the game 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.170
 when it seems appropriate, go like garlic going to the skull when you think it is appropriate 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.870
 hundred as new how it has evolved from a perspective a 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:26.899
 plane aerial 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.840
 percent growing scraping 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.070
 it is very important and above all 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.750
 that is to say, this this diego this sixth kid finding out has been since 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.160
 in my personal experience in the game 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.010
 so at no time has not been undertaken any cold and that is all 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.800
 one hundred percent 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.030
 I want you to be doing it seems silly 3 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.760
 she dragged all those who have been escaping reappearing a little more 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.660
 To who 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.660
 tilted in in this district 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.260
 why then because if you set a pantry you can stick it in the flag of 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.370
 antinoise we want that we want to leave them locked in 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.450
 the display what yes I owe my work dress the top 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.480
 I am like gathering all those who have been appearing then good 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.819
 part of the agency 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.159
 and then the oco we will see how if we put a flag efe that 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:23.020
 I answer the ones that I could seem like, the enemy could 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.400
 important is to grow the radar the points right now are strengthening 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.140
 there and this even if we did not have the radar we could find out why 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.920
 We did not understand those flags they know they can father and how we have building 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.779
 front cd that blackboard plot and all in the square 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:41.339
 Iran will often appear in the building was just opposite is just 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:44.219
 and the alley behind also frequent cracking so beware of 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.559
 those the point is of spill state 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:52.290
 you have to be careful with them and braque colton under country concello 2 the 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:57.029
 dogs and here we are already with the run practically assured 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.749
 by the way they were unfortunately captured us of what else is going 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:01.399
 do 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:05.819
 that the restaurant is dispersed and also cost us the flag of 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.619
 let us amd have recovered 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:12.459
 so good seventh progressing here already commented again 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.179
 no view like this until the end of the game a general list about everything 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:20.499
 as how the cell phase gas that took the 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:24.349
 crossbow 1 an excellent long weapon I love the crossbow 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:29.529
 i know you know that i had to do with chávez in joop jil toma 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:33.689
 they take me in the b was taken under far good and here we continue with the 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:38.509
 peace the moment as saverio stick the main points of spam eae that 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.880
 cover so that the wounded allied waves can catch the flag of ee d 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.249
 because it is to capture two flags is what allows you to do 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:48.730
 and catch them in the respawn response 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.689
 then how do you get with this 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:56.099
 so very simple what you are going to get base to catch the flag from 0 to 20 and 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.569
 as well as you see in the tour help in the penis team is that enduring so that 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.359
 my team can enter the house is 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.849
 I saw a zone back so that the rest is not this part because I am in 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.810
 a reference here then I'm getting into those areas 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.369
 so they can not strengthen those enemies 

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:14.869
 this approach you how I made myself commented I think that someone in a team enters into that 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:15.410
 zone 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.260
 I go back first to cover myself and then for the responsible 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.640
 be in these places as I've seen before it can seem where you are 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.259
 take 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.210
 area that was killed him and a couple of three thousand like bis with this one 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.169
 I went back to do a round in which 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.740
 I've gone back to catch the people of bulls that have been left behind and we return 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.080
 again to the same doctoral all the time the same before here Jorge is 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.059
 all controlled 

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:44.239
 I got that the rest is conrado efe percent Scotland of the gv and here 

00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:49.309
 as a neighbor are all together this told us reference before will be present 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:50.599
 today in the square where I 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.869
 in which he concluded the domestic prices in which the left in 

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:58.560
 where they can appear so much with the captured flags can 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:00.729
 possible that it reappears if we are all to do 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.690
 another part of the adam fund disappeared since the game started or 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:09.069
 you can also repair the building where I am now in the 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.069
 alley behind is very frequent merchants in this area 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.349
 but if they really are going to disappear or to oviedo efe because this team 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.229
 tricks generally if tennis player 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.240
 capture the flag that you have to take that who the enemies effect is 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.490
 to take it will cost a lot before we always put as three or four times 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.040
 hundred 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.070
 the ally is to take that flag so he exhorted there may be two in 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.349
 flagged the part of the cuckoo store apparently the 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:38.400
 the area of ​​the waiter where there are fewer people 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.070
 this is the same as in hard for teams the same thing happens completely the same 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.009
 that we have three flags 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.770
 the process is practically the same 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.610
 the restoration points in the first people is to say where less 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.999
 Teammates 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:55.189
 is where to reappear if I had in mind what are the points you 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:57.309
 I answer then to those who like 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:01.309
 a few on the map I did more than if we are on another tip of the map manna 

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:04.830
 reappear it exposed in the opposite corner so this facilitates us 

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:08.059
 quite drunk when he is not there he answers my son but well this is all 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:12.339
 you go shopping tic has played many games finding out that they kill you for the 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:17.619
 back and week will be seems here for that after hitting iraida to good 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:20.990
 Be attentive to do more things that can happen 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.050
 and here we are 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.659
 having to act the three flags is certain command on maps and once 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:27.330
 He tried to direct my team 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.780
 i right now amatlan dc and what do I let you capture the flag 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.979
 so that afterwards we simply have to capture the flag 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.029
 so that they have the backing and limos we are going to close them I come out quite useful 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:43.349
 and here metro the track expressing titled time to capture the performance 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:44.979
 fallero a failure of mine 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.580
 but hey we are again as it says that you alleyways tequesta that 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.990
 they look on the right 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.640
 that's what it says and what served to come here miser seemed a lot 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:54.819
 more people 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:58.219
 between these areas and what good has been something that I thought 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:04.580
 timely they say that all the movements that their career and that with 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.289
 the practice we all perform 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:10.599
 in the fates we consciously do and that's the good thing because 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:14.969
 little by little we learn to see them point of reason according to here we will see how 

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:18.330
 if the motion of this part of the game as you see 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.969
 here we had the three flags then 

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:23.490
 the backup points are where 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.490
 green points rafa is accusing the opposite corner red dots 

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.849
 so this what allows us 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:31.819
 is to have then as 

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:34.129
 just as he responds hard for teams 

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:37.490
 and in the majority of votes a good pass has been motor we have three flags of 

00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:38.289
 a substitute 

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:41.289
 what will it be to have a careful intern 

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:44.119
 i good this month as 

00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:46.830
 n Low enemy pressure insured 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.830
 indispensable to know that yes maybe a good departure 

00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:54.519
 then this appeared quite interesting to share with you 

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:57.809
 but already arrived with much avidity that you see tennis that play it play 

00:07:57.809 --> 00:08:00.569
 games is to take it into account 

00:08:00.569 --> 00:08:04.699
 and already after having failed and anything any question the 

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:07.830
 iss question and here I am to answer them 

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.540
 always when the public television series by the way I hope that I have 

00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:13.599
 liked - in the next he greeted us
