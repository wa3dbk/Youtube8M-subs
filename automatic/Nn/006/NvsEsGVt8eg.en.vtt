00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.699
 Hello everyone, Ilya will show you today 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.660
 as the next lamp shines with the effect 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.150
 under xenon 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.060
 because the guys in the group asked 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.250
 thrown on yu tuba show how such 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.490
 the lamp will shine that is against 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:35.880
 ordinary lamp which is the same 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:43.010
 100 to 20 thousand lamps lamp looks like this 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.010
 so here with such a lamp base goes 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.239
 that is, the lamp marking is either 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.730
 b35 either 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:02.300
 b from 20 to this two identical currents to 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:07.229
 so today we will test 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:11.040
 ordinary pear against stripes 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.610
 how are the bones there but let 's take this 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.610
 here's the lamp 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:25.270
 let's start the usual light bulb first 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:34.240
 let's see how it shines so try for 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:44.370
 start brown it shines our 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:44.370
 ordinary bulb pear dipped beam 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:58.039
 it was a pear that is in the light with 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:06.280
 turn off the lights like this 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:06.280
 It turns out that this is what I was talking about in a 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.299
 20d 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:26.510
 at the bottom of the marking is fine base 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:33.640
 the appearance of the cap is different that is 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.640
 if you look here mustache here is mustache 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:44.320
 that is, the same cicada but if 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.320
 look almost like this 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.170
 everyone knew what kind of halogen glass 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:01.860
 bulbs can not be taken because either 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.959
 the bubble burns or inflates right on 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:14.190
 glass such cases were so try 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:17.030
 daylight look shines then 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.030
 there is if you look at the table 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.030
 it is seen 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:36.200
 what appears blue 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:36.200
 that is actually a lamp a lamp is bright and 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:57.590
 noticeably big difference in coverage 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:59.989
 in general, it was two of such a lamp 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.639
