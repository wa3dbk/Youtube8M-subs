of all you have to become a nurse so if

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.740 
of all you have to become a nurse so if

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
you're a high school graduate you have

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.109 
you're a high school graduate you have
to<00:01:09.869> enroll<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.650> nursing<00:01:11.100> school<00:01:11.490> program

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
to enroll in a nursing school program

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
now there are options with that also so

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.550 
now there are options with that also so
there<00:01:14.880> are<00:01:15.060> three<00:01:15.479> year<00:01:15.659> programs<00:01:16.140> there<00:01:16.530> are

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
there are three year programs there are

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.460 
there are three year programs there are
four-year<00:01:17.070> programs<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:18.570> your<00:01:18.750> best<00:01:18.960> bet<00:01:19.110> is

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
four-year programs but your best bet is

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.140 
four-year programs but your best bet is
to<00:01:19.710> make<00:01:19.890> sure<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.400> when<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.700> finish<00:01:20.970> with

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
to make sure that when you finish with

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.530 
to make sure that when you finish with
nursing<00:01:21.570> school<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:22.950> your<00:01:23.250> BSN<00:01:24.090> your

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
nursing school you have your BSN your

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.950 
nursing school you have your BSN your
bachelor<00:01:24.990> degrees<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.680> science<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.610> nursing

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
bachelor degrees in science and nursing

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.289 
bachelor degrees in science and nursing
so<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.409> typically<00:01:28.890> three<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.610> four<00:01:29.909> years

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
so that is typically three to four years

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.090 
so that is typically three to four years
definitely<00:01:30.930> four<00:01:31.229> years<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.860> go<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.040> a

definitely four years if you go to a
four-year<00:01:32.460> college<00:01:32.990> once<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.380> then

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
four-year college once you do that then

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.190

unit<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.739> your<00:02:37.980> school<00:02:38.250> might<00:02:38.430> consider

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
unit and your school might consider

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.380 
unit and your school might consider
other<00:02:39.239> areas<00:02:39.750> as<00:02:39.959> well<00:02:40.100> so<00:02:41.100> first<00:02:41.850> look<00:02:42.180> into

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
other areas as well so first look into

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.360 
other areas as well so first look into
the<00:02:42.600> schools<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.620> you're<00:02:43.770> interested<00:02:44.070> in

the schools that you're interested in

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.430 
the schools that you're interested in

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
and see what their prerequisites are for

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.790 
and see what their prerequisites are for
critical<00:02:47.010> care<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:48.420> usually<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:49.050> year

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
critical care and it's usually a year

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.520 
critical care and it's usually a year
experience<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.850> then<00:02:51.810> once<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.170> choose<00:02:52.470> your

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
experience and then once you choose your

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.270 
experience and then once you choose your
school<00:02:53.600> they<00:02:54.600> will<00:02:54.780> always<00:02:55.019> ask<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.800> for

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
letters of reference so you line that up

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.059 
letters of reference so you line that up
with<00:02:58.560> physicians<00:02:59.130> peers<00:03:00.319> your<00:03:01.319> managers

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
and even instructors in schools so

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.820 
and even instructors in schools so
letters<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:06.060> references<00:03:06.540> are<00:03:06.690> important<00:03:07.170> your

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
letters of references are important your

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.759 
letters of references are important your
resume<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.459> definitely<00:03:08.910> important<00:03:09.360> and

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
resume is definitely important and

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.699 
resume is definitely important and
actually<00:03:10.769> being<00:03:10.980> certified<00:03:11.370> in<00:03:11.700> ACLS<00:03:12.269> PALS

actually being certified in ACLS PALS

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.310 
actually being certified in ACLS PALS
and<00:03:13.709> be<00:03:13.890> CLS<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.580> probably<00:03:15.300> also<00:03:15.510> very<00:03:15.900> helpful

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
and be CLS is probably also very helpful

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.930 
and be CLS is probably also very helpful
it<00:03:16.410> is<00:03:16.530> competitive<00:03:17.010> getting<00:03:17.549> into<00:03:17.790> these

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
it is competitive getting into these

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.120 
it is competitive getting into these
schools<00:03:18.239> so<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.049> really<00:03:19.380> have<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.769> be<00:03:19.890> at<00:03:20.010> the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
schools so you really have to be at the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.080 
schools so you really have to be at the
cutting<00:03:20.340> edge<00:03:20.640> on<00:03:21.060> your<00:03:21.420> resume<00:03:22.790> they'll<00:03:23.790> ask

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
you for your grades from school so you

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.509 
you for your grades from school so you
know<00:03:28.019> just<00:03:28.260> by<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.860> fact<00:03:29.160> that<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.489> are

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
know just by the fact that you are

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.759 
know just by the fact that you are
registered<00:03:30.000> nurse<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:31.230> means<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.650> you've

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
registered nurse it means that you've

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.970 
registered nurse it means that you've
probably<00:03:32.280> did<00:03:32.640> pretty<00:03:32.850> well<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:33.120> school<00:03:33.540> so

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
probably did pretty well in school so

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.800 
probably did pretty well in school so
you<00:03:34.980> know<00:03:35.100> you're<00:03:35.310> probably<00:03:35.579> will<00:03:36.420> meet<00:03:36.660> the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
you know you're probably will meet the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.199 
you know you're probably will meet the
requirements<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.560> get<00:03:37.799> into<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.370> into<00:03:38.820> the

requirements to get into it into the

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.539 
requirements to get into it into the
program<00:03:39.560> but<00:03:40.560> there's<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:40.980> competitive

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
program but there's the competitive

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.370 
program but there's the competitive
aspect<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.239> other<00:03:42.420> nurses<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:42.989> are<00:03:43.140> trying

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
aspect and other nurses that are trying

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.349 
aspect and other nurses that are trying
to<00:03:43.590> get<00:03:43.709> in<00:03:43.920> right<00:03:44.700> now<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.209> very

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
to get in right now it is very

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.110 
to get in right now it is very
competitive<00:03:45.810> but<00:03:46.440> there<00:03:46.680> are<00:03:46.970> quite<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.000> few

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
competitive but there are quite a few

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.210 
competitive but there are quite a few
schools<00:03:48.840> in<00:03:49.829> in<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:51.209> areas<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:51.920> offer<00:03:52.920> this

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
schools in in the areas that offer this

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.860 
schools in in the areas that offer this
program<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.180> think<00:03:54.570> they<00:03:54.720> are

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
program to you I think they are

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.750 
program to you I think they are
expanding<00:03:55.290> as<00:03:55.590> well<00:03:55.769> because<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.100> is<00:03:56.130> becoming

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
expanding as well because it is becoming

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.840 
expanding as well because it is becoming
a<00:03:56.910> very<00:03:57.510> popular<00:03:58.109> field<00:03:58.380> perhaps<00:03:59.190> because<00:03:59.730> it

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
a very popular field perhaps because it

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.599 
a very popular field perhaps because it
is<00:03:59.970> advanced<00:04:00.480> practice<00:04:01.019> nursing<00:04:01.609> perhaps

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
is advanced practice nursing perhaps

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.979 
is advanced practice nursing perhaps
because<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.390> can<00:04:03.660> make<00:04:04.079> up<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.440> $200<00:04:05.310> an<00:04:05.430> hour

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
because you can make up to $200 an hour

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.120 
because you can make up to $200 an hour
which<00:04:06.989> you<00:04:07.350> know<00:04:07.470> leaves<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:07.799> with<00:04:07.920> a<00:04:07.980> very
