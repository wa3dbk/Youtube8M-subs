00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.520
 Good day 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.020
 I want to present you a small review on 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.710
 armored warfare 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.770
 This is a new tank online shooter which is not 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.689
 is another copy of the world of tanks 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.860
 Well, at least as we were promised 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.540
 developers similarity not found 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.700
 development of the game as a whole is engaged 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.950
 obsidian entertainment 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.980
 if anyone is not aware of obsidian this 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.399
 the legendary studio has created such hits 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.829
 how to fallout new vegas &amp; sounds park 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.120
 general studios specialize in 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.190
 mostly role-playing games 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.929
 minus happily agreed to 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.390
 mail.ru offer 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:55.690
 create a cool frituley shooter pro 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.159
 funky but in russia the game localizes 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.100
 mail.ru company 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.079
 however sad it may sound but everything 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.720
 understand what I'm doing this 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.750
 at the moment the game is on 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.130
 zbt stages and get there well well not 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.060
 is labor 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.660
 since there is a massive distribution of keys 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.050
 armored warfare 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.300
 running on the edge engine and so i'm not 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.940
 I think that we should doubt 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.520
 excellent drawing details of the game world 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.670
 well and awesome destroy and from 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.360
 neutral objects all actions 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.530
 occur 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.810
 our days well, and in the game you will find the technique 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.240
 since the 50s and up to the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.000
 modern innovations created based on 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.360
 real models with many modifications 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.490
 but there is one but some tank 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.740
 still had to donate for 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.820
 achieve maximum balance 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.820
 for example a car like fv215b 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.240
 which is well so loved by many fans in 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.150
 world of tanks will not be implemented in 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.790
 gameplay since its 183 millimeter 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.240
 the gun can on the press break the balance in 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.910
 the world from drum tanks also had to 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.430
 refuse but the creators promised 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.370
 maintain maximum confidence 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.439
 all classified drawings never 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.109
 implemented in real life fine 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.980
 also the developers mentioned the award 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:24.249
 smart machines 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.999
 promising not to do it to them other Beauvais 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:30.480
 tanks of the same one as you already understood 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:33.400
 tanks in the game can be pumped 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.180
 leveling armored warfare will be that 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.030
 called 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.730
 historical it reflects the stages of development 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.719
 of a tank since its inception 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.700
 adopting and to this day in 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.819
 the game you will not find alike 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.349
 cards each card in the game is 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:54.249
 unique and has its military 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:56.709
 atmosphere and even the weather conditions 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:59.109
 who bored battle in PvP can 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.139
 try yourself on my mission what 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.859
 It helps relax as friends so 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.489
 and in the salon 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:08.499
 well, or just take a break from pvp content 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.840
 well time we touched upon let's cut 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:13.810
 analyze the main features of this 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.569
 aspects are teams of four five 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.409
 players is the ability to play platoons 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.599
 or battalion different levels of difficulty 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:25.810
 contracts for three special operations in each 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.060
 contract division of tasks on the main 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.840
 and secondary 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.050
 individual 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.660
 activity levels of opponents and different 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.200
 types of combat missions hold capture and so 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.190
 Further, in the armored warfare added 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.040
 clan system 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.370
 that foreshadows clan battles and 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.680
 adds a lot of epic to the game 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.989
 pretty good balancer teams which 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.140
 will collect from players available to 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.629
 background balance will be respected not only 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.420
 by classes and levels but by rating 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.980
 players visa free games scheduled for 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.349
