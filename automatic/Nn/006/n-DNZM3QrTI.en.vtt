 People who go to pachinko while receiving this life protection 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.990
 Masu Tei Ue 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:47.790
 This cost of living is living in a book today 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:49.260
 The whole nation is spending money a little at a time, the country collects money and spends it for those who are in trouble in life 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.330
 It is for getting 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.400
 this 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.680
 It is a thing that should not exist originally to be used for pachinko 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.830
 I just 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.270
 Receiving welfare 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.930
 Losing you all is still that money 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.020
 Important money 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:14.170
 I really understand the feeling that I put it in a pachinko 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:20.020
 Money I thought I would never spend 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:21.840
 Put money on pachinko from money or other important people. 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.720
 I have experienced 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:33.780
 There are terribly strong one because so pachinko of magic 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.920
 So not only welfare be an experience you've used everyone's various money also 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.709
 May 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.520
 Using sanitization of husband and wife which we saved for supporting expenses of child who used the cost of living 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.780
 Oops 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.550
 I tried to buy what I wanted, and I used my best effort to eat the stored chopsticks 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.290
 I got somebody from 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:56.400
 You may have experience say Kaso and I spent a large Iwai of money 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:01.409
 What I think is important to convey to everyone 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.890
 It means that life can not always be happy alone 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:09.520
 Artwor 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:11.860
 I can not be happy alone I live alone on an uninhabited island and get rich there happily 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:18.130
 You can not live in 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:21.240
 So we decided to quit pachinko from now on and decided to quit pachinko 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.630
 Anyone if you do not have there to be 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:31.170
 People you can trust and friends 9 friends 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:37.710
 Absolutely accustomed to is we are happy if you do not nobody from that friend who yearning of yourself 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:39.150
 No, and I think I will go back to pachinko to comfort myself again 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.230
 Until now 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.209
 Resulting in a pachinko in even if life protection 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:50.349
 Those who have had previous experience who have spent valuable money 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.730
 I also of course so that I want to say against such a person is 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.959
 3 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.030
 Trust relationship with people around prefecture 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.310
 this 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.790
 You must not betray it 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.460
 If you think there is something to come up with 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.480
 What to do is not to go back to the past 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.830
 from now on 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:14.510
 Let's think about what to do and what to do 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:21.610
 Even if you do not have the money, let's do the other party feel the value 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:23.030
 People who think that everything is good are animals that can not live without help 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.500
 We 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.330
 I have the right to get help + 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:36.870
 You can get it, but we also got help 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.639
 Rather than trying to do When you return from you debt do to be raised to help someone can be your gold 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.520
 The 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.520
 Think about what you can do now 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:52.150
 That who are willing something to the other party 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:56.380
 In doing what I think that the other party is bothersome 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:05:04.200
 By only get given it will change to the side that gives no 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:07.860
 One's life regains its radiance again One's living meaning or one's fulfilling feeling 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:11.160
 Your own existence value will come to feel this 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:17.310
 A really small step is important 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:23.249
 Even if you hear this story, I think your life will change a little 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:28.560
 What can we do for people ? Is there anything we can do for ourselves ? 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:33.240
 Yes , the human brain has a great power just by asking the head 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:39.040
 I will always find out the answer and tell you 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:41.009
 Doing it is really the first step in changing our lives 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.749
 By all means right now 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:49.990
 Ask your heart to your head 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:52.340
 I that I can do for others 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.720

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.409
