00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
that's copying I can minimize this is

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:47.590 
that's copying I can minimize this is
like<00:04:29.570> this<00:04:44.830> yeah<00:04:45.850> now<00:04:46.850> that<00:04:46.910> that's<00:04:47.150> copy<00:04:47.390> you

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
like this yeah now that that's copy you

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
like this yeah now that that's copy you
can<00:04:47.780> exit<00:04:48.080> this<00:04:48.230> now<00:04:49.810> and<00:04:50.810> then<00:04:51.170> go<00:04:51.320> to<00:04:51.350> flight

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
can exit this now and then go to flight

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.640 
can exit this now and then go to flight
similar

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:05.960 

then<00:04:59.310> change<00:04:59.639> our<00:04:59.820> curve

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970

change<00:05:06.970> that

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:51.230 

then<00:05:33.310> go<00:05:33.460> to<00:05:33.520> publisher<00:05:35.280> good<00:05:36.280> unknown
