00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
proactively and this changes that we're

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.370 
proactively and this changes that we're
the<00:01:50.760> ones<00:01:50.910> that<00:01:51.240> act<00:01:51.510> like<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> buffer<00:01:52.230> and

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the ones that act like a buffer and

entire last year the second issue is

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.830 
entire last year the second issue is

we've increased the value of the cell

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.750 
we've increased the value of the cell
last<00:03:15.230> year<00:03:15.500> at<00:03:15.650> this<00:03:15.799> time<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.250> average<00:03:16.549> value

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
of the cell was forty nine thousand

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.740 
of the cell was forty nine thousand
dollars<00:03:19.130> at<00:03:19.340> this<00:03:19.880> point<00:03:20.120> in<00:03:20.330> time<00:03:20.360> the

average value of the cell is ninety
eight<00:03:22.519> thousand<00:03:23.030> dollars<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:23.480> we've<00:03:23.630> doubled

eight thousand dollars so we've doubled

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.199

the value to sell so in essence for
every<00:03:26.480> one<00:03:26.690> cell<00:03:27.019> we<00:03:27.200> get<00:03:27.410> we<00:03:27.560> get<00:03:27.680> twice<00:03:27.920> the
