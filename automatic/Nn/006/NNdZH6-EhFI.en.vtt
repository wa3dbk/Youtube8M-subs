00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.240
 I'm here today with a new one 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.370
 tutorial on this channel is today I will make you 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.480
 see the best apps to make gods 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:17.700
 video and finally upload them to youtube 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:21.600
 then we start immediately we have the first 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:24.000
 that looks like a video folder intro l'it 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.410
 this is used to weave the panniers 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.260
 for example to videos in place you see 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.320
 already customized you can also move 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.960
 written to your liking 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.930
 in the middle of the screen sign up to 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.480
 canal we move it a little more here than 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.790
 we can also enlarge it with the various ones 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.720
 buttons that are underneath so yes 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.010
 it enlarges and so gets smaller sa 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.840
 yet 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.410
 then for example we can change the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.030
 font with these keys is 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.690
 equal 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.810
 then going ahead you can also put 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.110
 another inscription that I don't put 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:10.170
 let's export we choose the size 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:15.240
 1280 x 720 that we did the maximum 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.960
 export now exports the intro and then vi 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:25.430
 I'll also see how that effect comes out 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.430
 for a while now that sport 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.659
 ok now and in the camera roll 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:45.649
 let's go into roll pictures in the last one 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.649
 that this will be the intro that will come out of you 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:55.049
 turn around ok so it leaves with the music 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.759
 the writings there will obviously succeed 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.240
 can also register put a nice me 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.759
 like at your leisure 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.649
 then to put it in front of another 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.450
 videos because these are introduced 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:26.970
 lizze video choc network for example now 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:32.230
 let's make a nice usa video 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:37.420
 we put ourselves another album we add 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:41.130
 the intro of 10 seconds and sport 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.340
 we put this before we say 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.380
 converts gathers year you wait you can 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.470
 also go on where to add the item 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.930
 the sound the music but the sounds and the 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.020
 music is paid 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:04.660
 then he said well let's convert that 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:06.970
 it is a moment in which you can choose the 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.220
 color the effects you can put a 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.860
 euro I leave normal here you can put 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.760
 an inscription that will appear for about 56 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.390
 seconds down I don't put the room 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:24.370
 roll 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:32.040
 now save it let's go see it went into 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:34.299
 images pollino and this beach will be with 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.060
 so 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.239
 the intro was obviously to be straightened 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.799
 I never did it because you also want to 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:48.610
 vertical the screen then the video will come out 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:55.620
 and then they bring us the publicity for that 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:04:00.459
 luck can be erased by doing ei 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:05.350
 so cut to the originals and take off 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:07.870
 the point of advertising then telling you 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:11.150
 finished 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.139
 for this video it's all sign up for 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.139
 channel I spare 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:19.669
 I'm sorry if I haven't been long 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:24.800
 active in this period but I am in 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:27.590
 hotel and no shortage of things it does 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.139
 video for example missing the right TV 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.470
 because I brought the play but it's not good 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.690
 facts look at the cardboard box 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.479
 calling it TV seems impossible to me 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.060
 and nice that there is written satellite tv a 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:46.300
 flat screen TV screen is not 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.300
