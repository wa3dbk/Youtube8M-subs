00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.730
 as they are today I'm going to do the color 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.650
 I'm going to teach them to do it to the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.140
 they do not know because they are the ones I 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.779
 have requested and this is the color that I use 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.509
 this green is called evergreen and is from the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.090
 super neon brand finds in the in 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:30.630
 sally beauty supply as you can see is 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.559
 a finite green a green flag and no 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.370
 plus I put half a teaspoon and two 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.100
 spoonfuls of white or white is 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.700
 the one that predominates after I stir very 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.890
 all right 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.480
 use any truth that you like 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.420
 a lot this because he is very experienced 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.400
 I put a little touch of blue is 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.260
 just blue blue skies if they have 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.170
 blue stronger because they put more 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.680
 but I think that blue is 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.570
 gives the touch as well as color 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.670
 lie 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.110
 this is how it is and I show you 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.060
 exactly what I do and so I 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.970
 they want to add free as it is optional 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.350
 I hope you get it right then 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.840
 I tell them the winners of the mix 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.750
 coral that finally says 6 of 10 grams 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.330
 the little packets and these are the people 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.119
 this will be ready and here I put them in 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.830
 very fast how is it that I choose the 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.979
 winners so there is no distrust 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.110
 they all focused this program and gm 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.450
 highlights the repeated ones that someone 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.250
 commented more than once it erases and gives you 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.490
 just a comment so all the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.740
 world that commented came in and well this is 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.630
 luck use class all the first 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.360
 six that went out so many 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.149
 thanks was a huge amount of 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.090
 comments I did not expect it and the 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.100
 true, it's nothing and the mosques 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.740
 compared the amount of comments I 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.590
 I know but something is something I will always try 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.530
 to be doing like that, I do 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.110
 I read all the comments all that 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.520
 they put them I read nothing else especially 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.679
 in this type of videos 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.509
 I can not answer because it would be 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.970
 put a comment and entangle all the 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.160
 I always try to answer 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.050
 how many comments can there sometimes be 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.720
 days I choose and I feel like answering 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.819
 but it's never enough in all my 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.819
 videos I'm late not all 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.440
 comments he answered but believe me 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.200
 that I read them and especially if it's a 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.790
 comment more than a greeting is a 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.709
 Comment on a doubt is to the 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.110
 that I might be a little bit better and treated them 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.209
 to answer I ask for an apology but 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.060
 Well, that's right now, because we are already many 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.920

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.160

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.900
