00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
going to be telling you how to get more

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.460 
going to be telling you how to get more
megapixels<00:00:04.950> out<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.730> your<00:00:05.910> camera<00:00:06.330> it's<00:00:07.259> sort

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
megapixels out of your camera it's sort

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.060 
megapixels out of your camera it's sort
of<00:00:07.529> an<00:00:07.620> alternative<00:00:08.189> way<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:09.800> getting<00:00:10.800> high

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
of an alternative way to getting high

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.570 
of an alternative way to getting high
resolution<00:00:11.700> images<00:00:12.320> with<00:00:13.320> your<00:00:13.559> digital<00:00:14.040> SLR

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
resolution images with your digital SLR

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
resolution images with your digital SLR
and<00:00:15.619> what<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.039> basically<00:00:17.600> you're

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
and what that is is basically you're

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.510 
and what that is is basically you're
just<00:00:18.630> taking<00:00:18.990> your<00:00:19.289> camera<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.859> you're

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
just taking your camera and you're

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.779 
just taking your camera and you're
taking<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.769> panoramic<00:00:22.769> image<00:00:23.100> but<00:00:23.670> you're

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
taking a panoramic image but you're

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.019 
taking a panoramic image but you're
zooming<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> little<00:00:24.449> bit<00:00:24.779> say<00:00:25.500> 255<00:00:26.369> if<00:00:26.820> you

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
zooming in a little bit say 255 if you

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.900 
zooming in a little bit say 255 if you
have<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.330> kit<00:00:27.510> lens<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.930> nikon<00:00:28.320> d50<00:00:28.910> so

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
have the kit lens on the nikon d50 so

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.860 
have the kit lens on the nikon d50 so
you<00:00:30.800> literally<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:32.160> take<00:00:32.399> pictures<00:00:32.870> with

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
you literally just take pictures with

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.030 
you literally just take pictures with
like<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> 25-percent<00:00:35.010> overlap<00:00:36.469> and<00:00:37.469> doing<00:00:37.920> that

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
like a 25-percent overlap and doing that

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.319 
like a 25-percent overlap and doing that
will<00:00:38.160> just<00:00:38.399> give<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.730> high<00:00:39.030> resolution

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
will just give you a high resolution

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.709 
will just give you a high resolution
image<00:00:40.670> compared<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.820> if<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.180> were<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.570> go

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
image compared to if you were just to go

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.200 
image compared to if you were just to go
wide<00:00:43.020> angle<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.739> shoot<00:00:43.920> one<00:00:44.190> picture<00:00:44.640> if

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
wide angle and just shoot one picture if

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.740 
wide angle and just shoot one picture if
you<00:00:45.390> shoot<00:00:45.600> multiple<00:00:45.960> pictures<00:00:47.450> zoomed<00:00:48.450> in

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
you shoot multiple pictures zoomed in

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.799 
you shoot multiple pictures zoomed in
you<00:00:49.670> can<00:00:50.670> get<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> high<00:00:51.000> resolution<00:00:51.270> image<00:00:53.809> now

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
you can get a high resolution image now

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.630 
you can get a high resolution image now
I'm<00:00:55.199> also<00:00:55.440> going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.800> demonstrate<00:00:55.980> how<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.430> do

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
I'm also going to demonstrate how to do

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.020 
I'm also going to demonstrate how to do
this<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:57.570> close-up<00:00:58.050> stuff<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.649> let's<00:00:59.010> go<00:00:59.190> to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
this on close-up stuff so let's go to

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.500 
this on close-up stuff so let's go to
that<00:01:00.149> tree<00:01:00.420> over<00:01:00.449> there<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.170> I'll<00:01:02.070> show<00:01:02.760> you

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.000 

all<00:01:06.510> right<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.470> are<00:01:07.590> next<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
all right so here we are next to the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.060 
all right so here we are next to the
tree<00:01:08.900> my<00:01:09.900> camera's<00:01:10.350> right<00:01:10.500> next<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
tree my camera's right next to it and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.940 
tree my camera's right next to it and
it's<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> tripod<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> tripod<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.049> its

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
it's on the tripod but the tripod is its

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.420 
it's on the tripod but the tripod is its
kind<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.250> tilted<00:01:14.580> backwards<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.840> want<00:01:16.080> it

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
kind of tilted backwards and we want it

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.340 
kind of tilted backwards and we want it
so<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.580> tripod<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.330> straight<00:01:19.020> up<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
so the tripod is like straight up and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.330 
so the tripod is like straight up and
down<00:01:19.970> parallel<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.869> tree<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:23.159> um<00:01:25.340> still

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
down parallel with the tree so um still

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:34.170 
down parallel with the tree so um still
it's<00:01:27.650> parallel<00:01:28.650> with<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:28.979> tree

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:45.160 

that's<00:01:35.180> about<00:01:35.930> good<00:01:36.170> okay<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:44.630> now<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
that's about good okay so now that the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.870 
that's about good okay so now that the
camera<00:01:45.560> is<00:01:45.590> like<00:01:45.860> straight<00:01:46.280> up<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:46.610> down<00:01:46.670> with

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
camera is like straight up and down with

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.330 
camera is like straight up and down with
the<00:01:46.910> tree<00:01:47.530> that'll<00:01:48.530> give<00:01:48.650> us<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:48.860> nice<00:01:49.040> even

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
the tree that'll give us a nice even

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.030 
the tree that'll give us a nice even
view<00:01:49.670> of<00:01:49.850> it<00:01:50.380> just<00:01:51.380> move<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:51.650> back<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:51.890> little

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
view of it just move it back a little

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.290 
view of it just move it back a little
bit<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:54.250> I'm<00:01:55.250> going<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.520> use<00:01:55.760> aperture

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
bit and I'm going to use aperture

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.260 
bit and I'm going to use aperture
priority<00:01:56.900> mode<00:01:57.230> what<00:01:57.560> I'm<00:01:57.650> going<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:58.240> when<00:01:59.240> I

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
priority mode what I'm going to when I

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.650 
priority mode what I'm going to when I
do<00:01:59.360> this<00:01:59.660> and<00:01:59.930> I'm<00:02:00.230> going<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.470> have<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.620> on<00:02:01.660> 55

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
do this and I'm going to have it on 55

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.680 
do this and I'm going to have it on 55
on<00:02:02.930> my<00:02:03.020> lens<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:05.770> f11<00:02:06.770> because<00:02:07.610> f<00:02:07.940> 11<00:02:08.240> is<00:02:08.570> the

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
on my lens and f11 because f 11 is the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.070 
on my lens and f11 because f 11 is the
sharpest<00:02:08.960> point<00:02:09.380> when<00:02:09.860> you're<00:02:10.040> at<00:02:10.570> 55<00:02:11.570> on<00:02:11.870> this

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
sharpest point when you're at 55 on this

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.240 
sharpest point when you're at 55 on this
lens<00:02:12.380> if<00:02:12.680> you're<00:02:12.920> at<00:02:13.040> 18<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:14.540> would<00:02:14.720> be<00:02:14.870> f<00:02:15.710> 8<00:02:16.010> and

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
lens if you're at 18 it would be f 8 and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.970 
lens if you're at 18 it would be f 8 and
there's<00:02:17.210> charts<00:02:17.720> on<00:02:18.020> this<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.410> tell<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.770> like

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
there's charts on this to tell you like

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.940 
there's charts on this to tell you like
what<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.310> sharpest<00:02:19.670> point<00:02:19.910> is<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.960> might<00:02:21.740> put

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
what the sharpest point is I might put

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.810 
what the sharpest point is I might put
the<00:02:22.070> put<00:02:22.700> those<00:02:22.850> up<00:02:23.530> but<00:02:24.530> anyways<00:02:25.810> um<00:02:27.160> I<00:02:28.160> got

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
the put those up but anyways um I got

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.180 
the put those up but anyways um I got
iso<00:02:29.420> 200<00:02:30.020> because<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.620> cameras<00:02:30.980> on<00:02:31.070> a<00:02:31.100> tripod

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
iso 200 because the cameras on a tripod

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.270 
iso 200 because the cameras on a tripod
and<00:02:31.820> it<00:02:32.690> it's<00:02:33.260> not<00:02:33.470> going<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.680> be<00:02:33.740> moving<00:02:33.890> so

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
and it it's not going to be moving so

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.350

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
your camera is the best option and white

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.350 
your camera is the best option and white
balance<00:02:41.990> it's<00:02:42.770> set<00:02:42.980> at<00:02:43.010> cloudy<00:02:43.400> it's<00:02:43.700> better

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
balance it's set at cloudy it's better

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.790 
balance it's set at cloudy it's better
to<00:02:44.540> have<00:02:44.570> it<00:02:44.720> set<00:02:45.050> at<00:02:45.080> something<00:02:45.500> rather<00:02:45.680> than

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
to have it set at something rather than

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.880 
to have it set at something rather than
auto<00:02:46.130> because<00:02:46.550> then<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.820> kind<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:48.200> works

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
auto because then it kind of it works

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.970 
auto because then it kind of it works
either<00:02:49.070> way<00:02:49.190> though<00:02:49.459> it's<00:02:49.640> fine<00:02:50.050> but<00:02:51.050> if<00:02:51.770> you

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
either way though it's fine but if you

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.550 
either way though it's fine but if you
want<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.640> most<00:02:52.820> optimal<00:02:53.450> stitching<00:02:54.050> result

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
want the most optimal stitching result

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.460 
want the most optimal stitching result
you<00:02:55.520> would<00:02:55.670> want<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:56.120> set<00:02:56.570> white<00:02:56.840> balance<00:02:57.230> not

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
you would want a set white balance not

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.340 
you would want a set white balance not
just<00:02:57.709> have<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:58.040> on<00:02:58.130> auto<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:59.050> also<00:03:00.050> my

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
just have it on auto and also my

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.460 
just have it on auto and also my
focusing<00:03:01.190> is<00:03:01.340> on<00:03:01.459> all<00:03:01.610> focus<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:03.260> what<00:03:03.380> I'm

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
focusing is on all focus so what I'm

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.340 
focusing is on all focus so what I'm
doing<00:03:03.500> is<00:03:04.040> I'm<00:03:05.030> going<00:03:05.209> to<00:03:05.300> put<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.660> camera<00:03:06.080> on

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
doing is I'm going to put the camera on

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.930 
doing is I'm going to put the camera on
a<00:03:07.390> timer<00:03:08.390> for<00:03:08.810> like<00:03:08.989> two<00:03:09.170> seconds<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.640> I'm

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
a timer for like two seconds and I'm

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.190 
a timer for like two seconds and I'm
going<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.150> push<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.420> shutter<00:03:11.570> button<00:03:11.720> and

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
going to push the shutter button and

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.240 
going to push the shutter button and
then<00:03:12.350> it's<00:03:12.500> going<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.650> take<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:12.920> picture

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
then it's going to take the picture

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.520 
then it's going to take the picture
after<00:03:13.459> two<00:03:13.850> seconds<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.930> reason<00:03:15.260> why<00:03:15.380> I'm

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
after two seconds the reason why I'm

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.670 
after two seconds the reason why I'm
doing<00:03:15.709> this<00:03:15.860> is<00:03:16.160> because<00:03:16.790> if<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.209> just<00:03:17.470> push<00:03:18.470> the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
doing this is because if I just push the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.870 
doing this is because if I just push the
shutter<00:03:19.100> button<00:03:19.250> like<00:03:19.610> that<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:21.790> Wiggles<00:03:22.790> the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
shutter button like that it Wiggles the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.400 
shutter button like that it Wiggles the
camera<00:03:23.209> just<00:03:23.239> a<00:03:23.480> little<00:03:23.750> bit<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.050> that<00:03:24.170> causes

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
camera just a little bit and that causes

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.600 
camera just a little bit and that causes
motion<00:03:24.770> blur<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:27.130> I'm<00:03:28.130> going<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.310> push<00:03:28.489> this

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
motion blur so I'm going to push this

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.830 
motion blur so I'm going to push this
little<00:03:28.760> button<00:03:28.940> right<00:03:29.150> here<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.630> timer

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
little button right here the timer

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.400 
little button right here the timer
button<00:03:31.300> get<00:03:32.300> this<00:03:32.570> set<00:03:32.989> up<00:03:33.940> push<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.090> button

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
button get this set up push the button

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.290 
button get this set up push the button
take<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.590> picture<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.700> now<00:03:39.360> I'm<00:03:40.290> going<00:03:40.680> to

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
take the picture and now I'm going to

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.070 
take the picture and now I'm going to
just<00:03:42.300> raise<00:03:42.600> it<00:03:42.900> up<00:03:43.050> and<00:03:44.420> make<00:03:45.420> sure<00:03:45.450> there's

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
just raise it up and make sure there's

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.410 
just raise it up and make sure there's
like<00:03:46.260> an<00:03:46.470> overlay<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.340> twenty-five<00:03:48.270> percent

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
like an overlay of twenty-five percent

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.950 
like an overlay of twenty-five percent
or<00:03:49.350> more<00:03:49.970> this<00:03:50.970> makes<00:03:51.240> it<00:03:51.330> easy<00:03:51.600> on<00:03:51.870> the

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
or more this makes it easy on the

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.330 
or more this makes it easy on the
stitching<00:03:52.380> software<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:53.070> you're<00:03:53.160> going<00:03:53.280> to

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
stitching software that you're going to

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.640 
stitching software that you're going to
use<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:54.480> do<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.930> same<00:03:55.140> thing<00:03:55.350> over<00:03:55.470> again

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
use and do the same thing over again

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.580 
use and do the same thing over again
push<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.400> timer<00:03:56.640> button<00:03:57.050> and<00:03:58.050> push<00:03:58.410> the

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
push the timer button and push the

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.200 
push the timer button and push the
shutter<00:03:58.800> button<00:03:59.870> takes<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.080> picture<00:04:01.470> and

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
shutter button takes the picture and

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:17.340 
shutter button takes the picture and
just<00:04:03.210> keep<00:04:03.390> doing<00:04:03.720> this

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.479 

another<00:04:18.350> thing<00:04:18.530> I<00:04:18.620> forgot<00:04:18.739> to<00:04:18.920> mention<00:04:19.010> was

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
another thing I forgot to mention was

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.800 
another thing I forgot to mention was
using<00:04:20.299> manual<00:04:20.510> mode<00:04:20.900> is<00:04:21.850> good<00:04:22.850> when<00:04:23.690> you're

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
using manual mode is good when you're

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.730 
using manual mode is good when you're
doing<00:04:24.110> panoramix<00:04:24.830> because<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:26.780> light<00:04:27.020> the

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
doing panoramix because the light the

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.260 
doing panoramix because the light the
lighting<00:04:28.220> coming<00:04:28.490> into<00:04:28.670> the<00:04:28.760> camera<00:04:28.940> is<00:04:29.120> going

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
lighting coming into the camera is going

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.490 
lighting coming into the camera is going
to<00:04:29.330> be<00:04:29.420> all<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.720> same<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.110> it's<00:04:30.230> going<00:04:30.320> to<00:04:30.380> be

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
to be all the same and it's going to be

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.450 
to be all the same and it's going to be
all<00:04:30.650> even<00:04:31.420> but<00:04:32.420> the<00:04:33.260> stitching<00:04:33.650> software<00:04:33.860> can

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
all even but the stitching software can

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.710 
all even but the stitching software can
also<00:04:35.020> do<00:04:36.020> pictures<00:04:36.850> in<00:04:37.850> aperture<00:04:38.540> priority

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
also do pictures in aperture priority

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:47.159 
also do pictures in aperture priority
more<00:04:39.410> mode<00:04:41.170> or<00:04:43.420> shutter<00:04:44.420> mode

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.469 

okay<00:04:47.860> so<00:04:47.979> now<00:04:48.279> we<00:04:48.340> have<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.759> pictures<00:04:49.090> on<00:04:49.330> the

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
okay so now we have the pictures on the
