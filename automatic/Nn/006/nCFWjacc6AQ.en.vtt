00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
rolling pin and then I just start

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.970 
rolling pin and then I just start
rolling<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:32.719> it<00:00:33.719> somewhat<00:00:34.230> depends<00:00:34.710> on<00:00:34.829> how

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
rolling it it somewhat depends on how

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.119 
rolling it it somewhat depends on how
tall<00:00:35.340> your<00:00:35.670> cake<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.719> how<00:00:36.870> large<00:00:37.350> your

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
tall your cake is as to how large your

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.380 
tall your cake is as to how large your
circle<00:00:39.120> needs<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:41.160> all<00:00:41.270> before<00:00:42.270> we

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
circle needs to be but we all before we

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.660 
circle needs to be but we all before we
go<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.629> put<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.170> we'll<00:00:43.469> gauge<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
go to put it on we'll gauge that and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.369 
go to put it on we'll gauge that and
then<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.059> want<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> always<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:46.020> making

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
then I just want to always be making

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the surface and I'll just keep going

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.490 
the surface and I'll just keep going
until<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.100> nice<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.489> thin<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.899> has<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.469> be

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
until this is nice and thin it has to be

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.580 
until this is nice and thin it has to be
a<00:00:56.039> wide<00:00:56.789> enough<00:00:57.559> circle<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.710> fit<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.609> my<00:00:59.879> cake

so<00:02:10.060> what<00:02:10.210> we're<00:02:10.360> going<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.570> do<00:02:10.810> is<00:02:11.110> just<00:02:11.620> rub

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
so what we're going to do is just rub

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.510 
so what we're going to do is just rub
the<00:02:12.210> fondant<00:02:13.210> onto<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.530> cake<00:02:14.710> very<00:02:15.040> gently

the fondant onto the cake very gently
you<00:02:15.700> don't<00:02:15.940> want<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.270> be<00:02:16.360> pulling<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:17.020> down

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
you don't want to be pulling it down

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.890 
you don't want to be pulling it down
because<00:02:17.500> then<00:02:17.740> it<00:02:17.830> may<00:02:18.160> split<00:02:19.030> at<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.300> top<00:02:19.540> so

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
because then it may split at the top so

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.740 
because then it may split at the top so
you<00:02:19.960> want<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.530> just<00:02:20.740> rub<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.640> very<00:02:22.060> gently<00:02:22.180> and

you want to just rub it very gently and

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.550 
you want to just rub it very gently and
also<00:02:23.590> we<00:02:23.830> need<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.520> get<00:02:24.910> these<00:02:25.390> seams<00:02:25.960> or<00:02:26.410> these

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
also we need to get these seams or these

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.100 
also we need to get these seams or these
pleats<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.220> have<00:02:27.430> been<00:02:27.670> created<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.840> lay

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
pleats that have been created to lay

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.430 
pleats that have been created to lay
flat<00:02:29.500> as<00:02:29.830> we're<00:02:30.730> doing<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.870> fondant<00:02:32.350> is

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
flat as we're doing that the fondant is

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.410 
flat as we're doing that the fondant is
going<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.650> get<00:02:32.740> longer<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:33.820> we<00:02:33.940> may<00:02:34.150> have

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
going to get longer and so we may have

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.070 
going to get longer and so we may have
to<00:02:34.540> trim<00:02:34.810> off<00:02:34.960> some<00:02:35.020> of<00:02:35.380> it<00:02:35.590> with<00:02:35.770> our<00:02:36.010> scissors

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
to trim off some of it with our scissors

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.530 
to trim off some of it with our scissors
so<00:02:38.080> just<00:02:38.380> keep<00:02:38.590> going<00:02:38.920> around<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.520> top<00:02:39.790> you

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
so just keep going around the top you

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.160 
so just keep going around the top you
want<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.810> do<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.670> top<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.300> then<00:02:43.600> we'll<00:02:43.900> deal

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
want to do the top and then we'll deal

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.290 
want to do the top and then we'll deal

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
moving around it's getting longer and

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.130 
moving around it's getting longer and
longer<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:35.830> as<00:03:36.160> I'm<00:03:36.910> working<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.570> I<00:03:37.750> may

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
longer and so as I'm working it I may

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.759 
longer and so as I'm working it I may
want<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:39.000> cut<00:03:40.000> some<00:03:40.390> of<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:40.690> excess<00:03:41.170> off<00:03:41.440> so

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
that I can work a little bit more easily

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.460 
that I can work a little bit more easily
with<00:03:45.910> this<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:46.390> you<00:03:46.480> don't<00:03:46.690> want<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:46.900> cut<00:03:47.140> too

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
should flatten out quite nicely so it

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.400 
should flatten out quite nicely so it
gets<00:04:03.230> that<00:04:03.500> right<00:04:04.040> close<00:04:04.730> down<00:04:05.209> just<00:04:06.170> keep

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
gets that right close down just keep

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:14.680 
gets that right close down just keep
rubbing<00:04:06.800> it<00:04:09.819> now<00:04:10.819> i<00:04:10.880> have<00:04:11.450> my<00:04:12.040> fondant<00:04:13.690> press
