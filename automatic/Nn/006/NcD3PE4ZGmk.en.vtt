00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.040
 good afternoon dear friends with you 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.529
 lucky today we play wager on 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:20.460
 10,000 mah not my subscriber's coins 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:22.640
 Here is the group 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.640
 we'll see 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.340
 expect 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.969
 the subscriber did not himself suggested holding it 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.800
 2 gir insisted on 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:03.640
 this one assured that he would win 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.640
 let's see what he will do 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.520
 I already don't like it 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.070
 Apparently apparently our opponent will play 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.070
 today canopies 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.860
 Vova dangerous very dangerous 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.930
 barbell 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.879
 let's go to growth for garbage 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.019
 Who 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.870
 he is covered 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.200
 no matter how we do it in 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.200
 attack 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.670
 well, that's barba 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.300
 this 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.300
 ten 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.440
 Yes 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.560
 Well, the mess he has such a speed that 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.920
 just no one should have a chance 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:08.750
 before running off on weight head fails 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.750
 our rival covers this pitch 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.050
 So 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.590
 crayfish 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.090
 lectures are playing the castle 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.959
 so languages 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.959
 20 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.550
 the first half is very good for us 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.300
 is shaping up honestly i'm not very 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:55.890
 sure that losing he will give the coins but 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:58.410
 here the essence as if not in the coins I just 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.840
 it was interesting to play with him he was 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.840
 very confident to myself now 30 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:13.330
 put the light here too everything is clear 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:17.260
 huge advantage so much in possession 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:22.930
 so on blows see what he took 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:25.360
 the second half went here when 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.450
 the sword slips past all my players 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:33.570
 I don't like the abbot like that 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.570
 narrow back everything under control 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.040
 will throw on and barba 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.870
 fourth ball in the goal 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.870
 x 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.360
 Moscow 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.520
 era 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.050
 but 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:15.830
 forgive forgive benefits in principle 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.830
 already enough 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:25.900
 once more forgive long-range strike or 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.900
 falls into frame 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.630
 keep going 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.110
 again attempt to break through 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:42.340
 at least the statisticians layer is now 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:42.340
 a little bit better 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:57.780
 both those people reward just passes 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.780
 su defense rival 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.340
 the fifth goal here is such here today 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.340
 turned blogger 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:14.050
 I am leaving one defender pass on 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.050
 martinus 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.970
 Pogba sixth goal 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:41.009
 60 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:02.210
 my goal is still not taken today 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.080
 so ended our first wager match 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.910
