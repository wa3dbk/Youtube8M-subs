00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
a way to actually do that in Safari for

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.370 
a way to actually do that in Safari for
our<00:01:16.530> iOS<00:01:17.159> devices<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.170> bank

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
our iOS devices so if you do bank

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.370 
our iOS devices so if you do bank
account<00:01:19.770> stuff<00:01:20.549> if<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.780> some<00:01:22.049> online

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
account stuff if you do some online

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.210 
account stuff if you do some online
purchases<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> good<00:01:24.000> idea<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.920> Safari<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
purchases it is a good idea in Safari to

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.420 
purchases it is a good idea in Safari to
erase<00:01:26.580> these<00:01:27.259> information<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.950> all<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.280> have

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
erase these information so all you have

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.840 
erase these information so all you have
to<00:01:29.549> do<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.270> settings<00:01:31.670> once<00:01:32.670> you're

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
to do is go to the settings once you're

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.080 
to do is go to the settings once you're
in<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> settings<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.990> will<00:01:34.140> go<00:01:34.409> down<00:01:34.680> to

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
in the settings you will go down to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.980 
in the settings you will go down to
Safari<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> Safari<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:39.030> once<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.780> are<00:01:39.960> there

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
Safari so Safari and once you are there

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.950 
Safari so Safari and once you are there
go<00:01:40.680> down<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.490> you'll<00:01:41.640> see<00:01:41.939> these<00:01:42.150> two<00:01:42.570> blue

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
go down and you'll see these two blue

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.980 
go down and you'll see these two blue
lines<00:01:43.290> here<00:01:43.530> once<00:01:44.250> that's<00:01:44.549> clear<00:01:44.880> history<00:01:45.689> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
lines here once that's clear history and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.410 
lines here once that's clear history and
the<00:01:46.649> other<00:01:46.770> one<00:01:46.920> says<00:01:47.220> clear<00:01:47.520> cookies<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
the other one says clear cookies and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.940 
the other one says clear cookies and
data<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:50.130> if<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.689> want<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.500> erase<00:01:53.430> everything

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
data so if you want to erase everything

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.639 
data so if you want to erase everything
after<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.219> bank<00:01:56.850> transaction<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:57.990> example<00:01:58.500> I

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
after a bank transaction for example I

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.060 
after a bank transaction for example I
suggest<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.759> clear<00:02:00.000> history<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.070> clear

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
suggest that you clear history and clear

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.130 
suggest that you clear history and clear
cookies<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.610> data<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.810> don't<00:02:03.930> want<00:02:04.049> to

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
cookies and data if you don't want to

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.109

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
deleting clear cookies and data is

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.790 
deleting clear cookies and data is
enough<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.090> just<00:02:14.300> click<00:02:14.570> there<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:15.560> see

enough so you just click there you see

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.580 
enough so you just click there you see
clear<00:02:16.100> cookies<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.730> data<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.540> your<00:02:18.290> iPhone

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
clear cookies and data and your iPhone

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.950 
clear cookies and data and your iPhone
will<00:02:19.160> have<00:02:19.460> all<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:19.970> information<00:02:20.150> removed

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
will have all that information removed

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.920 
will have all that information removed
and<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:22.130> see<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.460> it<00:02:22.610> became<00:02:23.000> great<00:02:23.540> that

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
and you see that it became great that

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.200 
and you see that it became great that
means<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:25.070> now<00:02:25.370> removed<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.000> if<00:02:26.090> I

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
means that it is now removed so if I

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.260 
means that it is now removed so if I
clear<00:02:26.420> history<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.260> comes<00:02:27.530> gray<00:02:27.800> also<00:02:28.270> what's

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270
