00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.850
 Y 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.270
 very good everyone here are going 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.230
 quick tips to learn to fly 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.230
 a helicopter to radio control 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.180
 once we have linked the issuer to 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.730
 helicopter the first thing we should do 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.410
 is to adjust the rudder on the ground so that 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.810
 keep as static as possible 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.400
 when it is flying for it we turn the 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.080
 adjustment potentiometer that is in the 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.650
 command until the helicopter does not turn 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.650
 alone 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.750
 it is important to keep in mind that at 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.190
 have little experience it 's better to fly in 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.380
 a place a little wide of the house 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.390
 always avoid areas like flying over 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.860
 of a table to avoid hitting the 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.580
 helicopter blades and that last as long 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.580
 maximum possible 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.059
 to get a little with the controls 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.070
 of the issuer is better to start with good 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.140
 traits try to keep helicopter 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.240
 static and balanced this is quite 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.890
 complicated to get but it will help 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.840
 a lot to adapt to the levers of 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.610
 command at the same time that will prevent that when 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.540
 lose control of the apparatus the blow 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.540
 that receives less 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.840
 at the moment when the loss of 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.400
 control is irremediable there is 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.290
 get used to slowing down in 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.120
 helicopter as you can see in the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.310
 images is better to leave it than in the 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.440
 soil that will continue to turn the blades and 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.480
 hit at that speed this is 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.990
 a very important fact to prolong the 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.990
 appliance life 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.800
 it's time to talk about the landing when it arrives 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.530
 this moment one should be taken calmly 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.150
 this action is not good to rush 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.520
 that helps you lose control and 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.900
 hit any little site to 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.360
 there is little to approach the area 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.310
 desired and go compensating and taking advantage 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.200
 the movements of the helicopter up 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.660
 be close enough to 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.090
 deactivate the rotor the good thing about 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.840
 landing is that if done well it remains 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.840
 very professional 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.930
 Well, here I leave you a final clip 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.220
 flying the helicopter through the house 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.319
 thank you very much for watching the video 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.220
 and I hope these good tips up 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.220
 the next video on health
