thousand rupees here in India and what
makes<00:00:27.259> it<00:00:27.410> different<00:00:27.560> from<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:27.830> core<00:00:28.099> i3<00:00:28.249> and

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
makes it different from the core i3 and

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.189 
makes it different from the core i3 and
Core<00:00:28.669> i5<00:00:28.789> is<00:00:29.089> it<00:00:29.419> has<00:00:29.539> got<00:00:29.570> a<00:00:29.749> backlit<00:00:30.140> keyboard

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
Core i5 is it has got a backlit keyboard

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.430 
Core i5 is it has got a backlit keyboard
and<00:00:31.329> the<00:00:32.329> graphic<00:00:32.720> card<00:00:32.870> in<00:00:33.530> it<00:00:33.650> is<00:00:33.800> GD<00:00:34.370> 7<00:00:34.670> 1<00:00:34.910> 0<00:00:34.940> M

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.319 
and the graphic card in it is GD 7 1 0 M
now<00:00:36.440> let<00:00:37.160> me<00:00:37.280> just<00:00:37.430> start<00:00:37.670> showing<00:00:37.940> you<00:00:38.210> off

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
now let me just start showing you off

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.360 
now let me just start showing you off
the<00:00:38.630> battery<00:00:39.020> here<00:00:39.290> this<00:00:39.770> is<00:00:39.860> a<00:00:39.890> four<00:00:40.160> cell

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
the battery here this is a four cell

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.730 
the battery here this is a four cell
lithium<00:00:40.730> battery<00:00:41.270> battery<00:00:41.780> which<00:00:42.470> comes

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
lithium battery battery which comes

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.400 
lithium battery battery which comes
along<00:00:43.010> with<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.370> laptop<00:00:44.000> this<00:00:44.150> is<00:00:44.330> this<00:00:45.200> had

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
along with the laptop this is this had

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.260 
along with the laptop this is this had
to<00:00:45.560> be<00:00:45.650> a<00:00:45.680> six<00:00:45.950> cell<00:00:46.100> at<00:00:46.220> least<00:00:46.430> but<00:00:46.670> that's

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
to be a six cell at least but that's

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.420 
to be a six cell at least but that's
fine<00:00:47.450> because<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:48.470> Core<00:00:48.650> i5<00:00:48.770> processor<00:00:48.950> that

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
fine because the Core i5 processor that

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.450 
fine because the Core i5 processor that
is<00:00:49.490> there<00:00:49.760> in<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.120> laptop<00:00:51.110> is<00:00:51.320> an<00:00:52.070> ultra-low

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
is there in the laptop is an ultra-low

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.090 
is there in the laptop is an ultra-low
voltage<00:00:52.580> processor<00:00:52.970> so<00:00:53.840> it<00:00:54.800> will<00:00:54.920> give<00:00:55.010> this

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
voltage processor so it will give this

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.970 
voltage processor so it will give this
better<00:00:55.490> backup<00:00:55.990> so<00:00:56.990> the<00:00:57.140> power<00:00:57.410> rating<00:00:57.590> here

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
better backup so the power rating here

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.200 
better backup so the power rating here
is<00:00:58.220> 14<00:00:58.850> point<00:00:59.030> 8<00:00:59.180> volts<00:00:59.630> and<00:01:00.250> 2500<00:01:01.250> mAh<00:01:01.640> 37

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
is 14 point 8 volts and 2500 mAh 37

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.730 
is 14 point 8 volts and 2500 mAh 37
vadas<00:01:02.480> it<00:01:02.990> will<00:01:03.110> give<00:01:03.200> you<00:01:03.290> a<00:01:03.350> backup<00:01:03.680> of

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
vadas it will give you a backup of

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.219 
vadas it will give you a backup of
around<00:01:04.040> say<00:01:04.339> maximum<00:01:05.089> of<00:01:05.390> two<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.020> half<00:01:06.110> to

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
around say maximum of two and a half to

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.340 
around say maximum of two and a half to
three<00:01:06.259> are<00:01:06.560> nothing<00:01:06.860> beyond<00:01:07.100> that<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:08.570> you

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
three are nothing beyond that and you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.080

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
feature I was talking about which is

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:43.320 
feature I was talking about which is
there<00:02:35.330> in<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.630> core<00:02:35.840> i5<00:02:35.960> variants<00:02:36.530> only

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.000 

so<00:02:43.840> this<00:02:43.990> is<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.520> practice<00:02:45.520> keyboard<00:02:46.360> that<00:02:46.690> is

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.710 
so this is the practice keyboard that is
distinctive<00:02:48.010> in<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.280> core<00:02:48.460> i5<00:02:48.580> variant<00:02:49.120> the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
distinctive in the core i5 variant the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.020 
distinctive in the core i5 variant the
core<00:02:49.900> i3<00:02:50.050> variant<00:02:50.590> does<00:02:51.160> not<00:02:51.340> have<00:02:51.550> Core<00:02:51.880> i5

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
core i3 variant does not have Core i5

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.720 
core i3 variant does not have Core i5
variant<00:02:52.900> only<00:02:53.290> has<00:02:53.470> got<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.680> backlit<00:02:54.040> keyboard
