00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
this and if you checkpoint restart or

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.770 
this and if you checkpoint restart or
like<00:01:16.979> let's<00:01:17.250> say<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.460> saved<00:01:17.909> several<00:01:18.360> times

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
like let's say you saved several times

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.030 
like let's say you saved several times
at<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.320> point<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.040> was<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.610> at<00:01:21.259> you<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
at that point I was just at you the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.570 
at that point I was just at you the
achievement<00:01:23.640> will<00:01:23.790> start<00:01:24.060> over<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.400> let's<00:01:26.400> say

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
achievement will start over so let's say

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.480 
achievement will start over so let's say
you<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.880> 11<00:01:27.829> off<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.159> here<00:01:29.430> here<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.420> go<00:01:30.689> back

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
you get 11 off of here here you go back

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.480 
you get 11 off of here here you go back
then

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
then

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.520 
then
you're<00:01:34.119> going<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.329> have<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.630> redo<00:01:35.020> it<00:01:35.049> because

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
you're going to have to redo it because

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.440 
you're going to have to redo it because
it<00:01:35.649> doesn't<00:01:35.950> save<00:01:36.100> your<00:01:36.250> saves<00:01:36.460> for<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.090> file

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
it doesn't save your saves for the file

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.719 
it doesn't save your saves for the file
it<00:01:37.689> doesn't<00:01:37.960> save<00:01:38.140> like<00:01:38.770> to<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.040> xbox<00:01:39.490> when<00:01:39.670> I

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
it doesn't save like to the xbox when I

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.420 
it doesn't save like to the xbox when I
explain<00:01:40.119> I'm<00:01:41.049> not<00:01:41.140> sure<00:01:41.200> how<00:01:41.470> they<00:01:41.680> other

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
explain I'm not sure how they other

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.130 
explain I'm not sure how they other
games<00:01:42.700> do<00:01:42.880> it<00:01:43.030> but<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.509> way<00:01:43.540> this<00:01:43.689> one<00:01:43.930> works

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
games do it but the way this one works

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.660 
games do it but the way this one works
it<00:01:44.950> saves<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:45.939> save<00:01:46.390> file<00:01:46.689> so<00:01:47.680> you'll

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
it saves to that save file so you'll

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.730 
it saves to that save file so you'll
have<00:01:48.789> to<00:01:48.850> redo<00:01:49.270> it<00:01:49.299> apparently<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:50.229> can't<00:01:50.500> find

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
have to redo it apparently I can't find

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.490 
have to redo it apparently I can't find
the<00:01:50.890> nanny<00:01:51.130> but<00:01:51.399> you'll<00:01:51.610> see<00:01:51.789> I<00:01:51.820> had<00:01:52.030> 10<00:01:52.500> and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
the nanny but you'll see I had 10 and

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.260 
the nanny but you'll see I had 10 and
that's<00:01:53.649> how<00:01:53.830> I<00:01:54.100> was<00:01:54.369> checking<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.789> see<00:01:55.000> if<00:01:55.030> it

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
that's how I was checking to see if it

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.899 
that's how I was checking to see if it
might<00:01:55.899> have<00:01:56.080> added<00:01:56.530> them<00:01:56.920> up<00:01:57.009> but<00:01:57.250> it<00:01:57.460> doesn't

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
might have added them up but it doesn't

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.020 
might have added them up but it doesn't
so<00:01:58.330> you'll<00:01:59.320> have<00:01:59.439> to<00:01:59.619> find<00:01:59.830> more<00:02:00.130> I<00:02:00.490> don't<00:02:00.939> know

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
so you'll have to find more I don't know

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.310 
so you'll have to find more I don't know
if<00:02:01.090> there's<00:02:01.240> any<00:02:01.390> other<00:02:01.539> glitches<00:02:01.780> like<00:02:01.960> this

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
if there's any other glitches like this
