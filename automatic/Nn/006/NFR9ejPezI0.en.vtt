00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.990 
written so before I'll just - any
conclusions<00:02:00.960> about<00:02:01.140> Neff<00:02:01.710> for<00:02:02.009> I'll<00:02:02.430> give<00:02:02.850> it

conclusions about Neff for I'll give it

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.630 
conclusions about Neff for I'll give it
a<00:02:03.149> few<00:02:03.659> more<00:02:03.899> days<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.229> see<00:02:04.799> if<00:02:05.009> there<00:02:05.490> is

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
a few more days to see if there is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.210 
a few more days to see if there is
something<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.210> dig<00:02:06.689> up<00:02:06.960> apparently<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.979> meant

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
something to dig up apparently it meant

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.190 
something to dig up apparently it meant
something<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.149> need<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> little<00:02:09.690> bit<00:02:09.959> more

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
something like I need a little bit more

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.960 
something like I need a little bit more
time<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.560> make<00:02:11.009> my<00:02:11.220> own<00:02:11.250> theory<00:02:12.090> for<00:02:12.360> my

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
time to make my own theory for my

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.840 
time to make my own theory for my
video<00:02:13.600> you<00:02:14.200> know<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.410> make<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:14.800> more<00:02:15.250> exciting
