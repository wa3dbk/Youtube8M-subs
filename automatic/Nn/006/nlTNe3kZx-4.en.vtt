00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.519
 very 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.750
 and the truth is that I think that as well 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.340
 says no to a preseason that is going to be 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.330
 different especially so the 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.850
 team is going to play the next 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.520
 season we do not know what it is and a 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.230
 difficult complicated situation by which 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.180
 at this moment perhaps the team is 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.190
 happening but I think we're all 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.100
 conscious I think we're doing 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.350
 a good preseason here in the card 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.580
 high performance of course for 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.440
 arrive in the best way to the next 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.739
 tournament and also start with the foot 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.739
 straight 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.460
 yes, I think it was important about 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.440
 everything also I think we had good 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.560
 results in that aspect not in the 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.210
 I work mostly also in what 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.760
 football that also what 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.100
 we were looking for I think the team understood 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.740
 also quickly or perfectly what 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.910
 what technician required and what is 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.160
 also requires in this type of 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.900
 situations I do not think the team has 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.550
 improved and goes from less to more 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.010
 that is important and good for that 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.840
 it is also important a good one very 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.479
 good preparation for what comes like this 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.550
 is I think it was very important to have 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.490
 got important points with 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.080
 complicated equipment that one of them 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.240
 they are when now good they are going to play the 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.540
 final I think the team made good 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.720
 parties I think we suddenly missed 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.640
 a little bit more fortune to take out 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.260
 better results the team think it's going 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.080
 from less to more 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.880
 and good to take this opportunity that 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.010
 a challenge presents itself again 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.000
 important and that I believe that the team 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.000
 will move forward 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.200
 all good 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.550
 I believe that as you say you do not 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.490
 better, we need a little more 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.650
 regularity but good that no longer it not 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.260
 I can recover what I can 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.370
 recover is this is what I'm 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.000
 living right now what I 'm doing 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.650
 Now, always work 100% for 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.510
 keep winning in my place and for 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.450
 course is to seize the opportunity 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.360
 that is presented to me for the benefit of 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.560
 team I think it helps me a lot not like 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.690
 you mention also to be able to handle 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.840
 various positions both in conception 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.370
 as in the top on the 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.640
 steering wheel by right or extreme by 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.110
 right so that also benefits me 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.570
 it helps me a lot and of course 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.550
 bring out the best in me to first for 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.580
 the team that is the most important and 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.330
 this and help in everything you can and 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.330
 whatever is within reach 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.189
 yes I think there is a very good atmosphere in 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.280
 the team that is the truth I think that 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:17.950
 we are very good companions there is a great 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.019
 union in the team and all aware 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.010
 of responsibility and what it is 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.409
 meaningful 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.019
 and well I think that good environment 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.849
 has to see reflected in the matches 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.239
 and start to get the results that 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.239
 we all want 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.319
 yes of course I do not think that 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.599
 like what you say I do not think we know 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.269
 nothing about the team that we represent what 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.829
 represents for Mexican football what 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.019
 which means chivas but also one 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.969
 as a player that prestige that pride 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:57.159
 have to go afloat to get 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:57.159
 forward this team who deserve it
