00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
can always be used to work the upper

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.609 
can always be used to work the upper
body<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:21.119> not<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> bad<00:00:21.750> thing<00:00:21.990> for<00:00:22.050> children

body it's not a bad thing for children

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.410 
body it's not a bad thing for children
to<00:00:22.949> work<00:00:23.130> some<00:00:23.340> weights<00:00:23.550> obviously<00:00:24.240> they're

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
to work some weights obviously they're

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.480 
to work some weights obviously they're
not<00:00:24.570> gonna<00:00:24.779> work<00:00:25.019> 500<00:00:25.710> pound<00:00:25.920> weights<00:00:26.189> their

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
not gonna work 500 pound weights their

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.580 
not gonna work 500 pound weights their
children<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.449> want<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.170> amount<00:00:28.439> of

children so you want to do the amount of

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.410 
children so you want to do the amount of
weight<00:00:28.800> that's<00:00:29.250> appropriate<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.090> child

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
weight that's appropriate for the child

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.380 
weight that's appropriate for the child
but<00:00:30.630> adding<00:00:31.050> weight<00:00:31.520> I'll<00:00:32.520> wait<00:00:32.759> here<00:00:32.790> I'll

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
but adding weight I'll wait here I'll

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.450 
but adding weight I'll wait here I'll
wait<00:00:33.600> here<00:00:33.630> any<00:00:34.200> place<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.710> their<00:00:34.920> body<00:00:35.130> is

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460

coordinated<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.710> we're<00:00:43.800> gonna<00:00:43.920> do<00:00:44.070> we've

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
coordinated so what we're gonna do we've

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.190 
coordinated so what we're gonna do we've
got<00:00:44.219> Olivia<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> floor<00:00:45.149> but<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.050> can

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
got Olivia on the floor but we can

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.799 
got Olivia on the floor but we can
always<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.399> exact<00:00:47.730> same<00:00:47.760> exercises<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
always do the exact same exercises on a

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.450 
always do the exact same exercises on a
BOSU<00:00:49.170> ball<00:00:49.350> adds<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.739> complete<00:00:50.129> different

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
BOSU ball adds a complete different

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.790 
BOSU ball adds a complete different
dimension<00:00:50.850> because<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.539> core<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.260> having<00:00:52.680> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
dimension because the core is having to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.910 
dimension because the core is having to
stabilize<00:00:53.340> at<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> same<00:00:54.270> time<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.350> Ryan's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
stabilize at the same time so Ryan's

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.170 
stabilize at the same time so Ryan's
gonna<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> ball<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.000> we're

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
gonna be on the ball and what we're

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.430 
gonna be on the ball and what we're
gonna<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> bunch<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.140> different

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
gonna do is a bunch of different

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.830 
gonna do is a bunch of different
exercises<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.210> doesn't<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.480> be<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.719> any

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
exercises and doesn't have to be in any

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
exercises and doesn't have to be in any
order<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.770> music<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.579> like<00:01:02.609> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
order if you have music and you like it

and you want to work on the beat so that
everybody's<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.339> together

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
everybody's going up and down together

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.090 
everybody's going up and down together
like<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> class<00:01:06.570> great<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.619> don't<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.950> to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
like a class great but you don't have to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.679 
like a class great but you don't have to
do<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.610> kind<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.030> Simon<00:01:09.450> Says

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
do that it's kind of like Simon Says

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.450 
do that it's kind of like Simon Says
they're<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.409> gonna<00:01:10.500> follow<00:01:10.799> what<00:01:11.310> you're

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
they're just gonna follow what you're

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.859 
they're just gonna follow what you're
doing<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.790> kids<00:01:12.000> are<00:01:12.150> really<00:01:12.330> good<00:01:12.659> at

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
doing and kids are really good at

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.420 
doing and kids are really good at
following<00:01:13.320> they're<00:01:13.680> used<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.070> doing<00:01:14.220> that

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
following they're used to doing that

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.520 
following they're used to doing that
they're<00:01:14.700> used<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.970> mimicking<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.409> is

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
they're used to mimicking and so this is

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.890 
they're used to mimicking and so this is
an<00:01:16.650> excellent<00:01:16.890> way<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.700> them<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.060> learn

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
an excellent way for them to learn

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.899 
an excellent way for them to learn
skills<00:01:19.409> safely<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.369> all<00:01:20.460> we're<00:01:20.580> gonna<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:20.790> is

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
skills safely so all we're gonna do is

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.670 
skills safely so all we're gonna do is
take<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.119> right<00:01:21.360> arm<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.990> parallel<00:01:22.380> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
take a right arm up to parallel and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.499 
take a right arm up to parallel and
bring<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.100> down<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:23.880> take<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> left<00:01:24.390> arm

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
bring it down so we take the left arm

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.870 
bring it down so we take the left arm
same<00:01:24.810> thing<00:01:24.990> up<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.320> parallel<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.920> down<00:01:26.610> then

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
same thing up to parallel and down then

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.370 
same thing up to parallel and down then
we're<00:01:26.970> gonna<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> right<00:01:27.420> again<00:01:27.689> as<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
we're gonna do the right again as the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.410 
we're gonna do the right again as the
arm<00:01:28.530> comes<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> shoulder<00:01:29.460> goes<00:01:29.640> low<00:01:29.880> your

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
arm comes up the shoulder goes low your

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.359 
arm comes up the shoulder goes low your
