00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
both your screws back up then once you

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.580 
both your screws back up then once you
put<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.650> plate<00:02:28.130> back<00:02:28.190> on<00:02:28.900> you'll<00:02:29.900> notice<00:02:30.320> that

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
put the plate back on you'll notice that

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.500 
put the plate back on you'll notice that
the<00:02:31.400> blades<00:02:31.760> are<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.060> lot<00:02:32.360> closer<00:02:32.660> together

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
the blades are a lot closer together

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.260 
the blades are a lot closer together
okay<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:36.080> makes<00:02:36.320> for<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.890> sharper<00:02:37.730> cut

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
okay and that makes for a sharper cut

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.510 
okay and that makes for a sharper cut
