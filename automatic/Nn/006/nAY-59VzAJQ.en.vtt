00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hey people cool it looks today 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.940
 I have my tips and tricks 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.440
 in terms of make-up I have in fact 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.960
 Often the last time you ask 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.059
 get what you do tutorial yet 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.690
 something with make-up and here comes 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.550
 Here is my best of what I have mine 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.460
 everyday make-up so noticed 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:26.310
 Let's go my tip number one is that 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.349
 a knock from the concealer i prefer 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.269
 because of a brush because through 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.550
 the body heat the product just a lot 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.969
 Melted better with the skin and you 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.230
 a more natural result 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.760
 do not forget the inside angle 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.629
 because that makes you wake up later 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.370
 look and radiant I give by the way 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.649
 still a bit concealer about mine 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.329
 eyelids so that the redness there 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.250
 simply be compensated 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.710
 the cool thing is that the concealer 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.600
 here simultaneously as a base works 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.730
 that is, the nitsch had the man 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.070
 after that keeps on wearing much better because 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.340
 he has a creamy consistency to stick 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.159
 I can not do that by nature 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.720
 strong lip contour I always give 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.790
 a bit of concealer around the edge 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.900
 my lips around the simply defined 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.000
 to look like 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.560
 So if you still lipstick afterwards 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.580
 Of course, he will then apply as well 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.110
 much more precise and accurate we come from 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.240
 to my favorite supports that 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.369
 Highlighter is for dry skin 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.770
 an absolute must because he skin 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.020
 makes you look healthier and radiant 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.720
 as I clearly prefer cream 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.640
 textures here because they last longer and 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.930
 the skin is not yet powdery and 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.930
 look artificial 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.159
 surplus product you can 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.460
 Of course, also on the marble floor 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.590
 So basically distribute the border 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.390
 her upper lip around the whole 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.479
 a bit voluminous looking fuller too 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.479
 to let 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.340
 I generally only demand my t zone 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.869
 and the poor part because the concealer 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.090
 here already fast in small 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.060
 Creases could slip and as well 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.750
 I meet only because when mixing could 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.429
 parts of the foundation or primer 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.239
 slip or maybe even completely 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.769
 be removed because I know that 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.019
 many of you have problems with the egg 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.150
 countries have come here my 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.060
 Solution simply with a thin precise 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.310
 brush tighten near the lash 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.870
 if the line is not perfect now 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.160
 it does not notice anybody because of that 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.690
 eyeshadows are much softer transitions 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.489
 generated as for example a 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.829
 I always make mascara two 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.049
 to get passes and more volume 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.390
 It also does not help the eyelashes 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.790
 just to fight through, but also 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.590
 with the mascara a little way and 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.030
 to wiggle it with the eyelashes 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.030
 looks particularly full 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.610
 sometimes my browns get a little bit over 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.920
 fat and too dark but the whole can 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.720
 to weaken one by simply using one 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.459
 a bit you can go over it 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.010
 that leaves everything natural again 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.150
 The more you wear on the more look 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.150
 more color comes down again 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.140
 the less worries i take mine 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.209
 want to make lips piece the matter 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.850
 my choice will be somebody 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.800
 lipstick the longer the and keeps 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.150
 best stop with me such lipp staines 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.150
 the quasi dry on the lips 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.980
 why then at the end of it 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.140
 Now I would go for example 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.350
 wear when I go shopping in the cinema 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.540
 So go a little bit more time 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.520
 but I do not have make-up 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.770
 so split up and cleaned up 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.480
 But he does not want to be so chic 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.310
 to send me what I mean 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.200
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.790
 if so, if I'm really great 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.380
 look over a dam high 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.720
 and if you still do not have enough 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.380
