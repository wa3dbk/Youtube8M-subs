00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
of a space my hair grows and it doesn't

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.470 
of a space my hair grows and it doesn't
go<00:02:53.170> in<00:02:53.350> as<00:02:53.530> thick<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.160> it's<00:02:54.760> not<00:02:54.940> from<00:02:55.120> damage

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
expect the locks in the back to be a

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.210 
expect the locks in the back to be a
little<00:03:00.460> bit<00:03:00.670> smaller<00:03:01.440> but<00:03:02.440> today<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:03.100> feels

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
little bit smaller but today it feels

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.220 
little bit smaller but today it feels
like<00:03:03.400> i<00:03:03.550> have<00:03:03.700> no<00:03:04.030> locks<00:03:04.360> in<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.600> bed<00:03:05.340> none<00:03:10.230> and

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
like i have no locks in the bed none and

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.210

these are ones that i recently combined

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.500
