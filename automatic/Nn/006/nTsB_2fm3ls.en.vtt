00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.480
 or the girls, how are they doing? 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.599
 we are the new recipe i am going to make 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.120
 some macaroni with meat in my channel 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.180
 I also have the recipe with meat from 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.220
 can then is to record this 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.619
 because to establish with common ground meat 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.980
 we go with fresh meat that neither with the 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.369
 I mean it's not from the dehesas and not 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.109
 it's good meat in the little box 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.170
 information below I will leave you to 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.180
 how to make homemade tomato sauce 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.710
 so I'm not going to explain it in this 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.840
 video because if it would be very long then 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.300
 but they puncture them there and there they go 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.649
 directly sauce recipe as 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.460
 come here I have some cherry tomatoes for 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.340
 do it right now 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.050
 on the other hand we will need macaroni and 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.879
 in this case to use the types pens of 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.179
 the island brand can use 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.640
 I have bought any meat 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:59.510
 beef and pork 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.899
 of mercadona and in turn to the flesh 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.760
 I'll take onion and garlic and oregano 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.869
 that nothing for the bad guys to good guys 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.869
 we have boiling water 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.850
 with him his cousins 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.659
 in 15 minutes always stirring for 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.659
 that does not stick 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:43.350
 about 10-15 minutes moments and here 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.259
 I have the tomato sauce zulia 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.240
 so let's hope it's done to 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.220
 can crush now in a pan I've 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.369
 put a little oil as you see very 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.520
 little and nothing is already hot so 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.859
 now I'm going to add 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.840
 frying for meat that on the one hand 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.840
 chopped chopped onion 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:18.470
 because the meat would be a little 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:21.700
 and it gives a taste 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.700
 and we are going to add now 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.890
 granites we are going to 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.320
 adore the bugs 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.290
 a little bit of back and forth and then 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.580
 we add the both with this color 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.860
 little gold so now I'm going to add the 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.830
 meat that we previously gave it a 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.460
 little hands so that it is not so 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.460
 so whole 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.710
 and I always recommend that you use a 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.980
 beef cow mixture because the 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.620
 always buy with pork 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.879
 because that's even softer 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.879
 market does not have a turkey chicken 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.209
 very soft if you like the taste of 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.459
 meat for better beef and pork but 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.680
 let's leave it botany pretty 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.540
 rich 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.049
 Very gentleman 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.049
 com 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.340
 all good 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.340
 and we're going to be a little glory 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.480
 I have is here a little bit because you 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.480
 gives 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.470
 we do not leave it behind 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.690
 It is a somewhat laborious but good dish 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.750
 then the flavors for a day that 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.430
 come to eat food have a 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.670
 community that is not very complicated either 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.980
 do 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.980
 and at the same time well enough 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.870
 we are not going to add here to simmer 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:49.550
 and we're going around and now we're going to 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.550
 pass the sauce that I have here and 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.600
 the landlady is much healthier than the one 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.860
 come in boats is much more tasty because 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.210
 is that it is much more tasty is not it 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.850
 the landlady herself to vote 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.410
 sincerely and do not waste so much time 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.410
 in doing it 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.760
 the devotee is like more brute stronger and 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.550
 it does not let you even taste what 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.550
 you are going to eat nor do you know the same 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.400
 we keep adding 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.460
 I 'm pretty much done with some 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.460
 a lot of tomato 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.760
 because with a little bit then you have to 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:53.780
 ah 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.780
 even bonus 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.520
 flick and villa 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.590
 and we add the latest 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.649
 we finished returning everything 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.240
 Well, it is more liquid 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.320
 and once we have the final point 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.740
 where the flower starts to be 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.850
 we turn off the room 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.900
 and we went to throw on the we are going to 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.900
 put the sauce 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.940
 yes 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.210
 we mix everything now 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.289
 and well we would have ready the 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:31.000
 macaroni with meat sar nothing else 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:34.479
 simply here we already have it already 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.030
 Plated as they see an exquisite pint 

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:40.210
 to eat and if you want, you can see 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:42.099
 top grated cheese as you want and if 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.270
 they do not eat it like that so nothing 

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:44.979
 I hope you liked these 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.590
 recipes that put it into practice if it is 

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:49.509
 so they already tell me what they thought and 

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:52.470
 nothing I do not have in the next video a 

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:52.470
 kiss and see you later
