 hello what numbers I'm faded g30 in this video I'll show you the 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.899
 subliminal messages from the revolver album of the famous band debits 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.230
 before starting this is not a pitcher and fucking video that you fuck your mother with a 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.750
 fucking ugly face and a horrible scream well let's start first track what 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.570
 first you have to analyze the revolver symbol that can mean 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.590
 of a revolver I already know that this may sound stupid but it's true 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.470
 let's continue according to what revolver can be interpreted at the change of two 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.069
 people like paul and the impostor 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:35.710
 second track on the cover clearly you can see that Paul unlike 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.820
 the other vehicles are looking in another direction suggesting that it is no longer 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.870
 of the moyano band is related to them 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.650
 3rd track equal on the cover to the top of the cover on the corner 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.120
 left there is an outstretched hand on Paul's head that in Hindu culture 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.300
 means he is dead 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.870
 fourth track in the songs also somewhat hidden and in the first song 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.950
 titled tackman there is a part where you can pray singing 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.380
 if not 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.990
 you will wonder why I put it on so stop wondering just why 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.550
 york says 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.040
 ain and that does not mean translated tax man means taxidermist for 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.890
 those who do not have a dictionary or simply give them or eva taxidermista 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.240
 means person who dissects bodies and that perhaps would mean that Paul 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.990
 is dead is this track in the yellow submarine song can you 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.930
 interpret that the seal or submarine is Paul's coffin can also be 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.400
 refer to that the land of the submarines can be a cemetery and 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.400
 then the words chÃ¡vez are mentioned 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.410
 came and adobe 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.630
 before it a submarine refers casket 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.550
