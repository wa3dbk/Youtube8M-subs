I've literally been living off of amazon
for<00:00:24.960> like<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.170> past<00:00:25.199> three<00:00:25.710> weeks<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:26.250> I

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
for like the past three weeks that I

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.880 
for like the past three weeks that I
just<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.090> didn't<00:00:27.869> really<00:00:28.109> have<00:00:28.199> an<00:00:28.380> idea<00:00:28.619> for<00:00:28.680> a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
just I didn't really have an idea for a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.349 
just I didn't really have an idea for a
video<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.429> only<00:00:29.580> thing<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:29.970> thought

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
video and the only thing that I thought

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.510 
video and the only thing that I thought
would<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.599> really<00:00:30.990> appropriate<00:00:31.349> would<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
would be really appropriate would be to

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.520 
would be really appropriate would be to
do<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:33.030> video<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.750> what<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.290> get<00:00:34.410> your
