00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 and basically the ingredients that one 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.990
 have to have to put together a garden 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.179
 vertical are practically any 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.549
 container that one has is made of plastic 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.650
 glass metal how important 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.240
 use materials that will last 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.619
 so you do not have to be putting together your 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.619
 orchard every two months 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:30.429
 a mixture or a substrate then in 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:34.000
 this case will be 40% land 40% humus 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.470
 and 20% rice husk one plant the 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.480
 that the one you want is going to be 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.250
 long then the first step is to hang 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.870
 the kangaroo in this case let's ride it 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.309
 in a living piece of furniture that are 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.680
 easels that we made ourselves 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.970
 in wood but really the surface 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.860
 it can be anyone can be a wall 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.500
 it can be a window can be a grate 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.379
 it can be up to a video we're going to do 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.949
 the sowing of aromatic herbs in 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.949
 this case 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.760
 the second step is to put there 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.500
 about one third of those in the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.170
 mix of earth that one has say 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.490
 as the bed once done this pulls the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.080
 plant of the bag in which it comes 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.940
 shakes a little bit of the old earth in the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.940
 that comes from planting the plant 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.320
 next to the basil we are going to plant 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:22.119
 a rosemary the rosemary is a bush is of 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.880
 the most enduring herbs so more 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.880
 resistant to lack of water 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.500
 and as a last step the root is covered well 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.180
 it does not necessarily have to be very 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.369
 very pressed very espicha very 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.810
 compressed but if we say should that 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.159
 sufficiently covered to the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.140
 roots have a good space of 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.680
 the fundamentals of growth 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.259
 herbs in general is that they should prune 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.450
 very often and by pruning I mean 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.880
 literally to tear off a twig and 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.240
 take it to the salad table or the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.040
 pasta table with tomato sauce 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.119
 let's say the more you use it the more 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.920
 Pretty is going to wear and more will last 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.840
 you get water because the plant just 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.610
 planted let 's say it 's badly treated and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.789
 then it requires water so that it does not 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.769
 he will die later if he is outside and 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.209
 in bogotÃ¡ giorgio irrigation almost all 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.450
 days for him because the dry wind 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.030
 much 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.550
 urban agriculture is no longer a 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.860
 Fashion is a necessity and what better way 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.480
 to begin that in his own house he has 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.190
 demonstrated that a large 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.290
 space that is not required in 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.280
 special conditions or technology 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.280
 high range to do it
