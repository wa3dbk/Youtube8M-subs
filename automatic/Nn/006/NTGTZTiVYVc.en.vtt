00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
 he comes back to league of legends me 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.799
 I'm back on the pcs servers 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.990
 Introduce your syndrome today at lant 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.570
 a new kid for sandra whose it 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.470
 currently on the wsv managed and 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.080
 this water theme 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:18.369
 he involves catching Rector with 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.630
 the first part namely dax sees here 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.640
 one already comes so a small ball 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.310
 and find quite cool effect if that 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.810
 dissolves and then perforated as the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.740
 then bursts on I find a very 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.020
 cool and I like it a lot 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.520
 Let's continue with force on this 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.960
 is our second step to grab it 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.550
 we are one unit or one of ours 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.620
 then balls can already look quite 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.600
 funny from when we will kick them 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.570
 such a small water effect is on 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.320
 every case made very cool and 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.080
 cabaret for the third game namely 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.630
 gallery weekend Albig we do our 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.790
 balls and also all opponents forward 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.230
 and yes, if adversaries hit 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.600
 We will thank the opponent 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.700
 if we do it with a ball 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.300
 I'll meet you and I'll show you that now 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.520
 yes and if this again so natural 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.549
 are effective water so very horny on 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.810
 not bad in any case 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.790
 and now the little one is planning ahead of me 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.850
 Run away just because you see fast 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.360
 he has to run in the last resort 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.920
 our ultimate in power 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.510
 yes our all our bullet forward 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.220
 throws at the opponent and 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.060
 accordingly causing harm per 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.190
 I have ball and the spread myself 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.200
 not even looked at so for me 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.610
 then completely new then we would be here one 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.040
 make ball and there would be again 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.940
 Ultima on the now higher one looks completely 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.740
 good from actually 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.330
 of course, then the balls are all 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.650
 here on the floor around that view 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.880
 children are not very good, I have to say 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.159
 I would say I'll show you now 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.080
 just the fashion and then too good 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.700
 Last of course, the recall 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.810
 well, then I'll be quiet for so long and you 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.810
 look at the ocean 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.560
 that was once the fashion comes now 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.070
 Of course, last but not least the recall 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.930
 of course a little bit, too 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.030
 different if I made it cool 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.410
 Write me the comments what you from 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.380
 the skin I think I find complete 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.270
 funny as a water film skin, I think 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.720
 very successful what also perfect for 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.690
 sin with these balls could be very 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.640
 implement good I find and shadow times 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.960
 would buy purely visually or if he was 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.200
 totally misses and then I would 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.000
 say 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.570
 Let's see how the next video looks like 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.570
