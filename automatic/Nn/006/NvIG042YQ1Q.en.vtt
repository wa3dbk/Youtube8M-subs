00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
sailboat and I'm having engine problems

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.800 
sailboat and I'm having engine problems
can't<00:00:18.220> get<00:00:18.310> the<00:00:18.369> fuel<00:00:18.580> line's<00:00:18.820> primed<00:00:19.330> up<00:00:19.570> so

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
can't get the fuel line's primed up so

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.620 
can't get the fuel line's primed up so
I'm<00:00:19.960> gonna<00:00:20.110> have<00:00:20.740> to<00:00:20.830> take<00:00:20.949> off<00:00:21.160> the<00:00:21.670> fuel<00:00:22.330> pump

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
I'm gonna have to take off the fuel pump

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.859 
I'm gonna have to take off the fuel pump
and<00:00:22.779> see<00:00:23.710> if<00:00:23.769> there's<00:00:23.949> any<00:00:24.039> issues<00:00:24.400> there<00:00:24.869> so

and see if there's any issues there so

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:41.250 
and see if there's any issues there so
this<00:00:26.230> is<00:00:26.410> where<00:00:26.589> I<00:00:26.619> get<00:00:26.830> to<00:00:26.890> my<00:00:27.160> engine<00:00:30.089> takeoff

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.340 

I<00:00:41.320> guess<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:43.450> is<00:00:43.660> just<00:00:43.690> to<00:00:43.930> collect<00:00:44.110> some

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
I guess this is just to collect some

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.160 
I guess this is just to collect some
fuel<00:00:44.760> spills<00:00:45.760> down<00:00:46.690> here<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:48.780> fuel<00:00:49.780> pump<00:00:50.080> is

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
fuel spills down here and fuel pump is

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.370 
fuel spills down here and fuel pump is
in<00:00:50.260> a<00:00:50.350> very<00:00:50.530> awkward<00:00:50.770> place<00:00:51.870> see<00:00:52.870> if<00:00:52.930> we<00:00:53.110> can't

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
in a very awkward place see if we can't

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.700 
in a very awkward place see if we can't
show<00:00:53.680> you<00:00:53.710> where<00:00:54.040> I'm<00:00:54.190> going<00:00:54.340> to<00:00:54.400> work<00:00:54.520> at<00:00:54.820> here

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
show you where I'm going to work at here

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.600 
show you where I'm going to work at here
that<00:00:56.710> is<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:58.030> fuel<00:00:58.450> pump<00:00:58.810> and<00:00:59.140> as<00:01:00.070> you<00:01:00.280> can<00:01:00.400> see

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
that is the fuel pump and as you can see

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.180 
that is the fuel pump and as you can see
I'm<00:01:00.820> working<00:01:01.090> with<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.240> universal<00:01:02.190> diesel

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
I'm working with a universal diesel

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.219 
I'm working with a universal diesel
engine<00:01:03.580> model<00:01:04.180> you<00:01:04.600> can't<00:01:04.780> read<00:01:04.900> it<00:01:04.989> but<00:01:05.080> says

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
engine model you can't read it but says

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.590 
engine model you can't read it but says
five<00:01:05.860> four<00:01:06.520> one<00:01:06.909> one<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:09.180> I'm<00:01:10.180> actually<00:01:10.390> going

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
five four one one and I'm actually going

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.000 
five four one one and I'm actually going
to<00:01:10.660> go<00:01:10.750> to<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:10.930> different<00:01:11.140> compartment<00:01:11.920> of<00:01:11.980> the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
to go to a different compartment of the

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.240 
to go to a different compartment of the
boat<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.640> see<00:01:12.820> if<00:01:12.910> I<00:01:12.970> can<00:01:13.120> reach<00:01:13.300> F<00:01:13.480> fuel<00:01:14.380> pump

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.120 

so<00:01:18.250> I<00:01:18.280> had<00:01:18.640> to<00:01:18.700> buy<00:01:18.910> a<00:01:19.330> special<00:01:19.990> wrench<00:01:20.170> well

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
so I had to buy a special wrench well

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.620 
so I had to buy a special wrench well
it's<00:01:21.250> not<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:21.400> special<00:01:21.760> but<00:01:21.970> I<00:01:22.150> needed<00:01:22.510> a

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
it's not that special but I needed a

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.860 
it's not that special but I needed a
wrench<00:01:22.810> with<00:01:23.100> minimal<00:01:24.100> amount<00:01:24.370> of<00:01:24.870> excess

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
wrench with minimal amount of excess

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.420 
wrench with minimal amount of excess
metal<00:01:26.200> and<00:01:26.440> a<00:01:26.500> sex<00:01:26.770> I<00:01:26.950> don't<00:01:26.980> have<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:27.250> lot<00:01:27.400> of

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
metal and a sex I don't have a lot of

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.149 
metal and a sex I don't have a lot of
room<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.670> work<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:29.110> we'll<00:01:29.230> see<00:01:29.409> if<00:01:29.680> this<00:01:29.890> tool

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
room to work but we'll see if this tool

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:30.690 
room to work but we'll see if this tool
works

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
works

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.880 
works
if<00:01:31.110> not<00:01:32.110> we'll<00:01:32.260> have<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.500> try<00:01:32.650> something

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
if not we'll have to try something

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.490 
if not we'll have to try something
different<00:01:32.980> but<00:01:33.720> I'm<00:01:34.720> gonna<00:01:34.870> climb<00:01:35.080> up<00:01:35.290> over

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
different but I'm gonna climb up over

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:45.120 
different but I'm gonna climb up over
here<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:35.860> get<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.909> listening<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:44.130> nuts

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
here and get just listening the nuts

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.360 
here and get just listening the nuts
were<00:01:45.550> sliding<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:47.170> mount<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.650> fuel<00:01:48.070> pump

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
were sliding this mount the fuel pump

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.000 
were sliding this mount the fuel pump
and<00:01:48.870> we'll<00:01:49.870> take<00:01:50.110> it<00:01:50.229> off<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.470> open<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:50.799> up<00:01:50.890> and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
and we'll take it off and open it up and

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.469 
and we'll take it off and open it up and
see<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:52.630> you<00:01:52.750> can't<00:01:52.990> find<00:01:53.200> any<00:01:53.380> gunk<00:01:53.740> or<00:01:54.479> any

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
see if you can't find any gunk or any

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.000 
see if you can't find any gunk or any
issues<00:01:55.900> why<00:01:56.110> it<00:01:56.590> won't<00:01:56.979> work

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.630 

I<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:04.600> actually<00:02:05.140> reach<00:02:05.740> that<00:02:05.950> first<00:02:06.310> nut

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
I can actually reach that first nut

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.260 
I can actually reach that first nut
easier<00:02:07.150> from<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:07.660> side<00:02:07.930> oh<00:02:08.970> well<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.119> other

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
easier from this side oh well the other

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.350 
easier from this side oh well the other
one<00:02:10.570> I<00:02:10.600> had<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:11.850> definitely<00:02:12.850> had<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.030> be<00:02:13.150> over

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
one I had to definitely had to be over

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:26.640 
one I had to definitely had to be over
there<00:02:21.180> should<00:02:22.180> come<00:02:22.210> off<00:02:25.500> I've<00:02:26.500> actually

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
there should come off I've actually

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.530 
there should come off I've actually
already<00:02:26.950> disconnected<00:02:28.470> some<00:02:29.470> hoses<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:30.540> don't

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
already disconnected some hoses so don't

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.300 
already disconnected some hoses so don't
worry<00:02:31.870> about<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.350> right<00:02:32.530> now

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.620 

here<00:02:36.310> is<00:02:37.470> my<00:02:38.470> fuel<00:02:38.950> pump<00:02:40.830> it's<00:02:41.830> an<00:02:41.890> automatic

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
here is my fuel pump it's an automatic

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.420 
here is my fuel pump it's an automatic
electrical<00:02:43.630> fuel<00:02:43.840> pump<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.380> if<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.040> just<00:02:45.250> take

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
electrical fuel pump and if I just take

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.970 
electrical fuel pump and if I just take
these<00:02:45.550> screws<00:02:45.880> off<00:02:46.060> I<00:02:46.210> can<00:02:46.360> open<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.720> up<00:02:46.980> and

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
these screws off I can open it up and

00:02:47.980 --> 00:03:00.340 
these screws off I can open it up and
not<00:02:48.220> cleaning<00:02:48.700> out<00:02:48.820> if<00:02:48.970> I<00:02:49.060> have<00:02:49.240> to

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.530 

you

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.640 

so<00:03:04.540> here's<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.500> manual<00:03:06.040> primer<00:03:06.460> that<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.030> got<00:03:07.650> for

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
so here's a manual primer that I got for

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.140 
so here's a manual primer that I got for
my<00:03:08.710> 5/8<00:03:09.610> hose<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:11.460> squeeze<00:03:12.460> this<00:03:12.640> make<00:03:12.910> sure

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
my 5/8 hose and squeeze this make sure

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.800 
my 5/8 hose and squeeze this make sure
there's<00:03:13.570> no<00:03:14.260> issues<00:03:14.620> with<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.510> fuel<00:03:16.510> line

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
there's no issues with the fuel line

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.430 
there's no issues with the fuel line
itself<00:03:18.270> it<00:03:19.270> is<00:03:19.360> possible<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:20.110> it<00:03:20.290> got

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
itself it is possible that it got

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.310 
itself it is possible that it got
clogged<00:03:20.740> up<00:03:20.890> from<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:22.390> tanks<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:22.990> we<00:03:23.140> just

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
clogged up from the tanks so we just

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.900 
clogged up from the tanks so we just
squeeze<00:03:23.650> this<00:03:23.830> a<00:03:23.890> couple<00:03:24.220> of<00:03:24.280> times

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
squeeze this a couple of times

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.830 
squeeze this a couple of times
stir<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:25.900> over<00:03:25.990> here<00:03:26.200> on<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.320> paper<00:03:26.500> towel<00:03:26.710> and

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
stir it over here on the paper towel and

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.680 
stir it over here on the paper towel and
yes<00:03:28.840> we<00:03:29.340> do<00:03:30.340> have<00:03:30.520> fuel<00:03:30.820> so<00:03:31.150> that's<00:03:31.360> actually<00:03:31.480> a

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
yes we do have fuel so that's actually a

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.840 
yes we do have fuel so that's actually a
good<00:03:31.720> sign<00:03:32.050> for<00:03:32.320> that<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:33.160> now<00:03:33.310> we<00:03:33.370> know<00:03:33.580> it's

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
good sign for that so now we know it's

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.940 
good sign for that so now we know it's
an<00:03:33.940> issue<00:03:34.060> with<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:36.190> pump<00:03:36.520> to<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:38.440> fuel

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
an issue with the the pump to the fuel

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.760 
an issue with the the pump to the fuel
filter<00:03:39.720> which<00:03:40.720> is<00:03:40.750> actually<00:03:41.140> where<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.350> tried

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
filter which is actually where I tried

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.540 
filter which is actually where I tried
to<00:03:41.890> bleed<00:03:42.100> it<00:03:42.250> from<00:03:42.460> originally<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.900> never

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
to bleed it from originally and I never

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.010 
to bleed it from originally and I never
got<00:03:45.550> any<00:03:45.730> fuel<00:03:46.030> coming<00:03:46.300> out<00:03:46.480> of<00:03:46.600> that<00:03:46.690> so

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
got any fuel coming out of that so

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.860 
got any fuel coming out of that so
that's<00:03:47.950> how<00:03:48.700> I<00:03:48.730> know<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:49.000> have<00:03:49.240> an<00:03:49.330> issue<00:03:49.450> with

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
that's how I know I have an issue with

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.590 
that's how I know I have an issue with
the<00:03:50.290> pump

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.380 

okay<00:03:56.600> so<00:03:56.660> I've<00:03:57.380> already<00:03:57.590> reinstalled<00:03:58.400> the

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
okay so I've already reinstalled the

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.380 
okay so I've already reinstalled the
fuel<00:04:00.110> pump<00:04:00.440> here<00:04:00.710> and<00:04:01.340> what<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:01.910> did<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:02.180> just

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
fuel pump here and what I did I just

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.990 
fuel pump here and what I did I just
took<00:04:02.690> this<00:04:02.960> tank<00:04:03.200> plate<00:04:03.470> off<00:04:03.820> spread<00:04:04.820> it<00:04:04.910> out

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
took this tank plate off spread it out

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.450 
took this tank plate off spread it out
with<00:04:05.060> some<00:04:05.300> wd-40<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.170> just<00:04:06.950> kind<00:04:07.160> of<00:04:07.190> cleaned

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
with some wd-40 and just kind of cleaned

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.840 
with some wd-40 and just kind of cleaned
it<00:04:07.610> out<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.750> we<00:04:08.870> should<00:04:08.900> have<00:04:09.230> fuel<00:04:09.500> in<00:04:10.340> our

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
it out so we should have fuel in our

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.120 
it out so we should have fuel in our
fuel<00:04:11.090> line<00:04:11.300> going<00:04:11.570> directly<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:11.990> the<00:04:12.110> pump<00:04:12.380> so

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
fuel line going directly to the pump so

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.200 
fuel line going directly to the pump so
we're<00:04:13.280> going<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.460> do<00:04:13.580> we're<00:04:13.820> going<00:04:13.910> to<00:04:13.970> crank

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
we're going to do we're going to crank

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.300 
we're going to do we're going to crank
it<00:04:14.330> over<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.600> few<00:04:14.720> times<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:15.740> see<00:04:15.920> if<00:04:16.010> we<00:04:16.100> can't

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
it over a few times and see if we can't

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.680 
it over a few times and see if we can't
get<00:04:16.430> any<00:04:16.640> fuel<00:04:16.850> coming<00:04:17.090> out<00:04:17.269> of<00:04:17.390> this<00:04:17.480> nozzle

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
get any fuel coming out of this nozzle

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.530 
get any fuel coming out of this nozzle
and<00:04:18.049> then<00:04:18.830> I<00:04:18.890> fuel<00:04:19.459> comes<00:04:19.640> out<00:04:19.790> we<00:04:19.910> know<00:04:20.060> that

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
and then I fuel comes out we know that

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.810 
and then I fuel comes out we know that
our<00:04:20.660> pump<00:04:20.870> is<00:04:20.959> fine<00:04:21.140> and<00:04:21.440> we'll<00:04:22.220> just<00:04:22.400> we'll

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
our pump is fine and we'll just we'll

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:31.089 
our pump is fine and we'll just we'll
work<00:04:22.970> from<00:04:23.090> there

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:31.099 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:32.790

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
connected this manual pump directly to

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.629 
connected this manual pump directly to
the<00:04:40.180> fuel<00:04:40.599> lines<00:04:40.870> it's<00:04:41.740> closed<00:04:42.099> directly<00:04:42.490> to

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
the fuel lines it's closed directly to

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.490 
the fuel lines it's closed directly to
the<00:04:42.729> fuel<00:04:43.000> filter<00:04:43.330> here<00:04:43.569> where<00:04:44.110> I<00:04:44.139> have<00:04:44.379> the
