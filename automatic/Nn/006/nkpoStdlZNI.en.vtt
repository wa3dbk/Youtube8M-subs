more<00:00:29.179> willing<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.420> aggressive<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.929> offense

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
more willing to be aggressive on offense

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.639 
more willing to be aggressive on offense
take<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> few<00:00:31.949> more<00:00:32.099> chances<00:00:32.340> ah<00:00:33.620> no<00:00:34.620> I

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
take a few more chances ah no I

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.299 
take a few more chances ah no I
shouldn't<00:00:35.280> say<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.059> think<00:00:37.100> we<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.129> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
shouldn't say that I think we have to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.970 
shouldn't say that I think we have to
keep<00:00:38.489> playing<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> same<00:00:38.940> way<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.510> then<00:00:39.980> Marty

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
keep playing the same way and then Marty

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.610 
keep playing the same way and then Marty
is<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.280> add<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.940> his<00:00:42.200> tremendous<00:00:43.200> game

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
is going to add with his tremendous game

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.900 
is going to add with his tremendous game
so<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.579> thinking<00:00:45.300> can<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:47.430> obviously<00:00:47.640> take

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
so I thinking can we can obviously take

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.779 
so I thinking can we can obviously take
take<00:00:48.570> take<00:00:48.780> more<00:00:49.110> steps<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:49.950> be<00:00:50.550> more

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
take take more steps to and we be more

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.650 
take take more steps to and we be more
solid<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.510> i<00:00:52.379> wouldn't<00:00:53.219> say<00:00:53.399> i'm<00:00:53.660> cheating

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
solid but i wouldn't say i'm cheating

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.209 
solid but i wouldn't say i'm cheating
more<00:00:54.870> offensively<00:00:55.410> or<00:00:55.530> defensively<00:00:58.160> than<00:00:59.160> i

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219

earlier you guys seem to struggle a
little<00:01:52.649> bit<00:01:52.799> here<00:01:53.070> at<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> rock<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:54.590> don't<00:01:55.590> know

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
little bit here at the rock I don't know

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.060 
little bit here at the rock I don't know
we<00:01:55.770> talked<00:01:55.979> about<00:01:56.070> mostly<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> just<00:01:58.070> competed

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
we talked about mostly I just competed

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.170 
we talked about mostly I just competed
and<00:01:59.130> stain<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.579> our<00:01:59.729> game<00:02:00.030> and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
and stain on our game and

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.470 
and stain on our game and
you<00:02:01.420> know<00:02:01.540> be<00:02:01.720> consistent<00:02:02.290> and<00:02:02.350> when<00:02:03.480> when

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
you know be consistent and when when

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.740 
you know be consistent and when when
when<00:02:04.840> tight<00:02:05.110> games<00:02:05.410> or<00:02:06.450> high-scoring<00:02:07.450> games

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
when tight games or high-scoring games

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.359 
when tight games or high-scoring games
and<00:02:08.020> if<00:02:08.110> you're<00:02:08.229> able<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.590> do<00:02:08.740> that<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:08.979> think

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
and if you're able to do that I think

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.520 
and if you're able to do that I think
you<00:02:10.300> can<00:02:10.450> put<00:02:10.600> your<00:02:10.690> safe<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:10.990> safe<00:02:11.320> when

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
you can put your safe and safe when

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.110 
you can put your safe and safe when
position<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.070> win<00:02:12.220> every<00:02:12.370> night<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.880> that's

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
position to win every night and that's

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.860 
position to win every night and that's
that's<00:02:13.870> what<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.080> want<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.350> do<00:02:14.440> when<00:02:15.370> your<00:02:15.550> goal

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
that's what I want to do when your goal

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.000 
that's what I want to do when your goal
at<00:02:16.870> what<00:02:17.050> point<00:02:17.200> did<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.440> decide<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.830> you

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
at what point did you decide that you

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.860 
at what point did you decide that you
were<00:02:18.070> going<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.280> shoot<00:02:18.520> ah<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:21.310> came<00:02:21.730> up<00:02:21.940> Emma<00:02:23.040> I

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
were going to shoot ah I came up Emma I

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.660 
were going to shoot ah I came up Emma I
didn't<00:02:25.870> think<00:02:26.020> at<00:02:26.709> first<00:02:26.920> maybe<00:02:27.160> I<00:02:27.280> first<00:02:27.550> I

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
didn't think at first maybe I first I

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.070 
didn't think at first maybe I first I
thought<00:02:27.850> I<00:02:27.910> could<00:02:28.209> beat<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.570> may<00:02:28.690> be<00:02:28.750> white<00:02:29.050> but

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
thought I could beat it may be white but

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.500 
thought I could beat it may be white but
after<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.400> backed<00:02:30.610> off<00:02:30.850> little<00:02:31.240> bit<00:02:31.360> and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
after that you backed off little bit and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.790 
after that you backed off little bit and
I<00:02:31.600> just<00:02:32.020> try<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.230> shoot<00:02:32.590> like<00:02:34.560> trying<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.590> find
