00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.610 

I<00:00:05.029> was<00:00:06.029> asked<00:00:06.270> recently<00:00:06.299> how<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:06.930> produced<00:00:07.350> this

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
I was asked recently how I produced this

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.230 
I was asked recently how I produced this
toon<00:00:07.980> shader<00:00:08.010> effect<00:00:08.610> which<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:08.940> did<00:00:09.059> for<00:00:09.090> a

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
toon shader effect which I did for a

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.839 
toon shader effect which I did for a
student<00:00:09.510> film<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.929> couple<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.740> years<00:00:10.920> back<00:00:11.160> it's

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
student film a couple of years back it's

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.009 
student film a couple of years back it's
a<00:00:11.969> very<00:00:12.150> easy<00:00:12.330> thing<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.540> do<00:00:12.660> it's<00:00:12.809> not<00:00:12.840> too

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
a very easy thing to do it's not too

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.780 
a very easy thing to do it's not too
complicated<00:00:13.259> essentially<00:00:13.980> it's<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.400> two-toned

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
complicated essentially it's a two-toned

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.779 
complicated essentially it's a two-toned
ramp<00:00:15.089> shader<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:16.020> follows<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.920> light<00:00:17.310> angle

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
ramp shader that follows the light angle

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.170 
ramp shader that follows the light angle
so<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.539> demonstrate<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.289> viewport<00:00:19.650> here

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
so to demonstrate in the viewport here

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.689 
so to demonstrate in the viewport here
then<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.390> simple<00:00:21.750> spotlight<00:00:22.199> and

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
then we have a simple spotlight and

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.210 
then we have a simple spotlight and
essentially<00:00:23.699> just<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.869> ramp<00:00:25.650> shader<00:00:25.949> will

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
essentially just the ramp shader will

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.670 
essentially just the ramp shader will
react<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.730> wherever<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.150> light<00:00:27.330> hits<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.349> one

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
react to wherever the light hits so one

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.500 
react to wherever the light hits so one
color<00:00:28.920> will<00:00:29.070> be<00:00:29.130> produced<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.939> like<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
color will be produced for like the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.060 
color will be produced for like the
lighter<00:00:30.689> side<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.349> vice-versa<00:00:31.920> there

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
lighter side of it and vice-versa there

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.799 
lighter side of it and vice-versa there
be<00:00:32.160> another<00:00:32.340> color<00:00:32.550> would<00:00:33.239> use<00:00:33.420> for<00:00:33.690> that

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
be another color would use for that

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.620 
be another color would use for that
where<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.290> light<00:00:34.469> isn't<00:00:34.710> hitting<00:00:35.630> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
where the light isn't hitting the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.930 
where the light isn't hitting the
shaders<00:00:36.989> color<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:38.280> brightness<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.820> will

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
shaders color the brightness of it will

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.220 
shaders color the brightness of it will
also<00:00:39.059> be<00:00:39.270> affected<00:00:39.660> by<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> brightness<00:00:40.050> of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
also be affected by the brightness of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.110 
also be affected by the brightness of
the<00:00:40.260> light<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:41.190> there<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.610> thing<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.000> keep

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the light so there is one thing to keep

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.750 
the light so there is one thing to keep
in<00:00:42.180> mind<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.780> well<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> start<00:00:44.399> created<00:00:44.730> a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
in mind as well so to start created a

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.639 
in mind as well so to start created a
blank<00:00:44.969> scene<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.600> demonstrate<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.469> just

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
blank scene to demonstrate it so just

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.860 
blank scene to demonstrate it so just
for<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:46.860> completely<00:00:47.250> from<00:00:47.370> scratch<00:00:47.870> first

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
for it's completely from scratch first

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.180 
for it's completely from scratch first
I'm<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.079> create<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.289> helix<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.070> can

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
I'm going to create a helix just you can

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.619 
I'm going to create a helix just you can
any<00:00:50.370> piece<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.610> geometry<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:51.180> an<00:00:51.360> example

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
any piece of geometry just an example

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
any piece of geometry just an example
I've<00:00:52.530> chosen<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.010> helix<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.670> nice

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
I've chosen the helix it's just a nice

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.180 
I've chosen the helix it's just a nice
piece<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> shader<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.140> wrap<00:00:55.260> around<00:00:55.289> so

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
piece for the shader to wrap around so

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.529 
piece for the shader to wrap around so
we<00:00:56.280> bump<00:00:56.489> into<00:00:56.579> hyper<00:00:56.940> shading<00:00:57.270> see<00:00:57.420> there's

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
we bump into hyper shading see there's

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.029 
we bump into hyper shading see there's
nothing<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.870> nothing's<00:00:58.230> completely<00:00:58.590> new<00:00:58.770> if

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
nothing in nothing's completely new if

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.330 
nothing in nothing's completely new if
you<00:00:59.699> look<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> toon<00:01:00.420> tab<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.160> Maya

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
you look in the toon tab so in the Maya

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.709 
you look in the toon tab so in the Maya
tabs<00:01:02.699> at<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.940> top<00:01:03.000> there<00:01:03.329> should<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> tune

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
tabs at the top there should be a tune

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.840 
tabs at the top there should be a tune
one<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.409> want<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.769> 2-tone<00:01:05.220> light<00:01:05.489> angle

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
one we want the 2-tone light angle

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.830 
one we want the 2-tone light angle
shader<00:01:06.090> that's<00:01:06.390> what<00:01:06.510> we're<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> be

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
shader that's what we're going to be

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.240 
shader that's what we're going to be
working<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.320> there<00:01:07.860> are<00:01:07.950> other<00:01:08.070> tuned

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
working with there are other tuned

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.100 
working with there are other tuned
shaders<00:01:08.549> available<00:01:09.000> oil<00:01:09.180> meas<00:01:09.659> experiment

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
shaders available oil meas experiment

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.450 
shaders available oil meas experiment
rather<00:01:10.229> ones<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.070> one<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.280> I

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
rather ones this is just the one that I

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.000 
rather ones this is just the one that I
like<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.880> use<00:01:12.140> they<00:01:13.140> gave<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> result<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.770> liked

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
like to use they gave the result I liked

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.690 
like to use they gave the result I liked
so<00:01:14.909> secondly<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.020> create<00:01:16.200> light<00:01:16.700> you

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
so secondly we going to create light you

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700 
so secondly we going to create light you
need<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> light<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.570> your<00:01:19.229> scene<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.650> you

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
need a light in your scene if you

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.899 
need a light in your scene if you
haven't<00:01:19.890> got<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> light<00:01:20.220> then<00:01:20.490> nothing<00:01:20.820> will

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
haven't got a light then nothing will

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.520 
haven't got a light then nothing will
show<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.689> very<00:01:21.810> very<00:01:21.990> important<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
show up so it's very very important to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.410 
show up so it's very very important to
have<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.710> light<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.159> understand<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.270> it's

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
have a light and understand that it's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.330 
have a light and understand that it's
pointed<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> object<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.710> also<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
pointed out the object and also that the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.830 
pointed out the object and also that the
light<00:01:26.520> has<00:01:26.790> attributes<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.540> would<00:01:27.630> like

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
light has attributes that you would like

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.960 
light has attributes that you would like
so<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.920> cone<00:01:29.100> angle<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.640> hands<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.880> your

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
so the cone angle for the hands of your

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.300 
so the cone angle for the hands of your
spotlight<00:01:30.360> also<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.170> intensity<00:01:31.590> does<00:01:31.920> affect

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
spotlight also the intensity does affect

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.249 
spotlight also the intensity does affect
the<00:01:32.400> shader<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.790> well<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.869> also<00:01:34.020> may<00:01:34.229> want

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the shader as well so you also may want

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.960 
the shader as well so you also may want
to<00:01:34.439> keep<00:01:34.560> an<00:01:34.650> eye<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:35.040> as<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.670> very<00:01:35.729> easy

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
to keep an eye on that as it's very easy

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.690 
to keep an eye on that as it's very easy
to<00:01:36.030> blow<00:01:36.299> out<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.840> shader<00:01:37.619> or<00:01:37.920> equally<00:01:38.400> under

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
to blow out the shader or equally under

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.429 
to blow out the shader or equally under
expose<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.360> it'll<00:01:39.960> feel<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.380> not

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
expose it so it'll feel like it's not

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.030 
expose it so it'll feel like it's not
doing<00:01:40.590> anything<00:01:42.409> ok<00:01:43.409> cool<00:01:43.590> now<00:01:43.740> let's<00:01:43.829> jump

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
doing anything ok cool now let's jump

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.240 
doing anything ok cool now let's jump
over<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.579> render<00:01:45.180> view<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.950> generally

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
over to the render view and I generally

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.620 
over to the render view and I generally
like<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.369> do<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.790> mental<00:01:48.090> ray<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.479> find

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
like to do it in mental ray I just find

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.350 
like to do it in mental ray I just find
it<00:01:48.720> gives<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.930> bit<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.229> nicer<00:01:49.470> look<00:01:49.860> um<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
it gives a bit of a nicer look um the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.420 
it gives a bit of a nicer look um the
quads<00:01:51.600> below<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.009> render<00:01:53.220> settings

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
quads below so in the render settings

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.910 
quads below so in the render settings
you<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.820> pump<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.270> production<00:01:54.659> ability

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
you can pump up to production ability

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.959 
you can pump up to production ability
just<00:01:55.920> cause<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.369> don't<00:01:56.430> worry<00:01:56.610> about<00:01:56.790> render

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
just cause we don't worry about render

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.819 
just cause we don't worry about render
times<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.290> nicer<00:01:58.590> to

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
times as it is and it's just nicer to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.090 
times as it is and it's just nicer to
see<00:01:59.009> how<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.670> looks<00:01:59.850> well

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.570 

okay<00:02:05.930> let's<00:02:06.930> minimize<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.369> see

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
okay let's minimize it so you can see

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.300 
okay let's minimize it so you can see
what<00:02:08.819> will<00:02:08.940> work<00:02:08.970> with<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:10.099> lovely<00:02:11.099> now<00:02:11.220> I'm

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
what will work with it lovely now I'm

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.860 
what will work with it lovely now I'm
gonna<00:02:11.430> look<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.640> bit<00:02:11.790> some<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.480> attributes

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
gonna look a bit some of the attributes

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.610 
gonna look a bit some of the attributes
inside<00:02:13.200> first<00:02:13.680> light<00:02:14.190> angled<00:02:14.580> shader<00:02:15.620> okay

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
inside first light angled shader okay

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.479 
inside first light angled shader okay
first<00:02:16.920> we're<00:02:17.040> going<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.190> look<00:02:17.310> at<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
first we're going to look at the

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.150 
first we're going to look at the
fall-off<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:19.020> if<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.290> move<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.680> bar<00:02:19.860> as<00:02:20.069> you

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
fall-off so if you move the bar as you

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.250 
fall-off so if you move the bar as you
can<00:02:20.340> see<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:21.330> will<00:02:21.480> change<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.930> how<00:02:22.110> much

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
can see that will change that how much

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.660 
can see that will change that how much
of<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.500> light<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.860> affected<00:02:23.220> by<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.340> lines<00:02:23.580> in

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
of the light is affected by the lines in

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.729 
of the light is affected by the lines in
the<00:02:23.730> dark<00:02:23.910> like<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.269> ratio<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.560> the

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
the dark like the ratio of it so the

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.170 
the dark like the ratio of it so the
more<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.069> more<00:02:26.370> darkness<00:02:26.730> there<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
more the more darkness there is in the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.000 
more the more darkness there is in the
bar<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.599> more<00:02:27.840> darkness<00:02:28.470> I'll<00:02:28.680> be<00:02:28.800> in<00:02:28.920> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
bar the more darkness I'll be in the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.610 
bar the more darkness I'll be in the
shader<00:02:29.250> as<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:30.150> can<00:02:30.300> see<00:02:30.450> here<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.840> if<00:02:31.440> it

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
shader as you can see here and if it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.589 
shader as you can see here and if it
goes<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.040> other<00:02:32.160> way<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.790> would<00:02:32.880> be<00:02:33.030> it

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
goes the other way that would be it

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.559 
goes the other way that would be it
would<00:02:33.720> go<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.959> other<00:02:34.050> way<00:02:34.670> okay<00:02:35.670> cool<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.150> next

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
would go the other way okay cool so next

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.240 
would go the other way okay cool so next
we<00:02:36.750> look<00:02:36.930> at<00:02:36.989> color<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.799> bit<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.100> self

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
we look at color it's a bit of a self

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.039 
we look at color it's a bit of a self
explanatory<00:02:38.700> thing<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.510> change<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.870> color

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
explanatory thing you change the color

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.500 
explanatory thing you change the color
of<00:02:40.200> each<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.470> sides<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:40.830> will<00:02:40.980> change

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
of each of the sides that will change

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.850 
of each of the sides that will change
like<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.690> output<00:02:43.170> color<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.650> doesn't

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
like the output color it doesn't

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.949 
like the output color it doesn't
necessarily<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.459> be<00:02:44.760> like<00:02:45.330> dark<00:02:45.630> light

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
necessarily have to be like dark light

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.890 
necessarily have to be like dark light
and<00:02:46.170> dark<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:47.700> can<00:02:48.030> create<00:02:48.209> some<00:02:48.390> nice<00:02:48.569> sort

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
and dark you can create some nice sort

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.180 
and dark you can create some nice sort
of<00:02:48.989> effects<00:02:49.380> with<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.560> light<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.890> dark<00:02:50.040> but

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
of effects with the light and dark but

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.140 
of effects with the light and dark but
equally<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.760> could<00:02:51.450> use<00:02:51.739> two<00:02:52.739> like<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> color

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
equally you could use two like a color

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.520 
equally you could use two like a color
and<00:02:54.450> saturation<00:02:54.600> or<00:02:55.049> equally<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.319> can<00:02:55.350> use

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
and saturation or equally you can use

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.199 
and saturation or equally you can use
opposing<00:02:56.130> colors<00:02:56.430> like<00:02:56.700> complementary

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
opposing colors like complementary

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.340 
opposing colors like complementary
colors<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:58.620> create<00:02:58.769> various<00:02:59.519> effects<00:03:00.350> it's

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
colors to create various effects it's

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.990 
colors to create various effects it's
really<00:03:01.530> up<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.860> how<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.040> use<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.370> it's

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
really up to you how you use it it's

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.460 
really up to you how you use it it's
quite<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.180> nice<00:03:03.330> shader<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:03.930> way<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.440> can

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
quite a nice shader in that way you can

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.830 
quite a nice shader in that way you can
create<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.459> lot<00:03:05.580> of<00:03:05.640> things<00:03:05.849> that<00:03:06.330> are<00:03:06.720> quite

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
create a lot of things that are quite

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.410 
create a lot of things that are quite
visually<00:03:07.230> appealing<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.860> so<00:03:08.150> that<00:03:09.150> part's

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
visually appealing and so that part's

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.380 
visually appealing and so that part's
completely<00:03:09.720> up<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:11.060> okay<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.120> that's

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
completely up to you okay so that's

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.949 
completely up to you okay so that's
basically<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:13.290> gist<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.310> shader<00:03:14.959> there

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
basically the gist of the shader there

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.020 
basically the gist of the shader there
are<00:03:16.049> a<00:03:16.079> lot<00:03:16.260> more<00:03:16.290> attributes<00:03:16.859> to<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.250> if<00:03:17.880> you

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
are a lot more attributes to it if you

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.640 
are a lot more attributes to it if you
scroll<00:03:18.269> down<00:03:18.329> there's<00:03:18.780> like<00:03:19.170> trans<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.530> can

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
scroll down there's like trans you can

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.170 
scroll down there's like trans you can
alter<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:19.980> transparency<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.850> incandescent

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
alter the transparency the incandescent

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.780 
alter the transparency the incandescent
the<00:03:21.540> specular<00:03:22.049> specular<00:03:22.980> colors<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.640> you

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
the specular specular colors that you

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.940 
the specular specular colors that you
can<00:03:23.970> make<00:03:24.120> from<00:03:24.209> glow<00:03:24.510> there's<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.470> shadows<00:03:25.920> I

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
can make from glow there's the shadows I

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.289 
can make from glow there's the shadows I
mean<00:03:26.190> there's<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.400> lot<00:03:26.519> more<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.060> shader

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
mean there's a lot more to the shader

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.000 
mean there's a lot more to the shader
however<00:03:28.019> a<00:03:28.109> lot<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.230> these<00:03:28.350> attributes<00:03:28.829> are

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
however a lot of these attributes are

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.500 
however a lot of these attributes are
mimicked<00:03:29.400> within<00:03:29.640> other<00:03:29.820> my<00:03:30.000> shaders

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
mimicked within other my shaders

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.160 
mimicked within other my shaders

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
eroticism such as Lambert's or Blin so I

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.360 
eroticism such as Lambert's or Blin so I
don't<00:03:34.590> want<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:34.920> sit<00:03:35.069> here<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.190> go<00:03:35.310> through

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
don't want to sit here and go through

each of them individually I thinking you

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.630 
each of them individually I thinking you
know<00:03:37.590> if<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:37.829> want<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.069> find<00:03:38.220> out<00:03:38.370> more<00:03:38.549> about

know if you want to find out more about

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.460 
know if you want to find out more about
them<00:03:39.000> tweaking<00:03:39.630> it's<00:03:39.959> just<00:03:40.109> a<00:03:40.140> great<00:03:40.319> way<00:03:40.440> of

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
them tweaking it's just a great way of

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.289 
them tweaking it's just a great way of
learning<00:03:40.709> about<00:03:40.890> them<00:03:41.190> visually<00:03:41.549> or<00:03:41.760> just<00:03:42.180> go

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
learning about them visually or just go

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.699 
learning about them visually or just go
if<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:42.480> go<00:03:42.600> google<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.959> term<00:03:43.170> there's<00:03:43.440> plenty

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
of information out there on how to do

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.740 
of information out there on how to do
things<00:03:46.250> so<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:47.400> mine<00:03:47.609> that's<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:48.090> basic

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
things so that mine that's the basic

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.740 
things so that mine that's the basic
gist<00:03:49.109> of<00:03:49.380> how<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.680> shader<00:03:50.400> works<00:03:50.790> okay<00:03:51.690> so

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
gist of how the shader works okay so

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.370 
gist of how the shader works okay so

you<00:04:00.690> got<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.900> do<00:04:01.019> is<00:04:01.170> select<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.950> faces<00:04:02.160> that

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
you got to do is select the faces that

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
you want to have a certain color for and

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.580 
you want to have a certain color for and
just<00:04:05.850> create<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.209> new<00:04:06.299> material<00:04:06.450> for<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:06.930> you

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
just create a new material for that you

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.809 
just create a new material for that you
can<00:04:07.739> see<00:04:07.829> as<00:04:07.980> I'm<00:04:08.100> selecting<00:04:08.549> different

can see as I'm selecting different

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.190 
can see as I'm selecting different

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
shaders here different parts of the body

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.460 
shaders here different parts of the body
are<00:04:10.579> they'll<00:04:11.579> have<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.760> selection<00:04:12.060> on<00:04:12.269> them<00:04:12.479> I

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
are they'll have a selection on them I

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.140 
are they'll have a selection on them I
just<00:04:13.650> want<00:04:13.829> to<00:04:14.070> quickly<00:04:14.669> demonstrate<00:04:14.820> the

just want to quickly demonstrate the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.460 
just want to quickly demonstrate the
lighting<00:04:15.449> as<00:04:15.570> well<00:04:15.600> as<00:04:15.780> something<00:04:16.260> that

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
lighting as well as something that

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.370 
lighting as well as something that
and<00:04:16.590> overlooked<00:04:17.870> obviously<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:18.959> increasing

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
and overlooked obviously to increasing

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.860 
and overlooked obviously to increasing
intensity<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:20.130> can<00:04:20.190> see<00:04:20.430> here<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:21.360> all<00:04:21.690> the

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
intensity you can see here the all the

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.330 
intensity you can see here the all the
colors<00:04:22.110> will<00:04:22.230> increase<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:22.800> obviously<00:04:23.130> to

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
colors will increase and obviously to

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.850 
colors will increase and obviously to
decrease<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:24.090> like<00:04:24.690> they<00:04:24.810> will<00:04:24.960> decrease<00:04:25.380> it

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
decrease it like they will decrease it

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.170 
decrease it like they will decrease it
seems<00:04:26.040> obvious<00:04:26.190> but<00:04:26.640> it's<00:04:26.880> something<00:04:27.090> that

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
seems obvious but it's something that

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.890 
seems obvious but it's something that
does<00:04:27.330> get<00:04:27.510> overlooked<00:04:28.700> ok<00:04:29.700> cool<00:04:29.910> as<00:04:30.390> a<00:04:30.450> final

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
does get overlooked ok cool as a final

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.870 
does get overlooked ok cool as a final
thought<00:04:31.050> I'd<00:04:31.290> like<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.770> delve<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.670> little<00:04:32.700> bit

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
thought I'd like to delve a little bit

thought I'd like to delve a little bit
into<00:04:32.970> texturing<00:04:33.770> this<00:04:34.770> is<00:04:34.890> very<00:04:35.160> simple<00:04:35.400> if

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
into texturing this is very simple if

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.760 
into texturing this is very simple if
you<00:04:35.610> just<00:04:35.760> want<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.240> block<00:04:36.630> color<00:04:36.960> however

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
you just want a block color however

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.860 
you just want a block color however
let's<00:04:38.430> say<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.580> want<00:04:38.790> to<00:04:38.850> put<00:04:39.120> like<00:04:39.840> a

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
let's say you want to put like a

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.330 
let's say you want to put like a
Hawaiian<00:04:40.050> t-shirt<00:04:40.740> or<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:40.920> want<00:04:41.070> to<00:04:41.160> want<00:04:41.280> to

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
Hawaiian t-shirt or you want to want to

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.490 
Hawaiian t-shirt or you want to want to
put<00:04:41.490> some<00:04:41.640> kind<00:04:41.790> of<00:04:41.940> like<00:04:42.090> texture<00:04:42.510> on<00:04:42.600> it<00:04:42.630> you

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
put some kind of like texture on it you

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.370 
put some kind of like texture on it you
will<00:04:43.800> have<00:04:43.860> to<00:04:44.040> go<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.430> little<00:04:44.730> bit<00:04:45.000> further

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
will have to go a little bit further

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.050 
will have to go a little bit further
okay<00:04:46.380> so<00:04:46.590> here<00:04:46.830> we<00:04:46.860> are<00:04:46.950> inside<00:04:47.220> of<00:04:47.460> Photoshop

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
okay so here we are inside of Photoshop

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.230 
okay so here we are inside of Photoshop

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
not a very good example of UV layout I

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.850 
not a very good example of UV layout I
made<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.190> very<00:04:53.670> very<00:04:53.760> long<00:04:54.000> time<00:04:54.210> ago<00:04:54.480> but<00:04:55.200> as<00:04:55.680> an

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
made a very very long time ago but as an

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.710 
made a very very long time ago but as an
example<00:04:56.130> sake<00:04:56.400> this<00:04:56.520> is<00:04:56.670> it<00:04:56.850> and<00:04:57.060> essentially

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
example sake this is it and essentially

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.900 
example sake this is it and essentially
we<00:04:58.020> are<00:04:58.230> going<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.590> create<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:59.130> light<00:04:59.700> and<00:04:59.880> a

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
we are going to create a light and a

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.300 
we are going to create a light and a
dark<00:04:59.940> version<00:05:00.420> of<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.780> texture<00:05:01.080> we<00:05:01.170> want<00:05:01.310> so

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
dark version of the texture we want so

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.380 
dark version of the texture we want so
I've<00:05:03.300> created<00:05:03.660> like<00:05:04.140> a<00:05:04.410> very<00:05:04.860> simple<00:05:05.390> Hawaiian

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
I've created like a very simple Hawaiian

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.740 
I've created like a very simple Hawaiian
like<00:05:06.750> generic<00:05:07.260> Hawaiian<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:08.310> texture<00:05:09.000> that's

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
like generic Hawaiian and texture that's

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.120 
like generic Hawaiian and texture that's
going<00:05:10.020> to<00:05:10.080> go<00:05:10.169> over<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.410> t-shirt

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
going to go over the t-shirt

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.340 
going to go over the t-shirt
obviously<00:05:11.640> here<00:05:11.940> and<00:05:12.150> essentially<00:05:13.020> we<00:05:13.200> have<00:05:13.320> a

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
obviously here and essentially we have a

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.130 
obviously here and essentially we have a
light<00:05:13.620> and<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:13.919> dark<00:05:13.950> version<00:05:14.430> I<00:05:14.990> could<00:05:15.990> go

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
light and a dark version I could go

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.100 
light and a dark version I could go
ahead<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:16.440> create<00:05:17.090> like<00:05:18.090> a<00:05:18.120> color<00:05:18.450> pattern<00:05:18.690> or

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
ahead and create like a color pattern or

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.409 
ahead and create like a color pattern or
click<00:05:19.530> colors<00:05:19.860> for<00:05:20.040> the<00:05:20.130> rest<00:05:20.310> of<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.550> body<00:05:20.730> so

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
click colors for the rest of the body so

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.000 
click colors for the rest of the body so
that<00:05:21.450> we<00:05:21.630> only<00:05:21.780> have<00:05:21.930> to<00:05:22.080> use<00:05:22.110> one<00:05:22.290> shader<00:05:22.740> when

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
that we only have to use one shader when

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.790 
that we only have to use one shader when
we<00:05:23.100> bring<00:05:23.310> it<00:05:23.430> back<00:05:23.460> into<00:05:23.760> Maya<00:05:24.060> but<00:05:24.930> this<00:05:25.680> is

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
we bring it back into Maya but this is

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.680 
we bring it back into Maya but this is
just<00:05:25.950> an<00:05:26.040> example<00:05:26.130> I've<00:05:26.700> just<00:05:26.940> stuck<00:05:27.300> to<00:05:27.540> the

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
just an example I've just stuck to the

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.690 
just an example I've just stuck to the
texture<00:05:28.440> teacher<00:05:28.620> information<00:05:29.220> so<00:05:29.520> you<00:05:29.580> can

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
texture teacher information so you can

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.870 
texture teacher information so you can
realize<00:05:30.210> how<00:05:30.240> to<00:05:30.419> do<00:05:30.660> it<00:05:31.280> and<00:05:32.280> this<00:05:32.400> is<00:05:32.460> just<00:05:32.550> my

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
realize how to do it and this is just my

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.250 
realize how to do it and this is just my
version<00:05:32.910> of<00:05:33.390> how<00:05:33.510> I<00:05:33.540> do<00:05:33.720> it<00:05:33.930> there's<00:05:34.169> probably

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
version of how I do it there's probably

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.409 
version of how I do it there's probably
other<00:05:34.919> ways<00:05:35.040> but<00:05:35.430> this<00:05:35.550> is<00:05:35.700> is<00:05:35.880> whether<00:05:36.150> works

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
other ways but this is is whether works

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.830 
other ways but this is is whether works
for<00:05:36.570> me<00:05:36.690> so<00:05:37.020> you<00:05:37.830> have<00:05:37.950> a<00:05:37.979> light<00:05:38.190> version<00:05:38.370> here

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
for me so you have a light version here

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.380 
for me so you have a light version here
amount<00:05:39.840> also<00:05:40.020> a<00:05:40.140> dark<00:05:40.440> version<00:05:41.150> just<00:05:42.150> saved

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
amount also a dark version just saved

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.020 
amount also a dark version just saved
off<00:05:42.570> as<00:05:42.690> another<00:05:42.870> layer<00:05:43.169> and<00:05:43.520> basically<00:05:44.520> once

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
off as another layer and basically once

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.240 
off as another layer and basically once
you<00:05:45.180> have<00:05:45.330> these<00:05:45.479> two<00:05:45.660> bits<00:05:45.810> of<00:05:45.930> information

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
you have these two bits of information

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.250 
you have these two bits of information
you<00:05:47.250> can<00:05:47.300> just<00:05:48.300> save<00:05:48.479> them<00:05:48.660> off<00:05:48.750> I<00:05:48.930> just<00:05:48.960> save

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
you can just save them off I just save

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.050 
you can just save them off I just save
them<00:05:49.380> off<00:05:49.470> as<00:05:49.590> like<00:05:49.770> light<00:05:50.640> and<00:05:50.940> dark<00:05:51.270> as<00:05:52.080> t.j.s

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
them off as like light and dark as t.j.s

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.520 
them off as like light and dark as t.j.s
with<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.270> obviously<00:05:54.690> with<00:05:54.810> a<00:05:54.840> UV<00:05:55.320> lines

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
with the obviously with a UV lines

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.290 
with the obviously with a UV lines
hidden<00:05:55.950> and<00:05:56.130> then<00:05:56.790> that<00:05:56.970> give<00:05:57.180> you<00:05:57.240> the

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
hidden and then that give you the

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.240 
hidden and then that give you the
information<00:05:57.540> you<00:05:57.840> need<00:05:58.080> to<00:05:58.350> then<00:05:58.650> plug<00:05:58.979> the

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
information you need to then plug the

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.520 
information you need to then plug the
texture<00:05:59.610> back<00:05:59.790> into<00:06:00.060> Maya<00:06:00.270> into<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.169> surface

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
texture back into Maya into the surface

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.240 
texture back into Maya into the surface
shaders<00:06:01.940> which<00:06:02.940> should<00:06:03.150> work<00:06:03.360> fine<00:06:04.190> ok<00:06:05.190> so

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
shaders which should work fine ok so

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.940 
shaders which should work fine ok so
back<00:06:05.610> to<00:06:05.669> my<00:06:06.030> um<00:06:06.330> we're<00:06:07.290> going<00:06:07.440> to<00:06:07.500> hyper<00:06:07.710> shade

back to my um we're going to hyper shade
this<00:06:08.220> up<00:06:08.430> here<00:06:09.120> we<00:06:09.660> select<00:06:09.780> the<00:06:10.169> t-shirt<00:06:10.890> and

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
this up here we select the t-shirt and

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.990 
this up here we select the t-shirt and

first<00:06:22.260> one's<00:06:22.530> a<00:06:22.590> dark<00:06:22.800> one<00:06:23.040> so<00:06:23.190> we're<00:06:23.310> going<00:06:23.430> to

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
first one's a dark one so we're going to

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.450 
first one's a dark one so we're going to
plug<00:06:23.700> in<00:06:23.910> for<00:06:24.900> preset<00:06:25.320> off<00:06:25.500> the<00:06:25.860> dark<00:06:26.370> t-shirt

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
plug in for preset off the dark t-shirt

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.890 
plug in for preset off the dark t-shirt
you<00:06:27.580> can<00:06:27.729> see<00:06:27.850> it<00:06:27.910> appear<00:06:28.180> that<00:06:28.210> and<00:06:28.569> plugged

we<00:06:42.009> could<00:06:42.160> use<00:06:42.340> this<00:06:42.550> to<00:06:42.759> texture<00:06:43.150> the<00:06:43.270> entire

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539 
we could use this to texture the entire

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:47.159 
we could use this to texture the entire
character<00:06:44.400> with<00:06:45.400> just<00:06:45.819> one<00:06:45.970> shader<00:06:46.210> so<00:06:46.990> that's

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
character with just one shader so that's

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.020 
character with just one shader so that's
also<00:06:47.349> another<00:06:47.470> option<00:06:47.759> depending<00:06:48.759> on<00:06:48.849> how<00:06:48.970> you

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030 
also another option depending on how you

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.360 
also another option depending on how you
like<00:06:49.569> to<00:06:49.720> do<00:06:49.840> things<00:06:50.050> but<00:06:50.889> you'll<00:06:51.009> also<00:06:51.190> to

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
like to do things but you'll also to

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.670 
like to do things but you'll also to
separate<00:06:51.789> them<00:06:51.910> out<00:06:51.940> if<00:06:52.090> you<00:06:52.180> like<00:06:52.360> and<00:06:52.680> um

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
separate them out if you like and um

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.150 
separate them out if you like and um
here<00:06:54.400> we<00:06:54.490> go<00:06:54.669> so<00:06:55.620> bring<00:06:56.620> this<00:06:56.680> up<00:06:56.860> a<00:06:56.919> little<00:06:57.039> bit

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
here we go so bring this up a little bit

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.520 
here we go so bring this up a little bit
bigger<00:06:57.419> you<00:06:58.419> can<00:06:58.539> see<00:06:58.720> that<00:06:58.960> we<00:06:59.169> now<00:06:59.319> have<00:06:59.349> a

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
bigger you can see that we now have a

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.339 
bigger you can see that we now have a
pattern<00:06:59.800> that<00:07:00.130> follows<00:07:00.430> the<00:07:00.930> surface<00:07:01.930> due<00:07:02.320> to

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:02.349 
pattern that follows the surface due to

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:05.640 
pattern that follows the surface due to
the<00:07:02.650> toon<00:07:02.830> shading<00:07:03.190> effect<00:07:04.020> and<00:07:05.020> matches<00:07:05.440> the

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.650 
the toon shading effect and matches the

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.100 
the toon shading effect and matches the
rest<00:07:05.860> of<00:07:06.039> the<00:07:06.220> character<00:07:06.849> so<00:07:07.570> to<00:07:07.630> another

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
rest of the character so to another

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.270 
rest of the character so to another
angle<00:07:08.470> so<00:07:08.560> you<00:07:08.590> can<00:07:08.650> see<00:07:09.099> better<00:07:11.039> there<00:07:12.039> we<00:07:12.130> go

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 
angle so you can see better there we go

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.480 
angle so you can see better there we go
so<00:07:12.729> here<00:07:13.479> we<00:07:13.570> have<00:07:13.750> it's<00:07:14.530> not<00:07:14.650> the<00:07:14.740> best<00:07:14.889> as<00:07:15.430> a

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
so here we have it's not the best as a

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.300 
so here we have it's not the best as a
wrap<00:07:15.759> texture<00:07:16.240> but<00:07:16.509> the<00:07:17.169> principle<00:07:17.830> behind<00:07:18.070> it

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.310 
wrap texture but the principle behind it

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.010 
wrap texture but the principle behind it
you<00:07:18.460> should<00:07:18.610> hope<00:07:18.820> you<00:07:19.000> can<00:07:19.180> see<00:07:19.360> that's<00:07:19.659> how

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:20.020 
you should hope you can see that's how

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.339 
you should hope you can see that's how
you<00:07:20.830> can<00:07:21.039> do<00:07:21.190> it<00:07:21.310> so<00:07:21.849> I<00:07:22.419> hope<00:07:22.720> you<00:07:22.900> enjoyed<00:07:23.139> this

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:23.349 
you can do it so I hope you enjoyed this

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:27.270 
you can do it so I hope you enjoyed this
and<00:07:23.789> see<00:07:24.789> you<00:07:24.849> next<00:07:25.120> time
