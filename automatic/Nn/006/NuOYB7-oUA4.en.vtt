 excuse me for the voice a little bassina malo 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.570
 to say goodbye to games week due to guilt 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.610
 of the enormous amount of people there was 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.500
 but I am so happy that it went like this 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.320
 but no more talk because we start at 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.899
 talk about battlefield 4 and the battlelog 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.540

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:30.950
 feature of the new battlelog how to use it 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.710

 all times and how to use it 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.760
 simply so for leisure 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.190
 first see the main page 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.660
 profile contains summary entries 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.660
 equipment breakdown statistics

 assignments awards and beats the pax between 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.980
 battle impact fights that don't fit 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.300
 on one line I first say those that 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.390
 they prepared the deluxe like me 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.519
 edition the digital deluxe edition that 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.070
 going in packet battles if it is 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.499
 they will already find 4 I opened them ie 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.480
 4 would be three for the pre order digital 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:07.070
 deluxe and four if you are veterans of 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.710
 battlefield or if these at least the 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.810
 second title of battlefield that 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.579
 you play and it is also objectively the most 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.799
 rich you can read with charcoal tents 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:19.149
 paused the video the bonuses I found 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:22.430
 within these packages 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.049
 battle in the summary you will see all the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.549
 your information as in the beta 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.619
 roughly a bit more so 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.450
 detailed in the statistics you will see 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.460
 all weapons precision breakouts 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.070
 what you will do those you see here are 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.829
 simply the ones unlocked via battle 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.110
 pack and you will also see the details i 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.810
 battle reports that are those 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.689
 which you will have will have to matches and vehicles 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.039
 very interesting and moving into 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:51.229
 soldier blinds breakouts you see that there is 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.180
 the list of all the weapons then 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.180
 go read it look 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.710
 their statistics look at something 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.090
 do you think you are starting to get an idea 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.130
 maybe which ones you mention a little more 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.350
 to play your first game one 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.140
 nice thing and this flares to ma 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.090
 red emergency bengal can 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.430
 lighten the dark areas of producing a 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.260
 slight blinding effect therefore a 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.570
 another tactical element inserted then 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.810
 look at how many knives and how much 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.450
 tamarro the machete really a thing 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.489
 you understand vices but something else I want you 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.610
 point out if you go to the area 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.010
 multiplayer you see here polygon that 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.180
 the strange in English if you click 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.130
 on this page 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.080
 you will see a series of tendons ie 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.360
 polygon with this classic race 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.739
 classic deathmatch annihilation that 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.410
 it would obliteration me all the others 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.200
 mode with lots of videos of 20 30 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.570
 seconds that explain the basics of how 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.670
 works in that way by explaining to you 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.430
 of symbols explaining a bit of everything 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.430
 the other nice thing and you can go 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.989
 to enter the polygon where 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.790
 you can try all the weapons 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.340
 accessories the vehicles to improve the 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.320
 your skills on the battlefield 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.230
 the interesting thing is that they will be there 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.540
 of targets probably and I hope 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.269
 within these maps on which 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.910
 on which excuse you may on which 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.250
 you will be able to improve your skills 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.830
 therefore, this also aims very very much 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.630
 useful in browser servers 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.220
 if you find some servants maybe they are 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.540
 modified are the proof ones 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.760
 they are running right now then 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.830
 he preferred technology these things yes 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.989
 arrange campaign to play yours 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.000
 campaign to review your progress 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.700
 inside it you come across 4 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.690
 you can share directly on the 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.010
 battlelog campaign that in theory 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.440
 it should have more than one road 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.209
 passable so it would be nice too 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.920
 maybe see it with you on youtube 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.959
 we will see your interest for a moment 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.239
 unfortunately, he can not tell you the names of the 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.900
 various missions to spoiler armeli but maybe 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.239
 it is better that way 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.579
 and then there are the emissions you can create 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.739
 a mission by adding your friend 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.989
 and choosing the type of achievement that 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.840
 you must make the number of attempts that you 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.019
 ha and this will be 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.390
 we say to do within 48 hours then 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.519
 get ready to challenge all yours 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.709
 friends regarding rankings 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.060
 see the world map you can go 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.920
 around the world find yours 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.140
 friends find players see where they are 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.900
 the strongest players in short, another 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.389
 really interesting idea is that there 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.130
 brings in a new generation where 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.110
 even the social becomes an integral part 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.840
 of video games 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.660
 I really like the new battlelog now 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.180
 I'm downloading two games 1 and 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.229

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.780
 I'll show you on the canal and who knows what 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.030

 left a like if you liked that ve
