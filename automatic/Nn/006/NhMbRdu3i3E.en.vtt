 problems playstation 4 remember 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.350

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.020
 problem in play 4 I hope this 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.580

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.520

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.530
 play 4 that what happens or very well the 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.420

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.220
 disk unintentionally at any time or

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.850

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.950

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.479

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.899
 You can see this tutorial in English 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.140
 you just have to press the button 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.960
 power x until you hear the two bits 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.470
 two bits I think it's for 30 seconds 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.060
 after that wait 30 seconds more 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.520
 clear the second more until it goes out 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.310
 all the lights of the play disconnected 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.310
 the playstation 4 the wall cable no 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.500
 for 3 minutes 4 minutes you turn it to 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.480
 connect furniture to turn on play and 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.340
