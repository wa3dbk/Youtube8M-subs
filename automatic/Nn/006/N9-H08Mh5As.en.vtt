lot of work I think Emirates on should
start<00:06:44.689> the<00:06:44.870> next<00:06:45.020> game<00:06:45.169> alongside<00:06:46.009> Henderson

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:48.790 
start the next game alongside Henderson
and<00:06:46.939> Milner<00:06:47.300> I<00:06:47.389> hope<00:06:47.599> Henderson<00:06:48.500> isn't

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
and Milner I hope Henderson isn't

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.860 
and Milner I hope Henderson isn't
