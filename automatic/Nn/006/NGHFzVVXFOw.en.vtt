00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
today I'm going to talk about proper

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.920 
today I'm going to talk about proper
shifting<00:00:03.810> techniques<00:00:04.259> on<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.560> ten-speed<00:00:04.980> bike

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
shifting techniques on a ten-speed bike

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.940 
shifting techniques on a ten-speed bike
they're<00:00:06.930> called<00:00:07.170> ten<00:00:07.410> speed<00:00:07.649> that<00:00:07.859> they

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
they're called ten speed that they

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.100 
they're called ten speed that they
actually<00:00:08.099> have<00:00:08.400> 20<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.150> back<00:00:09.360> sprocket<00:00:09.719> has

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
actually have 20 the back sprocket has

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.480 
actually have 20 the back sprocket has
ten<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.550> front<00:00:11.880> chainring<00:00:12.630> has<00:00:13.049> to

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
ten and the front chainring has to

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:21.650 
ten and the front chainring has to
understand<00:00:18.410> ok<00:00:19.410> as<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.590> can<00:00:19.650> see<00:00:19.800> here<00:00:20.660> we

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
understand ok as you can see here we

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.710 
understand ok as you can see here we
have<00:00:22.609> we<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> chain<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.570> are<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
have we have the chain and what are the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.779 
have we have the chain and what are the
middle<00:00:25.019> gears<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.279> if<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.519> look<00:00:26.670> up

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
middle gears here and if you look up

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.290 
middle gears here and if you look up
front<00:00:27.060> here<00:00:27.269> it's<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> small<00:00:27.990> chain<00:00:28.349> ring

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.090 

what<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.420> want<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.750> avoid<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.920> it

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
what you want to avoid and this is it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.340 
what you want to avoid and this is it
this<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> cross<00:00:36.059> chain<00:00:36.390> situation<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.200> have

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
this is a cross chain situation we have

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.619 
this is a cross chain situation we have
the<00:00:37.500> small<00:00:37.770> chain<00:00:38.070> ring<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.520> front<00:00:38.820> which

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
the small chain ring in the front which

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.020 
the small chain ring in the front which
is<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> left<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.250> smallest<00:00:41.579> gear<00:00:41.940> in

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
is to the left and the smallest gear in

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.910 
is to the left and the smallest gear in
the<00:00:42.090> back<00:00:42.270> which<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.809> right<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.710> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the back which is to the right as you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.340 
the back which is to the right as you
can<00:00:44.070> see<00:00:44.340> there's<00:00:44.969> very<00:00:45.090> little<00:00:45.510> tension<00:00:45.870> on

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
can see there's very little tension on

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.470 
can see there's very little tension on
the<00:00:46.770> chain<00:00:46.980> down<00:00:47.579> here<00:00:47.850> because<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the chain down here because the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.170 
the chain down here because the
derailleur<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.140> pulled<00:00:49.440> all<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> way<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.219> this

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
derailleur is pulled all the way up this

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.060 
derailleur is pulled all the way up this
is<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.660> good<00:00:52.020> situation<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.710> doesn't<00:00:52.860> hurt

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
is not a good situation it doesn't hurt

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.500 
is not a good situation it doesn't hurt
your<00:00:53.219> chain<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:53.820> causes<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.270> lot<00:00:54.480> of

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
your chain it just causes a lot of

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.660 
your chain it just causes a lot of
flopping<00:00:55.110> around<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:56.280> might<00:00:56.460> get<00:00:56.640> some

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
flopping around and you might get some

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.700 
flopping around and you might get some
noise<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.570> where<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> chain<00:00:57.899> hits<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
noise here where the chain hits the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:11.280 
noise here where the chain hits the
guard<00:00:59.010> above<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> main<00:01:00.180> chamber

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.350 

the<00:01:12.290> other<00:01:12.470> extreme<00:01:12.939> here<00:01:13.939> I've<00:01:14.060> got<00:01:14.240> the

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
the other extreme here I've got the

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.210 
the other extreme here I've got the
other<00:01:14.509> extreme<00:01:16.600> where<00:01:17.600> as<00:01:17.689> you<00:01:17.810> can<00:01:17.869> see<00:01:18.220> I've

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
other extreme where as you can see I've

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.149 
other extreme where as you can see I've
got<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:19.759> now<00:01:19.909> that<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.720> rear<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.860> realtor

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
got the now that the rear the realtor

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.450 
got the now that the rear the realtor
set<00:01:22.399> is<00:01:22.580> on<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:22.939> highest<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.720> largest<00:01:24.460> cog

if you will of the rear cassette and I'm

on the outside ring the large ring on
the<00:01:30.890> front<00:01:31.009> chainring<00:01:31.640> this<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:32.479> stretching

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
the front chainring this is stretching

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.859 
the front chainring this is stretching
the<00:01:33.049> chain<00:01:33.380> up<00:01:33.590> as<00:01:33.799> far<00:01:34.210> as<00:01:35.210> far<00:01:35.539> as<00:01:35.630> it'll<00:01:35.840> go

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
the chain up as far as far as it'll go

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.529 
the chain up as far as far as it'll go
in<00:01:36.200> fact<00:01:36.470> it's<00:01:36.740> really<00:01:37.280> too<00:01:37.610> far<00:01:37.640> the

in fact it's really too far the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
hitting the COG here this is not a good

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.889 
hitting the COG here this is not a good

situation to be in really there's no

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
reason you would do this you get the

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.230 
reason you would do this you get the

cogs and go to the small chain ring
there's<00:01:52.759> no<00:01:52.970> real<00:01:53.270> reason<00:01:53.509> ever<00:01:53.929> to<00:01:54.259> do<00:01:54.440> this

there's no real reason ever to do this

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.800 
there's no real reason ever to do this
potential<00:01:55.549> broken<00:01:55.940> chain<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:56.420> certainly

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
potential broken chain and certainly

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.800 
potential broken chain and certainly
potential<00:01:57.319> damage<00:01:57.940> to<00:01:58.940> your<00:01:59.060> derailleur<00:01:59.450> and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.800 

with<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.750> big<00:02:06.049> rings<00:02:06.740> in<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.009> back<00:02:07.810> you're

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
with the big rings in the back you're

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.199 
with the big rings in the back you're
going<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.229> turn<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.890> wheel<00:02:10.039> fewer<00:02:10.489> times<00:02:10.789> for

going to turn the wheel fewer times for

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.330 
going to turn the wheel fewer times for
the<00:02:11.299> amount<00:02:11.540> of<00:02:11.630> times<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:12.049> turn<00:02:12.200> up<00:02:12.410> front<00:02:12.709> so

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
the amount of times you turn up front so

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.039 
the amount of times you turn up front so
this<00:02:13.489> is<00:02:13.670> what's<00:02:13.880> called<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.209> climbing<00:02:14.780> rings

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
this is what's called the climbing rings

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.580 
this is what's called the climbing rings
these<00:02:15.560> are<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.890> slower<00:02:16.280> speed<00:02:16.670> rings<00:02:17.590> you

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
these are the slower speed rings you

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.210 
these are the slower speed rings you

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
will turn the wheel turn the pedals one

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.830 
will turn the wheel turn the pedals one
time<00:02:22.519> you<00:02:22.910> might<00:02:23.090> only<00:02:23.239> get<00:02:23.450> three<00:02:23.690> or<00:02:23.810> four

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
time you might only get three or four

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.080 
time you might only get three or four
turns<00:02:24.290> on<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.590> wheel<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:25.700> if<00:02:25.790> you're<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.030> a

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
turns on the wheel and if you're in a

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
small chain ring up front sometimes it's

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.069 
small chain ring up front sometimes it's
even<00:02:28.130> one<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.609> one<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:29.030> do<00:02:29.329> it<00:02:29.480> by<00:02:29.630> counting

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
even one to one you do it by counting

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.819 
even one to one you do it by counting
teeth<00:02:30.320> this<00:02:31.040> is<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.310> 32<00:02:31.790> tooth<00:02:32.299> cog<00:02:33.230> right<00:02:33.650> here

one-to-one<00:02:43.760> so<00:02:44.480> if<00:02:44.570> I<00:02:44.690> put<00:02:44.930> my<00:02:45.049> hand<00:02:45.320> here<00:02:46.180> and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
one-to-one so if I put my hand here and

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:55.059 
one-to-one so if I put my hand here and
I<00:02:47.269> go<00:02:47.450> around<00:02:47.570> one<00:02:47.989> complete<00:02:48.440> time<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.920> can

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
I go around one complete time you can

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.940 
I go around one complete time you can
see<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.370> goes<00:02:55.549> a<00:02:55.579> little<00:02:55.850> bit<00:02:56.120> past<00:02:56.450> I<00:02:56.810> do<00:02:57.650> get

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
see it goes a little bit past I do get

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.789 
see it goes a little bit past I do get
slightly<00:02:58.280> more<00:02:58.489> than<00:02:58.700> one<00:02:59.030> turn<00:02:59.799> that's

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
slightly more than one turn that's

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.650 
slightly more than one turn that's
determines<00:03:01.400> how<00:03:01.549> well<00:03:01.760> your<00:03:02.000> bike<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.390> going

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
determines how well your bike is going

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.590 
determines how well your bike is going
to<00:03:02.780> climb<00:03:03.019> at<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.069> same<00:03:04.310> time<00:03:04.549> this<00:03:04.819> is<00:03:04.880> an<00:03:05.120> 11
