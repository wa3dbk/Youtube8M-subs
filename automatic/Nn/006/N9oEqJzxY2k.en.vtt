with knee rolls a hybrid pad with

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.110 
with knee rolls a hybrid pad with
needles<00:00:13.710> will<00:00:13.980> typically<00:00:14.340> have<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.580> softer

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
needles will typically have a softer

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.870 
needles will typically have a softer
face<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.750> which<00:00:16.020> makes<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.859> puck<00:00:17.070> hit<00:00:17.730> it

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
face in it which makes the puck hit it

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.880 
face in it which makes the puck hit it
and<00:00:18.029> stay<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> little<00:00:18.810> bit<00:00:18.930> closer<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> pad

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
and stay a little bit closer to the pad

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.640 
and stay a little bit closer to the pad
the<00:00:20.640> flat<00:00:20.910> face<00:00:21.150> pad<00:00:21.420> will<00:00:21.630> typically<00:00:22.080> have<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
the flat face pad will typically have a

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.500 
the flat face pad will typically have a
higher<00:00:22.740> density<00:00:23.220> foam<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.910> through<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> face

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
higher density foam in through the face

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.630 
higher density foam in through the face
so<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.109> have<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.470> direct<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.949> rebound<00:00:26.400> to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
so you have to direct the rebound to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.540 
so you have to direct the rebound to
where<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.150> want<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.599> go<00:00:28.010> moving<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
where you want it to go moving on to the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.330 
where you want it to go moving on to the
knee<00:00:29.730> rolls<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.179> pads<00:00:30.980> you'll<00:00:31.980> notice

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
knee rolls of the pads you'll notice

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.310 
knee rolls of the pads you'll notice
that<00:00:32.550> there's<00:00:33.360> two<00:00:33.450> different<00:00:33.630> styles<00:00:33.989> of

a single brake pad a double brake pad is
going<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> little<00:00:40.559> bit<00:00:40.739> more<00:00:40.920> flexible

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
going to be a little bit more flexible

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.970 
going to be a little bit more flexible
having<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> double<00:00:42.780> brake<00:00:43.020> pad<00:00:43.320> will<00:00:43.739> allow<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
having a double brake pad will allow the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.069 
having a double brake pad will allow the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
look at when selecting pads is the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.100 
look at when selecting pads is the
strapping<00:01:10.260> system<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.040> back<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.460> pot

strapping system on the back of the pot

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.450 
strapping system on the back of the pot
here<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.409> two<00:01:13.650> different<00:01:13.799> strapping

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
here we have two different strapping

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.649 
here we have two different strapping
setups<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.380> nylon<00:01:17.280> strap<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.450> is

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
setups this is your nylon strap this is

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.320 
setups this is your nylon strap this is

your synthetic leather strap the nylon
straps<00:01:21.689> are<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> little<00:01:22.170> bit<00:01:22.409> easier<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
straps are a little bit easier with a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.190 
straps are a little bit easier with a
young<00:01:23.610> goalie<00:01:23.909> because<00:01:24.450> once<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.020> them

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
young goalie because once you have them

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.429 
young goalie because once you have them
set<00:01:25.470> up<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.909> quick<00:01:27.150> clip<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:28.290> the
