coerced<00:02:32.450> more<00:02:32.990> or<00:02:33.050> less<00:02:33.230> right<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:34.010> now<00:02:34.430> we're

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
coerced more or less right and now we're

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.600 
coerced more or less right and now we're
getting<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.090> issues<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.950> coercion<00:02:36.950> we're

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
getting to issues of coercion we're

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.910 
getting to issues of coercion we're
getting<00:02:37.820> into<00:02:38.000> issues<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.920> medical

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
getting into issues of medical

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.270 
getting into issues of medical
experimentation<00:02:40.550> or<00:02:40.850> black<00:02:41.150> folk<00:02:41.860> right<00:02:42.860> and

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
experimentation or black folk right and

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.690 
experimentation or black folk right and
so<00:02:43.850> he<00:02:44.030> becomes<00:02:44.270> Power<00:02:44.630> Man<00:02:45.020> because<00:02:45.680> he<00:02:46.460> gets

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
so he becomes Power Man because he gets

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.900 
so he becomes Power Man because he gets
in<00:02:46.820> this<00:02:46.880> experiment<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:48.640> one<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:49.760> the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
in this experiment and one of the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.870 
in this experiment and one of the
racists<00:02:50.750> white<00:02:50.900> guards<00:02:51.760> sabotages<00:02:52.760> the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
racists white guards sabotages the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.650 
racists white guards sabotages the
experiment<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:53.690> he<00:02:54.170> mutates<00:02:55.100> into<00:02:55.430> power<00:02:56.300> man

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
experiment and he mutates into power man

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.380 
experiment and he mutates into power man
so<00:02:57.110> this<00:02:57.350> origin<00:02:57.920> narrative<00:02:58.430> is<00:02:58.640> is<00:02:58.940> layered

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
so this origin narrative is is layered

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.610 
so this origin narrative is is layered
with<00:03:00.220> issues<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.250> race<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:02.150> layered<00:03:03.110> with

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
with issues of race is layered with

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.240 
with issues of race is layered with
issues<00:03:04.130> of<00:03:04.450> political<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.990> social<00:03:06.250> reform

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
issues of political and social reform

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.340 
issues of political and social reform
and<00:03:08.240> when<00:03:08.480> we<00:03:08.600> talk<00:03:08.780> about<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.080> prison

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
and when we talk about the prison

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.970 
and when we talk about the prison
industrial<00:03:09.470> complex<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:11.810> layered<00:03:12.470> with<00:03:12.650> his

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
industrial complex is layered with his

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.360 
industrial complex is layered with his
birth<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:13.700> he's<00:03:14.660> birthed<00:03:15.050> out<00:03:15.410> of<00:03:15.440> this<00:03:16.130> this

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
birth is he's birthed out of this this

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.290 
birth is he's birthed out of this this
this<00:03:16.670> this<00:03:17.500> intense<00:03:18.580> racism<00:03:19.580> that<00:03:19.910> he

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
this this intense racism that he

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.380 
this this intense racism that he
experiences<00:03:21.080> now<00:03:22.070> that<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:22.850> me<00:03:22.880> is<00:03:24.220> pretty

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
experiences now that to me is pretty

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.380 
experiences now that to me is pretty
potent<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.860> if<00:03:27.860> we<00:03:27.980> just<00:03:28.190> talk<00:03:28.400> about<00:03:28.459> how<00:03:28.910> he

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
potent and if we just talk about how he

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.270 
potent and if we just talk about how he
says<00:03:29.630> things<00:03:29.900> like<00:03:29.989> sweet<00:03:30.320> Christmas<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.070> his

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
says things like sweet Christmas and his

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.670 
says things like sweet Christmas and his
his<00:03:31.790> language<00:03:32.300> doesn't<00:03:32.630> sound<00:03:32.840> authentic<00:03:33.500> in

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
his language doesn't sound authentic in

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.100 
his language doesn't sound authentic in
terms<00:03:34.250> of<00:03:34.340> how<00:03:34.400> they<00:03:34.519> write<00:03:34.760> it<00:03:34.970> certainly<00:03:35.810> I

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
terms of how they write it certainly I

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.009 
terms of how they write it certainly I
can<00:03:36.920> go<00:03:37.100> with<00:03:37.220> that<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:37.720> certainly<00:03:38.720> some<00:03:38.989> of

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
can go with that and certainly some of

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.949 
can go with that and certainly some of
the<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:40.030> artistic<00:03:41.030> renderings<00:03:41.480> of<00:03:41.630> Luke<00:03:41.750> Cage

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
the the artistic renderings of Luke Cage

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.620 
the the artistic renderings of Luke Cage
makes<00:03:42.560> him<00:03:42.709> look<00:03:42.860> very<00:03:42.920> groin<00:03:43.459> emphasis<00:03:44.450> on

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
makes him look very groin emphasis on

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.310 
makes him look very groin emphasis on
groin<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:45.290> mean<00:03:45.769> this<00:03:46.250> brother<00:03:46.810> means<00:03:47.810> he's<00:03:48.080> no

Billy Dee right I mean this is this guy
he's<00:03:52.610> looking<00:03:52.790> rough<00:03:53.239> right<00:03:54.200> so<00:03:54.560> we<00:03:55.459> can

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
he's looking rough right so we can

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.600 
he's looking rough right so we can
critique<00:03:55.790> it<00:03:56.150> for<00:03:56.330> that<00:03:56.530> but<00:03:57.530> if<00:03:57.739> we<00:03:58.010> over

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
critique it for that but if we over

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.210 
critique it for that but if we over
critique<00:03:59.060> its<00:03:59.390> shortcomings<00:04:00.080> for<00:04:00.739> being<00:04:01.070> a
