the<00:00:28.039> wheel

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.090 

be<00:00:31.210> right<00:00:31.449> now<00:00:31.720> it<00:00:32.590> isn't<00:00:32.800> Drive<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.950> a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
be right now it isn't Drive it's a

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.430 
be right now it isn't Drive it's a
front-wheel<00:00:36.670> drive<00:00:36.700> so<00:00:37.059> the<00:00:37.480> phone<00:00:37.720> will<00:00:37.750> be

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
front-wheel drive so the phone will be

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.810 
front-wheel drive so the phone will be
spinning<00:00:38.770> backwards<00:00:39.129> now

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
spinning backwards now

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:49.209 
spinning backwards now
in<00:00:41.330> the<00:00:41.480> air

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219

yeah now I have it on
dried<00:00:56.210> I'm<00:00:57.210> cursed<00:00:57.600> before<00:00:58.310> still<00:00:59.310> nothing

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.840 

you<00:01:05.910> can<00:01:06.090> tell<00:01:06.300> there's<00:01:06.480> something<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
you can tell there's something on the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.700 
you can tell there's something on the
interior<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.090> transmission<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.320> because

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
interior the transmission just because

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.360 
interior the transmission just because
like<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.040> said<00:01:11.100> when<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.520> spin<00:01:12.770> this<00:01:13.770> wheel<00:01:14.100> by

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
like I said when I spin this wheel by

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.300 
like I said when I spin this wheel by
hand<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.810> other<00:01:15.930> wheel<00:01:16.410> on<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> other<00:01:17.010> side

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
hand the other wheel on the other side

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.030 
hand the other wheel on the other side
should<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:18.180> spinning<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.410> the<00:01:19.560> opposite

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
should be spinning in the opposite

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.670 
should be spinning in the opposite
direction

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.500 

it's<00:01:24.800> doing<00:01:25.070> nothing

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
it's doing nothing

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.560 
it's doing nothing
so<00:01:27.110> except<00:01:27.620> in<00:01:27.830> some<00:01:28.070> eternity<00:01:29.090> I<00:01:29.120> mean

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
so except in some eternity I mean

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.719 
so except in some eternity I mean
transmission<00:01:30.380> problem

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
transmission problem

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.139 
transmission problem
again<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> second<00:01:34.289> transmission

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
again this is the second transmission

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.419 
again this is the second transmission
the<00:01:36.149> gaia<00:01:36.360> JDM<00:01:37.049> seems<00:01:37.469> to<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.799> very<00:01:38.219> responsive

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
the gaia JDM seems to be very responsive

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:56.870 
the gaia JDM seems to be very responsive

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
being inconvenience is me and one more

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.449 
being inconvenience is me and one more
time<00:02:32.280> with<00:02:32.519> them<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.819> guess<00:02:33.860> only<00:02:34.860> reason<00:02:35.340> I'm

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
time with them I guess only reason I'm

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.280 
time with them I guess only reason I'm
going<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.849> try<00:02:36.120> we<00:02:36.329> don't<00:02:36.540> one<00:02:36.690> more<00:02:36.870> time<00:02:37.079> is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
going to try we don't one more time is

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.550 
going to try we don't one more time is
simply<00:02:37.769> because<00:02:37.950> they<00:02:38.400> seem<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.480> very

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
simply because they seem to be very

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.740 
simply because they seem to be very
responsive<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:43.680> know<00:02:43.799> it<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.750> used

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
responsive and you know it is a used

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.349 
responsive and you know it is a used
transmission<00:02:46.500> he<00:02:47.250> has<00:02:47.400> another<00:02:47.760> one<00:02:47.910> at<00:02:48.090> hand

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
transmission he has another one at hand

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.289 
transmission he has another one at hand
that<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:49.019> saw<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.410> other<00:02:49.620> day<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:50.030> we'll<00:02:51.030> try<00:02:51.269> to

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
that I saw the other day so we'll try to

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.569 
that I saw the other day so we'll try to
try<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.750> one<00:02:51.959> again<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.470> take<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.430> from

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
try that one again and take it from

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:54.020 
try that one again and take it from
there

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
there

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.680

next<00:02:54.630> video<00:02:54.780> hopefully<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.680> baby<00:02:55.950> will<00:02:56.190> be

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
next video hopefully this baby will be

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.620 
next video hopefully this baby will be
riding<00:02:57.690> down<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.579> my<00:02:59.579> driveway<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.150> out<00:03:00.480> into

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
riding down the my driveway and out into

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.530 
riding down the my driveway and out into
the<00:03:00.780> street<00:03:02.720> it<00:03:03.720> is<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.950> see<00:03:04.950> my<00:03:04.980> overdrive<00:03:05.639> like

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
the street it is a see my overdrive like

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.319 
the street it is a see my overdrive like
they're<00:03:06.840> lighting<00:03:07.260> up<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:08.489> also<00:03:08.670> it's

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
they're lighting up and also it's

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.180 
they're lighting up and also it's
definitely<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.079> transmission<00:03:10.650> issue

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
definitely a transmission issue

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.560 
definitely a transmission issue
light<00:03:12.580> starts<00:03:12.970> blinking<00:03:13.560> okay
