get caught in there so it's a bit of

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.729 
get caught in there so it's a bit of
trouble

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739

Oh<00:02:39.270> importantly<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.600> handbrake<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:40.989> on<00:02:41.170> as

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
Oh importantly the handbrake is on as

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.949 
Oh importantly the handbrake is on as
well<00:02:42.030> none<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.180> wires<00:02:43.390> are<00:02:43.630> done<00:02:43.750> yet

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
well none of the wires are done yet

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.510 
well none of the wires are done yet
certain<00:02:44.380> is<00:02:44.470> basically<00:02:44.739> dual<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.160> routing

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
certain is basically dual that routing

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.440 
certain is basically dual that routing
later<00:02:45.700> on<00:02:46.530> also<00:02:47.530> all<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:48.040> fuel<00:02:48.850> line<00:02:49.090> needs<00:02:49.390> to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
later on also all the fuel line needs to

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.210 
later on also all the fuel line needs to
be<00:02:49.540> sorted<00:02:50.080> out<00:02:50.170> as<00:02:50.350> well<00:02:50.620> but<00:02:50.920> I've<00:02:51.040> in<00:02:51.190> my

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
be sorted out as well but I've in my

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.910 
be sorted out as well but I've in my
next<00:02:51.400> video<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.700> think<00:02:52.230> but<00:02:53.230> I'm<00:02:53.350> very<00:02:53.650> very

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
next video I think but I'm very very

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.830 
next video I think but I'm very very
close<00:02:54.160> now<00:02:54.519> very<00:02:55.000> close<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.480> painting<00:02:55.780> the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
close now very close to painting the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.160 
close now very close to painting the
chassis<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.790> doing<00:02:57.790> kind<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.420> final<00:02:58.840> assembly

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
chassis and doing kind of final assembly

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.830 
chassis and doing kind of final assembly
I<00:02:59.500> guess<00:02:59.709> and<00:03:00.060> that's<00:03:01.060> going<00:03:01.299> to<00:03:01.360> be<00:03:01.480> quite

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
I guess and that's going to be quite

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.920 
I guess and that's going to be quite
exciting<00:03:02.590> so<00:03:02.950> as<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.580> guys<00:03:03.700> can<00:03:03.940> see<00:03:04.000> the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
exciting so as you guys can see the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.580 
exciting so as you guys can see the
beast<00:03:05.560> is<00:03:05.860> getting<00:03:06.489> there<00:03:06.640> I<00:03:06.959> reckon<00:03:07.959> in<00:03:08.170> about

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
beast is getting there I reckon in about

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.390 
beast is getting there I reckon in about
or<00:03:09.420> three<00:03:10.420> weeks<00:03:10.630> time<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:12.010> engine<00:03:12.280> will<00:03:12.370> be

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
or three weeks time the engine will be

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.130 
or three weeks time the engine will be
running<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:12.940> it'll<00:03:13.570> be<00:03:13.750> hopefully<00:03:14.640> hopefully

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
running and it'll be hopefully hopefully

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.920 
running and it'll be hopefully hopefully
driving<00:03:17.140> hundreds<00:03:17.890> own<00:03:18.010> power<00:03:18.220> he<00:03:19.209> may<00:03:19.780> have<00:03:19.870> a

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
driving hundreds own power he may have a

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.550 
driving hundreds own power he may have a
long<00:03:20.110> shot<00:03:20.410> but<00:03:20.680> also<00:03:20.860> I<00:03:21.040> can<00:03:21.280> do<00:03:21.930> right<00:03:22.930> though

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560
