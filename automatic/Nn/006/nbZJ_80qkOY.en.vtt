00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
person from Duke that I think the truth

as<00:00:58.350> well<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> defense<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.149> he'll<00:01:00.449> hit

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
as well with the defense and he'll hit

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.840 
as well with the defense and he'll hit
that<00:01:00.780> open<00:01:01.050> 3-pointer<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:02.460> know<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:02.670> i<00:01:02.699> mean

so i think and Yao Ming has to stay

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920 
so i think and Yao Ming has to stay
healthy<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.430> order<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.180> Houston<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.780> it

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
they are going to play off the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.199 
they are going to play off the
think<00:03:08.130> overall<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.430> know<00:03:08.700> they<00:03:08.940> got<00:03:09.090> the

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
think overall you know they got the

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.400 
think overall you know they got the
running<00:03:09.510> game<00:03:09.600> I<00:03:09.660> think<00:03:09.810> this<00:03:10.049> would<00:03:10.140> be<00:03:10.170> much

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
running game I think this would be much

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.069 
running game I think this would be much
better<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:12.150> think<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.450> biggest<00:03:12.600> deal<00:03:12.840> last

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
better and I think the biggest deal last

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.539 
better and I think the biggest deal last
year<00:03:13.200> was<00:03:13.440> second<00:03:13.829> error<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.160> they<00:03:14.310> went<00:03:14.430> out

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
year was second error so they went out

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.520 
year was second error so they went out
and<00:03:14.610> dresta<00:03:15.090> debt<00:03:15.269> you<00:03:15.420> know<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.690> think<00:03:15.930> for

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
and dresta debt you know and I think for

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.560 
and dresta debt you know and I think for
a<00:03:16.560> fact<00:03:16.829> offering<00:03:17.790> Bush<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.180> his<00:03:18.269> difference

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
a fact offering Bush and his difference

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.160 
a fact offering Bush and his difference
of<00:03:18.690> staff<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.019> going<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.260> get<00:03:19.320> it<00:03:19.470> done
