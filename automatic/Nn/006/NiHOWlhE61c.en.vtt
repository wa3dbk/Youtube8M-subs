00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
here this video we're gonna have an

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.110 
here this video we're gonna have an
inside<00:00:13.290> look<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.920> Airmotive<00:00:14.370> fuel<00:00:14.880> pressure

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
inside look of Airmotive fuel pressure

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.359 
inside look of Airmotive fuel pressure
regulators<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:15.839> here's<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.109> quick<00:00:16.350> look<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:17.039> a

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
regulators so here's a quick look of a

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.670 
regulators so here's a quick look of a
Aeromotive<00:00:18.090> fuel<00:00:18.119> pressure<00:00:18.570> regulator<00:00:18.869> I'm

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
Aeromotive fuel pressure regulator I'm

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.740 
Aeromotive fuel pressure regulator I'm
gonna<00:00:19.859> put<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.189> together<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.000> guys<00:00:21.060> took

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
gonna put it together for you guys took

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.400 
gonna put it together for you guys took
it<00:00:21.900> all<00:00:21.990> apart<00:00:22.460> they<00:00:23.460> usually<00:00:23.609> run<00:00:23.970> around

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
it all apart they usually run around

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.800 
it all apart they usually run around
anywhere<00:00:25.410> from<00:00:25.619> 150<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.340> 200<00:00:27.119> plus<00:00:27.269> dollars

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
anywhere from 150 to 200 plus dollars

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.710 
anywhere from 150 to 200 plus dollars
and<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.109> ones<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.730> oil<00:00:29.730> filled<00:00:30.179> gauges

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
and the ones with the oil filled gauges

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.680 
and the ones with the oil filled gauges
they're<00:00:31.109> up<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.560> $200<00:00:32.130> range<00:00:32.510> this<00:00:33.510> one

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
they're up in the $200 range this one

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.780 
they're up in the $200 range this one
doesn't<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.079> model<00:00:34.410> number<00:00:34.710> but<00:00:34.950> they

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
doesn't have a model number but they

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.209 
doesn't have a model number but they
basically<00:00:36.420> all<00:00:36.719> do<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> same<00:00:37.140> thing<00:00:37.620> just

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
basically all do the same thing just

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.030 
basically all do the same thing just
regulate<00:00:38.730> fuel<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.989> let's<00:00:40.320> get<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.680> putting<00:00:40.920> it

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
regulate fuel so let's get to putting it

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.610 
regulate fuel so let's get to putting it
together<00:00:41.239> basically<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.629> your<00:00:42.660> screw

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
together basically you have your screw

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.160 
together basically you have your screw
right<00:00:43.829> here<00:00:44.190> or<00:00:44.370> bolt<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.420> lock<00:00:45.629> bolt<00:00:45.960> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
right here or bolt it's a lock bolt you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.479 
right here or bolt it's a lock bolt you
tighten<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.559> with<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.710> allen<00:00:47.010> wrench<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.430> then

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
tighten it with a allen wrench and then

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.670 
tighten it with a allen wrench and then
lock<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.969> nut<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.450> locks<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> fuel

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
lock the nut and that locks in the fuel

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.510 
lock the nut and that locks in the fuel
pressure<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:51.000> more<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.780> tighten<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.520> that

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
pressure the more you tighten it that

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.729 
pressure the more you tighten it that
raises<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.149> fuel<00:00:54.360> pressure<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.559> more

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
raises the fuel pressure and the more

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.660 
raises the fuel pressure and the more
you<00:00:55.829> loosen<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:58.219> lowers<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.430> fuel

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
you loosen it that lowers the fuel

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.260 
you loosen it that lowers the fuel
pressure<00:01:00.079> so<00:01:01.079> let's<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.460> pretty<00:01:03.090> much

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
pressure so let's get to it pretty much

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.600 
pressure so let's get to it pretty much
we<00:01:03.510> just<00:01:03.690> take<00:01:03.899> our<00:01:04.110> bolt<00:01:04.439> stick<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.580> through

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
we just take our bolt stick it through

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.899 
we just take our bolt stick it through
the<00:01:05.850> top<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.860> Aeromotive<00:01:08.450> housing<00:01:09.830> then

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
the top of the Aeromotive housing then

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.520 
the top of the Aeromotive housing then
we<00:01:11.909> take<00:01:12.090> our<00:01:12.270> washer<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.900> as<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.470> see

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
we take our washer and as you can see

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.859 
we take our washer and as you can see
it's<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.250> been<00:01:15.110> scarred<00:01:16.110> right<00:01:16.380> there<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
it's it's been scarred right there and

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.749 
it's it's been scarred right there and
on<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.049> side<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:20.009> scarred<00:01:20.460> where<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
on this side it's scarred where the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.999 
on this side it's scarred where the
spring<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.170> know<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
spring is so we know that this is the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.310 
spring is so we know that this is the
spring<00:01:23.310> side<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.450> anyhow<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.780> flip<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.259> down

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
spring side so anyhow we flip that down

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.149 
spring side so anyhow we flip that down
there<00:01:25.799> like<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:27.259> we<00:01:28.259> take<00:01:28.470> our<00:01:28.619> spring<00:01:28.979> it

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
there like that we take our spring it

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.710 
there like that we take our spring it
doesn't<00:01:29.460> matter<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.909> goes<00:01:29.939> up<00:01:30.570> or<00:01:30.869> down<00:01:32.720> set

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
doesn't matter if it goes up or down set

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.859 
doesn't matter if it goes up or down set
that<00:01:33.930> like<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.350> then<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:34.950> got<00:01:35.100> our<00:01:35.340> diaphragm

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
that like that then we got our diaphragm

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.390 
that like that then we got our diaphragm
and<00:01:36.869> we<00:01:36.960> got<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.110> little<00:01:37.259> BB<00:01:37.740> right<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.220> they

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
and we got a little BB right here they

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.719 
and we got a little BB right here they
make<00:01:38.579> them<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.409> seals<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
make them like this and it seals the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.960 
make them like this and it seals the
bottom<00:01:42.180> where<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.320> return<00:01:43.680> goes<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
bottom where the return goes and the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.719 
bottom where the return goes and the
diaphragm<00:01:45.240> goes<00:01:45.630> out<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.950> lower<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.490> fuel

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
diaphragm goes out to lower the fuel

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.830 
diaphragm goes out to lower the fuel
pressure<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:50.250> raise<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.299> restricts

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
pressure and in to raise it it restricts

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.789 
pressure and in to raise it it restricts
it<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.860> right<00:01:53.189> here<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.460> where<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.729> BB<00:01:54.090> goes

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
it and right here is where that BB goes

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.490 
it and right here is where that BB goes
that's<00:01:55.799> what<00:01:56.040> seals<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.540> now<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.170> pretty

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
that's what seals it so now we pretty

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.219 
that's what seals it so now we pretty
much<00:01:58.590> take<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.640> I'm<00:02:00.600> gonna<00:02:00.750> clean<00:02:01.079> it

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
much take this and I'm gonna clean it

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.109 
much take this and I'm gonna clean it
off<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.829> hair<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.759> got<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> little<00:02:03.270> bit<00:02:03.450> of

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
off just a hair it's got a little bit of

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.670 
off just a hair it's got a little bit of
material<00:02:06.119> from<00:02:06.689> tightening<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.439> loosening

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
material from tightening and loosening

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.859 
material from tightening and loosening
the<00:02:08.129> spring<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:09.119> don't<00:02:09.270> want<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.479> get<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.780> in

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
the spring you don't want to get that in

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.510 
the spring you don't want to get that in
your<00:02:09.959> fuel<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.619> make<00:02:10.800> sure<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.069> clean<00:02:11.340> that

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
your fuel so make sure you clean that

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.040 
your fuel so make sure you clean that
off<00:02:11.730> I'm<00:02:12.000> going<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.209> clean<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.569> real<00:02:12.810> quick

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
off I'm going to clean this real quick

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.800 
off I'm going to clean this real quick
and<00:02:13.080> we'll<00:02:13.440> get<00:02:13.590> back

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
and we'll get back

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.199 
and we'll get back
to<00:02:14.190> assembling<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.370> all<00:02:15.610> right<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:15.940> it's<00:02:16.090> all

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
to assembling it all right so it's all

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.890 
to assembling it all right so it's all
cleaned<00:02:16.540> up<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:17.410> we<00:02:17.560> take<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:18.040> like<00:02:18.340> this<00:02:18.900> set

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
cleaned up so we take it like this set

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.050 
cleaned up so we take it like this set
it<00:02:20.020> right<00:02:20.140> on<00:02:20.200> top<00:02:20.560> like<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.830> now<00:02:21.580> this<00:02:21.880> is

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
it right on top like that now this is

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.270 
it right on top like that now this is
the<00:02:22.180> tricky<00:02:22.540> part<00:02:22.569> you<00:02:23.290> have<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.560> compress<00:02:24.010> it

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
the tricky part you have to compress it

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.100 
the tricky part you have to compress it
in<00:02:24.790> order<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.840> get<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.140> back<00:02:26.380> on<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:28.120> bottom

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
in order to get it back on the bottom

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.460 
in order to get it back on the bottom
part<00:02:29.410> where<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.190> return<00:02:30.519> is<00:02:30.700> so<00:02:31.569> what<00:02:32.170> we<00:02:32.290> need

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
part where the return is so what we need

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.270 
part where the return is so what we need
to<00:02:32.500> do<00:02:32.739> is<00:02:33.040> we<00:02:33.940> want<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.239> just<00:02:34.540> take<00:02:34.870> out<00:02:35.280> the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
to do is we want to just take out the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.910 
to do is we want to just take out the
screw<00:02:36.640> or<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.360> bolt<00:02:37.599> as<00:02:37.840> far<00:02:38.260> as<00:02:38.380> we<00:02:38.500> can<00:02:38.739> and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
screw or the bolt as far as we can and

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.890 
screw or the bolt as far as we can and
that<00:02:39.099> as<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:39.670> can<00:02:39.760> see<00:02:39.819> is<00:02:40.150> lowering<00:02:40.569> the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
that as you can see is lowering the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.490 
that as you can see is lowering the
spring<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:42.130> just<00:02:42.970> kind<00:02:43.209> of<00:02:43.269> leave<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:44.470> can

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
spring so just kind of leave it you can

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.199 
spring so just kind of leave it you can
actually<00:02:44.830> leave<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.310> completely<00:02:45.489> out<00:02:45.910> it

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
actually leave it completely out it

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.729 
actually leave it completely out it
doesn't<00:02:46.390> have<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.810> be<00:02:46.930> in<00:02:47.049> there<00:02:47.260> until<00:02:47.500> we're

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
doesn't have to be in there until we're

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.280 
doesn't have to be in there until we're
ready<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.610> adjust<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.209> pressure<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:50.230> it

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
ready to adjust the pressure so it

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.479 
ready to adjust the pressure so it
doesn't<00:02:50.530> matter<00:02:50.620> which<00:02:50.890> way<00:02:51.130> this<00:02:51.340> goes

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
doesn't matter which way this goes

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.520 
doesn't matter which way this goes
around<00:02:52.180> because<00:02:52.540> they're<00:02:52.660> all<00:02:52.810> four<00:02:53.110> on<00:02:53.350> this

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
around because they're all four on this

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.559 
around because they're all four on this
model<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:55.080> we<00:02:56.080> basically<00:02:56.620> take<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.269> like<00:02:58.269> this

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
model and we basically take it like this

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.320 
model and we basically take it like this
and<00:02:58.840> we're<00:02:59.080> going<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.260> put<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.530> on<00:02:59.620> top<00:02:59.799> now

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
and we're going to put it on top now

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.120 
and we're going to put it on top now
whichever<00:03:01.330> way<00:03:01.660> you<00:03:01.720> want<00:03:02.170> this<00:03:02.440> nipple<00:03:02.799> right

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
whichever way you want this nipple right

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.890 
whichever way you want this nipple right
here<00:03:03.430> for<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.760> vacuum<00:03:04.239> for<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.569> intake

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
here for the vacuum for the intake

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.809 
here for the vacuum for the intake
manifold<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.530> pulls<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.130> pressure<00:03:06.400> on<00:03:06.730> the

manifold that pulls the pressure on the

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.600 
manifold that pulls the pressure on the
diaphragm<00:03:07.049> you<00:03:08.049> need<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.410> adjust<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.370> or

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
diaphragm you need to adjust that or

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.130 
diaphragm you need to adjust that or
turn<00:03:09.849> it<00:03:10.000> which<00:03:10.150> way<00:03:10.390> you<00:03:10.450> want<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:10.989> doesn't

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
turn it which way you want it doesn't

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.839 
turn it which way you want it doesn't
matter<00:03:11.290> if<00:03:11.530> it's<00:03:11.650> this<00:03:11.860> way<00:03:12.069> this<00:03:12.310> way<00:03:12.519> or<00:03:12.700> this

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
matter if it's this way this way or this

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.809 
matter if it's this way this way or this
way<00:03:12.910> but<00:03:13.569> this<00:03:13.750> is<00:03:13.900> just<00:03:14.310> what<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.459> want<00:03:15.489> to

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
way but this is just what you want to

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.940 
way but this is just what you want to
have<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.390> positioned<00:03:16.599> so<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.230> can<00:03:17.440> install<00:03:17.769> it

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
have it positioned so you can install it

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.560 
have it positioned so you can install it
properly<00:03:17.980> on<00:03:18.579> your<00:03:18.730> vehicle<00:03:19.090> every<00:03:19.329> vehicle

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
properly on your vehicle every vehicle

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.210 
properly on your vehicle every vehicle
is<00:03:19.810> going<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:19.959> be<00:03:20.049> different<00:03:20.410> I<00:03:20.560> need<00:03:20.980> mine

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
is going to be different I need mine

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.819 
is going to be different I need mine
away<00:03:21.609> from<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.390> head<00:03:22.630> so<00:03:22.989> if<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.380> install<00:03:23.769> it

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
away from the head so if I install it

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.370 
away from the head so if I install it
say<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:25.030> way<00:03:25.269> it'll<00:03:25.570> be<00:03:25.750> hitting<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.019> head

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
say this way it'll be hitting the head

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.520 
say this way it'll be hitting the head
anyhow<00:03:27.070> so<00:03:27.459> we<00:03:28.269> just<00:03:28.450> put<00:03:28.630> this<00:03:28.780> on<00:03:29.019> top<00:03:29.230> like

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
anyhow so we just put this on top like

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.490 
anyhow so we just put this on top like
this<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:31.390> pretty<00:03:31.600> much<00:03:31.780> self<00:03:32.109> aligns

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
this and it pretty much self aligns

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.610 
this and it pretty much self aligns
itself<00:03:32.739> on<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:34.890> BB<00:03:35.890> so<00:03:36.810> if<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.900> can<00:03:38.079> see<00:03:38.319> here

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
itself on the BB so if you can see here

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.979 
itself on the BB so if you can see here
the<00:03:38.829> BB<00:03:39.160> goes<00:03:39.370> right<00:03:39.609> there<00:03:39.850> so<00:03:40.180> we<00:03:40.660> can<00:03:40.840> just

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
the BB goes right there so we can just

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.229 
the BB goes right there so we can just
set<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.350> right<00:03:41.500> right<00:03:41.980> like<00:03:42.190> that<00:03:42.489> where<00:03:43.120> the

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
set it right right like that where the

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.300 
set it right right like that where the
BB<00:03:43.540> is<00:03:43.600> touching<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.200> be<00:03:44.769> careful<00:03:45.130> when

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
BB is touching and be careful when

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.259 
BB is touching and be careful when
you're<00:03:45.430> screwing<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.790> together<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:46.209> don't

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
you're screwing it together you don't

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.910 
you're screwing it together you don't
want<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.540> screw<00:03:46.840> through<00:03:47.079> the<00:03:47.109> diaphragm<00:03:47.739> and

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
want to screw through the diaphragm and

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.759 
want to screw through the diaphragm and
tear<00:03:48.190> it<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:49.090> that's<00:03:49.359> one<00:03:49.810> of<00:03:49.959> them<00:03:50.079> concerns

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
tear it so that's one of them concerns

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.710 
tear it so that's one of them concerns
that<00:03:50.980> you<00:03:51.100> should<00:03:51.280> have<00:03:51.489> so<00:03:52.299> I'm<00:03:52.420> gonna<00:03:52.540> go

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
that you should have so I'm gonna go

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.330 
that you should have so I'm gonna go
check<00:03:52.959> out<00:03:53.109> which<00:03:53.530> way<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:53.799> needs<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:53.980> be<00:03:54.069> on<00:03:54.220> my

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
check out which way it needs to be on my

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.250 
check out which way it needs to be on my
vehicle<00:03:54.519> and<00:03:54.910> then<00:03:55.299> we'll<00:03:55.510> just<00:03:55.690> screw<00:03:56.200> it

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
vehicle and then we'll just screw it

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.470 
vehicle and then we'll just screw it
back<00:03:56.380> together<00:03:56.530> okay<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:57.400> I<00:03:57.609> got<00:03:57.880> that<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.389> I'm

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
back together okay so I got that and I'm

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.629

gonna start it this is the position I

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.490 
gonna start it this is the position I
need<00:04:00.850> so<00:04:01.450> you<00:04:01.540> just<00:04:01.720> kind<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:01.989> want<00:04:02.109> to<00:04:02.260> feed

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
need so you just kind of want to feed

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.710 
need so you just kind of want to feed
one<00:04:02.799> in<00:04:02.980> there<00:04:03.359> just<00:04:04.359> line<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:04.660> up<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:06.630> it's<00:04:07.630> a

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
one in there just line it up and it's a

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.210 
one in there just line it up and it's a
little<00:04:07.870> difficult<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:08.470> can<00:04:08.709> put<00:04:08.889> it<00:04:08.980> in<00:04:09.130> a

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
little difficult you can put it in a

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.789 
little difficult you can put it in a
vise<00:04:09.630> but<00:04:10.630> I<00:04:10.660> think<00:04:10.930> I<00:04:10.989> got<00:04:11.200> it<00:04:11.350> with<00:04:11.470> one<00:04:11.739> hand

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
vise but I think I got it with one hand

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.520 
vise but I think I got it with one hand
so<00:04:14.799> let's<00:04:15.160> just<00:04:15.609> get<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:15.819> started<00:04:16.530> there's

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
so let's just get that started there's

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.420 
so let's just get that started there's
one<00:04:17.889> and<00:04:18.220> then<00:04:18.880> I<00:04:19.590> think<00:04:20.590> we<00:04:20.680> can<00:04:20.799> get<00:04:20.919> a<00:04:20.950> second

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
one and then I think we can get a second

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.540 
one and then I think we can get a second
one<00:04:21.549> started<00:04:22.770> pretty<00:04:23.770> much<00:04:23.860> that's<00:04:24.159> all<00:04:24.370> there
