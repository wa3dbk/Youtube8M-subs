00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:13.250
 hello friends i'm in some of 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.100
 the video there told how our schools 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.609
 began as there were a lot of people not 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.439
 proficient in english and i'm there 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.039
 somehow methodically solved this issue in 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:29.000
 particular means the form of the pdf file was 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:32.480
 test book and I had 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.040
 buddy programmer who wrote 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.760
 mean what little program 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.840
 Utility such which once dog on 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.030
 this whole book on keywords and 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.310
 further in frequency order lined up and 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.560
 Here it turned out that there is the word testing there 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.960
 occurs 5,000 times and the words there I donâ€™t 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.030
 I know quality meet two thousand times 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.160
 and here's the program all this automatically 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.020
 I made it from the file by the way and not for long 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.530
 I wrote I think that maybe there for 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.559
 half a day wrote 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.559
 and 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.500
 I have repeatedly said Mikhail but 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.030
 here this one again and frequency which you 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.340
 did here by this book by 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.460
 testing is it possible there 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.010
 You can not get it because 20 years 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.170
 passed I do not know where it is what it is there 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.630
 some floppy disks were up to 6 i found this 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.480
 diskette suddenly I can not read that 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.900
 on it but in the floppy that keeps it 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.380
 how much are you nowhere to sense like that hussar and 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.010
 let them be silent but really why nowhere 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.250
 mean i wanted to ask i know what 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.680
 among our audience there are people who 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.600
 programmed and I thought that maybe 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.790
 do such a common task that here 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.070
 What file is taken in this file? 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.869
 the book in this background is then thank God 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.390
 Here is the file and here it is prepared and 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.360
 frequency dictionaries are made from it 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.729
 on this file 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.940
 just write this utility I am not someone 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.860
 height can spend there what 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.300
 amount of time to write this i 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.390
 I think it would be great we are in her 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.590
 hanged where the thread link would give a link 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.030
 where is she hanging so that all people can imagine 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.800
 under some subject to gain vocabulary 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.390
 it makes sense that if you 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.100
 acting architecture or there 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.520
 programming or testing and 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.650
 administering so that the person is there 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.260
 on this vocabulary could quickly start reading 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.380
 literature or and talk too i think 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.870
 that lively speech it should also 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.810
 be actively used so if someone 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.590
 will take here I call night 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.239
 volunteers take up the task and or 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.650
 if you want a few people there i'm 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.410
 what can be more than one 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.130
 wishing you then in Tomsk comments 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.750
 operate 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.330
 and and solve the problem and let's learn 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.500
 make files and you know the files now 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.510
 now full take there for 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.569
 testing any perfect little book 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.190
 see what happens and then like this 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.180
 that if someone takes it I will be very 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.180
 thank you thanks
