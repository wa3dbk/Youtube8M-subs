00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
design I've made it from someone here on

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.660 
design I've made it from someone here on
YouTube<00:02:12.290> because<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.470> lot<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.950> design<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.459> it's

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
YouTube because a lot of design and it's

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.760 
YouTube because a lot of design and it's
actually<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.180> perfect<00:02:15.510> skill<00:02:15.930> for<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.620> know

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770

everything so over to my su race yes to
race<00:02:22.290> but<00:02:22.860> you've<00:02:23.099> seen<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.780> blu-ray<00:02:25.130> anyhow

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
race but you've seen a blu-ray anyhow

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.729 
race but you've seen a blu-ray anyhow
it's<00:02:26.280> built<00:02:26.519> series<00:02:26.910> episode<00:02:27.450> 1<00:02:29.690> well<00:02:30.739> these

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
it's built series episode 1 well these

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.970 
it's built series episode 1 well these
are<00:02:32.310> red<00:02:33.090> because<00:02:33.720> I<00:02:33.989> changed<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.470> color<00:02:34.680> and

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
are red because I changed the color and

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.050 
are red because I changed the color and
red<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.580> red<00:02:35.910> designs<00:02:36.330> are<00:02:36.950> cooler<00:02:37.950> or<00:02:38.400> a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
red and red designs are cooler or a

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.280 
red and red designs are cooler or a
lighter<00:02:39.959> red<00:02:40.110> designs<00:02:40.880> instead<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.090> blue

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
lighter red designs instead of the blue

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.190 
lighter red designs instead of the blue
because<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.069> red<00:02:44.340> design<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.080> if<00:02:46.080> you

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
because this is a red design and if you

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.039 
because this is a red design and if you
want<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.470> know<00:02:46.590> what<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.920> blue<00:02:47.220> design<00:02:47.459> was<00:02:48.049> just

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
want to know what a blue design was just

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.110 
want to know what a blue design was just
a<00:02:49.290> fluke<00:02:49.799> at<00:02:50.069> T<00:02:50.489> how<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:50.940> build<00:02:51.269> series<00:02:51.510> part<00:02:51.870> 1

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
a fluke at T how to build series part 1

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.910 
a fluke at T how to build series part 1
so<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.480> actually<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.810> same<00:02:55.049> just<00:02:55.349> go<00:02:55.560> red

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
so it's actually the same just go red

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.850 
so it's actually the same just go red
and<00:02:56.190> some<00:02:56.370> pieces<00:02:56.640> I've<00:02:57.650> changed<00:02:59.299> so<00:03:00.860> right

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
and some pieces I've changed so right

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:09.650 
and some pieces I've changed so right
over<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:03.200> UNSC<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:05.190> course<00:03:08.030> over<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.239> my<00:03:09.390> war
