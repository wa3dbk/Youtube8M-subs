00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that in the second round it would be

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.829 
that in the second round it would be
over<00:00:59.550> because<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.999> low<00:01:00.120> kicks<00:01:00.329> because<00:01:00.600> he<00:01:00.719> was

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
over because it low kicks because he was

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.049 
over because it low kicks because he was
like<00:01:01.019> stumbling<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.589> bit<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.249> he<00:01:02.699> took<00:01:02.879> him

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
like stumbling a bit but he took him

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.180

five<00:01:03.570> rounds<00:01:03.960> long<00:01:04.110> yeah<00:01:04.440> i<00:01:04.470> think<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
five rounds long yeah i think is a

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.610 
five rounds long yeah i think is a
strong<00:01:05.730> mind<00:01:05.940> i<00:01:06.090> think<00:01:06.300> and<00:01:06.540> he<00:01:07.290> didn't<00:01:07.500> want

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
strong mind i think and he didn't want

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.740 
strong mind i think and he didn't want
to<00:01:07.680> lose<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.120> said<00:01:09.300> my<00:01:09.390> poor<00:01:09.570> folks
