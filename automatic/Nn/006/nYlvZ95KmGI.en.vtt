centerpiece out so it looks you have to
disconnect<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.759> linkages<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.470> thin

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
disconnect the linkages it's just a thin

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.249 
disconnect the linkages it's just a thin
here<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.280> there's<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> net<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.750> there<00:01:21.960> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the stock shifter is pretty much the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.929 
the stock shifter is pretty much the
same<00:01:24.680> so<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.799> then<00:01:25.920> once<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.369> undo<00:01:26.700> those

undo these four large bolts and that
whole<00:01:32.490> Center<00:01:33.000> piece<00:01:33.600> should<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.140> come<00:01:34.409> out

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
whole Center piece should just come out

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.460 
whole Center piece should just come out
already<00:01:36.979> alright<00:01:37.979> once<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.280> enter<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> bolts

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
already alright once you enter the bolts

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.840 
already alright once you enter the bolts
officially<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.560> pop<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.979> out<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.700> still

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
officially is pop it out and it's still

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.870 
officially is pop it out and it's still
attached<00:01:42.240> because<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.869> two<00:01:43.229> cables<00:01:43.619> here

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
attached because of the two cables here

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.710 
attached because of the two cables here
you<00:01:44.880> don't<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.240> take<00:01:45.420> them<00:01:45.540> outside

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
you don't have to take them outside

you don't have to take them outside
necessary<00:01:47.180> basically<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.540> look<00:01:49.079> at<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
necessary basically do is look at the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.480 
necessary basically do is look at the
bottom<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:51.030> take<00:01:51.329> off<00:01:51.540> these<00:01:52.530> two<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.250> then

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
bottom and take off these two and then

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.990 
bottom and take off these two and then
those<00:01:54.360> two<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:55.020> they'll<00:01:55.860> pop<00:01:56.100> off<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.549> bottom

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
those two and they'll pop off the bottom

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.709 
those two and they'll pop off the bottom
assembly<00:02:01.790> alright<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:02.969> once<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.270> take<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.570> out

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
assembly alright so once you take it out

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.300 
assembly alright so once you take it out
this<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.140> pretty<00:02:04.350> much<00:02:04.409> all<00:02:04.619> you're<00:02:04.829> left<00:02:05.040> with

next part you just basically

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.130 
next part you just basically
disassembled<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:11.610> it's<00:02:11.879> fairly<00:02:12.450> simple<00:02:12.810> you

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
disassembled this it's fairly simple you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.589 
disassembled this it's fairly simple you
pop<00:02:13.500> out<00:02:13.650> take<00:02:14.489> off<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.760> little<00:02:15.770> sprocket

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
pop out take off this little sprocket

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
that's all and then you get to pop it

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.580 
that's all and then you get to pop it
out<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.069> here<00:02:24.140> kind<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.170> hard<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.440> do

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
out of here kind of hard to do

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.710 
out of here kind of hard to do
one-handed<00:02:26.870> go<00:02:27.870> okay<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.650> there<00:02:29.099> you<00:02:29.129> go

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
one-handed go okay so there you go

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.880 
one-handed go okay so there you go
that's<00:02:30.720> all<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.319> then<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:31.769> basically

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
that's all and then you just basically

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.600 
that's all and then you just basically
pop<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.519> out<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:32.970> socket<00:02:34.400> pop<00:02:35.400> this

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
pop this out of the socket pop this

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.770 
pop this out of the socket pop this
white<00:02:35.879> piece<00:02:36.390> off<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:38.190> little<00:02:38.519> thing

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
white piece off and this little thing

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.960 
white piece off and this little thing
place<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.959> on<00:02:40.080> your<00:02:40.110> new<00:02:40.379> shifter<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.040> then

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
place it on your new shifter and then

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.000 
place it on your new shifter and then
reassemble<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.750> in<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.959> same<00:02:43.200> way<00:02:44.540> so<00:02:46.010> undo

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
reassemble it in the same way so undo

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.500 
reassemble it in the same way so undo
that<00:02:47.660> okay<00:02:48.830> but<00:02:49.830> this<00:02:50.819> is<00:02:50.940> gonna<00:02:51.090> require<00:02:51.180> your

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
that okay but this is gonna require your

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.449 
that okay but this is gonna require your
hands<00:02:51.720> anyway<00:02:52.110> you'll<00:02:52.560> also<00:02:52.800> depending<00:02:53.370> what

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
hands anyway you'll also depending what

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.520 
hands anyway you'll also depending what
kit<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:53.790> get<00:02:53.940> you'll<00:02:54.120> get<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.300> spacer<00:02:55.080> plate<00:02:55.110> I

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
kit you get you'll get a spacer plate I

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.320 
kit you get you'll get a spacer plate I
recommend<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.459> use<00:02:56.489> it<00:02:56.760> because<00:02:56.879> it<00:02:57.180> does

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
recommend you use it because it does

recommend you use it because it does
help<00:02:57.830> with<00:02:58.830> the<00:03:00.500> quickness<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.769> shifting

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
help with the quickness of the shifting

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.280 
help with the quickness of the shifting
of<00:03:02.129> this<00:03:02.310> lower<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:02.940> bit<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.870> basically

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
of this lower it a bit you basically

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.509 
of this lower it a bit you basically
place<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.739> on<00:03:04.860> top<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.560> lowers<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:08.069> shifter

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
place it on top so it lowers the shifter

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.180 
place it on top so it lowers the shifter
making<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.209> shifts<00:03:09.629> actually<00:03:09.930> quicker<00:03:10.890> than

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
making the shifts actually quicker than

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.790 
making the shifts actually quicker than
without<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.659> there<00:03:13.349> you<00:03:13.440> go

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
without it so there you go

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.149 
without it so there you go
and<00:03:14.280> then<00:03:14.730> basically<00:03:15.000> reassembly<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.159> the

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
and then basically reassembly is the

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.550 
and then basically reassembly is the
reverse<00:03:17.459> order

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
reverse order

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.619 
reverse order
so<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.590> hope<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:19.950> helped<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.450> if<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.540> guys
