00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.880

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.760

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.029

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.269
 everyone understood now I 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.610
 take the posts I'm starting from 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.920
 wine goes behind it does not hurt too much 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.820
 the door at the price of gaulle is a milk 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.739
 in front of the guys it was not enough 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.640
 so far the fifteen loops that 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.040
 well vallorbe 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.399
 the team was not doing terrible 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.039
 today I may repeat myself but 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.219
 I want the will the camaraderie is 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.300
 vain lucidity it is clear dearly 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.449
 training this week 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.879
 almost zero what made you but I tell you 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.409
 still gives this chance today 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:07.770
 jean michel married yesterday I will judge 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.979
 until you can run if you have not 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.170
 too much drunk six very good times 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.600
 I hope that it will go wish that a good 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.850
 luck today it's fantastic 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.369
 what are you doing for the team to come play 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.049
 still today I did not count 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.270
 a lot on canvas and then stella that's 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.979
 normal you play marcel defensive half 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.520
 it's normal that you resume your place 1 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.680
 that's okay there you deserve it you have 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.430
 help the team someone you have to show 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.600
 to these young people a half-defensive spending 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.520
 no better ground is paying attention 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.649
 the parents' team plays quiet at 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.840
 departure dissipates he is right and 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.979
 then if we win 2 or 3 0 at half time I 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.500
 would you eat or I do not know what 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.140
 okay but at the beginning still softly you 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.340
 stay behind you block this game all 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:00.149
 to jean-marc enlightens every game it plays 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.409
 with not that the coaches of a clown 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.479
 remember but what I tell you this 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.640
 week still head to a clown is 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.350
 arrived once 10 hours once 7:30 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.539
 at one time eight o'clock we never know 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.430
 everything happens on the other hand 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.690
 can not say anything yet but does 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.300
 be careful because that 's 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.520
 stuff 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.870
 sorry do not do the workouts if you 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.970
 do not come then all of a sudden you make me 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.370
 Sunday you risk finding many 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.360
 two transmit on the sidelines 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.680
 the other night I tell you that you would play 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.680
 not a winch 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.820
 did not I tell you the aubade I had to 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.550
 resume a little bit a celtic 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.620
 always and initially so I hope that 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.820
 it wants to play in the first half at the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:40.510
 half time you think of me to tell me 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:42.340
 how are you okay on those days 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.410
 Saint Bartholomew played against Saint 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.410
 cross and win easily 5 1
