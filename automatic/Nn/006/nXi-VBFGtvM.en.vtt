update<00:00:06.690> for<00:00:06.930> Minecraft<00:00:07.319> came<00:00:07.529> out<00:00:07.649> yesterday

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
update for Minecraft came out yesterday

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.720 
update for Minecraft came out yesterday
and<00:00:08.570> that<00:00:09.570> released<00:00:09.960> pistons<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.280> lot<00:00:11.550> of

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
and that released pistons and a lot of

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.049 
and that released pistons and a lot of
other<00:00:11.940> redstone<00:00:12.630> related<00:00:13.170> items<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:14.059> shears

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
other redstone related items and shears

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.990 
other redstone related items and shears
and<00:00:15.770> a<00:00:18.529> really<00:00:19.529> cool<00:00:19.710> way<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:19.980> use<00:00:20.130> Pistons<00:00:20.730> is

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
and a really cool way to use Pistons is

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.519 
and a really cool way to use Pistons is
to<00:00:21.630> make<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.990> extending<00:00:22.769> bridge<00:00:23.039> which<00:00:24.000> is

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
to make a extending bridge which is

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.009 
to make a extending bridge which is
fairly<00:00:25.529> simple<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.099> do<00:00:26.449> which<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.750> put

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
fairly simple to do which you just put

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.959 
fairly simple to do which you just put
delayed<00:00:28.619> repeaters<00:00:29.449> every<00:00:30.449> other<00:00:30.689> block<00:00:31.080> and

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
delayed repeaters every other block and

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.120 
delayed repeaters every other block and
extend<00:00:32.969> torches<00:00:33.649> extended<00:00:34.649> missions<00:00:34.980> like

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
extend torches extended missions like

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.119 
extend torches extended missions like
this<00:00:35.340> right<00:00:35.910> but<00:00:36.829> retracting<00:00:37.829> them<00:00:37.980> is

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
this right but retracting them is

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.729 
this right but retracting them is
extremely<00:00:38.910> difficult<00:00:39.390> due<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.410> fact<00:00:40.620> that

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
extremely difficult due to the fact that

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.180 
extremely difficult due to the fact that
you<00:00:40.950> cannot<00:00:41.719> pull<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:43.050> piston<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> sticky

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
you cannot pull a piston with a sticky

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.270 
you cannot pull a piston with a sticky
piston<00:00:44.390> if<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.600> extended<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:47.129> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
piston if it's extended so you have to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.240 
piston if it's extended so you have to
delay<00:00:47.579> them<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.090> certain<00:00:48.360> pattern<00:00:48.920> in<00:00:49.920> order

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
delay them in a certain pattern in order

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.340 
delay them in a certain pattern in order
for<00:00:50.489> them<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:52.430> get<00:00:53.430> stuck<00:00:54.180> by<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> other

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
for them to get get stuck by the other

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.770 
for them to get get stuck by the other
sticky<00:00:55.710> piston<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.250> pull<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.550> backwards<00:00:56.780> so

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
sticky piston and pull it backwards so

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
sticky piston and pull it backwards so
back<00:00:58.500> here<00:00:58.530> I've<00:00:59.219> created<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.850> bunch<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:01.020> way

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
back here I've created a bunch it's way

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.290 
back here I've created a bunch it's way
more<00:01:01.829> complicated<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.820> needs<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.180> be

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
more complicated that it needs to be

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.480 
more complicated that it needs to be
combination<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.500> delays<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:07.490> each

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
combination of delays going to each

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.870 
combination of delays going to each
piston<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:09.299> each<00:01:09.600> opening<00:01:10.729> there's<00:01:11.729> one

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
piston or each opening there's one

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.670 
piston or each opening there's one
underground<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.659> every<00:01:13.110> other<00:01:13.229> goes

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
underground to every other goes

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.060 
underground to every other goes
underground<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.439> they're<00:01:16.619> all<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
underground so and they're all going to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.410 
underground so and they're all going to
the<00:01:17.340> Pistons<00:01:17.729> when<00:01:17.939> they're<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.240> that

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the Pistons when they're in that

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.170 
the Pistons when they're in that
position<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.380> pretty<00:01:20.220> much<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.670> starts

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
position and pretty much it just starts

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.440 
position and pretty much it just starts
off<00:01:21.450> right<00:01:21.810> here<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.340> first<00:01:23.580> pulse<00:01:23.850> then

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
off right here with the first pulse then

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.899 
off right here with the first pulse then
it's<00:01:24.780> splits<00:01:25.590> into<00:01:25.740> two<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.100> delays<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.820> then

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
it's splits into two and delays and then

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.929 
it's splits into two and delays and then
this<00:01:27.180> one<00:01:27.420> goes<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> next<00:01:28.860> ones<00:01:29.189> that's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
this one goes on to the next ones that's

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.859 
this one goes on to the next ones that's
so<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.479> go<00:01:30.750> forth<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:32.210> pull<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> Pistons<00:01:33.659> back

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
so on go forth to pull the Pistons back

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.359 
so on go forth to pull the Pistons back
in<00:01:34.020> order<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.439> I'll<00:01:34.650> show<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.890> how<00:01:35.159> this

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
in order and I'll show you how this

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.749 
in order and I'll show you how this
works<00:01:36.350> see<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.680> there's<00:01:38.369> anything<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:38.670> don't

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
works see if there's anything they don't

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.069 
works see if there's anything they don't
pull<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> other<00:01:39.360> because<00:01:39.720> they're<00:01:40.049> all

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
pull in the other because they're all

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.190 
pull in the other because they're all
extended<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.369> I've<00:01:41.579> created<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.659> delay<00:01:42.990> system

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
extended but I've created a delay system

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.969 
extended but I've created a delay system
which<00:01:43.860> makes<00:01:44.100> them<00:01:44.340> retract

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.690 

then<00:01:49.979> extend<00:01:50.549> them<00:01:50.670> again<00:01:51.110> do<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.229> how<00:01:52.470> much

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
then extend them again do this how much

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.920 
then extend them again do this how much
however<00:01:53.700> many<00:01:53.880> times

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
however many times

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.140 
however many times
works<00:01:55.920> every<00:01:56.070> time<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:59.340> course<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.790> could<00:02:00.120> have

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
works every time of course I could have

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.110 
works every time of course I could have
made<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.570> underground<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.800> way<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.730> lot

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
made this underground and or way a lot

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.400 
made this underground and or way a lot
smaller<00:02:03.540> hello

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
smaller hello

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.850 
smaller hello
this<00:02:04.920> was<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.190> first<00:02:05.600> sort<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.690> prototype<00:02:07.080> so

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
this was the first sort of prototype so

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.560 
this was the first sort of prototype so
I<00:02:07.890> didn't<00:02:08.310> really<00:02:08.550> think<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:09.030> conserving

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
I didn't really think of conserving

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.440 
I didn't really think of conserving
space<00:02:09.950> just<00:02:10.950> trying<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:12.110> create<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.200> design<00:02:13.710> and

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
space just trying to create a design and

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.760 
space just trying to create a design and
