00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.850 
however starting yes he's going for the
one<00:03:08.870> gate<00:03:10.330> cybernetics<00:03:11.330> core<00:03:11.570> build<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:12.230> he'll

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
one gate cybernetics core build so he'll

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.610 
one gate cybernetics core build so he'll
probably<00:03:12.890> go<00:03:13.400> faster<00:03:13.880> girls<00:03:14.090> into<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.620> river

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
probably go faster girls into a river

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.340 
probably go faster girls into a river
drop<00:03:15.980> probably<00:03:16.540> but<00:03:17.540> you<00:03:17.600> should<00:03:17.900> build<00:03:18.140> your

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
drop probably but you should build your

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.130 
drop probably but you should build your
goons<00:03:18.560> build<00:03:19.250> some<00:03:19.400> probes<00:03:19.700> me<00:03:19.910> but<00:03:20.810> sadly

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
goons build some probes me but sadly

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.680 
goons build some probes me but sadly
some<00:03:21.890> early<00:03:22.640> drops<00:03:23.000> by<00:03:23.630> tagoma<00:03:24.530> early<00:03:25.690> tanking

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
some early drops by tagoma early tanking

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.090
