00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
yeah I want to move the triangle back

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.710 
yeah I want to move the triangle back
and<00:00:28.320> when<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:29.000> do<00:00:30.000> start<00:00:30.210> talking<00:00:30.570> your

wrists you start seeing a little box

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.229 
wrists you start seeing a little box
effect<00:00:34.309> you<00:00:35.309> know<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.579> get<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> little<00:00:36.030> box

there<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.719> want<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.230> finish<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.399> top<00:00:38.610> of

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
there I want to finish it to the top of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.360 
there I want to finish it to the top of
the<00:00:38.790> swing<00:00:39.000> keep<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.360> box<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.530> then<00:00:40.770> when<00:00:41.340> I

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the swing keep the box and then when I

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.000 
the swing keep the box and then when I
make<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.840> transition<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.020> want<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.530> keep<00:00:43.739> that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
make the transition I want to keep that

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.850 
make the transition I want to keep that
same<00:00:44.280> angle<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.000> don't<00:00:45.960> want<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.320> straighten

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
same angle I don't want it to straighten

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.940 
same angle I don't want it to straighten
or<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.969> too<00:00:48.149> close<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.480> me<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.530> get<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
or get too close to me so I get to the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.389 
or get too close to me so I get to the
box<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.730> top<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:51.270> keep<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.629> angle

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
box the top and then keep that angle

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.160 
box the top and then keep that angle
into<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.489> shot<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.719> keeps<00:00:55.020> me

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
into the shot and that keeps me

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.020 
into the shot and that keeps me
connected<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:56.219> my<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.940> off<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:58.789> just<00:00:59.789> give

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
connected with my up off and just give

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.550 
connected with my up off and just give
it<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.239> give<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.960> less

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.170 

I<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:06.700> over<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.000> bull<00:01:07.210> nice<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:07.690> comfortable

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
I get over the bull nice and comfortable

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.120 
I get over the bull nice and comfortable
neutral<00:01:10.180> position

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
neutral position

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:21.639 
neutral position
easy<00:01:12.130> back<00:01:12.549> keep<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.850> box<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:17.080> off<00:01:17.200> you<00:01:17.350> go

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.550 

and<00:01:22.649> when<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.829> keep<00:01:23.039> that<00:01:23.250> angle<00:01:24.229> we<00:01:25.229> always

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
and when you keep that angle we always

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.639 
and when you keep that angle we always
talk<00:01:25.770> about<00:01:25.799> keeping<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.789> spine<00:01:27.090> angle<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:28.560> when

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
talk about keeping a spine angle so when

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.230 
talk about keeping a spine angle so when
you<00:01:28.710> keep<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.070> angle<00:01:29.399> you<00:01:29.490> stay<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.970> shot

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
you keep this angle you stay in a shot

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.810 
you keep this angle you stay in a shot
longer<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:31.320> when<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.590> straighten<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.310> is

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
longer is when you straighten this is

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.700 
longer is when you straighten this is
when<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.119> get<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.720> shot<00:01:33.960> we're<00:01:34.649> going

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
when you get out of the shot we're going

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.950 
when you get out of the shot we're going
to<00:01:34.860> keep<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.250> angle<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.969> that<00:01:36.030> keeps<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.719> in

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
to keep that angle and that keeps you in

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
to keep that angle and that keeps you in
the<00:01:36.990> shot<00:01:37.380> there<00:01:38.340> get<00:01:38.429> all<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> great<00:01:38.789> players

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the shot there get all the great players

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.309 
the shot there get all the great players
like<00:01:39.210> Hogan<00:01:39.920> player<00:01:40.920> Nicklaus<00:01:41.490> stagger<00:01:42.319> the

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
like Hogan player Nicklaus stagger the

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:44.330 
like Hogan player Nicklaus stagger the
all<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> shot

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
all in the shot

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.669 
all in the shot
and<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:45.299> think<00:01:45.360> what<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> angle<00:01:46.229> helps<00:01:46.470> you

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
and I think what the angle helps you

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.039 
and I think what the angle helps you
doing<00:01:47.130> that

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.350
