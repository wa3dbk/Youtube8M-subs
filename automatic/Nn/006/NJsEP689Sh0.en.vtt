through the back here and put the other
way<00:01:39.950> up<00:01:40.490> see<00:01:40.909> where<00:01:41.030> your<00:01:41.179> wheels<00:01:43.450> wanting<00:01:44.450> to

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
way up see where your wheels wanting to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:52.179 
way up see where your wheels wanting to
teach<00:01:44.659> us<00:01:48.609> how<00:01:49.609> to<00:01:49.670> make<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.939> bars<00:01:51.159> that<00:01:52.159> you

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
teach us how to make the bars that you

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:59.339 
teach us how to make the bars that you
need<00:01:54.009> for<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.069> bottom<00:01:55.340> part<00:01:56.799> one<00:01:57.799> of<00:01:57.829> these

00:01:59.339 --> 00:01:59.349 
need for the bottom part one of these

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:06.310 
need for the bottom part one of these
this<00:02:00.349> is<00:02:00.500> for<00:02:00.799> just<00:02:01.129> the<00:02:01.780> tube

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.880 

are<00:02:06.890> these<00:02:07.070> me<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:07.970> this<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:09.649> why<00:02:09.890> these<00:02:10.180> and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
are these me to this and why these and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.200 
are these me to this and why these and
this<00:02:12.890> one<00:02:13.160> is<00:02:13.310> just<00:02:13.340> another<00:02:13.640> one<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.030> pretty

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
this one is just another one so pretty

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.080 
this one is just another one so pretty
much<00:02:14.300> three<00:02:14.570> this<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:17.360> what<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.570> can<00:02:17.660> do<00:02:19.090> is

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
much three this so what you can do is

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
much three this so what you can do is
I'm<00:02:20.300> going<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.480> put<00:02:20.570> this<00:02:20.680> through<00:02:21.680> here<00:02:21.890> that

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
I'm going to put this through here that

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.710 
I'm going to put this through here that
maybe<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.230> put<00:02:24.470> this<00:02:24.650> theory<00:02:24.980> like<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:25.720> look

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
maybe I put this theory like that look

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.430 
maybe I put this theory like that look
at<00:02:26.870> this<00:02:27.070> figure<00:02:28.070> like<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:29.120> then<00:02:29.990> this

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
at this figure like that and then this

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.680 
at this figure like that and then this
is<00:02:30.680> pretty<00:02:30.890> much<00:02:30.980> for<00:02:31.310> your<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.580> scooter<00:02:31.940> so

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
is pretty much for your the scooter so

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.550 
is pretty much for your the scooter so
then<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.900> put<00:02:33.050> this<00:02:33.200> through<00:02:33.410> here<00:02:35.410> clip<00:02:36.410> this

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
then you put this through here clip this

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.840 
then you put this through here clip this
part<00:02:36.830> in<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:38.600> I'm<00:02:38.660> cut<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.989> two<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:40.640> now<00:02:40.670> you

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
part in so I'm cut the two so now you

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.930 
part in so I'm cut the two so now you
make<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.330> handlebars<00:02:42.730> just<00:02:43.730> put<00:02:43.850> the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
make the handlebars just put the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.060 
make the handlebars just put the
handlebars<00:02:45.880> you're<00:02:46.880> going<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.090> need<00:02:48.040> four<00:02:49.040> of

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
handlebars you're going to need four of

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.229 
handlebars you're going to need four of
these<00:02:49.250> doesn't<00:02:49.670> matter<00:02:49.790> any<00:02:49.970> color<00:02:52.239> through

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
these doesn't matter any color through

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.830 
these doesn't matter any color through
these

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.050 

and<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.769> these<00:03:01.470> one<00:03:02.470> of<00:03:02.500> these<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:04.780> these<00:03:04.930> and

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
and to these one of these to these and

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.240 
and to these one of these to these and
212<00:03:07.060> longs<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:08.769> I<00:03:08.830> are<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:08.950> going<00:03:09.069> to<00:03:09.129> make

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
212 longs so I are you going to make

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.410 
212 longs so I are you going to make
this<00:03:09.780> is<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.870> can<00:03:10.989> have<00:03:11.140> this<00:03:11.290> red<00:03:12.150> got<00:03:13.150> aside

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
this is you can have this red got aside

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.780
