00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hi friends from youtube i 'm enrique 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.629
 known to come back and I hd and today I come to 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.690
 bring them my top 10 of the best 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.650
 heavyweight champions according to me 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.049
 from the web 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.420
 good at number 10 I place a goldberg 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.820
 goldberg won the championship only once 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.060
 heavyweight won a hidden force 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.449
 of 2003 defeating the triple h champion 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.099
 his reign lasted about 84 days was a good 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.349
 champion to my point of view 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.570
 during several rounds he defended his 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.669
 successful championship until he lost the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.210
 title against triple h in Armageddon 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.879
 2003 number 9 in this position I put the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.030
 boy breaking shorts that says hearts 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.879
 x by shawn michaels an authentic 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.850
 legend only got the weight championship 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.910
 weighed only once with a reign of 28 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.820
 days his reign was short he got the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.920
 title in survivor series 2002 in the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.109
 first elimination chamber of all the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.140
 story in which apart from michaels 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.750
 participated rob van dam cane chris 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.939
 jericho booker ti and the champion in that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.600
 then triple all were left in 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.820
 the ring 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.670
 very good combat one of the best in 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.159
 2002 in if the reign of michaels was 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.440
 short but this gave a good fight for 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.659
 at least he tried hard even if I had 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.390
 liked that it lasted longer but 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.729
 good in order a good champion number 8 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.280
 kurt angle that can be said about this 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.320
 great fighter an Olympic champion and for 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.960
 me one of the best representatives of 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.899
 the hera ruthless aggression got only 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.539
 once the title with a reign of 82 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.060
 days he got it in a royal abbot 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.550
 of smackdown in early 2006 and 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.860
 that the title was vacant he won that 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.110
 real battle and he achieved the title during 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.539
 his reign gave good struggles against mark 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.490
 henry the undertaker a good champion me 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.800
 I would have liked it to have lasted 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.890
 more but nothing happens at least what 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.399
 achievement in order number 8 kurt angle number 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.590

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.049
 good champion got the title in three 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.330

 punk batista jones in a undertaker or axis 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.080
 when I was a champion besides being very 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.480
 good with him 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.070

 King Mysterio the first fighter with 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.460
 Latin roots in getting the title 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.850
 he got the title twice 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.100

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.350

 kurt anglia randy orton on rsc lehman ya 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.230
 22 in 2006 his first reign was good 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.150
 but the second one was not so much since 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.690
 the latter lasted less than a month 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.400

 kleman already 23 in 2007 defeating 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.160
 Batista had a good feud against 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.040

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.040

 to face against sonia they 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.920
 giving what for me would be 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.350
 the best fight of all 2004 got the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.040
 belt on only one occasion but with a 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.959
 reign of 154 days gave excellent 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.569
