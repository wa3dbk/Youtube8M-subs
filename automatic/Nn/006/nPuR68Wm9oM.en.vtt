00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:09.030
 friends we are again cabin shaft pits and I'm with 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.059
 happy to imagine already known to us 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.980
 model we shot last year she 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.440
 produced on me of course a grand 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.840
 impression there are a few changes in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.090
 this year so we show them to you with 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.470
 equal to start with how it all looks 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.359
 Entirely on the first we will display the angular version 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.849
 then of course impressive we see with you 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.880
 the kitchen 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:35.850
 which is completely closed from its kitchen 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.670
 Nastya it is theoretically possible to say that 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.270
 This is a product of aluminum and glass. 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.550
 satin glass here 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.230
 satin words here whom and glass 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.350
 shiny mirror 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.219
 two colors rim light from the ground restrained 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.989
 colors and this one is what muffled 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.820
 yellow and certainly absolutely 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.140
 neutral gray all backlight too 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.840
 although this year the device is invented 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.879
 which allows her to turn off her 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.410
 small pultik 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.899
 well and we see here how is she 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.450
 combined this part of the kitchen so 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.950
 which in conventional manufacturers 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.750
 called suspended modules 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.580
 here, in general, your own first 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.450
 not suspended secondly not 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.259
 looks like kitchen modules in general 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.259
 that's what we do 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.730
 in one smooth motion we discover everything 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.010
 space for operational 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.390
 cooking and washing activities 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.550
 cleaning in general all those tasks that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.110
 need to be decided in the kitchen but such 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.670
 the tabletop it used to be wooden 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.560
 now she has become of Corian that is she 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.840
 become more vandal resistant want me 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.610
 really liked wood 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.200
 wooden she could grow old together 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.340
 with the kitchen and make at least some 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.680
 such a history of this kitchen that is to have 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.780
 On itself its history well, on victory, they, too, 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.430
 a little story will remain though we know 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.290
 with you shakaryan is the stuff that 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.170
 polished and can remain perfectly 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:03.170
 new up here with this 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.170
 movements 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.870
 of course when 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.140
 the owner of the kitchen is the owner or the hostess 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.630
 but so cool as possible and host 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.370
 the owner of the kitchen uses the kitchen he already has 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.530
 practiced speed with which he 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.420
 will make this movement here not 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.680
 no 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.360
 hydraulic it is perfect 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.180
 mechanical device that is there 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.810
 nothing to break by balancing 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.680
 weights 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.349
 This is the top element here manually. 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.420
 master at the factory balancing the door 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.459
 so here they will see in the open 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.310
 condition that is, nothing interferes 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.500
 always kitchen countertops in the depths more 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.780
 than 60 and here mile 60 and here 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.569
 additional 30 centimeters more 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.910
 minimum and due to this we get 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.980
 here is a perfectly efficient working 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.130
 cooking zone for two 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.780
 movements opened the entire top and such 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.269
 same simple two movements can 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.380
 look and close like this 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.269
 specially made device which 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.239
 stops a little bit without bringing 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.549
 its facade must be tightened manually because 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.450
 well, to avoid a strike and to 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:23.459
 make sure the color is turned off 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.459
 completely closed 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.069
 here one more thing can be noted 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.840
 oh the depths a lot of different center on 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.819
 pay attention to this 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:41.230
 the thickness of this slot 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.230
 3 millimeters thickness 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.550
 perhaps this is the only company 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.000
 European manufacturers capable 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.250
 do 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.460
 large opening facades with 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.340
 such precision 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.970
 Well, in this for me is the secret accuracy 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.720
 which the customer often requires from the kitchen 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.670
 immaculate thoroughness in 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.670
 look at the smallest details 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.540
 on perfectly even three millimeter 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.460
 Shawn I will show you in another kitchen 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.680
 how important is it for the factory and how 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.310
 she performs it not only in glass 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.520
 facades 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.910
 and in wood and our other aces we 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.890
 we know that it is always an aluminum frame 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.990
 here the glass company spends on 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.000
 production of its products on 85 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.860
 percent less material than any 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.660
 another kitchen maker but in 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.250
 In this case, we will not again 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.010
 talk about it already about it 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:37.020
 told by me just a hundred times 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.020
 look here is such a new corner option 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:48.770
 forgot to say here for two more here 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.240
 new item 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.459
 which is added yes really for 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.439
 a man whose lack of growth and is 

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:58.679
 it will be important to see they do not 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:01.369
 a rectangular shape for just a little 

00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:09.649
 so that they do not interfere with each other 

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:09.649
 not rectangular here usually 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.020
 Today I talked about what is 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.750
 new us different devices 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.020
 this we have already seen go out attention that 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.240
 the mixer is hidden here by its pattern 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.610
 spirituality did not stick out when everything is closed 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.350
 very similar to the cup that made 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.350
 tattoo in the continuation of the collection or 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.930
 there is no sound and nothing knocks 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:39.010
 nothing is all glass size here by 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.340
 my 242 40 and at the same time immaculately I 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.340
 shut down
