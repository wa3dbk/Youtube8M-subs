what it used to be that's what this car
is<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.590> pretty<00:00:55.829> much<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.239> built<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.510> as

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
is this is pretty much a built to be as

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.139 
is this is pretty much a built to be as
it<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> quarter-mile<00:00:58.800> car<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.699> literally

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it is a quarter-mile car it's literally

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.529 
it is a quarter-mile car it's literally
meant<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.719> go<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.460> quarter-mile<00:01:02.460> as<00:01:02.789> fast<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.390> it

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
meant to go a quarter-mile as fast as it

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.149 
meant to go a quarter-mile as fast as it
can<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.369> that's<00:01:05.369> about<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.869> when<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:07.799> had<00:01:07.979> this

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
can and that's about it when we had this

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.690 
can and that's about it when we had this
car<00:01:08.430> last<00:01:08.760> year<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.630> was<00:01:10.290> built<00:01:10.500> by<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> racing

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
car last year it was built by a racing

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.480 
car last year it was built by a racing
guy<00:01:12.140> we<00:01:13.140> weren't<00:01:13.409> able<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:13.830> ahold<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.310> him

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
guy we weren't able to get ahold of him

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.660 
guy we weren't able to get ahold of him
I<00:01:14.760> don't<00:01:15.240> know<00:01:15.479> why<00:01:15.659> maybe<00:01:16.200> someone<00:01:16.680> fell<00:01:17.460> ill

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
I don't know why maybe someone fell ill

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.539 
I don't know why maybe someone fell ill
who<00:01:17.939> knows<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.320> had<00:01:19.500> no<00:01:19.710> idea<00:01:19.740> what<00:01:20.310> this

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
who knows so we had no idea what this

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.030 
who knows so we had no idea what this
car<00:01:20.820> had<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> cam<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> compression

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
car had for a cam for a compression

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.560 
car had for a cam for a compression
ratio<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.720> anything<00:01:25.820> so<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.119> kind

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
ratio for for anything so we just kind

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.370 
ratio for for anything so we just kind
of<00:01:27.659> put<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.930> together<00:01:28.049> as<00:01:28.409> best<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.770> can

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
of put it together as best we can

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.350 
of put it together as best we can
probably<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.590> biggest<00:01:32.220> issue<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.880> didn't<00:01:33.180> do

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
probably the biggest issue we didn't do

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.249 
probably the biggest issue we didn't do
last<00:01:33.750> year<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:35.090> we<00:01:36.090> didn't<00:01:36.329> put<00:01:36.540> an<00:01:36.720> ignition

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
last year is we didn't put an ignition

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.580 
last year is we didn't put an ignition
module<00:01:37.860> with<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> rev<00:01:38.369> limiter<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
module with a rev limiter in it so the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.289 
module with a rev limiter in it so the
guy<00:01:40.710> who<00:01:40.770> owns<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.369> car<00:01:41.579> picked<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.030> up<00:01:42.119> from

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
guy who owns the car picked it up from

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.899 
guy who owns the car picked it up from
us<00:01:42.509> running<00:01:43.290> great<00:01:43.560> running<00:01:44.250> real<00:01:44.460> powerful

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
us running great running real powerful

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.039 
us running great running real powerful
and<00:01:46.009> he<00:01:47.009> was<00:01:47.130> gone<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.610> maybe<00:01:47.850> maybe<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.840> minute

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
and he was gone for maybe maybe a minute

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.120 
and he was gone for maybe maybe a minute
and<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.290> half<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:50.689> think<00:01:51.689> he<00:01:51.840> missed<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.890> third

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and a half I think he missed the third

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.910 
and a half I think he missed the third
fourth<00:01:53.490> shift<00:01:53.909> or<00:01:54.869> maybe<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.259> first<00:01:55.439> second

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
fourth shift or maybe the first second

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.120 
fourth shift or maybe the first second
shift<00:01:56.070> probably<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.490> first<00:01:56.700> second<00:01:57.180> shift

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
shift probably the first second shift

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.510 
shift probably the first second shift
and<00:01:59.130> he<00:01:59.399> ended<00:02:00.270> up<00:02:00.590> pulling<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.799> couple<00:02:01.979> rocket

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
and he ended up pulling a couple rocket

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.060 
and he ended up pulling a couple rocket
studs<00:02:02.759> right<00:02:02.880> out<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> heads

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
studs right out of one of the heads

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.560 
studs right out of one of the heads
which<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.399> had<00:02:05.549> we<00:02:05.729> repaired<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.329> got<00:02:06.479> it

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
which we had we repaired and got it

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.249 
which we had we repaired and got it
running<00:02:06.719> again<00:02:07.110> but<00:02:08.099> being<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.239> drag<00:02:09.539> car<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
running again but being a drag car the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.130 
running again but being a drag car the
it<00:02:10.830> makes<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.459> lot<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.760> power<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.450> makes<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.780> law

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
it makes a lot of power it makes a law

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.080 
it makes a lot of power it makes a law
heat<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.980> really<00:02:14.220> can't<00:02:14.550> get<00:02:14.760> rid<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:15.030> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
heat and it really can't get rid of the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.270 
heat and it really can't get rid of the
heat<00:02:15.300> which<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:16.110> probably<00:02:16.440> its<00:02:16.560> biggest<00:02:16.770> issue

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
heat which is probably its biggest issue

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.880 
heat which is probably its biggest issue
it's<00:02:18.060> just<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.480> can't<00:02:18.720> get<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.959> heat<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.709> it

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
it's just you can't get the heat and it

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.870 
it's just you can't get the heat and it
overheats<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:22.709> what's<00:02:23.040> here<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.490> year

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
overheats and so what's here this year

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.059 
overheats and so what's here this year
we're<00:02:24.720> gonna<00:02:24.840> I'm<00:02:25.380> gonna<00:02:25.530> be<00:02:25.680> pulling<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
we're gonna I'm gonna be pulling the

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.880 
we're gonna I'm gonna be pulling the
motor<00:02:26.220> out<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:27.140> we'll<00:02:28.140> talk<00:02:28.319> about<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.740> in

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
motor out of it we'll talk about that in

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.610 
motor out of it we'll talk about that in
a<00:02:28.950> second<00:02:29.959> let's<00:02:30.959> take<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.230> look<00:02:31.470> at<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
a second let's take a look at the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.330 
a second let's take a look at the
interior<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:34.010> think<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.250> a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
interior of this I think this is a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.440 
interior of this I think this is a
really<00:02:35.700> well<00:02:35.880> laid<00:02:36.150> out<00:02:37.160> interior<00:02:38.160> from<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.060> 68

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
really well laid out interior from a 68

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.040 
really well laid out interior from a 68

I<00:02:40.730> really<00:02:41.730> like<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.690> -<00:02:42.930> things<00:02:43.380> this<00:02:44.100> is

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
I really like the the - things this is

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.120 
I really like the the - things this is
something<00:02:44.640> we<00:02:45.030> see<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.270> lot<00:02:45.540> nowadays<00:02:46.130> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
something we see a lot nowadays the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.680 
something we see a lot nowadays the
defense<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.820> work<00:02:48.030> like<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:50.510> what's<00:02:51.510> old

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
defense that work like that what's old

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.590 
defense that work like that what's old
is<00:02:51.840> new<00:02:51.900> again<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.970> know<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.390> real

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
is new again and you know it's a real

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.680 
is new again and you know it's a real
AMX<00:02:55.320> it's<00:02:55.680> numbered<00:02:56.300> what's<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.480> number

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
AMX it's numbered what's that number

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.790 
AMX it's numbered what's that number
like<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:59.190> focus<00:03:02.360> 4513<00:03:03.360> I'm<00:03:04.230> not<00:03:04.440> sure<00:03:04.620> what

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
like the focus 4513 I'm not sure what

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.340 
like the focus 4513 I'm not sure what
the<00:03:04.920> total<00:03:05.160> build<00:03:05.690> but<00:03:06.690> if<00:03:06.840> someone<00:03:07.080> wants<00:03:07.320> to

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
the total build but if someone wants to

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.300 
the total build but if someone wants to
make<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.680> comment

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.490 

neat<00:03:13.970> wood<00:03:14.180> panels<00:03:15.760> seats<00:03:16.760> are<00:03:16.940> pretty<00:03:17.060> good

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
neat wood panels seats are pretty good

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.680 
neat wood panels seats are pretty good
but<00:03:18.500> would<00:03:18.620> you'd<00:03:18.770> expect<00:03:19.360> now<00:03:20.360> this<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.630> a

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
but would you'd expect now this is a

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.790 
but would you'd expect now this is a
two-seat<00:03:21.170> car<00:03:21.380> this<00:03:22.160> was<00:03:23.230> kind<00:03:24.230> of<00:03:24.350> considered

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
two-seat car this was kind of considered

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.490 
two-seat car this was kind of considered
the<00:03:24.950> poor<00:03:25.250> man's<00:03:25.550> Corvette<00:03:26.240> that<00:03:26.990> was<00:03:27.140> kind<00:03:27.410> of

the poor man's Corvette that was kind of

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.199 
the poor man's Corvette that was kind of

fuel we might temp gauge is always way
up<00:03:39.530> somewhere<00:03:40.040> bumping<00:03:40.550> off<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.790> fuel<00:03:41.030> gauge

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.570 

uh<00:03:44.300> how<00:03:45.200> about<00:03:45.260> we<00:03:45.380> uh<00:03:45.560> something<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.400> little

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
uh how about we uh something a little

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.120 
uh how about we uh something a little
different<00:03:46.940> this<00:03:47.810> thing<00:03:48.019> sounds<00:03:48.410> really<00:03:48.680> nice

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
different this thing sounds really nice

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.130 
different this thing sounds really nice
we'll<00:03:49.250> give<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.489> quick<00:03:49.610> start<00:03:50.019> we'll<00:03:51.019> give

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
we'll give it a quick start we'll give

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.300 
we'll give it a quick start we'll give
it<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.260> couple<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.650> revs<00:03:51.860> and<00:03:52.040> then<00:03:52.160> we'll<00:03:52.250> go

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
it a couple of revs and then we'll go

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:57.060 
it a couple of revs and then we'll go
look<00:03:52.459> at<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:52.670> motor

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:03.400 

sounds<00:04:58.070> nice<00:04:58.250> doesn't<00:04:58.280> it<00:05:01.990> now<00:05:02.990> there's<00:05:03.290> the

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
sounds nice doesn't it now there's the

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.710 
sounds nice doesn't it now there's the
390<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:06.710> Edelbrock<00:05:07.160> intake<00:05:07.190> on<00:05:07.910> it<00:05:08.090> I<00:05:08.360> don't

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
390 the Edelbrock intake on it I don't

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.620 
390 the Edelbrock intake on it I don't
remember<00:05:09.080> what<00:05:09.500> we've<00:05:09.650> what<00:05:10.280> size<00:05:10.639> carb<00:05:11.180> it

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
remember what we've what size carb it

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.060 
remember what we've what size carb it
was<00:05:11.750> just<00:05:11.930> kind<00:05:12.139> of<00:05:12.199> something<00:05:12.560> we<00:05:12.620> threw<00:05:12.919> on

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
was just kind of something we threw on

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.420 
was just kind of something we threw on
it<00:05:13.220> had<00:05:13.340> a<00:05:13.370> really<00:05:13.910> big<00:05:14.150> Holley<00:05:14.449> on<00:05:14.750> there<00:05:15.050> and

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
it had a really big Holley on there and

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.909 
it had a really big Holley on there and
I<00:05:16.430> think<00:05:16.550> this<00:05:16.850> might<00:05:17.060> be<00:05:17.090> like<00:05:17.330> a<00:05:17.360> 650<00:05:18.139> or<00:05:18.289> 750

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
I think this might be like a 650 or 750

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.350 
I think this might be like a 650 or 750
CFM<00:05:19.370> Edelbrock<00:05:21.220> we<00:05:22.220> chose<00:05:22.460> this<00:05:22.699> carburetor

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
CFM Edelbrock we chose this carburetor

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.080 
CFM Edelbrock we chose this carburetor
in<00:05:23.660> part<00:05:24.320> because<00:05:24.680> it's<00:05:25.160> really<00:05:25.520> available<00:05:25.759> to

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
in part because it's really available to

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:34.469 
in part because it's really available to
us<00:05:26.389> and<00:05:27.100> they're<00:05:28.100> pretty<00:05:28.310> easy<00:05:28.430> to<00:05:28.699> tune<00:05:31.690> yeah

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
us and they're pretty easy to tune yeah

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.260 
us and they're pretty easy to tune yeah
now<00:05:35.479> like<00:05:35.720> I<00:05:35.840> was<00:05:35.870> saying<00:05:36.020> where<00:05:37.000> this<00:05:38.000> motor

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
now like I was saying where this motor

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.760 
now like I was saying where this motor
makes<00:05:38.539> a<00:05:38.630> lot<00:05:38.840> of<00:05:38.960> horsepower

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
makes a lot of horsepower

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.640 
makes a lot of horsepower
I'm<00:05:40.100> gonna<00:05:40.280> guess<00:05:40.550> somewhere<00:05:41.060> in<00:05:41.270> the<00:05:41.650> the

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
I'm gonna guess somewhere in the the

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.620 
I'm gonna guess somewhere in the the
high<00:05:42.860> 400<00:05:43.850> horsepower<00:05:44.150> maybe<00:05:44.870> mid<00:05:45.139> 400<00:05:46.630> it

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
high 400 horsepower maybe mid 400 it

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.719 
high 400 horsepower maybe mid 400 it

the car has been on the strip I should

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.150 
the car has been on the strip I should
say<00:05:51.919> so<00:05:52.610> I<00:05:52.639> can't<00:05:52.940> tell<00:05:53.120> you<00:05:53.270> what<00:05:53.449> it's<00:05:53.570> pulled

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
say so I can't tell you what it's pulled

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.100

what<00:05:55.160> it<00:05:55.280> can<00:05:55.460> pull<00:05:55.699> in<00:05:55.849> this<00:05:55.970> trim<00:05:56.300> I'm<00:05:56.900> gonna

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
what it can pull in this trim I'm gonna

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.330 
what it can pull in this trim I'm gonna
say<00:05:58.539> 13s<00:05:59.539> all<00:05:59.660> day<00:05:59.900> with<00:06:00.470> this<00:06:00.620> setup<00:06:00.860> at<00:06:01.130> least

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340

and and not overheat and not make a ton

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:27.129 
and and not overheat and not make a ton
of<00:06:25.820> noise<00:06:25.940> so<00:06:26.389> I'm<00:06:26.510> gonna<00:06:26.659> be<00:06:26.720> pulling<00:06:26.930> this

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
of noise so I'm gonna be pulling this

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.350 
of noise so I'm gonna be pulling this
motor<00:06:27.409> out<00:06:27.530> and<00:06:27.970> we're<00:06:28.970> actually<00:06:29.120> gonna

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
motor out and we're actually gonna

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.250 
motor out and we're actually gonna
detune<00:06:29.810> it

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
detune it

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.510 
detune it
we're<00:06:30.740> probably<00:06:30.860> gonna<00:06:31.070> put<00:06:31.280> some<00:06:31.430> aluminum

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
we're probably gonna put some aluminum

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.270 
we're probably gonna put some aluminum
heads<00:06:32.060> on<00:06:32.300> one<00:06:33.139> of<00:06:33.229> the<00:06:33.320> issues<00:06:33.650> we<00:06:33.830> had<00:06:34.010> last

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
heads on one of the issues we had last

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.460 
heads on one of the issues we had last
year<00:06:34.460> with<00:06:34.669> this<00:06:34.760> motor

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
year with this motor

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.279 
year with this motor
we<00:06:36.470> put<00:06:36.650> the<00:06:37.010> different<00:06:37.370> intake<00:06:37.669> on<00:06:37.940> it<00:06:38.150> and<00:06:38.300> we

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:39.289 
we put the different intake on it and we

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:41.260 
we put the different intake on it and we
found<00:06:39.560> that<00:06:39.949> the<00:06:40.340> heads<00:06:40.669> have<00:06:40.849> been<00:06:41.000> shaved

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
found that the heads have been shaved

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.480 
found that the heads have been shaved
and<00:06:41.720> the<00:06:41.810> block<00:06:42.020> has<00:06:42.199> been<00:06:42.349> decked<00:06:42.650> to<00:06:43.310> raise

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
and the block has been decked to raise

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.149 
and the block has been decked to raise
the<00:06:43.699> compression<00:06:44.240> ratio<00:06:44.389> now<00:06:45.380> that<00:06:45.680> goes<00:06:45.889> with

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:46.159 
the compression ratio now that goes with

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:47.980 
the compression ratio now that goes with
no<00:06:46.310> having<00:06:46.580> no<00:06:46.729> idea<00:06:47.120> what<00:06:47.389> was<00:06:47.599> done<00:06:47.810> with

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
no having no idea what was done with

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.560 
no having no idea what was done with
this<00:06:48.139> so<00:06:48.590> we're<00:06:49.490> going<00:06:49.610> to<00:06:49.699> kind<00:06:49.940> of<00:06:50.120> take<00:06:50.419> it

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570 
this so we're going to kind of take it

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.540 
this so we're going to kind of take it
apart<00:06:50.870> see<00:06:51.260> what<00:06:51.409> we<00:06:51.530> have<00:06:51.740> and<00:06:52.099> we're<00:06:52.430> going

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
apart see what we have and we're going

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.370 
apart see what we have and we're going
to<00:06:52.580> try<00:06:52.789> to<00:06:52.849> lower<00:06:53.090> the<00:06:53.210> compression<00:06:53.870> so<00:06:54.289> we

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
to try to lower the compression so we

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.909 
to try to lower the compression so we
can<00:06:54.530> run<00:06:54.710> pump<00:06:55.039> gas<00:06:55.280> and<00:06:56.320> not<00:06:57.320> ping<00:06:57.680> it<00:06:57.800> to

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 
can run pump gas and not ping it to

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:01.149 
can run pump gas and not ping it to
death<00:06:58.810> so<00:06:59.810> this<00:07:00.080> is<00:07:00.199> a<00:07:00.229> project<00:07:00.470> to<00:07:00.860> keep<00:07:00.979> your

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:01.159 
death so this is a project to keep your

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:03.219 
death so this is a project to keep your
eyes<00:07:01.310> on<00:07:01.340> I<00:07:01.849> will<00:07:02.510> probably<00:07:02.659> do<00:07:02.900> something

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:03.229 
eyes on I will probably do something

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:05.790 
eyes on I will probably do something
like<00:07:03.320> I<00:07:03.469> did<00:07:03.620> with<00:07:03.740> the<00:07:03.830> Jaguar<00:07:04.389> where<00:07:05.389> I'll

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
like I did with the Jaguar where I'll

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.690 
like I did with the Jaguar where I'll
pull<00:07:06.800> it<00:07:06.919> apart<00:07:07.010> have

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:07.700 
pull it apart have

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.060 
pull it apart have
motor<00:07:07.910> apart<00:07:08.270> show<00:07:08.990> you<00:07:09.050> what<00:07:09.260> it<00:07:09.350> looks<00:07:09.530> like

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.070 
motor apart show you what it looks like

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.350 
motor apart show you what it looks like
and<00:07:12.430> maybe<00:07:13.430> we'll<00:07:13.610> get<00:07:13.760> this<00:07:13.910> thing<00:07:14.150> maybe

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 
and maybe we'll get this thing maybe

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.270 
and maybe we'll get this thing maybe
I'll<00:07:14.510> get<00:07:14.630> maybe<00:07:14.810> can<00:07:15.140> convince<00:07:15.440> the<00:07:15.590> owner<00:07:15.800> to

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 
I'll get maybe can convince the owner to

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.070 
I'll get maybe can convince the owner to
put<00:07:16.820> this<00:07:16.970> on<00:07:17.150> a<00:07:17.180> drag<00:07:17.480> strip

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
put this on a drag strip

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.320 
put this on a drag strip
we'll<00:07:18.470> do<00:07:18.620> a<00:07:18.650> names<00:07:18.920> east<00:07:19.100> corner<00:07:19.430> from<00:07:20.030> a<00:07:20.090> drag

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.330 
we'll do a names east corner from a drag

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.630 
we'll do a names east corner from a drag
strip<00:07:20.600> and<00:07:20.870> see<00:07:20.990> what<00:07:21.080> it<00:07:21.170> pulls<00:07:24.100> so<00:07:25.100> this

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:25.640 
strip and see what it pulls so this

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.850 
strip and see what it pulls so this
video<00:07:25.910> is<00:07:26.030> getting<00:07:26.210> a<00:07:26.360> little<00:07:26.450> long<00:07:26.750> so<00:07:27.050> I'm

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:27.860 
video is getting a little long so I'm

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.330 
video is getting a little long so I'm
going<00:07:27.890> to<00:07:28.070> finish<00:07:28.250> it<00:07:28.520> there<00:07:28.670> by<00:07:28.880> saying<00:07:30.340> this

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:31.340 
going to finish it there by saying this

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.640 
going to finish it there by saying this
one<00:07:31.640> will<00:07:32.150> take<00:07:32.420> you<00:07:32.600> right<00:07:32.630> into<00:07:33.050> the<00:07:33.140> cabbage

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:33.650 
one will take you right into the cabbage

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.780 
one will take you right into the cabbage
so<00:07:34.190> keep<00:07:35.030> it<00:07:35.150> out<00:07:35.240> of<00:07:35.330> the<00:07:35.420> cabbage
