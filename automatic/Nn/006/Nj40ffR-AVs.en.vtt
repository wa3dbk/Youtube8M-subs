00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
which was in a I think a target

scaled<00:02:29.470> nice<00:02:29.890> very<00:02:30.489> nicely<00:02:30.819> with<00:02:31.599> each<00:02:31.630> other

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
scaled nice very nicely with each other

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.410 
scaled nice very nicely with each other
it's<00:02:32.920> an<00:02:33.040> absolutely<00:02:33.430> wonderful<00:02:33.489> figure<00:02:34.209> if

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
it's an absolutely wonderful figure if

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.910 
it's an absolutely wonderful figure if

you're a big Marvel Universe fan and an
x-men<00:02:36.310> fan<00:02:36.550> you've<00:02:36.730> gotta<00:02:37.090> track<00:02:37.510> this<00:02:37.720> one

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
x-men fan you've gotta track this one

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.380 
x-men fan you've gotta track this one
dog<00:02:38.049> but<00:02:38.170> again<00:02:38.470> as<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.680> said<00:02:38.739> don't<00:02:39.519> pay<00:02:39.670> $60

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
dog but again as I said don't pay $60

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.809 
dog but again as I said don't pay $60
for<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.720> or<00:02:41.319> I<00:02:41.760> mean<00:02:44.069> $25<00:02:45.069> I<00:02:45.400> think<00:02:45.670> it's

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
for it or I mean $25 I think it's

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.830 
for it or I mean $25 I think it's
reasonable<00:02:46.200> 25<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.380> 30<00:02:47.620> dollars<00:02:48.480> shipped<00:02:49.480> I

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
reasonable 25 to 30 dollars shipped I

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.460 
reasonable 25 to 30 dollars shipped I
think<00:02:50.799> is<00:02:51.040> reasonable<00:02:51.310> enough<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.330> that<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.349> me

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
think is reasonable enough I that to me

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.520 
think is reasonable enough I that to me
is<00:02:53.560> still<00:02:53.830> too<00:02:54.069> pricy<00:02:54.430> i<00:02:55.170> when<00:02:56.170> I<00:02:56.200> got<00:02:56.380> the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
is still too pricy i when I got the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.140 
is still too pricy i when I got the
whole<00:02:56.650> case<00:02:56.950> this<00:02:57.190> thing<00:02:57.250> just<00:02:57.549> ended<00:02:57.849> up<00:02:57.970> like

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
whole case this thing just ended up like

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
whole case this thing just ended up like
what<00:02:58.360> twelve<00:02:59.849> thirteen<00:03:00.849> dollars<00:03:01.239> because<00:03:02.110> I

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
what twelve thirteen dollars because I

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.830 
what twelve thirteen dollars because I
bought<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.500> case<00:03:02.680> but<00:03:03.180> $20<00:03:04.180> should<00:03:04.420> be<00:03:04.569> tops

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
bought the case but $20 should be tops

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.410 
bought the case but $20 should be tops
shipped<00:03:05.769> I<00:03:05.950> don't<00:03:06.250> think<00:03:06.430> that's<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:07.030> think

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
shipped I don't think that's I think

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.870 
shipped I don't think that's I think
it's<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.750> most<00:03:07.870> reasonable<00:03:08.730> ceiling<00:03:09.730> that

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
it's the most reasonable ceiling that

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.390 
it's the most reasonable ceiling that
you<00:03:10.030> can<00:03:10.180> get<00:03:10.329> so<00:03:10.600> onto<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.440> sculpt<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:12.160> great

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
you can get so onto the sculpt is great

actually<00:04:03.459> like<00:04:03.790> this<00:04:03.970> one<00:04:04.030> more<00:04:04.359> than<00:04:04.569> the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
actually like this one more than the

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.520 
actually like this one more than the
cable<00:04:05.019> figure<00:04:06.420> not<00:04:07.420> as<00:04:07.660> much<00:04:07.840> as<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.019> art<00:04:08.170> well

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530
