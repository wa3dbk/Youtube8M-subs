okay I'm gonna try out the
Barone<00:00:04.500> on<00:00:04.620> this<00:00:05.660> little<00:00:06.660> stove<00:00:06.990> so<00:00:07.770> this<00:00:08.250> is

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
Barone on this little stove so this is

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.270 
Barone on this little stove so this is
the<00:00:08.849> log<00:00:09.290> with<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.320> hole<00:00:10.920> drilled<00:00:11.219> through

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
the log with the hole drilled through

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.749 
the log with the hole drilled through
the<00:00:11.700> top<00:00:11.969> hole<00:00:12.750> drill<00:00:13.019> through<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.950> side<00:00:14.219> and

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
the top hole drill through the side and

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.050 
the top hole drill through the side and
then<00:00:15.660> I'll<00:00:16.289> just<00:00:16.619> post<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.250> shape<00:00:17.550> cutting<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
then I'll just post a shape cutting the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:33.280 
then I'll just post a shape cutting the
top<00:00:28.699> just<00:00:29.699> see<00:00:30.090> if<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.240> can<00:00:30.420> lie<00:00:30.539> today<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:31.769> by

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
top just see if I can lie today just by

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:54.880 
top just see if I can lie today just by
dropping<00:00:34.290> small<00:00:34.950> days<00:00:41.059> should<00:00:42.059> work

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.150 

and<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:55.489> idea<00:00:55.790> that<00:00:55.879> this<00:00:56.000> is<00:00:56.239> a<00:00:56.950> once<00:00:57.950> it's

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
and the idea that this is a once it's

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:07.480 
and the idea that this is a once it's
going<00:00:59.470> it<00:01:00.470> should<00:01:00.680> feel<00:01:00.920> itself<00:01:06.130> yeah<00:01:07.130> we<00:01:07.310> can

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
going it should feel itself yeah we can

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.420 
going it should feel itself yeah we can
be<00:01:07.610> going<00:01:07.760> now<00:01:08.260> there<00:01:09.260> take<00:01:10.159> a<00:01:10.250> lot<00:01:10.400> more

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
be going now there take a lot more

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.760 
be going now there take a lot more
fooling<00:01:11.000> about<00:01:11.119> than<00:01:11.479> I<00:01:11.720> thought

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
fooling about than I thought

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.550 
fooling about than I thought
I<00:01:13.000> think<00:01:14.000> it's<00:01:14.090> because<00:01:14.270> they're<00:01:14.479> size<00:01:15.320> of<00:01:15.470> the

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
I think it's because they're size of the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.430 
I think it's because they're size of the
halls<00:01:15.740> on<00:01:15.979> this<00:01:16.130> one<00:01:16.509> quite<00:01:17.509> small<00:01:17.900> so<00:01:18.140> it's

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
halls on this one quite small so it's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.600 
halls on this one quite small so it's
not<00:01:18.590> much<00:01:18.950> room<00:01:19.190> for<00:01:19.780> adding<00:01:21.460> additional<00:01:22.690> fuel

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
not much room for adding additional fuel

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.960 
not much room for adding additional fuel
so<00:01:25.610> I<00:01:25.700> liked<00:01:26.030> it<00:01:26.149> a<00:01:26.180> couple<00:01:26.420> of<00:01:26.479> times<00:01:26.750> now<00:01:29.110> I

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
so I liked it a couple of times now I

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.850 
so I liked it a couple of times now I
think<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.090> improve<00:01:32.509> it<00:01:32.720> make<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.440> homes<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.710> bit

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
think to improve it make the homes a bit

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.330 
think to improve it make the homes a bit
bigger<00:01:34.390> they<00:01:35.390> are<00:01:35.750> get<00:01:36.740> some<00:01:36.890> little<00:01:37.039> tweaks

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
bigger they are get some little tweaks

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:46.690 
bigger they are get some little tweaks
to<00:01:37.729> users<00:01:42.340> can<00:01:43.340> I<00:01:45.009> get<00:01:46.009> a<00:01:46.039> kit<00:01:46.250> on<00:01:46.399> in<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.580> minute

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
to users can I get a kit on in a minute

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.419 
to users can I get a kit on in a minute
and<00:01:47.300> they're<00:01:47.539> sticking<00:01:48.380> on<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:51.890> say<00:01:52.070> one<00:01:52.250> good

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
and they're sticking on you say one good

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.130 
and they're sticking on you say one good
thing<00:01:52.460> about<00:01:52.670> this<00:01:52.970> is<00:01:53.240> there<00:01:53.509> doesn't<00:01:54.050> get

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
thing about this is there doesn't get

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:45.239 

definitely<00:04:38.499> idea<00:04:38.829> would<00:04:39.009> be<00:04:39.039> to<00:04:44.129> drill<00:04:45.129> the

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:45.249 
definitely idea would be to drill the

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:49.079 
definitely idea would be to drill the
hole<00:04:45.429> further<00:04:45.699> back<00:04:45.939> this<00:04:46.149> way<00:04:46.389> and<00:04:47.549> then<00:04:48.549> this

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:49.089 
hole further back this way and then this

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:51.899 
hole further back this way and then this
halls<00:04:49.419> longer<00:04:50.309> towards<00:04:51.309> them<00:04:51.399> burn<00:04:51.669> them<00:04:51.789> at

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
halls longer towards them burn them at

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:58.289 
halls longer towards them burn them at
the<00:04:51.999> front<00:04:52.119> I<00:04:52.359> want<00:04:52.569> you<00:04:56.849> given<00:04:57.849> the<00:04:57.939> fact<00:04:58.149> you

can pick that up just short it to the

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:05.069 
can pick that up just short it to the
well-insulated<00:05:01.839> that's<00:05:02.469> going<00:05:02.709> to<00:05:02.769> be<00:05:04.079> even

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:05.079 
well-insulated that's going to be even

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:08.759 
well-insulated that's going to be even
to<00:05:05.199> use<00:05:05.379> as<00:05:05.589> a<00:05:05.879> normal<00:05:06.879> rocket<00:05:07.179> stove<00:05:07.769> they're

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:08.769 
to use as a normal rocket stove they're

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:12.299 
to use as a normal rocket stove they're
not<00:05:09.069> a<00:05:09.129> self-sustaining<00:05:09.969> one<00:05:11.099> that's<00:05:12.099> what

00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:12.309 
not a self-sustaining one that's what
