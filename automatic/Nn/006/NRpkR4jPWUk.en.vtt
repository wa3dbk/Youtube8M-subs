but maybe there's one that you might
have<00:00:26.910> overlooked<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:28.470> Mitsubishi<00:00:28.890> Outlander

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250

have overlooked the Mitsubishi Outlander
for<00:00:29.699> example<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> 2006<00:00:31.560> model<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:32.070> this

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
for example this is a 2006 model in this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.420 
for example this is a 2006 model in this
case<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.210> limited<00:00:33.780> all-wheel<00:00:34.290> drive<00:00:34.620> it's

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
case it's a limited all-wheel drive it's

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.360 
case it's a limited all-wheel drive it's
got<00:00:35.610> full-time<00:00:36.540> four-wheel-drive<00:00:37.370> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370

Outlander is available in four trim

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.900 
Outlander is available in four trim
levels<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:40.950> trim<00:00:41.160> level<00:00:41.520> that

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
levels so you have one trim level that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.639 
levels so you have one trim level that
is<00:00:42.030> front-wheel<00:00:42.329> drive<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.260> rest<00:00:43.440> I'll

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
is front-wheel drive and the rest I'll

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.850

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
stuck with the four-speed automatic

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.539 
stuck with the four-speed automatic
which<00:01:36.540> isn't<00:01:36.720> bad<00:01:36.900> get<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> automatic<00:01:38.040> across

the<00:01:38.729> board<00:01:38.939> also<00:01:40.100> quite<00:01:41.100> powerful<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.049> think

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the board also quite powerful I think

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.230 
the board also quite powerful I think
the<00:01:43.320> 5-speed<00:01:43.920> manual<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.460> better<00:01:44.759> suited<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the 5-speed manual is better suited to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.319 
the 5-speed manual is better suited to
this<00:01:45.450> engine<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.110> driven<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:47.850> Mitsubishi

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
this engine I have driven a a Mitsubishi

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.940 
this engine I have driven a a Mitsubishi
Lancer<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> same<00:01:49.470> engine<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950

5-speed<00:01:50.430> manual<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.540> seems<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.899> work<00:01:51.930> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
5-speed manual and it seems to work a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.620 
5-speed manual and it seems to work a
lot<00:01:52.470> better<00:01:52.799> than<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.220> combination<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
lot better than this combination the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.090 
lot better than this combination the
engine<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.110> don't<00:01:55.350> know<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.530> sounds<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.950> little

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
engine I don't know it sounds a little

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.490 
engine I don't know it sounds a little
different<00:01:56.509> from<00:01:57.509> what<00:01:57.780> I've<00:01:57.930> driven<00:01:58.200> before

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
different from what I've driven before

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.069 
different from what I've driven before
it<00:01:59.219> sounds<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.640> little<00:01:59.729> more<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.570> little<00:02:00.869> more

it sounds a little more a little more

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.550 
it sounds a little more a little more
noisy<00:02:01.700> but<00:02:02.700> overall<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.630> does<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> good<00:02:04.020> job<00:02:04.079> of

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
noisy but overall it does a good job of

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.249 
noisy but overall it does a good job of
pushing<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.549> vehicle<00:02:05.909> forward<00:02:06.270> inside<00:02:07.140> the

bad actually the rest of the dash is

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.740 
bad actually the rest of the dash is
purely<00:02:19.590> functional<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.430> nice<00:02:20.670> no<00:02:21.090> risks<00:02:21.569> I

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
purely functional it's nice no risks I

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.960 
purely functional it's nice no risks I
like<00:02:22.409> it<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.650> way<00:02:22.830> simple<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.459> functional

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
like it that way simple and functional
