00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
about the as550 rev limiter removal

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.879 
about the as550 rev limiter removal
process<00:00:04.850> this<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.480> 550<00:00:07.370> rev<00:00:08.370> limiter<00:00:09.889> it

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889

process this is the 550 rev limiter it
bolts<00:00:11.219> in<00:00:11.340> back<00:00:11.670> down<00:00:11.910> here

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
bolts in back down here

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.640 
bolts in back down here
I've<00:00:13.920> unbolt<00:00:14.340> amaya<00:00:14.580> taken<00:00:14.910> out<00:00:15.210> I've<00:00:15.330> already

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
I've unbolt amaya taken out I've already

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.019 
I've unbolt amaya taken out I've already
eliminated<00:00:16.650> mine<00:00:17.930> about<00:00:18.930> 90%<00:00:19.789> this<00:00:20.789> goes

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
eliminated mine about 90% this goes

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.560 
eliminated mine about 90% this goes
right<00:00:21.240> here<00:00:21.270> where<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.689> plug<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:23.269> this<00:00:24.269> goes

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
right here where that plug is this goes

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.179 
right here where that plug is this goes
this<00:00:25.050> comes<00:00:25.380> from<00:00:25.500> your<00:00:25.680> return<00:00:26.210> and<00:00:28.189> this

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
this comes from your return and this

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.749 
this comes from your return and this
actually<00:00:29.789> returns<00:00:30.359> back<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.019> tank<00:00:31.759> so

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
actually returns back to the tank so

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.639 
actually returns back to the tank so
what<00:00:32.910> I've<00:00:33.000> done<00:00:33.180> here<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:35.600> if<00:00:36.600> you're<00:00:37.440> going

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
what I've done here is if you're going

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.250 
what I've done here is if you're going
to<00:00:37.710> eliminate<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.960> an

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
to eliminate this you have to have an

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.490 
to eliminate this you have to have an
inline<00:00:40.829> restrictor<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:42.600> way<00:00:42.750> mine<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.200> inline

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
inline restrictor the way mine is inline

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.680 
inline restrictor the way mine is inline
restricted<00:00:44.040> oh<00:00:44.370> if<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.450> if<00:00:45.539> I'm

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
restricted oh if you can see if I'm

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.180 
restricted oh if you can see if I'm
trying<00:00:46.309> is<00:00:47.309> there's<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.539> uh<00:00:51.739> pilot<00:00:52.739> jet

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
trying is there's a and uh pilot jet

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.369 
trying is there's a and uh pilot jet
screwed<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.879> there<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.570> act<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:54.960> an<00:00:55.079> inline

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
restrictor the tows now goes from here I

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.349 
restrictor the tows now goes from here I
just<00:00:59.129> ran<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> straight<00:00:59.699> back<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.090> return

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
just ran it straight back to the return

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.340 
just ran it straight back to the return
tank<00:01:00.980> so<00:01:01.980> your<00:01:02.309> inline<00:01:02.640> rev<00:01:02.910> limiter<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
tank so your inline rev limiter the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.370 
tank so your inline rev limiter the
factory<00:01:04.769> one<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.670> acts<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> rev<00:01:06.810> limiter<00:01:07.170> but

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
factory one it acts as a rev limiter but

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.940 
factory one it acts as a rev limiter but
it<00:01:07.470> also<00:01:07.650> acts<00:01:08.040> as<00:01:08.310> your<00:01:08.700> fuel<00:01:09.119> restrictor

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
it also acts as your fuel restrictor

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.890 
it also acts as your fuel restrictor
back<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:12.920> your<00:01:13.920> tank<00:01:14.509> that's<00:01:15.509> where<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> got<00:01:15.869> it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
back to your tank that's where I got it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.539 
back to your tank that's where I got it
plugged<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.259> from<00:01:16.409> there<00:01:16.710> all<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> way<00:01:17.310> over

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
plugged in from there all the way over

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.170 
plugged in from there all the way over
there<00:01:17.729> got<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.509> capped<00:01:18.780> off<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> we're<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.119> to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
there got a capped off so we're going to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.929 
there got a capped off so we're going to
talk<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.330> little<00:01:21.509> bit<00:01:21.630> about<00:01:21.750> what<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> does

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
talk a little bit about what it does

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.210 
talk a little bit about what it does
your<00:01:23.939> rev<00:01:24.150> limiter<00:01:24.890> plugs<00:01:25.890> into<00:01:26.100> your

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
when it gets up there it redirects to

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.389 
when it gets up there it redirects to

the carburetor to bog it down so it

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.580 
the carburetor to bog it down so it
pretty<00:01:49.170> much<00:01:49.259> floods<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.860> out<00:01:50.600> when<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:52.170> floods

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
pretty much floods it out when it floods

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.149 
pretty much floods it out when it floods
it<00:01:52.740> out
