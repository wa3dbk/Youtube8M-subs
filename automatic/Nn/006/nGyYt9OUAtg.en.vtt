00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
now guys Rob again this quads now been

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.039 
now guys Rob again this quads now been
flying<00:00:04.020> for<00:00:04.110> about<00:00:04.700> 13<00:00:05.700> minutes<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:06.150> you'll

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
flying for about 13 minutes and you'll

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.570 
flying for about 13 minutes and you'll
see<00:00:07.290> that<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.560> red<00:00:07.740> light<00:00:07.950> flashing<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
see that the red light flashing on the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.430 
see that the red light flashing on the
back<00:00:08.820> that's<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.360> low<00:00:09.630> voltage<00:00:09.870> warning

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
back that's the low voltage warning

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.709 
back that's the low voltage warning
that's<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.710> first<00:00:10.980> low<00:00:11.429> voltage<00:00:11.790> warning<00:00:12.150> and

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
that's the first low voltage warning and

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.870 
that's the first low voltage warning and
the<00:00:12.900> second<00:00:13.290> low<00:00:13.380> voltage<00:00:13.740> warning<00:00:14.130> when<00:00:14.730> that

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
the second low voltage warning when that

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.550 
the second low voltage warning when that
occurs<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.509> quadrille<00:00:15.900> just<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.170> stand<00:00:16.440> of

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
occurs the quadrille just the stand of

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.189 
occurs the quadrille just the stand of
land<00:00:16.770> by<00:00:16.980> itself<00:00:17.279> but<00:00:17.640> I'll<00:00:18.359> just<00:00:18.420> leave<00:00:19.080> the

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
land by itself but I'll just leave the

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.570 
land by itself but I'll just leave the
video<00:00:19.350> running<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.949> I'll<00:00:20.039> show<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.310> how<00:00:20.430> that

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
video running and I'll show you how that

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.670 
video running and I'll show you how that
works<00:00:21.980> you<00:00:22.980> can<00:00:23.160> actually<00:00:23.310> set<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.680> voltage

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
works you can actually set the voltage

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.470 
works you can actually set the voltage
levels<00:00:26.070> for<00:00:26.279> these<00:00:26.340> two<00:00:26.609> warnings<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.210> occur

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
levels for these two warnings to occur

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.259 
levels for these two warnings to occur
or<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.960> disable<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.500> if<00:00:28.619> necessary

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
or you can disable it if necessary

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.269 
or you can disable it if necessary
but<00:00:30.269> after<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> bit<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.080> trial<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.830> error<00:00:31.980> I've

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
but after a bit of trial and error I've

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.490 
but after a bit of trial and error I've
got<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> point<00:00:33.030> where<00:00:33.350> it<00:00:34.350> will

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
got it to the point where it will

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.799 
got it to the point where it will
automatically<00:00:35.010> descend<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.760> land<00:00:35.820> with

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
automatically descend and land with

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.540 
automatically descend and land with
about<00:00:37.050> 20%<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.129> battery<00:00:38.399> capacity

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
about 20% of the battery capacity

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.000 
about 20% of the battery capacity
remaining<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.570> some<00:00:40.200> fairly<00:00:40.440> happy<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:40.860> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
remaining so some fairly happy with that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.740 
remaining so some fairly happy with that
it<00:00:41.250> gives<00:00:41.399> me<00:00:41.550> about<00:00:41.760> 15<00:00:42.149> minutes<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.540> flight

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
it gives me about 15 minutes of flight

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.049 
it gives me about 15 minutes of flight
time

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.180 

it's<00:00:50.629> just<00:00:50.870> coming<00:00:51.050> up<00:00:51.170> to<00:00:51.230> about<00:00:51.379> 14<00:00:51.860> minutes

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
it's just coming up to about 14 minutes

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:20.540 
it's just coming up to about 14 minutes
now

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.610 

I'm<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.360> climbing<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.870> manually<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.350> little

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
I'm just climbing it manually a little

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.600 
I'm just climbing it manually a little
bit<00:01:22.740> there<00:01:24.260> just<00:01:25.260> so<00:01:25.410> that<00:01:25.440> you<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:25.860> see<00:01:26.100> how

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
bit there just so that you can see how

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.730 
bit there just so that you can see how
it<00:01:26.760> will<00:01:26.880> positively<00:01:27.510> descend<00:01:28.110> when<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
it will positively descend when the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:38.399 
it will positively descend when the
battery<00:01:29.010> gets<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.340> life

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.499 

now<00:01:38.950> that's<00:01:39.159> 15<00:01:39.549> minutes<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:40.000> flight<00:01:40.240> time

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
now that's 15 minutes the flight time

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.459 
now that's 15 minutes the flight time
now<00:01:40.719> so<00:01:41.020> I'm<00:01:41.350> expecting<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.920> battery<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:43.469> be

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
now so I'm expecting the battery to be

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.889 
now so I'm expecting the battery to be
depleted<00:01:44.799> fairly<00:01:45.399> soon<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:45.939> you'll<00:01:46.659> see<00:01:46.810> the

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
depleted fairly soon and you'll see the

00:01:46.899 --> 00:02:20.190 
depleted fairly soon and you'll see the
quadrille<00:01:47.229> disk<00:01:47.380> automatically<00:01:47.920> land

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.809 

flying<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.980> little<00:02:21.069> bit<00:02:21.280> longer<00:02:21.520> than<00:02:21.730> I

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
flying a little bit longer than I

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:41.140 
flying a little bit longer than I
expected

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:03:03.130 

okay<00:02:41.810> there<00:02:41.989> guys

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.710 

I<00:03:03.790> thought<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.910> would<00:03:05.000> shut<00:03:05.180> off<00:03:05.210> the<00:03:05.420> motors

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
I thought it would shut off the motors

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.449 
I thought it would shut off the motors
itself<00:03:06.110> but<00:03:06.319> it<00:03:06.530> didn't<00:03:06.830> do<00:03:06.950> that<00:03:06.980> then<00:03:07.250> I<00:03:07.310> had

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
itself but it didn't do that then I had

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.160 
itself but it didn't do that then I had
to<00:03:07.550> shut<00:03:07.670> them<00:03:07.850> off<00:03:07.940> manually<00:03:08.360> but<00:03:08.510> at<00:03:08.990> least

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
to shut them off manually but at least

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.900 
to shut them off manually but at least
that<00:03:09.380> showed<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.890> what<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.220> court<00:03:10.430> does<00:03:10.610> when

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
that showed you what the court does when

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.760 
that showed you what the court does when
the<00:03:11.060> voltage<00:03:11.480> level<00:03:11.900> gets<00:03:12.080> too<00:03:12.290> low<00:03:12.440> you<00:03:12.709> know

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
the voltage level gets too low you know

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.270 
the voltage level gets too low you know
when<00:03:13.100> I<00:03:13.130> put<00:03:13.400> that<00:03:13.490> on<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.730> charger<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:15.280> it's

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
when I put that on the charger the it's

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.440 
when I put that on the charger the it's
a<00:03:16.370> five<00:03:16.550> thousand<00:03:16.880> milliamp<00:03:17.090> hour<00:03:17.390> battery

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
a five thousand milliamp hour battery

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.080 
a five thousand milliamp hour battery
it'll<00:03:18.230> take<00:03:18.440> back<00:03:18.740> about<00:03:19.010> four<00:03:19.400> thousand<00:03:19.940> two

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
it'll take back about four thousand two

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.360 
it'll take back about four thousand two
hundred<00:03:20.120> milliamps<00:03:20.660> just<00:03:21.140> from<00:03:21.370> previous

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
hundred milliamps just from previous

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.330 
hundred milliamps just from previous
experience<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:22.910> that<00:03:23.030> went<00:03:23.209> for<00:03:23.450> sixteen

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
experience and that went for sixteen

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.250 
experience and that went for sixteen
minutes<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.850> six<00:03:26.420> seconds<00:03:26.780> thanks<00:03:27.170> for

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
minutes and six seconds thanks for

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.530 
minutes and six seconds thanks for
