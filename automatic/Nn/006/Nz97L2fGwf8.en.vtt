00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
were broken but turns out i was just

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.060 
were broken but turns out i was just
being<00:00:56.059> stupid<00:00:56.360> because<00:00:56.750> i<00:00:57.170> put<00:00:57.409> the<00:00:57.619> mic<00:00:57.890> in

wrong well i got these tsunami using
these<00:01:01.610> new<00:01:01.879> ones<00:01:02.150> called<00:01:02.479> shark<00:01:02.780> UNS<00:01:03.049> which

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
these new ones called shark UNS which

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.670 
these new ones called shark UNS which
I'm<00:01:04.129> guessing<00:01:04.339> is<00:01:04.580> generic<00:01:05.390> a<00:01:05.689> generic<00:01:06.470> form

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
I'm guessing is generic a generic form

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.490 
I'm guessing is generic a generic form
of<00:01:06.950> Triton's<00:01:07.900> because<00:01:08.900> the<00:01:09.020> same<00:01:09.290> the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
of Triton's because the same the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.380 
of Triton's because the same the
packaging<00:01:09.979> is<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.220> same<00:01:10.490> everything<00:01:11.150> about

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
packaging is the same everything about

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.170 
packaging is the same everything about
them<00:01:11.509> is<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.720> same<00:01:11.960> like<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:12.799> features<00:01:13.250> so<00:01:14.150> i

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
them is the same like the features so i

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.540 
them is the same like the features so i
think<00:01:14.360> i<00:01:14.570> just<00:01:14.600> got<00:01:14.869> a<00:01:14.900> generic<00:01:15.710> form<00:01:15.920> of<00:01:16.070> a

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
think i just got a generic form of a

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.090 
think i just got a generic form of a
Triton<00:01:17.300> so<00:01:18.080> I<00:01:18.110> hope<00:01:18.410> everything<00:01:18.830> is<00:01:18.860> alright

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
Triton so I hope everything is alright

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.700 
Triton so I hope everything is alright

because if you remember mw2 you had that

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.460 
because if you remember mw2 you had that
throwing<00:02:01.850> knife<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.210> when<00:02:02.900> you<00:02:03.049> threw<00:02:03.440> that

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
throwing knife and when you threw that

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.630 
throwing knife and when you threw that
thing<00:02:03.620> it<00:02:03.890> would<00:02:03.979> stick<00:02:04.250> into<00:02:04.400> anything

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
thing it would stick into anything

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.030 
thing it would stick into anything
whether<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.150> be<00:02:05.210> concrete<00:02:05.780> or<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.890> know<00:02:07.010> just

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
whether it be concrete or you know just

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.339 
whether it be concrete or you know just
a<00:02:07.280> barrel<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.850> would<00:02:08.000> stick<00:02:08.360> look<00:02:09.200> at<00:02:09.289> this

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
a barrel it would stick look at this

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.500 
a barrel it would stick look at this
that's<00:02:10.069> that<00:02:10.519> should<00:02:10.700> have<00:02:10.789> been<00:02:10.819> on<00:02:11.030> top<00:02:11.060> 10

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
that's that should have been on top 10
