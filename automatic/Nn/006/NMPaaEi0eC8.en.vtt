00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
with the nades you're gonna spawn Search

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.970 
with the nades you're gonna spawn Search
and<00:02:31.890> Destroy<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:33.349> now<00:02:34.349> this<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.830> tricky

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
and Destroy and now this is the tricky

and Destroy and now this is the tricky
part<00:02:35.370> okay<00:02:35.910> how<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.599> is<00:02:36.750> going<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.989> work<00:02:37.200> is

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
part okay how this is going to work is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.470 
part okay how this is going to work is
you're<00:02:37.980> going<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.190> take<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.880> number<00:02:39.060> I'm

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
you're going to take that number I'm

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.300 
you're going to take that number I'm
drive<00:02:39.690> away<00:02:39.989> with<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.290> your<00:02:40.410> calculator<00:02:40.980> and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
drive away with in your calculator and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.620 
drive away with in your calculator and
you're<00:02:42.090> going<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.269> want<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.510> take

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
you're going to want to take

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.550 
you're going to want to take
approximately<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.950> many<00:02:44.459> steps<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.959> let's

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
approximately that many steps so let's

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.740 
approximately that many steps so let's
do<00:02:46.799> that<00:02:47.010> now<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:48.030> going<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.269> be<00:02:48.620> 4.6<00:02:49.819> 0871<00:02:50.819> 60

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
do that now it's going to be 4.6 0871 60

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:02.600 
do that now it's going to be 4.6 0871 60
75<00:02:52.350> 85<00:02:53.540> 1609<00:02:54.540> steps<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:56.040> one<00:02:58.099> two<00:03:00.170> three<00:03:01.610> four

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
75 85 1609 steps so one two three four

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.050 
75 85 1609 steps so one two three four
now<00:03:03.709> we're<00:03:04.709> going<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:04.980> have<00:03:05.099> to<00:03:05.250> go<00:03:05.489> into<00:03:05.760> this

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
now we're going to have to go into this

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.020 
now we're going to have to go into this
corner<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.480> little<00:03:06.569> bit<00:03:06.930> more<00:03:07.230> since<00:03:07.530> it's<00:03:07.739> the

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
corner a little bit more since it's the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.130 
corner a little bit more since it's the
608<00:03:09.030> 7160<00:03:09.900> 2785<00:03:10.769> 1609<00:03:11.610> I'm<00:03:12.569> going<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.810> go<00:03:12.959> all
