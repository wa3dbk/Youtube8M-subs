00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.250 

and<00:02:45.550> this<00:02:45.730> is<00:02:45.910> where<00:02:46.120> my<00:02:46.300> problem<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:46.900> gonna<00:02:47.020> be

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
and this is where my problem is gonna be

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.900 
and this is where my problem is gonna be
I<00:02:47.290> know<00:02:47.440> it's<00:02:47.560> going<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:47.890> be<00:02:48.040> some<00:02:49.000> money<00:02:49.320> but

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
I know it's going to be some money but

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.000 
I know it's going to be some money but
got<00:02:51.910> some<00:02:52.210> rust<00:02:52.450> going<00:02:52.810> on<00:02:52.960> pretty<00:02:53.170> bad

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
got some rust going on pretty bad

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.699 
got some rust going on pretty bad
so<00:02:55.459> what<00:02:55.640> I'm<00:02:55.730> probably<00:02:55.940> gonna<00:02:56.180> do<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:57.319> just

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
so what I'm probably gonna do is just

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.729 
so what I'm probably gonna do is just
probably<00:02:57.950> chop<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:58.790> off<00:02:58.910> right<00:02:59.120> there<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.739> be

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
probably chop it off right there and be

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.630 
probably chop it off right there and be
good<00:03:00.980> with<00:03:01.160> it<00:03:01.340> because<00:03:01.489> also

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
good with it because also

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.030 
good with it because also
on<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.850> driver<00:03:04.569> side<00:03:04.660> behind<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:06.370> also

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
on the driver side behind it and also

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.979 
on the driver side behind it and also
here<00:03:08.549> on<00:03:08.730> the

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.050 

driver's<00:03:11.709> side

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060
