absolutely<00:00:27.210> fine<00:00:27.830> moving<00:00:28.830> around<00:00:29.779> so<00:00:30.779> I'll

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
absolutely fine moving around so I'll

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.889 
absolutely fine moving around so I'll
try<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.140> keep<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.380> light<00:00:31.590> out<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.800> their

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
try and keep the light out of their

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.090 
try and keep the light out of their
older<00:00:33.899> buttons<00:00:34.230> instead<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> trigger

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
older buttons instead of the trigger

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.310 
older buttons instead of the trigger
buttons<00:00:35.489> or<00:00:36.000> they<00:00:36.239> shut<00:00:36.570> down<00:00:36.600> their<00:00:37.050> way<00:00:38.059> that

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
buttons or they shut down their way that

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.810 
buttons or they shut down their way that
could<00:00:40.320> be<00:00:40.469> an<00:00:40.590> issue<00:00:40.710> let's<00:00:41.160> see<00:00:41.340> if<00:00:41.430> that's<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
could be an issue let's see if that's a

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.500 
could be an issue let's see if that's a
problem<00:00:43.070> because<00:00:44.070> again<00:00:44.460> it's<00:00:44.700> not<00:00:44.760> optimized

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
problem because again it's not optimized

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.260 
problem because again it's not optimized
for<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.930> shield<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.950> would<00:00:47.340> expect<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.940> few

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
for the shield so I would expect a few

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.119 
for the shield so I would expect a few
little<00:00:48.600> bugs<00:00:48.809> here<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:49.800> all<00:00:49.890> done

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
little bugs here and there it's all done

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.160 
little bugs here and there it's all done
it<00:00:50.610> shouldn't<00:00:50.910> be<00:00:51.000> any<00:00:51.120> sort<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.480> updating<00:00:51.989> at

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
it shouldn't be any sort of updating at

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.229 
it shouldn't be any sort of updating at
the<00:00:52.260> moment<00:00:52.649> trust<00:00:53.309> anyone<00:00:53.699> all<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.210> a
