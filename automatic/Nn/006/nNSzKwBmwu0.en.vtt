 generations as if I tell you that 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.800

 I dedicated mostly 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.220
 most macular deviations affect the elderly 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.220
 subjects above the 60 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.670

 the first visual difficulties 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.330
 a series of instrumental investigations must be carried out and therefore possibly 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.659
 establish appropriate therapy 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.770
 the rich also said therapy
