of experience with this already but
anyways<00:00:23.810> tequila<00:00:24.810> used<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.590> be<00:00:25.740> probably<00:00:26.460> my

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
anyways tequila used to be probably my

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.820 
anyways tequila used to be probably my
least<00:00:27.090> favorite<00:00:27.599> spirit<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.260> that's<00:00:28.410> because

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
least favorite spirit and that's because

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.999 
least favorite spirit and that's because
I<00:00:29.160> have<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.939> lot<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.300> bad<00:00:30.480> experiences<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.439> if

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
I have a lot of bad experiences on it if

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.310 
I have a lot of bad experiences on it if
I<00:00:32.460> would<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.030> rated<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:33.660> stuff<00:00:33.989> when<00:00:34.290> I

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
I would have rated this stuff when I

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.860 
I would have rated this stuff when I
first<00:00:34.800> tried<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.340> probably<00:00:35.790> give<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.300> like<00:00:36.630> a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
first tried it I probably give it like a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.549 
first tried it I probably give it like a
1<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.559> for<00:00:37.800> 2<00:00:38.190> out<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.430> 5<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:39.570> I'm<00:00:40.260> gonna<00:00:40.379> go

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
1 and for 2 out of 5 but I'm gonna go

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.069 
1 and for 2 out of 5 but I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.890> see<00:00:41.579> how<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.300> rating<00:00:42.719> might<00:00:42.960> have

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
ahead and see how that rating might have

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:57.240 
ahead and see how that rating might have
changed<00:00:43.530> over<00:00:43.739> time

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.510 

so<00:00:57.820> it's<00:00:57.970> not<00:00:58.120> too<00:00:58.360> bad<00:00:58.390> actually<00:00:58.840> it<00:00:59.520> does

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
so it's not too bad actually it does

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.000 
so it's not too bad actually it does
burn<00:01:00.760> quite<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.240> bit<00:01:01.540> quite<00:01:02.410> a<00:01:02.470> bit<00:01:02.620> more<00:01:02.800> than

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
burn quite a bit quite a bit more than

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.250 
burn quite a bit quite a bit more than
the<00:01:03.130> donkey<00:01:03.490> leo

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the donkey leo

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.520 
the donkey leo
it's<00:01:05.260> a<00:01:05.350> very<00:01:05.620> low-key<00:01:07.050> kind<00:01:08.050> of<00:01:08.140> taste<00:01:08.350> a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
it's a very low-key kind of taste a

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.610 
it's a very low-key kind of taste a
little<00:01:08.650> bit<00:01:08.830> like<00:01:08.860> apple<00:01:09.340> news<00:01:09.490> and<00:01:10.590> yeah<00:01:11.590> of

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
course there's a really strong flavor of

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.060 
course there's a really strong flavor of
a<00:01:14.560> Gavi<00:01:14.800> in<00:01:15.310> there<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.900> anyways<00:01:17.230> I'm<00:01:18.010> just
