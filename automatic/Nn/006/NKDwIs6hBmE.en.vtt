00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.670
 opportunity 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.780
 in the heads of many young people like 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.960
 all of these that have been accredited 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.210
 some groups with ways of people by 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.280
 the streets or where they are always 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.219
 with its expensive Indian like as 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.820
 thrown up like some very expressions 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.820
 foreign 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.429
 Hello 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:22.550
 and what is the meaning of life 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.850
 I do not know what for you is the sense of 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.850
 life 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.689
 but I only know that I am very 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.900
 grateful but be here for having us 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:36.750
 gone because it may not have been like that 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.829
 but my parents when I was three months 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.810
 of effect and they told me that 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:46.439
 affected said he was going to be physically 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:50.300
 unable to pronounce the s then 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:54.010
 I came to this world almost inadvertently 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.010
 what is the meaning in life 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.060
 in the meaning of life is selling houses 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.650
 try to be happy a little but not 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.650
 Sell â€‹â€‹houses 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.010
 black Jews jonas is for example that 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.840
 There is an opportunity if you have 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.129
 beliefs of wanting to exterminate your no 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.180
 it matters because it's not right to live in 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:32.079
 a perfect house to the good ones but we 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.599
 they could not do anything about it 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.159
 because the same nature was already commissioned 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.349
 of punishing the bankers also who 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.879
 also sing sell houses you know 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.080
 a couple of homosexuals arrived and I 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:48.070
 said ay 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:51.310
 for us as a family of 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.500
 blacks that good divine divine house 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.840
 first floor so a patio did not have a 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.290
 back yard not ahead to avoid 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.510
 that neighbors make others uncomfortable 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.180
 crosses in hood with that will not happen 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.450
 If you are a good Jew, if I study you 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.200
 I guarantee 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.330
 a good gas system to avoid the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.950
 memories then if you want a house 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.870
 If you want anything or if you want 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.980
 have a coffee or talk since you can 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.980

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.859

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.720

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.530
 already already 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.530

 I do not know what the meaning of life is for 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.750
 you block and it does not make sense to me 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.180
 your miracle is apology but if you eat 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.070
 cancer meat if you buy a dog in 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.140
 place of adopters will be shattered by 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.910
 a tornado listens to music in Spanish and 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.290
 will keep being the shofar and I'm fed up 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.290
