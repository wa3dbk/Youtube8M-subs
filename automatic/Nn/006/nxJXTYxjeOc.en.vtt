00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello everyone good in the day's review 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.099
 today for this great gift of reviews that 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:16.139
 we have is the glue for eyelashes 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.400
 revlon possession the processions says 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.930
 this 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.730
 this glue for you is 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.590
 relatively new I think he has a 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.570
 couple of months if it's not just more or 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:31.810
 less a month here in Mexico 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.850
 it's black and the packaging basically 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.980
 what it says is that it's for a 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.940
 application 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:43.210
 trouble is waterproof and is 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.890
 latex-free what most called me the 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.989
 Attention of the beginning is that it is free of 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.850
 latex for people who are allergic to 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.910
 latex or having allergic reactions 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.640
 to latex normally the glues for 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.610
 eyelashes have latex and the fact 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.710
 that this one does not have was what called me 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.230
 the attention no more than anything and that there was 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:08.200
 listened to very good reviews 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:10.810
 the product has 17 ounce point or 5 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.690
 milliliters is a good amount and 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.830
 also what we are most interested in this 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.300
 product is that the format is 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.440
 a feather 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.450
 I'm still in a brush 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.670
 and the first thing I thought was that 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.030
 convenient it will be the simplest of 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.080
 world to be able to apply the glue to your 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.490
 eyelashes without embedding 2 however it is the 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.490
 formula is a nightmare 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.780
 to start but to pass and to 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.750
 finish you need two things from a 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.180
 glue for eyelashes number one that 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.920
 it adheres to your lashes and number two 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.080
 that sticks to your lashes 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.700
 for several hours because we did not 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.810
 We can use false eyelashes to use them 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.000
 half an hour more with the crystals 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.500
 fake special occasions like 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.750
 weddings graduations 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.820
 special occasions when you're going to 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.729
 take pictures and you want it to look like that 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.770
 extra not from bigger eyes and not 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.430
 does neither of those two things is 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.790
 really at first I thought maybe 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.920
 I was using it badly and it is very difficult 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.480
 it's not like a makeup foundation that 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.940
 you say good some people like it 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.450
 for its skin type, others do not 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.880
 I do not have eyes especially my 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.300
 eyelids are not very very fatty and 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.880
 I found that it was impossible is you put the 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.190
 glue on the tab you wait more or 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.680
 minus one minute to dry 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.200
 it dries never never dries 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.239
 dried up to dry you have to wait for 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.720
 that dries a bit that is like 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.150
 dry ozone baits completely own 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.880
 idle so you can put it in the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.470
 eye on the eyelid and that never happened 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.300
 So, well, I said, it does not matter. 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.400
 I'm going to apply on the eyelid 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.600
 once dried after 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.430
 you have to be two hours there 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.640
 grabbing the tab because if it does not go 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.630
 to move all over your eye 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.380
 the tips of the tip inside the tip 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.990
 outside they took off after 5 seconds 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.400
 and I did not manage to make them stick 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.310
 10,000 ways 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.430
 and many times I try my 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.380
 eyes began to cry after 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.540
 several attempts and my eyes are not 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.390
 precisely the most whiny eyes of the 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.850
 story but something has this glue 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.550
 that made them irritate a lot and that 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:39.470
 that they do not have latex which I do 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:42.290
 very strange and good said I will achieve it 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.560
 and I put more and more and more and more glue 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.410
 at the tips it was possible to paste after 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.060
 one hour they were already taking off 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.870
 after two hours I could remove the 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.420
 tab so sliding as if nothing and what 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.250
 most impressive of that is that here says 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.700
 which is waterproof then I 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.860
 I would think good maybe 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.200
 I did not manage to hit it well but what I already know 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.470
 stuck is waterproof no it is not to 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.630
 water proof 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.060
 in fact it is not proof of anything because 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.790
 not even his not going out on the street 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.970
 I did nothing and the tab was I tell them 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.790
 I could grab it and pull it as if nothing 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.829
 unlike the glue duo both the 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.980
 which is black like the one that is transparent 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.750
 I have to take it off with make-up remover 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.910
 for tabs I have a video of how 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.950
 make-up false eyelashes and in that 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.860
 video I show how it is that I do it and it is 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.630
 quite complicated complicated not to 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.580
 degree of that inconvenience but 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.530
 complicated added that you can have 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.220
 lashes like 10 hours and they are not going to 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.210
 fall and then the fact that this 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.880
 besides that it says it's proof of 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:51.350
 water and that does not last an hour put is 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.000
 a complete waste of time I 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.360
 I think I had never encountered a 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.780
 product I do not hate it like that of hate 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.360
 because it 's makeup already but I do not think 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.250
 it's nothing effective I tell you the only ones 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.070
 positive things are useless because 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.690
 the formula itself does not work for any 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.470
 kind of a way 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.440
 dt 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.390
 I'll keep using it and more than anything 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.920
 to see if with time it's like the 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.810
 mascara you open it and close it and 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.330
 praiseable and you close it and you get air and 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.640
 it gets a little drier I'll see if 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.830
 that happens and I'll let you know in some 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.260
 future but if they do not return to 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.260
 listen to none of this glue for 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:34.190
 eyelashes is that it never worked and good 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:37.010
 sadly that's my review about 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:41.830
 the product then also the price is 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:45.620
 the cost 190 pesos my duo 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.830
 costs as 40 35 and works 15 thousand 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.390
 times better then for my taste it is not 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.040
 a product that is worth nothing 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.570
 more because it serves us for some kind of 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.710
 skin but because in general the formula 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:00.350
 the formula does not operate, it does not strike, it does not 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.030
 provides shadows without shadows with 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.910
 eyeliner with first without prize 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.130
 powder without dust I put everything and remove 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.110
 all of my eyelids and it still works 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.000
 that 's all for my part I hope that this 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.800
 Once you find it useful to excuse that sounds 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.470
 so negative silk 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.090
 if they have tried it and managed to make 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.830
 will work please let me know 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.770
 because I do not like having the products 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.099
 sitting there doing nothing is the price 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.099
 video and
