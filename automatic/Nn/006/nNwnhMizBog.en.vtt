handles<00:02:31.800> very<00:02:31.860> well<00:02:32.100> that's<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.000> key<00:02:33.209> I'm

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
handles very well that's the key I'm

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.750

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
was hitting before I've actually had

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.430 
was hitting before I've actually had
mine<00:02:38.130> where<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.030> was<00:02:39.300> running<00:02:39.450> downstream<00:02:40.170> on

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
mine where I was running downstream on

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.070 
mine where I was running downstream on
that<00:02:40.620> River<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:42.090> there's<00:02:42.300> there's<00:02:42.780> water

running over top of a flat Boulder and

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.120 
running over top of a flat Boulder and
there<00:02:45.720> was<00:02:45.840> enough<00:02:46.110> water<00:02:46.140> for<00:02:46.530> me<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.010> go

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
there was enough water for me to go

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.530 
there was enough water for me to go
right<00:02:47.340> over<00:02:47.370> top<00:02:47.819> of<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.090> Boulder<00:02:48.420> I

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
right over top of the Boulder I

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.030 
right over top of the Boulder I
literally<00:02:48.959> went<00:02:49.350> over<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.590> top<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.830> the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
literally went over the top of the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.680 
literally went over the top of the
