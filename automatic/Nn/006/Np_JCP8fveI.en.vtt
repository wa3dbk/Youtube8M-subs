00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.149 

so<00:00:00.359> what<00:00:00.510> was<00:00:00.690> a<00:00:00.719> little<00:00:01.380> bit<00:00:01.500> harder<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.800> do<00:00:02.070> is

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
so what was a little bit harder to do is

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.329 
so what was a little bit harder to do is
to<00:00:02.340> do<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.490> balanced<00:00:02.970> computation<00:00:03.629> and<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:05.069> did

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
to do a balanced computation and I did

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.769 
to do a balanced computation and I did
that<00:00:05.549> for<00:00:05.700> kill<00:00:05.879> up<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.240> day<00:00:06.359> just<00:00:06.660> because

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
that for kill up to the day just because

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.110 
that for kill up to the day just because
I<00:00:06.990> wasn't<00:00:07.170> sure<00:00:07.350> what<00:00:07.620> they<00:00:07.740> win<00:00:07.950> what<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.760> need

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
I wasn't sure what they win what I need

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.890 
I wasn't sure what they win what I need
to<00:00:09.210> put<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.510> win

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
to put the win

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.940 
to put the win
I'm<00:00:10.679> down<00:00:11.690> you<00:00:12.690> need<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.230> start<00:00:13.530> with<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
I'm down you need to start with the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.890 
I'm down you need to start with the
weight<00:00:14.219> estimate<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.120> do<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.299> need<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.450> do<00:00:15.690> all

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
weight estimate so do you need to do all

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.790 
weight estimate so do you need to do all
of<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.230> first<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:17.699> then<00:00:18.289> the<00:00:19.289> key<00:00:19.500> point

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
of that first so but then the key point

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.910 
of that first so but then the key point
to<00:00:20.070> doing<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.730> balanced<00:00:21.769> computation<00:00:22.769> is

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
to doing a balanced computation is

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.250 
to doing a balanced computation is
coming<00:00:23.369> up<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:24.539> different<00:00:24.930> names<00:00:25.140> for

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
coming up and this different names for

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.529 
coming up and this different names for
this<00:00:25.470> some<00:00:25.769> people<00:00:26.039> call<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.670> reference

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
this some people call this a reference

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.519 
this some people call this a reference
datum<00:00:27.900> or<00:00:28.160> the<00:00:29.160> datum<00:00:29.519> line<00:00:29.900> I<00:00:30.900> don't<00:00:31.230> care

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
datum or the datum line I don't care

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.799 
datum or the datum line I don't care
what<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.800> call<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.489> know<00:00:32.540> it's<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.660> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
what you call it you know it's just a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:34.220 
what you call it you know it's just a
name

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
name

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.560 
name
but<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.250> basically<00:00:35.430> need<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.000> come<00:00:36.270> up<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:36.540> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
but you basically need to come up with a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.220 
but you basically need to come up with a
point<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:38.040> airplane<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:39.110> everything<00:00:40.110> is

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
point on the airplane that everything is

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.900 
point on the airplane that everything is
going<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> be<00:00:40.590> measured<00:00:42.140> against<00:00:43.460> okay<00:00:44.460> so

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
going to be measured against okay so

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.660 
going to be measured against okay so
you're<00:00:45.090> gonna<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.539> know<00:00:45.570> measuring

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
you're gonna be you know measuring

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.110 
you're gonna be you know measuring
weight<00:00:47.670> um<00:00:48.680> but<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> distances<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.700> to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
weight um but the distances to that to

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.240 
weight um but the distances to that to
that<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.719> point<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.160> know

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
that to that point and you know

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.830 
that to that point and you know
sometimes<00:00:53.670> they<00:00:53.879> put<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.480> know<00:00:54.539> at<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
sometimes they put it you know at the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.420 
sometimes they put it you know at the
quarter<00:00:55.140> chord<00:00:55.440> point<00:00:55.710> sometimes<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.340> been

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
quarter chord point sometimes have been

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.490 
quarter chord point sometimes have been
the<00:00:56.610> wind<00:00:56.850> leading<00:00:57.149> edge<00:00:57.329> sometimes<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.350> is

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
the wind leading edge sometimes it is

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.889 
the wind leading edge sometimes it is
some<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.800> firewall<00:00:59.340> so<00:01:00.120> nice<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.570> running

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
some the firewall so nice it's running

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.410 
some the firewall so nice it's running
the<00:01:00.930> nose<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> airplane<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:03.300> I've

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the nose of the airplane but what I've

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.000 
the nose of the airplane but what I've
done<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> spreadsheet<00:01:04.589> that's

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
done and I have a spreadsheet that's

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.179 
done and I have a spreadsheet that's
just<00:01:05.580> gonna<00:01:05.729> go<00:01:05.880> along<00:01:06.119> with<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.420> article<00:01:07.189> he

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
just gonna go along with this article he

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.140 
just gonna go along with this article he
said<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.610> put<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.979> one<00:01:10.979> inch<00:01:11.250> ahead<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
said I just put it one inch ahead of the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.969 
said I just put it one inch ahead of the
airplane<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.200> reason<00:01:13.500> why<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> did<00:01:13.950> that

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
airplane and the reason why I did that

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.710 
airplane and the reason why I did that
is<00:01:14.159> because<00:01:14.369> then<00:01:14.729> all<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.030> numbers<00:01:15.540> are

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
is because then all the numbers are

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.539 
is because then all the numbers are
positive<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.500> all<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> numbers<00:01:17.070> are<00:01:17.220> easy<00:01:17.369> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
positive and all the numbers are easy to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.730 
positive and all the numbers are easy to
work<00:01:17.670> with<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.570> he<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:18.990> kind<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.229> simplified

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
work with and he just kind of simplified

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.550 
work with and he just kind of simplified
things<00:01:20.119> but<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.330> then<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:22.140> course<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.439> know

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
things but but then of course you know

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.020 
things but but then of course you know
then<00:01:22.740> you're<00:01:22.830> gonna<00:01:22.979> come<00:01:23.220> up<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.549> value

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
then you're gonna come up with a value

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.820 
then you're gonna come up with a value
you<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.689> gonna<00:01:24.810> say<00:01:25.080> seven<00:01:25.560> inches

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
you know this is gonna say seven inches

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.980 
you know this is gonna say seven inches
well<00:01:26.070> keep<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.700> mind<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.060> seven<00:01:27.390> inches<00:01:27.750> from

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
well keep in mind is seven inches from

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.319 
well keep in mind is seven inches from
that<00:01:28.409> point<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.250> know<00:01:29.640> that's<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:30.090> inch

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
that point you know that's one inch

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.969 
that point you know that's one inch
ahead<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> airplane<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.560> kind<00:01:31.920> of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
ahead of the airplane so you kind of

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.999 
ahead of the airplane so you kind of
need<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.159> work<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.460> way<00:01:32.729> back<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.740> think

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
need to work your way back so I think

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.649 
need to work your way back so I think
what<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.369> did<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> spreadsheet<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.479> have

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
what I did in the spreadsheet is have

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.440 
what I did in the spreadsheet is have
ideally<00:01:37.020> computations<00:01:37.829> from<00:01:38.310> there<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:39.210> then

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
ideally computations from there but then

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.410 
ideally computations from there but then
to<00:01:39.630> figure<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:40.310> where<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> wing<00:01:41.670> needed<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
to figure out where the wing needed to

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.560 
to figure out where the wing needed to
go<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.810> actually<00:01:43.500> mesh<00:01:44.000> measured<00:01:45.000> from<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
go I actually mesh measured from the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.050 
go I actually mesh measured from the
firewall<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> wing<00:01:47.100> leading<00:01:47.490> edge<00:01:47.640> which

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
firewall to the wing leading edge which

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.539 
firewall to the wing leading edge which
had<00:01:48.240> almost<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.659> lot<00:01:48.899> easier<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.350> work<00:01:49.500> with<00:01:49.560> and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
had almost a lot easier to work with and

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.179 
had almost a lot easier to work with and
you<00:01:50.610> know<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.180> know<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:52.380> really<00:01:52.619> easy<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.950> do

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
you know you know it's really easy to do

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.120 
you know you know it's really easy to do
that<00:01:53.220> because<00:01:53.460> you're<00:01:53.939> subtracting

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
that because you're subtracting

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.590 
that because you're subtracting
basically<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.310> length<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> motor<00:01:57.299> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
basically the length of the motor and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.319 
basically the length of the motor and
the<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.439> know<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.159> propeller<00:01:59.759> shaft<00:02:00.119> and

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
the you know the the propeller shaft and

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.179 
the you know the the propeller shaft and
and<00:02:00.630> all<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.009> so<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> anyway<00:02:03.540> um<00:02:04.189> just

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
and all of that so so anyway um just

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.590 
and all of that so so anyway um just
like<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.490> did<00:02:05.670> before<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.420> weight

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
like you did before for the weight

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.229 
like you did before for the weight
estimate<00:02:07.110> do<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.920> want<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.250> go<00:02:08.459> through<00:02:08.789> one

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
estimate do you want to go through one

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.680 
estimate do you want to go through one
by<00:02:09.270> one<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.800> come<00:02:11.640> up<00:02:11.760> with<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:11.970> value<00:02:12.300> which

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
by one and it come up with a value which

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.040 
by one and it come up with a value which
is<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
is the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.720 
is the
distance<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.710> that<00:02:14.000> datum<00:02:15.000> line<00:02:15.180> okay<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.730> you

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
distance to that datum line okay and you

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.830 
distance to that datum line okay and you
know<00:02:17.820> it's<00:02:17.910> pretty<00:02:18.060> straightforward

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
know it's pretty straightforward

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.180 
know it's pretty straightforward
you<00:02:19.050> know<00:02:19.170> just<00:02:19.410> there's<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.650> couple<00:02:19.980> things<00:02:20.070> to

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
you know just there's a couple things to

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.610 
you know just there's a couple things to
keep<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.550> mind<00:02:20.760> like<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:22.260> know<00:02:22.380> if<00:02:22.470> it's

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
keep in mind like you know if it's

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.430 
keep in mind like you know if it's
something<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.240> that's<00:02:24.240> big<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.170> know<00:02:25.230> let's

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
something that that's big you know let's

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.020 
something that that's big you know let's
say<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.800> fuselage<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.520> know<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.760> future

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
say is the fuselage you know the future

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.500 
say is the fuselage you know the future
lies<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.540> 36<00:02:28.500> inches<00:02:28.800> long<00:02:29.100> well<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:30.390> know

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
lies is a 36 inches long well you know

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.760 
lies is a 36 inches long well you know
for<00:02:30.690> everything<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.200> really<00:02:31.410> want<00:02:31.650> to

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
for everything you really want to

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.060 
for everything you really want to
measure<00:02:32.430> from<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.090> middle<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.980> the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
measure from the middle of it and in the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.490 
measure from the middle of it and in the
case<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.490> fuselage<00:02:35.970> has<00:02:36.150> 18<00:02:36.570> inches<00:02:36.900> so

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
case of the fuselage has 18 inches so

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.130 
case of the fuselage has 18 inches so
you<00:02:37.530> target<00:02:37.950> 18<00:02:38.340> inches<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:39.600> course<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.020> know

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
you target 18 inches of course you know

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.100 
you target 18 inches of course you know
to<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.440> firewall<00:02:41.090> plus<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.600> length<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.990> the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
to the firewall plus the length of the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.430 
to the firewall plus the length of the
motor

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
motor

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.260 
motor
Plus<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:44.010> extra<00:02:44.370> inch<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.850> that's<00:02:45.120> the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
Plus that extra inch and that's the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.660 
Plus that extra inch and that's the
value<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.840> need<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.110> use<00:02:46.260> for<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.670> you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
value that you need to use for that you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.130 
value that you need to use for that you
know<00:02:47.760> for<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.030> tail<00:02:48.270> you<00:02:48.690> know<00:02:48.720> that's<00:02:48.990> gonna

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
know for the tail you know that's gonna

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.360 
know for the tail you know that's gonna
be<00:02:49.230> pretty<00:02:49.560> long<00:02:49.970> value<00:02:51.200> for<00:02:52.200> each<00:02:52.320> servo<00:02:52.800> you

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
be pretty long value for each servo you

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.830 
be pretty long value for each servo you
know<00:02:53.490> they're<00:02:53.640> not<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:54.000> big<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.600> know<00:02:54.720> you

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
know they're not that big you know you

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.470 
know they're not that big you know you
can<00:02:55.020> add<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.620> know<00:02:55.740> half<00:02:56.160> an<00:02:56.340> inch<00:02:56.490> or<00:02:56.790> an<00:02:57.450> inch

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
can add you know half an inch or an inch

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.110 
can add you know half an inch or an inch
if<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.930> want<00:02:58.170> just<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.560> be<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.280> little<00:02:59.910> bit<00:03:00.000> more

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
if you want just to be a little bit more

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.820 
if you want just to be a little bit more
accurate<00:03:00.600> but<00:03:01.230> they're<00:03:01.350> not<00:03:01.440> gonna<00:03:01.620> weigh<00:03:01.800> a

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
accurate but they're not gonna weigh a

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.540 
accurate but they're not gonna weigh a
lot<00:03:02.070> anyway<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:04.620> there's<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.130> couple<00:03:05.370> of

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
lot anyway this there's a couple of

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.600 
lot anyway this there's a couple of
tricky<00:03:05.940> areas<00:03:06.300> with<00:03:06.630> this<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:08.190> know<00:03:08.280> one<00:03:08.490> of

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
tricky areas with this you know one of

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.210 
tricky areas with this you know one of
them<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:10.410> know<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.740> course<00:03:10.920> if<00:03:11.100> you're

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
them is you know of course if you're

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.190 
them is you know of course if you're
doing<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.610> computation<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.630> figured<00:03:12.960> I<00:03:13.020> would

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
doing the computation to figured I would

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.860 
doing the computation to figured I would
where<00:03:13.500> do<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.710> need<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:13.890> put<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.310> wing<00:03:14.870> how

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
where do you need to put the wing how

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.930 
where do you need to put the wing how
can<00:03:16.050> you<00:03:16.140> put<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.350> value<00:03:16.590> on<00:03:16.770> into<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.670> do<00:03:17.790> the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
can you put a value on into to do the

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.820 
can you put a value on into to do the
you<00:03:18.540> know<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.780> get<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.050> estimate<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.560> begin

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
you know to get the estimate to begin

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.530 
you know to get the estimate to begin
with<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.550> know<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:20.730> it's<00:03:20.880> kind<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.150> catch-22

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
with you know so it's kind of a catch-22

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.400 
with you know so it's kind of a catch-22
I<00:03:22.160> am<00:03:23.160> what<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.000> do<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.720> just<00:03:25.170> took<00:03:25.260> you

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
I am what I do is that I just took you

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.680 
I am what I do is that I just took you
guys<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:26.430> know<00:03:26.520> I<00:03:26.550> just<00:03:26.700> say<00:03:27.030> okay<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.510> wing

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
guys you know I just say okay the wing

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.310 
guys you know I just say okay the wing
is<00:03:27.810> five<00:03:28.050> inches<00:03:28.380> back<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:30.239> know<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.570> or

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
is five inches back and you know and or

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.110 
is five inches back and you know and or
let's<00:03:31.560> say<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.830> CG<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.700> know<00:03:32.790> it's<00:03:32.910> gonna<00:03:33.030> be

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
let's say the CG you know it's gonna be

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.190 
let's say the CG you know it's gonna be
five<00:03:33.720> inches<00:03:34.020> back<00:03:34.310> well<00:03:35.690> let<00:03:36.690> me<00:03:36.720> back<00:03:36.900> up<00:03:36.959> the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
five inches back well let me back up the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.290 
five inches back well let me back up the
wing<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.830> we<00:03:38.010> quit<00:03:38.280> record<00:03:38.670> is<00:03:38.820> five<00:03:39.030> inches

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
wing that we quit record is five inches

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.760 
wing that we quit record is five inches
back<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:39.870> then<00:03:40.020> I<00:03:40.110> do<00:03:40.170> all<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.620> computations

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
back so then I do all the computations

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.240 
back so then I do all the computations
and<00:03:41.600> I<00:03:42.600> dipped<00:03:42.840> under<00:03:42.959> seven<00:03:43.350> CG<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.130> gonna

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
and I dipped under seven CG it's gonna

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.729 
and I dipped under seven CG it's gonna
be<00:03:44.430> seven<00:03:44.790> inches<00:03:44.940> back<00:03:45.270> so<00:03:45.989> I'm<00:03:46.200> off<00:03:46.440> by<00:03:46.680> two

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
be seven inches back so I'm off by two

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.610 
be seven inches back so I'm off by two
inches<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.570> say<00:03:48.570> okay<00:03:48.900> well<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.140> gotta<00:03:49.380> push<00:03:49.590> the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
inches so say okay well I gotta push the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.130 
inches so say okay well I gotta push the
wing<00:03:49.860> back<00:03:50.100> now<00:03:50.610> keep<00:03:50.850> in<00:03:51.000> mind<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.390> wing<00:03:51.660> by

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
wing back now keep in mind the wing by

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.380 
wing back now keep in mind the wing by
itself<00:03:52.470> it's<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.280> large<00:03:53.550> portion<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.270> the

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
itself it's a large portion of the

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.720 
itself it's a large portion of the
weight<00:03:54.570> of<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.810> total<00:03:55.140> airplane<00:03:55.530> so<00:03:56.220> it's<00:03:56.340> so

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
weight of the total airplane so it's so

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.790 
weight of the total airplane so it's so
you<00:03:57.300> know<00:03:57.360> in<00:03:57.480> this<00:03:57.570> case<00:03:57.840> you're<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.620> would

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
you know in this case you're you would

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.920 
you know in this case you're you would
be<00:03:58.950> off<00:03:59.070> by<00:03:59.280> two<00:03:59.340> inches<00:03:59.820> but<00:04:00.330> moving<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.750> back

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
be off by two inches but moving it back

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.440 
be off by two inches but moving it back
two<00:04:01.140> instances<00:04:01.590> it's<00:04:01.950> probably<00:04:02.430> too<00:04:02.580> much<00:04:02.760> you

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
two instances it's probably too much you

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.729 
two instances it's probably too much you
know<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.600> might<00:04:03.840> only<00:04:03.989> need<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.320> move<00:04:04.470> back

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
know you might only need to move back

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.470 
know you might only need to move back
moving<00:04:05.160> back<00:04:05.340> like<00:04:05.550> one<00:04:05.790> or<00:04:05.970> one<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.300> half

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
moving back like one or one and a half

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.170 
moving back like one or one and a half
but<00:04:07.470> so<00:04:07.709> but<00:04:07.980> it's<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.250> spreadsheet<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:08.940> that's

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
but so but it's a spreadsheet and that's

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.610 
but so but it's a spreadsheet and that's
the<00:04:09.330> beauty<00:04:09.660> of<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.840> of<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.410> know<00:04:10.500> it's

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
the beauty of it of it you know it's

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.199 
the beauty of it of it you know it's
really<00:04:10.830> easy<00:04:11.070> to<00:04:11.190> change<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.640> number<00:04:12.000> on<00:04:12.120> the

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
really easy to change the number on the

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.630 
really easy to change the number on the
spreadsheet<00:04:12.570> it's<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.290> lot<00:04:13.530> harder<00:04:13.800> to<00:04:14.160> move

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
spreadsheet it's a lot harder to move

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.320 
spreadsheet it's a lot harder to move
the<00:04:14.820> wing

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
the wing

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.580 
the wing
you<00:04:15.450> don't<00:04:15.630> want<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:15.900> build<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.230> airplane

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
you don't want you build the airplane

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.259 
you don't want you build the airplane
and<00:04:16.709> that<00:04:16.769> that's<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.669> whole<00:04:17.820> reason<00:04:17.880> why

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
and that that's the whole reason why

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.390 
and that that's the whole reason why
you're<00:04:18.450> doing<00:04:18.600> this<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.680> change<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.070> number

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
you're doing this so change the number

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.730 
you're doing this so change the number
in<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.609> spreadsheet<00:04:20.940> do<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.080> computation

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
in the spreadsheet do the computation

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.890 
in the spreadsheet do the computation
again<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:24.030> see<00:04:24.360> where<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.840> CG<00:04:25.229> you<00:04:25.500> know

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
again and see where the CG you know

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.840 
again and see where the CG you know
she<00:04:26.020> comes<00:04:26.350> out<00:04:26.530> this<00:04:26.710> time<00:04:26.919> and<00:04:27.729> you're

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
she comes out this time and you're

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.730 
she comes out this time and you're
trying<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.240> get<00:04:28.389> that<00:04:28.540> quote<00:04:28.750> accord<00:04:29.169> and<00:04:29.320> CG

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
trying to get that quote accord and CG

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.550 
trying to get that quote accord and CG
to<00:04:30.070> be<00:04:30.190> in<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.400> same<00:04:30.580> spot<00:04:30.850> so<00:04:31.660> you<00:04:32.229> know<00:04:32.350> so

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
to be in the same spot so you know so

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.320 
to be in the same spot so you know so
you<00:04:32.590> go<00:04:33.130> back<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.460> forth<00:04:33.520> it's<00:04:33.850> not<00:04:34.000> hard<00:04:34.210> to

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
you go back and forth it's not hard to

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.490 
you go back and forth it's not hard to
do<00:04:34.479> the<00:04:35.289> only<00:04:35.440> thing<00:04:35.560> is<00:04:35.979> the<00:04:36.699> body<00:04:37.500> because

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
do the only thing is the body because

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.650 
do the only thing is the body because
normally<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.039> battery<00:04:39.400> it's<00:04:39.699> gonna<00:04:39.940> be<00:04:40.180> Nolan

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
normally the battery it's gonna be Nolan

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.360 
normally the battery it's gonna be Nolan
it's<00:04:40.960> probably<00:04:41.289> not<00:04:41.740> only<00:04:41.919> is<00:04:41.979> it<00:04:42.070> probably

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
it's probably not only is it probably

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.580 
it's probably not only is it probably
the<00:04:42.550> single<00:04:42.910> heaviest<00:04:43.270> component<00:04:43.840> but<00:04:44.440> it's

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
the single heaviest component but it's

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.840 
the single heaviest component but it's
also<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:45.039> one<00:04:45.250> that<00:04:45.280> you're<00:04:45.550> going<00:04:45.699> to<00:04:45.759> be

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
also the one that you're going to be

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.499 
also the one that you're going to be
moving<00:04:46.000> back<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.509> forth<00:04:46.889> to<00:04:47.889> to<00:04:48.610> get<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:49.000> CG

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
moving back and forth to to get the CG

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.779 
moving back and forth to to get the CG
on<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.870> real<00:04:50.110> airplane<00:04:50.380> where<00:04:51.160> you<00:04:51.490> really

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
on the real airplane where you really

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.029 
on the real airplane where you really
want<00:04:52.000> it<00:04:52.120> to<00:04:52.270> be<00:04:52.389> because<00:04:53.139> you<00:04:53.500> know<00:04:53.530> dick<00:04:53.800> this

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
want it to be because you know dick this

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.129 
want it to be because you know dick this
this<00:04:54.520> balance<00:04:54.940> computation<00:04:55.479> your<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:55.990> weight

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
this balance computation your the weight

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:56.760 
this balance computation your the weight
and<00:04:56.350> balance

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
and balance

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.920 
and balance
they're<00:04:57.160> just<00:04:57.310> estimates<00:04:57.820> so<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:58.570> think

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
they're just estimates so you think

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.480 
they're just estimates so you think
you're<00:04:59.139> trying<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.530> be<00:04:59.650> close<00:04:59.919> but<00:05:00.250> you're

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
you're trying to be close but you're

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.250 
you're trying to be close but you're
never<00:05:00.639> gonna<00:05:00.910> be<00:05:01.120> 100%<00:05:01.389> right

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
never gonna be 100% right

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.560 
never gonna be 100% right
so<00:05:02.949> so<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.460> pilot<00:05:03.789> is<00:05:03.910> what<00:05:04.150> you're<00:05:04.300> gonna<00:05:04.419> get

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
so so the pilot is what you're gonna get

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.439 
so so the pilot is what you're gonna get
to<00:05:04.750> move<00:05:04.930> later<00:05:05.410> once<00:05:05.919> you<00:05:06.010> built<00:05:06.250> it<00:05:06.400> to<00:05:07.060> to

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
to move later once you built it to to

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:08.790 
to move later once you built it to to
have<00:05:07.660> everything<00:05:08.110> work<00:05:08.289> out<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:08.650> way<00:05:08.770> that

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
have everything work out the way that

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.779 
have everything work out the way that
you<00:05:09.010> really<00:05:09.280> want<00:05:09.490> so<00:05:10.680> so<00:05:11.680> what<00:05:11.860> I<00:05:11.889> do<00:05:12.039> with<00:05:12.580> my

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
you really want so so what I do with my

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.000 
you really want so so what I do with my
body<00:05:13.030> with<00:05:13.300> my<00:05:13.570> battery<00:05:13.930> in<00:05:14.110> my<00:05:14.139> computation

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
body with my battery in my computation

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.339 
body with my battery in my computation
you<00:05:15.130> say<00:05:15.310> I<00:05:15.550> just<00:05:16.180> assume<00:05:16.630> that<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:17.020> battery

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
you say I just assume that the battery

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.830 
you say I just assume that the battery
was<00:05:18.220> like<00:05:18.430> right<00:05:18.729> in<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:18.910> middle<00:05:19.030> of<00:05:19.539> the

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
was like right in the middle of the

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.650 
was like right in the middle of the
range<00:05:20.139> that<00:05:21.039> it<00:05:21.160> can<00:05:21.310> go<00:05:21.490> you<00:05:22.330> know<00:05:22.419> in<00:05:22.539> this

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
range that it can go you know in this

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.950 
range that it can go you know in this
case<00:05:22.900> you<00:05:23.320> know<00:05:23.410> a<00:05:23.470> cell<00:05:23.680> go<00:05:23.949> between<00:05:24.130> this

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
case you know a cell go between this

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.159 
case you know a cell go between this
system<00:05:25.960> front<00:05:26.500> support<00:05:26.710> and<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:28.630> the<00:05:28.870> leading

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
system front support and and the leading

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.140 
system front support and and the leading
edge<00:05:29.289> of<00:05:29.320> the<00:05:29.530> wing<00:05:29.710> and<00:05:30.400> you<00:05:30.639> know<00:05:30.820> that's<00:05:31.030> a

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
edge of the wing and you know that's a

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.930 
edge of the wing and you know that's a
good<00:05:31.300> like<00:05:31.599> maybe<00:05:31.810> four<00:05:32.169> inches<00:05:32.470> there<00:05:32.910> so<00:05:33.910> I

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
good like maybe four inches there so I

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.270 
good like maybe four inches there so I
just<00:05:34.210> said<00:05:34.449> okay<00:05:34.750> the<00:05:35.139> the<00:05:35.650> center<00:05:36.039> of<00:05:36.190> the

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
just said okay the the center of the

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.909 
just said okay the the center of the
battery<00:05:36.669> is<00:05:36.820> going<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.120> be<00:05:37.240> two<00:05:37.539> inches<00:05:37.919> from

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
battery is going to be two inches from

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.920 
battery is going to be two inches from
the<00:05:39.070> front<00:05:39.130> support<00:05:39.729> you<00:05:40.330> know<00:05:40.419> which<00:05:40.570> puts<00:05:40.810> it

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
the front support you know which puts it

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.750 
the front support you know which puts it
right<00:05:40.960> in<00:05:41.229> the<00:05:41.320> middle<00:05:41.470> of<00:05:41.830> the<00:05:41.979> range<00:05:42.220> that<00:05:42.490> ik

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
right in the middle of the range that ik

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.120 
right in the middle of the range that ik
that<00:05:43.090> I<00:05:43.389> can<00:05:43.570> put<00:05:43.750> it<00:05:43.840> on<00:05:43.990> and<00:05:44.199> I'm<00:05:44.979> just

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
that I can put it on and I'm just

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.310 
that I can put it on and I'm just
playing<00:05:45.430> it<00:05:45.580> safe<00:05:45.760> because<00:05:45.970> I<00:05:46.240> don't<00:05:46.419> know<00:05:46.539> you

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
playing it safe because I don't know you

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.659 
playing it safe because I don't know you
know<00:05:47.440> see<00:05:47.620> airplane<00:05:47.860> gonna<00:05:48.010> come<00:05:48.220> on<00:05:48.340> little

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
know see airplane gonna come on little

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.339 
know see airplane gonna come on little
bit<00:05:48.789> tell<00:05:49.030> heavier<00:05:49.330> a<00:05:49.419> little<00:05:49.690> bit<00:05:49.780> no<00:05:49.930> sabía<00:05:50.260> I

bit tell heavier a little bit no sabía I

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:52.680 
bit tell heavier a little bit no sabía I
really<00:05:50.650> have<00:05:50.800> no<00:05:50.979> idea<00:05:51.120> now<00:05:52.120> you<00:05:52.389> know<00:05:52.630> of

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
really have no idea now you know of

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.620 
really have no idea now you know of
course<00:05:53.370> giving<00:05:54.370> up<00:05:54.490> my<00:05:54.669> previous<00:05:55.060> experience

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
course giving up my previous experience

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.779 
course giving up my previous experience
every<00:05:55.930> place<00:05:56.110> always<00:05:56.560> think<00:05:57.280> to<00:05:57.430> come<00:05:57.610> out<00:05:57.760> a

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
every place always think to come out a

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.360 
every place always think to come out a
little<00:05:58.150> bit<00:05:58.360> too<00:05:58.599> tail-heavy<00:05:59.139> so<00:06:00.130> you<00:06:00.190> may

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
little bit too tail-heavy so you may

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.360 
little bit too tail-heavy so you may
want<00:06:00.580> to<00:06:00.669> I<00:06:01.110> make<00:06:02.110> believe<00:06:02.289> that<00:06:02.470> battery<00:06:03.010> it's

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
want to I make believe that battery it's

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.420 
want to I make believe that battery it's
a<00:06:03.520> little<00:06:03.789> bit<00:06:03.940> further<00:06:04.690> back<00:06:05.280> because<00:06:06.280> then

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
a little bit further back because then

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.879 
a little bit further back because then
that<00:06:06.789> will<00:06:06.970> give<00:06:07.180> you<00:06:07.300> more<00:06:07.530> Headroom<00:06:08.530> to<00:06:08.740> move

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
that will give you more Headroom to move

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:11.399 
that will give you more Headroom to move
it<00:06:09.010> forward<00:06:09.720> hope<00:06:10.720> that<00:06:10.930> makes<00:06:11.050> sense

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:11.409 
it forward hope that makes sense

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.480 
it forward hope that makes sense
so<00:06:12.599> but<00:06:13.599> that's<00:06:13.780> it<00:06:13.930> you<00:06:13.960> know<00:06:14.229> just<00:06:14.260> just<00:06:14.830> make

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
so but that's it you know just just make

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.279 
so but that's it you know just just make
believe<00:06:15.669> you<00:06:16.150> know<00:06:16.270> it's<00:06:16.419> their<00:06:16.720> enemies<00:06:17.110> or

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
believe you know it's their enemies or

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.950 
believe you know it's their enemies or
maybe<00:06:17.590> a<00:06:17.680> little<00:06:17.830> bit<00:06:18.039> further<00:06:18.220> back<00:06:18.490> I<00:06:18.960> mean

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
maybe a little bit further back I mean

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.210 
maybe a little bit further back I mean
with<00:06:20.110> the<00:06:20.199> wing<00:06:20.380> you<00:06:20.409> need<00:06:20.710> to<00:06:20.830> play<00:06:21.010> with<00:06:21.159> the

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
with the wing you need to play with the

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.060 
with the wing you need to play with the
numbers<00:06:21.610> for<00:06:22.300> them<00:06:22.419> to<00:06:22.539> come<00:06:22.690> out<00:06:22.780> right<00:06:23.070> so

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
numbers for them to come out right so

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.550 
numbers for them to come out right so
it's<00:06:24.220> a<00:06:24.310> little<00:06:24.340> bit<00:06:24.669> of<00:06:24.760> a<00:06:24.820> formula<00:06:25.300> I<00:06:25.560> you

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
it's a little bit of a formula I you

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.930 
it's a little bit of a formula I you
know<00:06:26.650> I'm<00:06:26.710> gonna<00:06:26.860> run<00:06:27.159> to<00:06:27.190> the<00:06:27.340> right<00:06:27.490> now<00:06:27.699> but

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
know I'm gonna run to the right now but

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.010 
know I'm gonna run to the right now but
it's<00:06:28.090> easy<00:06:28.240> to<00:06:28.510> just<00:06:28.690> look<00:06:28.810> at<00:06:28.930> this

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
it's easy to just look at this

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.779 
it's easy to just look at this
spreadsheet<00:06:29.349> but<00:06:30.039> then<00:06:30.159> but<00:06:30.520> then<00:06:30.550> what

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
spreadsheet but then but then what

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:32.250 
spreadsheet but then but then what
you're<00:06:30.909> doing<00:06:30.940> so<00:06:31.330> you're<00:06:31.479> multiplying<00:06:31.630> the

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260 
you're doing so you're multiplying the

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.409 
you're doing so you're multiplying the
weight<00:06:32.530> of<00:06:32.710> each<00:06:32.830> component<00:06:33.270> but<00:06:34.270> that

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
weight of each component but that

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:37.170 
weight of each component but that
distance<00:06:34.960> to<00:06:35.320> the<00:06:35.440> datum<00:06:35.770> line<00:06:35.979> so<00:06:36.909> that's<00:06:37.029> a

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
distance to the datum line so that's a

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.280 
distance to the datum line so that's a
problem<00:06:37.419> when<00:06:37.960> you<00:06:38.080> do

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
problem when you do

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.780 
problem when you do
or<00:06:38.350> you<00:06:38.590> know<00:06:38.680> multiply<00:06:39.130> those<00:06:39.370> all<00:06:39.610> those

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
or you know multiply those all those

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.650 
or you know multiply those all those
numbers<00:06:40.180> then<00:06:40.840> you<00:06:40.870> add<00:06:41.200> up<00:06:41.760> the<00:06:42.760> product<00:06:43.480> and

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
numbers then you add up the product and

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.870 
numbers then you add up the product and
you<00:06:44.260> need<00:06:44.410> to<00:06:44.560> divide<00:06:44.950> it<00:06:45.190> by<00:06:45.700> the<00:06:45.760> total

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
you need to divide it by the total

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.540 
you need to divide it by the total
weight<00:06:46.480> of<00:06:46.510> the<00:06:46.660> airplane<00:06:47.190> and<00:06:48.190> that<00:06:48.400> will

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
weight of the airplane and that will

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.340 
weight of the airplane and that will
give<00:06:48.820> you<00:06:49.030> the<00:06:49.360> distance<00:06:50.640> to<00:06:51.640> to<00:06:52.540> the<00:06:52.690> to<00:06:53.230> the

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
give you the distance to to the to the

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.280 
give you the distance to to the to the
datum<00:06:53.710> line<00:06:54.480> between<00:06:55.480> the<00:06:55.690> city<00:06:55.960> and<00:06:56.110> the

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.290 
datum line between the city and the

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.890 
datum line between the city and the
datum<00:06:56.650> line<00:06:56.830> and<00:06:57.220> again<00:06:58.000> you<00:06:58.240> know<00:06:58.330> that<00:06:58.360> might

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900 
datum line and again you know that might

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.450 
datum line and again you know that might
be<00:06:58.930> an<00:06:59.110> inch<00:06:59.320> in<00:06:59.500> front<00:06:59.650> of<00:06:59.830> the<00:06:59.920> airplane<00:07:00.190> so

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.460 
be an inch in front of the airplane so

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.950 
be an inch in front of the airplane so
then<00:07:00.580> you<00:07:00.700> need<00:07:00.850> to<00:07:00.970> kind<00:07:01.240> of<00:07:01.330> work<00:07:01.570> your<00:07:01.870> way

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
then you need to kind of work your way

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.770 
then you need to kind of work your way
back<00:07:02.230> to<00:07:02.920> say<00:07:03.100> okay<00:07:03.400> that's<00:07:04.030> the<00:07:04.180> distance<00:07:04.570> to

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
back to say okay that's the distance to

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.930 
back to say okay that's the distance to
the<00:07:04.900> firewall<00:07:05.320> and<00:07:05.770> then<00:07:06.370> you<00:07:06.520> need<00:07:06.640> to<00:07:06.760> you

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
the firewall and then you need to you

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.280 
the firewall and then you need to you
know<00:07:07.000> take<00:07:07.060> out<00:07:07.420> a<00:07:07.450> little<00:07:07.630> bit<00:07:07.870> from<00:07:07.960> the<00:07:08.110> wing

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.290 
know take out a little bit from the wing

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.810 
know take out a little bit from the wing
and<00:07:08.560> you<00:07:08.620> say<00:07:08.860> okay<00:07:09.040> that's<00:07:09.190> the<00:07:09.310> distance<00:07:09.670> we

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
and you say okay that's the distance we

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.550 
and you say okay that's the distance we
did<00:07:09.970> the<00:07:10.060> firewall<00:07:10.540> and<00:07:10.750> then<00:07:11.020> leaving<00:07:11.200> it<00:07:11.380> to

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 
did the firewall and then leaving it to

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.370 
did the firewall and then leaving it to
the<00:07:11.590> wing<00:07:11.830> so<00:07:12.840> it's<00:07:13.840> a<00:07:13.960> little<00:07:14.170> bit<00:07:14.290> of

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:14.380 
the wing so it's a little bit of

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.260 
the wing so it's a little bit of
computation<00:07:14.620> just<00:07:15.280> use<00:07:15.460> my<00:07:15.640> spreadsheet<00:07:16.120> as

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
computation just use my spreadsheet as

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.660 
computation just use my spreadsheet as
an<00:07:16.390> example<00:07:16.750> just<00:07:17.470> plug<00:07:17.710> in<00:07:17.830> your<00:07:17.950> numbers<00:07:18.280> in

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:18.670 
an example just plug in your numbers in

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.040 
an example just plug in your numbers in
there<00:07:18.820> that's<00:07:19.060> that's<00:07:19.330> easy<00:07:19.660> enough

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050 
there that's that's easy enough

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.820 
there that's that's easy enough
and<00:07:21.010> now<00:07:21.310> you<00:07:22.090> know<00:07:22.210> I<00:07:22.450> in<00:07:23.020> the<00:07:23.140> case<00:07:23.350> of<00:07:23.530> pivot

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:23.830 
and now you know I in the case of pivot

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.770 
and now you know I in the case of pivot
to<00:07:23.950> the<00:07:24.100> 3d<00:07:24.610> I<00:07:24.640> think<00:07:24.910> it<00:07:25.000> was<00:07:25.090> well<00:07:25.270> worth<00:07:25.510> to

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:25.780 
to the 3d I think it was well worth to

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.470 
to the 3d I think it was well worth to
do<00:07:25.900> the<00:07:26.050> balanced<00:07:26.380> computation<00:07:27.070> and<00:07:27.330> but<00:07:28.330> it's

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:28.480 
do the balanced computation and but it's

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.510 
do the balanced computation and but it's
really<00:07:28.630> up<00:07:28.870> to<00:07:28.900> you<00:07:29.140> you<00:07:29.440> know<00:07:29.560> try<00:07:29.770> it<00:07:29.890> out<00:07:30.130> see

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 
really up to you you know try it out see

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.060 
really up to you you know try it out see
how<00:07:30.670> you<00:07:30.730> like<00:07:31.000> it<00:07:31.030> and<00:07:31.480> see<00:07:32.050> how<00:07:32.230> how<00:07:32.620> accurate

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.070 
how you like it and see how how accurate

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.610 
how you like it and see how how accurate
you<00:07:33.190> are<00:07:33.400> and<00:07:33.670> you<00:07:34.630> know<00:07:34.720> let<00:07:35.260> me<00:07:35.350> know<00:07:35.470> how<00:07:35.560> you

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:35.620 
you are and you know let me know how you

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.820 
you are and you know let me know how you
like<00:07:35.830> it<00:07:35.860> so<00:07:35.980> till<00:07:36.490> next<00:07:36.610> time
