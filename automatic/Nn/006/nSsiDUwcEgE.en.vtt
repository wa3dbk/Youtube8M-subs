week of pronation specifically looking
at<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.590> in<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.920> serve<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.690> today<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.719> think<00:00:12.900> I'm

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
at it in the serve and today I think I'm

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.690 
at it in the serve and today I think I'm
going<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.380> blow<00:00:13.620> your<00:00:13.799> guys<00:00:13.980> minds<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.610> little

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
going to blow your guys minds a little

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.279 
going to blow your guys minds a little
bit<00:00:15.000> because<00:00:15.389> we're<00:00:15.809> talking<00:00:16.049> about

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
bit because we're talking about

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.120 
bit because we're talking about
pronation<00:00:17.010> on<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.580> slice<00:00:18.150> serve<00:00:18.859> for<00:00:19.859> any<00:00:19.980> of

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
pronation on a slice serve for any of

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.820 
pronation on a slice serve for any of
you<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.460> saw<00:00:20.820> our<00:00:21.150> video<00:00:21.689> from<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.800> believe

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
you that saw our video from I believe

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.130 
you that saw our video from I believe
two<00:00:23.430> weeks<00:00:23.699> ago<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.180> was<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> slice<00:00:24.810> serve

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
two weeks ago it was a slice serve

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.160 
two weeks ago it was a slice serve
progression<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:27.210> was<00:00:27.359> geared<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.779> little

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
progression and that was geared a little

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.500 
progression and that was geared a little
more<00:00:28.349> towards<00:00:28.949> people<00:00:29.580> learning<00:00:29.910> how<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.269> hit

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
more towards people learning how to hit

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.069 
more towards people learning how to hit
a<00:00:30.539> slice<00:00:31.160> so<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.489> idea<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.210> really<00:00:33.809> get

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
a slice so the idea was to really get

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.459 
a slice so the idea was to really get
you<00:00:34.680> know<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.950> strings<00:00:35.370> moving<00:00:36.170> around<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
you know the strings moving around the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.049 
you know the strings moving around the
side<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.010> tennis<00:00:38.340> ball<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:38.820> didn't

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
side of the tennis ball and we didn't

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.709 
side of the tennis ball and we didn't
delve<00:00:39.270> into<00:00:39.770> you<00:00:40.770> know<00:00:40.890> creating<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.730> tour

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
delve into you know creating this tour

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.590 
delve into you know creating this tour
level<00:00:43.230> slice<00:00:43.590> serve<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:45.000> if<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.210> guys<00:00:45.360> are

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
level slice serve so if you guys are

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.069 
level slice serve so if you guys are
just<00:00:45.660> now<00:00:46.110> working<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.860> getting<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.340> slice<00:00:48.079> this

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
just now working on getting a slice this

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.830 
just now working on getting a slice this
video<00:00:49.440> might<00:00:49.739> be<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.950> little<00:00:50.129> advanced<00:00:50.840> but

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
video might be a little advanced but

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.750 
video might be a little advanced but
where<00:00:52.289> we're<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.620> now<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.949> guys<00:00:53.309> with<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
where we're at now you guys with the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.060 
where we're at now you guys with the
slice<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.260> know<00:00:55.379> if<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:55.590> look<00:00:55.770> at<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
slice is that you know if we look at the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.360 
slice is that you know if we look at the
pros<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.579> tour<00:00:57.230> they're<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.410> serving<00:00:59.190> their

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
pros on tour they're not serving their

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.759 
pros on tour they're not serving their
slice<00:00:59.730> serve<00:01:01.460> with<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.969> spin<00:01:03.470> okay<00:01:04.470> because

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
slice serve with just spin okay because

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.250 
slice serve with just spin okay because
the<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.760> bounce<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.210> predictable<00:01:06.930> for<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the the bounce is predictable for the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.710 
the the bounce is predictable for the
returner<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.010> there's<00:01:08.700> just<00:01:08.970> no<00:01:09.150> power<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
returner and there's just no power and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.230 
returner and there's just no power and
the<00:01:09.810> reason<00:01:10.049> pronation<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.549> key<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:11.880> it's

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
the reason pronation is so key and it's

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.240 
the reason pronation is so key and it's
key<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.869> slice<00:01:13.229> serve<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:13.680> well<00:01:13.890> is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
key on this slice serve as well is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.020 
key on this slice serve as well is
because<00:01:15.090> pronation<00:01:15.780> provides<00:01:16.470> power<00:01:17.030> alright

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
because pronation provides power alright

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.920 
because pronation provides power alright
so<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.990> looked<00:01:19.470> at<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:19.979> any<00:01:20.280> pro<00:01:20.970> hitting<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
so if you looked at at any pro hitting a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.800 
so if you looked at at any pro hitting a
you<00:01:22.530> know<00:01:22.650> first<00:01:23.100> serves<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.880> was<00:01:24.119> hit<00:01:24.630> with

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you know first serves that was hit with

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.580 
you know first serves that was hit with
slice<00:01:25.170> or<00:01:25.590> even<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.580> big<00:01:26.850> second<00:01:27.420> serve<00:01:27.659> you're

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
slice or even a big second serve you're

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.700 
slice or even a big second serve you're
going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.979> see<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.340> strings<00:01:29.869> inevitably<00:01:30.869> even

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
going to see the strings inevitably even

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.679 
going to see the strings inevitably even
though<00:01:31.890> there's<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.759> know<00:01:32.850> spin<00:01:33.360> being

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
though there's you know spin being

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.109 
though there's you know spin being
created<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> outside<00:01:35.280> part<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> ball

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
created on the outside part of the ball

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.140 
created on the outside part of the ball
you're<00:01:37.079> still<00:01:37.439> inevitably<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.610> see<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
you're still inevitably going to see the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.810 
you're still inevitably going to see the
pros<00:01:40.009> turning<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.189> hand<00:01:42.320> downward<00:01:43.520> okay<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
pros turning that hand downward okay and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.660 
pros turning that hand downward okay and
that's<00:01:45.149> something<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.899> think<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:47.100> hard

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
that's something that I think is is hard

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.580 
that's something that I think is is hard
for<00:01:48.000> club<00:01:48.270> level<00:01:48.600> players<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.140> wrap<00:01:49.350> their

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
for club level players to wrap their

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.010 
for club level players to wrap their
head<00:01:49.770> around<00:01:49.880> because<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.540> thought<00:01:51.780> is

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
head around because the thought is

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.260 
head around because the thought is
alright<00:01:52.409> well<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.829> pronate<00:01:53.369> my<00:01:53.579> wrist<00:01:53.939> and

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
alright well if I pronate my wrist and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.560 
alright well if I pronate my wrist and
my<00:01:54.329> forearm<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.350> turn<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> strings<00:01:56.070> down

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
my forearm and I turn the strings down

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.910 
my forearm and I turn the strings down
how<00:01:57.570> am<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.049> hit<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.439> ball<00:01:58.680> with

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
how am I going to hit that ball with

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.149 
how am I going to hit that ball with
slice<00:01:59.600> and<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.810> key<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.590> slice<00:02:01.920> is

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
slice and the key is that the slice is

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.889 
slice and the key is that the slice is
going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.369> be<00:02:02.490> hit<00:02:02.729> first<00:02:03.060> okay

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
going to be hit first okay

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.920 
going to be hit first okay
I'm<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.560> get<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.009> ball<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.930> create

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
I'm going to get to the ball and create

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.160 
I'm going to get to the ball and create
the<00:02:07.200> spin<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.979> then<00:02:08.849> after<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> feel<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.959> ball

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the spin and then after I feel the ball

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.339 
the spin and then after I feel the ball
on<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.500> strings<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.220> really<00:02:11.970> when<00:02:12.239> I'm<00:02:13.140> going

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
on the strings is really when I'm going

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.790 
on the strings is really when I'm going
to<00:02:13.440> start

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
to start

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.010 
to start
to<00:02:13.980> start<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:15.000> feel<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.210> hand<00:02:15.690> turn

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
to start to feel that hand turn

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.470 
to start to feel that hand turn
downwards<00:02:16.680> okay<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.970> let's<00:02:18.180> go<00:02:18.270> ahead<00:02:18.300> and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
downwards okay so let's go ahead and

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.210 
downwards okay so let's go ahead and
take<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> look<00:02:19.020> at<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.200> few<00:02:19.440> serves<00:02:19.770> here<00:02:20.070> these

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
take a look at a few serves here these

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.430 
take a look at a few serves here these
are<00:02:20.400> these<00:02:20.670> are<00:02:20.820> kind<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.090> my<00:02:21.240> hard<00:02:21.630> slice

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
are these are kind of my hard slice

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.920 
are these are kind of my hard slice
serves<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.040> again<00:02:23.300> pronation<00:02:24.300> provides

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
serves and again pronation provides

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.190 
serves and again pronation provides
power<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.770> I'm<00:02:25.920> feeling<00:02:26.250> like<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:27.780> know<00:02:27.870> I'm

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
power so I'm feeling like you know I'm

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.690 
power so I'm feeling like you know I'm
going<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.470> I'm<00:02:28.860> going<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.100> hit<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:29.340> slice

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
going to I'm going to hit this slice

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.700 
going to I'm going to hit this slice
basically<00:02:30.240> about<00:02:30.480> as<00:02:30.660> big<00:02:30.900> as<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.170> can<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.620> you

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
basically about as big as I can and you

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.560 
basically about as big as I can and you
guys<00:02:31.890> watch<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.460> rest<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.910> think<00:02:32.940> you'll<00:02:33.270> see

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
guys watch the rest I think you'll see

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.530 
guys watch the rest I think you'll see
it's<00:02:34.350> not<00:02:34.620> me<00:02:34.950> just<00:02:34.980> cutting<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.030> side<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
it's not me just cutting the side of the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:48.350 
it's not me just cutting the side of the
ball<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.750> leaving<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.410> strings<00:02:37.770> out<00:02:37.980> there

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:03:01.820 

you

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:10.059 

see<00:03:02.830> that<00:03:02.980> again

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.339 

okay<00:03:11.060> so<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:12.650> see<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:13.069> action<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:14.569> is<00:03:14.840> that

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
okay so you see that action that is that

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.039 
okay so you see that action that is that
is<00:03:15.560> something<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.099> you<00:03:16.430> guys<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:16.939> takes<00:03:17.629> a

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
is something that you guys it takes a

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.050 
is something that you guys it takes a
lot<00:03:18.709> of<00:03:18.739> feel<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:20.049> almost<00:03:21.049> just<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.250> lot<00:03:23.030> of

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
lot of feel and almost just a lot of

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.380 
lot of feel and almost just a lot of
practice<00:03:23.359> obviously<00:03:24.310> to<00:03:25.310> go<00:03:25.489> ahead<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.000> and

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
practice obviously to go ahead and and

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.839 
practice obviously to go ahead and and
change<00:03:26.840> that<00:03:27.079> slice<00:03:27.560> from<00:03:27.920> just<00:03:28.280> being<00:03:28.519> all

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
change that slice from just being all

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.039 
change that slice from just being all
spin<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:30.019> providing<00:03:30.620> pace<00:03:31.180> what<00:03:32.180> I<00:03:32.209> would<00:03:32.569> say

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
spin to providing pace what I would say

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.750 
spin to providing pace what I would say
is<00:03:34.040> make<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.849> practice<00:03:35.120> more<00:03:35.750> just<00:03:36.200> about<00:03:36.760> you

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
is make the practice more just about you

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.059 
is make the practice more just about you
know<00:03:37.790> trying<00:03:38.599> to<00:03:38.689> pick<00:03:38.959> up<00:03:39.170> pace<00:03:39.500> it's<00:03:39.769> pretty

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
know trying to pick up pace it's pretty

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.160 
know trying to pick up pace it's pretty
tough<00:03:40.400> to<00:03:40.459> be<00:03:40.790> in<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:41.030> middle<00:03:41.389> of<00:03:41.540> your<00:03:41.689> swing

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
tough to be in the middle of your swing

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.679 
tough to be in the middle of your swing
going<00:03:43.040> up<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.459> hit<00:03:43.609> a<00:03:43.639> slice<00:03:44.000> serve<00:03:44.299> and<00:03:44.510> saying

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
going up to hit a slice serve and saying

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.199 
going up to hit a slice serve and saying
okay<00:03:44.930> now<00:03:45.769> do<00:03:45.829> I<00:03:46.010> start<00:03:46.370> turning<00:03:46.549> my<00:03:46.790> hand<00:03:47.090> out

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
okay now do I start turning my hand out

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.809 
okay now do I start turning my hand out
it's<00:03:47.450> almost<00:03:47.599> a<00:03:47.840> little<00:03:47.870> too<00:03:48.260> technical<00:03:48.639> so<00:03:49.639> go

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
it's almost a little too technical so go

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.000 
it's almost a little too technical so go
out<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.030> try<00:03:50.569> to<00:03:50.599> just<00:03:50.930> start<00:03:51.230> hitting<00:03:51.500> slice

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
out and try to just start hitting slice

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.220 
out and try to just start hitting slice
serves<00:03:52.370> bigger<00:03:52.970> than<00:03:53.299> you<00:03:53.419> ever<00:03:53.599> have<00:03:53.930> before

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
serves bigger than you ever have before

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.890 
serves bigger than you ever have before
and<00:03:54.739> I<00:03:55.400> think<00:03:55.730> in<00:03:55.849> the<00:03:55.939> attempt<00:03:56.359> to<00:03:56.540> get<00:03:56.720> more

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
and I think in the attempt to get more

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.460 
and I think in the attempt to get more
power

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
power

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.800 
power
your<00:03:58.099> body's<00:03:58.519> naturally<00:03:59.150> going<00:03:59.269> to<00:03:59.329> find<00:03:59.659> a

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
your body's naturally going to find a

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.770 
your body's naturally going to find a
way<00:04:00.019> to<00:04:00.079> start<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:01.310> know<00:04:01.430> turning<00:04:02.389> the<00:04:02.510> hand

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
way to start you know turning the hand

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.599 
way to start you know turning the hand
down<00:04:02.989> which<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.500> pronation<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.370> and

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
down which is pronation and and

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.699 
down which is pronation and and
ultimately<00:04:04.790> that<00:04:05.480> that<00:04:05.840> extra<00:04:06.200> pop<00:04:06.439> that

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
ultimately that that extra pop that

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.369 
ultimately that that extra pop that
