and white too I was just pretty awesome
uh<00:06:36.180> chances<00:06:37.050> are<00:06:37.260> the<00:06:37.440> effects<00:06:37.800> like<00:06:38.340> this<00:06:38.610> if

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
uh chances are the effects like this if

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.470 
uh chances are the effects like this if
the<00:06:39.150> storyline<00:06:39.539> is<00:06:39.690> like<00:06:39.840> a<00:06:39.870> directions

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480 
the storyline is like a directions

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.870 
the storyline is like a directions
you<00:06:40.510> Asian<00:06:40.840> of<00:06:40.900> the<00:06:41.020> of<00:06:41.470> the<00:06:42.310> storyline<00:06:42.790> from

you Asian of the of the storyline from
black<00:06:43.150> and<00:06:43.180> white<00:06:43.360> is<00:06:43.570> probably<00:06:43.840> a<00:06:43.960> mess<00:06:44.230> with

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410
