the<00:00:35.969> map<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.480> well<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:38.370> second<00:00:38.730> one<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.120> thought

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
the map as well the second one I thought

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.000 
the map as well the second one I thought
I'd<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:39.840> throw<00:00:39.960> into<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.440> video<00:00:40.770> as<00:00:40.980> well

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
I'd just throw into this video as well

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.040 
I'd just throw into this video as well
instead<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.850> making<00:00:42.149> two<00:00:42.360> separate<00:00:42.719> videos

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
instead of making two separate videos

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.240 
instead of making two separate videos
because<00:00:43.440> that'll<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> little<00:00:44.129> bit

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
because that'll be a little bit

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.860 
because that'll be a little bit
confusing<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.239> don't<00:00:45.420> know<00:00:45.510> if<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.719> already

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
confusing you don't know if you already

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.340 
confusing you don't know if you already
saw<00:00:46.230> both<00:00:46.739> wall<00:00:47.010> breaches<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.809> don't<00:00:49.289> know

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
saw both wall breaches but I don't know

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.319 
saw both wall breaches but I don't know
I<00:00:49.379> thought<00:00:49.620> I'd<00:00:49.800> make<00:00:50.550> things<00:00:50.820> simpler<00:00:51.120> and

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
I thought I'd make things simpler and

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.600 
I thought I'd make things simpler and
just<00:00:51.449> throw<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.629> into<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.399> now<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.579> I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
just throw it into one and now that I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.119 
just throw it into one and now that I
got<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.879> chance<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.329> did<00:00:54.629> end<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:55.140> posting<00:00:55.379> that

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
got the chance I did end up posting that

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.939 
got the chance I did end up posting that
