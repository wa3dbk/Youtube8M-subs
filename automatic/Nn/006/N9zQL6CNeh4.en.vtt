you<00:02:23.030> can<00:02:23.210> see<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.630> field<00:02:23.870> today<00:02:24.760> where

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
you can see on the field today where

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.870 
you can see on the field today where
that<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.210> evolved<00:02:26.990> and<00:02:27.280> even<00:02:28.280> in<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.580> early

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
that is evolved and even in the early

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.260 
that is evolved and even in the early
stages<00:02:29.470> they<00:02:30.470> demonstrated<00:02:31.280> an<00:02:31.670> enormous

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
stages they demonstrated an enormous

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.820

took<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.430> quite<00:02:37.700> well<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.920> relationship

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
took to it quite well the relationship

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.160 
took to it quite well the relationship
that<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.180> we<00:02:41.870> had<00:02:42.140> was<00:02:42.410> that<00:02:42.790> they<00:02:43.790> knew<00:02:44.030> that

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
that I we had was that they knew that

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.930 
that I we had was that they knew that
the<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.740> we<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.280> coaches<00:02:46.640> were<00:02:46.790> the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
the that we the coaches were the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.800 
the that we the coaches were the
disciplinarian<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:48.610> but<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:50.330> one<00:02:50.570> thing

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
disciplinarian and but the one thing

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.050 
disciplinarian and but the one thing
that<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:51.080> think<00:02:51.230> was<00:02:51.440> key<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:52.040> success<00:02:52.790> with

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
that I think was key to the success with

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.390 
that I think was key to the success with
girls<00:02:53.420> soccer<00:02:53.660> girls<00:02:54.620> athletics<00:02:55.160> for<00:02:55.280> that

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
girls soccer girls athletics for that

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.180 
girls soccer girls athletics for that
matter<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.360> they<00:02:57.290> need<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.860> know<00:02:58.130> you

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
matter is that they need to know you

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.970 
matter is that they need to know you
care<00:02:58.850> about<00:02:58.880> him<00:02:59.150> as<00:02:59.300> a<00:02:59.330> person<00:02:59.920> if<00:03:00.920> they

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
care about him as a person if they

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.550 
care about him as a person if they
believe<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:01.820> they'll<00:03:02.780> do<00:03:02.990> these<00:03:03.230> things

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
believe that they'll do these things

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.650 
believe that they'll do these things
that<00:03:03.800> are<00:03:03.920> that<00:03:04.220> are<00:03:04.660> extraordinarily

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
that are that are extraordinarily

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.880 
that are that are extraordinarily
difficult<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.950> do<00:03:07.489> in<00:03:07.700> terms<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:08.060> fitness<00:03:08.540> and

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
work ethic and what it takes to be

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.720 
work ethic and what it takes to be
successful<00:03:11.840> not<00:03:12.709> only<00:03:12.769> in<00:03:13.040> soccer<00:03:13.280> but<00:03:13.580> in

that they've accomplished and are

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.430

had other reasons why they chose not to
so<00:04:08.319> I<00:04:09.250> take<00:04:10.180> away<00:04:10.360> a<00:04:10.510> great<00:04:10.900> deal<00:04:11.170> of<00:04:13.890> positive

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
so I take away a great deal of positive

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.370 
so I take away a great deal of positive
feelings<00:04:15.489> for<00:04:15.940> what<00:04:16.419> they've<00:04:16.690> accomplished

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
feelings for what they've accomplished

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.129 
feelings for what they've accomplished
and<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.250> what<00:04:18.459> they<00:04:18.609> did<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:19.299> what<00:04:19.450> I<00:04:19.810> think

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
and and what they did and what I think

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.700 
and and what they did and what I think
they<00:04:20.850> truly<00:04:21.850> were<00:04:22.000> instrumental<00:04:22.750> in<00:04:23.070> growing

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
they truly were instrumental in growing

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.100 
they truly were instrumental in growing
significantly<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:27.130> what<00:04:27.400> soccer<00:04:28.030> is<00:04:28.180> refer

significantly to what soccer is refer
girls<00:04:29.380> today<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:30.240> think<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.330> teacher<00:04:31.570> has

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
girls today I think the teacher has

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.800 
girls today I think the teacher has
learned<00:04:32.290> to<00:04:32.440> respect<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:33.070> pupil<00:04:33.550> probably<00:04:34.180> as

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
learned to respect the pupil probably as
