00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.119
What does it mean to be comfortable in the water? Well, first of all,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.619
It's entirely natural not to be comfortable in the water. I mean humans are not

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.949
aquatic creatures. Virtually everyone's first experience with swimming is a near-death experience. They're worried that they're going to drown,

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:33.550
um, and

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.380
drowning really comes because you sink and you can't come back up.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.230
No swimmer is comfortable in the water, it doesn't matter if they're a non-swimmer or if they're a great swimmer.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.950
They do have to to learn body position. They're fighting for survival in the water.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.630
I think a lot of people tend to panic when they get in the water and start to swim. The biggest key is to relax.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.730
Because if you can relax you can manipulate the water better.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.410
The first thing to do to get somebody comfortable is to teach them how to float effortlessly.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.169
How to basically have the feeling of that they can just lay there and do nothing and have the water support them.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.680
People when they swim they're swimming

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.919
according to their instincts and their instincts are sort of to flail, to move the arms and legs pretty quickly.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.759
And the disadvantage of that is that water's a fluid, and and because it's a fluid it has certain properties,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.080
and anything you do in the water that's not fluent, anything that's rough or rushed or flailing is a huge disadvantage.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.009
What matters most in swimming is to be balanced first, to be slippery second, and

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.020
third to not disturb the water, to not create turbulence when you swim. And you have to really mindfully, really patiently,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.759
imprint the movements that make you more fluent and economical in the water.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.649
I swim now for an aerobic capacity. I don't swim to sprint or anything like that

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.650
I did in my Olympic days, and I swim because I like to stay in shape.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.249
Swimming in general is just a great sport for me.

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.459
There's relatively low injury risk.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.910
Low impact, or, I think running you end up having problems sooner or later in your life as far as injuries go.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.830
And not all runners,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.269
but certainly it is a higher risk of injury and long-term injuries.

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.359
Whereas swimming there, isn't there isn't that problem. You don't have any risk really of injury.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.000
People who have diseases, whether it's arthritis, or diabetes, or

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.389
injuries, even athletes with injuries.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.819
Everybody can swim and it's a way to keep your body fully supported and in motion, so it's good for

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.570
everybody.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.180
Once you reach your middle years, weightless exercises is more,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.290
is more helpful for you than exercise that might be hard on your joints.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.220
Rhythmic exercise is good, fluent exercise is good. Most important, I think, is exercise you enjoy.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.039
Something that feels good to your body because if, if that's the case, you'll do it.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.409
I'm more and more convinced that

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:05.329
the biggest value swimming is not simply aerobic but, but when swimming is practiced with the same mindful spirit of Tai-chi,

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.079
let's say, or yoga, and there, there are great holistic benefits to doing that sort of thing.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.280
It's, it's good for your body, but it's also good for your psyche at the same time.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.210
The more you swim with awareness,

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.849
the better your chances of always feeling good, every stroke you take, at always feeling good. And

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.899
And over the course of your entire life getting better, and better, and better.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.620
There's no reason why someone seventy years old can't still learn a whole lot about being comfortable and

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.130
fluent and simply beautiful in the water. And just to go through that process where you're able to do

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.560
one simple step at a time,

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.410
understand the things that are causing you to feel uncomfortable,

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.679
learn the mechanisms that allow you to be comfortable,

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:03.149
tweak those until you are yet more comfortable and just be able to do it at your own pace, in a patient way.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.620
That's it's it's valuable for any human trying to be a fish.
