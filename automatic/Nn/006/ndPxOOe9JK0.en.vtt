00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.150
 hello everyone we meet loads 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.220
 castillejo in room number 305 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.200
 diagonal silken hotel 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.120
 and all about and how to make debut 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.890
 the marathon of barcelona and see the 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.690
 last impressions and that tells us 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.990
 Carlos about his expectations before the 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.990
 test 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.850
 we have already talked about rhythms we have not 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:35.440
 It was clear enough for the room 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.730
 where it was but good now that 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.140
 we have for example here beside the 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.140
 kilometer 28 and a half 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.980
 what it is expected to reach expectations 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.210
 up to this kilometric point tomorrow by 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.060
 example but you arrive you do not get here I 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:55.970
 I've been going many many days that good 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:59.280
 since you get to 21 to 30 or just good 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.840
 it's one thing I want to clarify that a lot 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.650
 people ask me if they will get there is not going to 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.160
 arrive 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:12.240
 I will not arrive for sure that is still 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.610
 calculated for pickup and I'm about 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.720
 to the finish line 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.630
 What I do have to say is that no 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.300
 I will reach the goal running and that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.040
 I'll stop when we get in, hopefully 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.780
 I could get here not because I'm at 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.580
 side of the hotel would be because I could 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.660
 stop closer the goal and this already 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.030
 It would be important to tell us something else with 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.400
 discounts on this afternoon to it seems 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.050
 relaxed but good you already know that the sale 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.050
 begins to get into situation 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.050
 to think more we are already waiting 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.300
 of going to the technical meeting to see what 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.610
 they tell us to see what surprises we 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.770
 they have saved for tomorrow not us 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.020
 we can complain the weather is going to 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.960
 respect will do something written in the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.150
 air 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.560
 a priori it does not rain down to the ground 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.960
 tiny wet but from here to tomorrow 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.610
 dry 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.340
 the free will meet perfectly 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.190
 would miss more because if they win save you 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.260
 do not go back to your house and good to see me 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.230
 I hope to get to this point here 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.740
 still behind the kenyata that is pulling 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.310
 and go to a crazy cool from the 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.140
 30 then pour the rice to that paella that 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.510
 has been cooking for 30 kilometers 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.200
 and see how it is doing 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.440
 and see what happens if we pass the rice or 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.910
 we are at the perfect point because many 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.820
 thank you and well let's take advantage of that 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.430
 we have shorter interview power and 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.200
 let's go to last one last since 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.030
 send a message of encouragement for all the 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.350
 people that go according to the marathon of 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.300
 barcelona especially those that 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.330
 they debutan tomorrow and face their 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.680
 first marathon 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.740
 when you faced the first one 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.080
 keeps a great memory and will explain 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.510
 what do you think the marathÃ³n the first 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.300
 marathon that runs is the prettiest 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.010
 because you are never going to forget the problem 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.290
 with him it's special because it 's something 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.200
 unknown is something that is afraid 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.930
 you have respect because you account 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.300
 story that there is a guy with a mallet 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.670
 that some corner comes out and hits you 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.670
 bait in the head that virgin and that's what they say 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.230
 but let's see there are times you know him and 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.630
 times that not normally the full 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.489
 Marathon is not usually known because the 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.380
 we face with more fear with a little 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.050
 more careful we did not go over the 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.360
 rhythm and I think the word that 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.650
 define or have to define I think 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.570
 than any marathon but especially the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.550
 first is to enjoy myself I think you have to 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.280
 enjoy one hundred percent of what it is 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.050
 a party ranking what is a 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.420
 marathon that you are going to run through the streets 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.160
 of barcelona in this case and enjoy 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.140
 enjoy watching while you go 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.130
 running then when you go through more to 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.130
 the family to health 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.940
 and that will say finish relax that you are going 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.670
 enjoying that you go in harmony then already 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.330
 I suppose from the 30 when you go to 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.330
 the beach 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.299
 they are going to start son little fingers were going to 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.459
 go more concentrated and the pity is that 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.620
 the best can triumph or see it because 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.100
 and equipment 36 and you have to look at the 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.660
 Blue line does not deviate from the attention and 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.700
 you have to suffer it to suffer 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.500
 but hey here he who has more 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.810
 experience in marathons I was 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.030
 way in goals the sambenito rent of 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.800
 tour guide to enjoy and 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.190
 get a good brand within the framework of 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.560
 the area not about your good uncle can 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.200
 say that tomorrow is going to be a good day and that 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.520
 it is already a plus it will not be so necessary 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.800
 hydration because temperatures 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.880
 they're going to be pretty low try 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.850
 forget a no gel 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.740
 Carolinas sneakers ensure well that 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.560
 the socks do not have any wrinkles 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.350
 still sometimes I put them on and put them on 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.370
 corresponding petrolatum or the one that stops 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.370
 that there are no chafing 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.620
 I would cut because they are also 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.110
 putting all the pressure 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.630
 and let's see I already have experience in 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.890
 marathons and I have experience doing 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:27.220
 of free in marathons or in fact two 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.220
 times if you are in that facet 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.810
 try less than 210 here in barcelona 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:43.810
 so difficult it is something that always 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:48.370
 suppose not fuck you 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.370
 the quick stop 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.770
 but you know 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.099
 for me yes and more than accustomed to 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.110
 do hare in good training the 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:01.460
 barcelona marathon I do not finish it in 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.439
 less than two days at any time because no 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.599
 I really felt like it but good 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:07.759
 that's why I have the time stamp because 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.590
 has not wanted to do less but good or 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:12.080
 be that tomorrow I am very prepared for 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.699
 pull for that between 30 and 50 kilometers 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.699
 at the rate of less than 2 10 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:22.810
 good luck to all luck guys and 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.810
 girls
