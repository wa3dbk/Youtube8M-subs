00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
edition of the target finder and black

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.939 
edition of the target finder and black
ops<00:00:50.070> 2<00:00:50.250> yeah<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.449> target<00:00:51.809> finder<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.530> kind<00:00:52.829> of

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
ops 2 yeah the target finder is kind of

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.510 
ops 2 yeah the target finder is kind of
easy<00:00:53.129> mode<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.789> know<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:53.940> mean<00:00:54.270> some<00:00:55.160> it's<00:00:56.160> it's

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
easy mode you know I mean some it's it's

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.369 
easy mode you know I mean some it's it's
unrealistic<00:00:57.090> first<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.750> all<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.140> it's

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
unrealistic first of all but it's

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.189 
unrealistic first of all but it's
something<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.030> captures<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.660> says<00:01:00.870> here's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
something that captures and says here's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.470 
something that captures and says here's
where<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.949> enemy<00:01:02.309> team<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.879> or<00:01:03.090> here's<00:01:03.300> where

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
where the enemy team is or here's where

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.410 
where the enemy team is or here's where
the<00:01:03.629> enemy<00:01:04.320> person<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.070> says<00:01:05.309> shoot<00:01:06.060> here

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the enemy person is and says shoot here

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.289 
the enemy person is and says shoot here
that's<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:07.070> it's<00:01:08.070> unrealistic<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.060> think

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that's just it's unrealistic I think

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.620 
that's just it's unrealistic I think
it's<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.720> little<00:01:10.110> bit<00:01:10.260> ridiculous<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.630> it

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it's a little bit ridiculous and it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.600 
it's a little bit ridiculous and it
should<00:01:12.869> probably<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.770> laser<00:01:14.070> gun<00:01:14.220> I

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
should probably be on a laser gun I

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.499 
should probably be on a laser gun I
don't<00:01:15.299> know<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:16.220> like<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.369> man<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.820> mean<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.360> all

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509

about earlier it has a lack of
peripheral<00:01:23.820> vision<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.299> mean<00:01:24.479> empty<00:01:24.720> what<00:01:25.020> do

don't<00:01:28.350> think<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.710> usable<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.340> me<00:01:29.490> as<00:01:29.820> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
don't think it's usable to me as a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.690 
don't think it's usable to me as a
running<00:01:30.840> gun<00:01:30.990> type<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.439> guy<00:01:31.560> I'm<00:01:32.009> an<00:01:32.400> SMG

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.240 
player so I like to spray and pray a lot
and<00:01:37.250> using<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> target<00:01:38.729> finder<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.150> me<00:01:39.299> is

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
and using the target finder to me is

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.020 
and using the target finder to me is
little<00:01:41.250> more<00:01:41.400> slow<00:01:41.759> me<00:01:41.939> down<00:01:41.970> than<00:01:42.630> anything

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
little more slow me down than anything

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.359 
little more slow me down than anything
if<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.270> me<00:01:45.360> I'm<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> lmg<00:01:46.110> player<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
if for me I'm a lmg player and for the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.069 
if for me I'm a lmg player and for the
LMGs<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:47.909> all<00:01:48.000> know<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.270> slow<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:48.780> hard<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
LMGs we all know it's slow it's hard to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.810 
LMGs we all know it's slow it's hard to
move<00:01:49.229> around<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.740> feels<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.159> quicksand<00:01:50.610> with

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
move around it feels like quicksand with

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.730 
move around it feels like quicksand with
it<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.540> target<00:01:51.899> finder<00:01:52.110> gives<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.619> that

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
it and the target finder gives you that

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.679 
it and the target finder gives you that
added<00:01:52.890> advantage<00:01:53.610> because<00:01:54.060> movements

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
added advantage because movements

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.109 
added advantage because movements
already<00:01:55.140> limited<00:01:55.560> from<00:01:55.770> left<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.040> right<00:01:56.130> now

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
already limited from left to right now

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.340 
already limited from left to right now
do<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.299> guys<00:01:57.360> think<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.750> helped<00:01:58.140> and

destroyed<00:02:00.420> call<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.780> duty<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.200> wouldn't<00:02:02.100> say

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
destroyed call of duty I wouldn't say

destroyed call of duty I wouldn't say
that<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.610> destroyed<00:02:03.180> call<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.659> duty<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.930> would

that it destroyed call of duty I would

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.590 
that it destroyed call of duty I would
say<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.890> just<00:02:05.280> another<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:06.060> know

this<00:03:19.760> game<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.270> mean<00:03:20.450> what<00:03:20.660> do<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:20.780> think<00:03:20.990> empty

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
this game I mean what do you think empty

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.440 
this game I mean what do you think empty
do<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:21.680> like<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:21.980> shock<00:03:22.220> charge<00:03:22.490> yes<00:03:23.270> I

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
do you like the shock charge yes I

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.120 
do you like the shock charge yes I
actually<00:03:23.690> do<00:03:24.140> like<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.560> shock<00:03:24.800> charge

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
actually do like the shock charge

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.310 
actually do like the shock charge
because<00:03:25.640> they<00:03:25.790> made<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.120> balanced<00:03:27.050> with<00:03:27.290> the

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
because they made it balanced with the

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.970 
because they made it balanced with the
right<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:28.100> know<00:03:28.190> perk<00:03:28.490> setup<00:03:28.910> if<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:30.709> are

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
right you know perk setup if you are

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.520 
right you know perk setup if you are
running<00:03:31.160> tech<00:03:31.490> mass<00:03:31.730> obviously<00:03:32.420> you<00:03:33.080> will<00:03:33.320> be

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
running tech mass obviously you will be

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.740 
running tech mass obviously you will be
able<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.860> counter<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.490> shock<00:03:34.700> charge<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:35.480> I

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
able to counter the shock charge so I

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.650 
able to counter the shock charge so I
think<00:03:36.050> it's<00:03:36.500> very<00:03:36.650> balanced<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.910> really

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
think it's very balanced and a really

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.040 
think it's very balanced and a really
good<00:03:38.870> addition<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.530> game<00:03:40.840> about<00:03:41.840> you

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
good addition to the game about you

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.510 
good addition to the game about you
whack<00:03:42.230> what<00:03:42.470> do<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:42.590> think<00:03:42.739> ma'am<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:43.130> think<00:03:43.430> if

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
whack what do you think ma'am I think if

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.890 
whack what do you think ma'am I think if
we're<00:03:43.670> looking<00:03:43.790> at<00:03:44.090> it<00:03:44.239> in<00:03:44.330> a<00:03:44.450> realistic

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
standpoint it's totally bogus I mean

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.320 
standpoint it's totally bogus I mean

shoes there's nothing that's going to
jump<00:03:52.520> out<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:52.850> actually<00:03:53.060> shocked<00:03:53.600> us<00:03:53.870> without

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
jump out and actually shocked us without

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.380 
jump out and actually shocked us without
some<00:03:54.680> kind<00:03:54.920> of<00:03:55.130> you<00:03:55.459> know<00:03:55.489> projectile<00:03:56.360> or

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
some kind of you know projectile or

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.449 
some kind of you know projectile or
something<00:03:56.959> like<00:03:57.080> that<00:03:57.140> but<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.070> other<00:03:58.220> thing

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
something like that but the other thing

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.610 
something like that but the other thing
would<00:03:58.670> be<00:03:58.880> with<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.600> shock<00:03:59.840> charge<00:04:00.140> I<00:04:00.380> think

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
would be with the shock charge I think

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.030 
would be with the shock charge I think
if<00:04:00.800> you<00:04:01.070> get<00:04:01.340> shocked<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:03.410> should<00:04:03.620> just<00:04:03.650> be

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
if you get shocked you should just be

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.830 
if you get shocked you should just be
spraying<00:04:04.489> because<00:04:05.000> with<00:04:05.390> that<00:04:05.600> much

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
spraying because with that much

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.420 
spraying because with that much
electricity<00:04:06.440> going<00:04:06.860> through<00:04:06.980> your<00:04:07.250> veins

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
electricity going through your veins

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.140 
electricity going through your veins
everything<00:04:08.300> is<00:04:08.450> going<00:04:08.660> to<00:04:08.750> tattoo<00:04:09.200> yeah<00:04:09.410> so

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
everything is going to tattoo yeah so

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.210 
everything is going to tattoo yeah so
you<00:04:11.150> should<00:04:11.360> be<00:04:11.450> shooting<00:04:11.680> entirely<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:12.890> the

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
you should be shooting entirely and the

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.979 
you should be shooting entirely and the
fact<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:13.520> you<00:04:13.700> can<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.540> can<00:04:14.720> kind<00:04:14.930> of

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
fact that you can you can kind of

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.120 
fact that you can you can kind of
control<00:04:15.140> that<00:04:15.380> like<00:04:15.530> you're<00:04:15.830> totally

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
control that like you're totally

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.400 
control that like you're totally
immobilized<00:04:17.060> your<00:04:17.330> whole<00:04:17.570> body<00:04:17.900> doesn't<00:04:18.380> work

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
immobilized your whole body doesn't work

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.770 
immobilized your whole body doesn't work
but<00:04:18.680> you<00:04:18.799> can<00:04:18.979> still<00:04:19.310> move<00:04:19.640> your<00:04:20.000> your<00:04:20.359> trigger

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
but you can still move your your trigger

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.590 
but you can still move your your trigger
finger<00:04:20.870> doesn't<00:04:21.680> make<00:04:21.919> any<00:04:22.100> sense

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
finger doesn't make any sense

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.460 
finger doesn't make any sense
me<00:04:22.690> yeah<00:04:23.590> it<00:04:23.740> should<00:04:23.920> automatically<00:04:24.460> shoot<00:04:24.850> I

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
me yeah it should automatically shoot I

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.990 
me yeah it should automatically shoot I
mean<00:04:26.470> for<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.710> black<00:04:26.920> ops<00:04:27.130> 1<00:04:27.310> days<00:04:27.730> it<00:04:27.910> was

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
charges and was it really necessary to

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.990 
charges and was it really necessary to
the<00:04:34.510> new<00:04:34.720> call<00:04:35.170> of<00:04:35.200> duty<00:04:35.410> game<00:04:35.620> for<00:04:36.310> myself<00:04:36.460> we

on<00:04:42.790> my<00:04:43.060> opinion<00:04:43.390> not<00:04:43.540> really<00:04:43.900> what's<00:04:44.380> your

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
on my opinion not really what's your

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.350 
on my opinion not really what's your
final<00:04:44.680> words<00:04:44.980> empty<00:04:45.370> i<00:04:45.670> believe<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.270> was

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
final words empty i believe it was

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.620 
final words empty i believe it was
necessary<00:04:46.960> because<00:04:47.290> um<00:04:47.920> just<00:04:48.760> for<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.360> main

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
necessary because um just for the main

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.190 
necessary because um just for the main
fact<00:04:49.990> that<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:51.430> was<00:04:52.300> that<00:04:52.540> the<00:04:52.660> flash<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.140> the

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
fact that the was that the flash and the

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.430 
fact that the was that the flash and the
concussion<00:04:53.710> they<00:04:53.980> last<00:04:54.310> so<00:04:54.970> long<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:55.660> it's<00:04:56.350> a

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
concussion they last so long and it's a

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.590 
concussion they last so long and it's a
great<00:04:56.620> counter<00:04:57.070> and<00:04:57.280> a<00:04:57.490> great<00:04:57.790> dumb<00:04:58.120> you<00:04:58.570> know

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
great counter and a great dumb you know

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.230 
great counter and a great dumb you know
even<00:04:59.290> if<00:04:59.440> you're<00:04:59.620> on<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.890> receiving<00:05:00.310> in<00:05:00.970> its

even if you're on the receiving in its

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.540 
even if you're on the receiving in its
it's<00:05:02.230> better<00:05:02.590> than<00:05:02.770> being<00:05:02.920> flashed<00:05:03.280> or

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
it's better than being flashed or

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.260 
it's better than being flashed or
stunned<00:05:03.790> i<00:05:05.340> don't<00:05:06.340> think<00:05:06.430> it<00:05:06.670> destroyed<00:05:07.150> it

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
I think in order to move forward with

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.390 
I think in order to move forward with
the<00:05:25.600> series<00:05:26.020> we're<00:05:26.290> gonna<00:05:26.470> have<00:05:26.740> to<00:05:26.920> see<00:05:27.160> these

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
the series we're gonna have to see these

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.130 
the series we're gonna have to see these
kind<00:05:27.670> of<00:05:27.820> one-offs<00:05:28.360> these<00:05:28.660> funny<00:05:29.020> little

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
kind of one-offs these funny little

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.740 
kind of one-offs these funny little
things<00:05:29.650> that<00:05:30.010> that<00:05:30.670> realistically<00:05:31.330> haven't

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
things that that realistically haven't

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.680 
things that that realistically haven't
been<00:05:31.870> invented<00:05:32.140> and<00:05:33.070> I<00:05:33.700> honestly<00:05:34.300> think<00:05:34.510> at

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
been invented and I honestly think at

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.790 
been invented and I honestly think at
some<00:05:34.840> point<00:05:34.900> we're<00:05:35.260> going<00:05:35.380> to<00:05:35.470> be<00:05:35.590> shooting

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
some point we're going to be shooting

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.880 
some point we're going to be shooting
laser<00:05:36.190> guns<00:05:36.550> in<00:05:36.880> the<00:05:37.060> series<00:05:37.420> so<00:05:37.810> we'll<00:05:38.740> see
