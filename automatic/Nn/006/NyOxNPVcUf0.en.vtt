 Four 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.480
 b 4 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:18.500
 Hi everyone, Hi Takayama 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:23.390
 Really long time no see Yeah really long time 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.970
 Video if you can not update the actual is it this time was sorry moving a little bit the 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.820
 Rather than dizzy of the secondary video 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:33.120
 a I'm sorry but various reasons why 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.420
 There was no way to go 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.550
 Well hey I think the kana put out videos I now 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:45.360
 It is yes this time I'd such for that of the Kudan 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.810
 Eh, everyone has a lot of challenges Hey, including critique 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.200
 I'd gotten the opinion is the enlistment conditions Nema large 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.020
 It's say you have a Yes Manaze to be changed 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.440
 a 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:02.460
 The condition of the previous day is also very tough 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.320
 In addition to that, it was difficult to understand 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:12.030
 Well very simple and removed if from the little bit I degree of difficulty 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.110
 I think it's a big drop, let's introduce a little more concretely 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.110
 I'd want to 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.460
 If it is recruitment Dan Hall, it is 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.670
 I am very sorry but I am sorry 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:27.840
 There is turn all of the one and three people were three years I'm sorry 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:33.119
 a It seems that the condition is well displayed on the screen 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:38.909
 It is the maintenance in star clan match of 2 real match 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.450
 More than 150 or more my clan is a I think I will focus on that much before 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.750
 I will 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.659
 So I thought I'd become such a situation 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.780
 Rigging at 8 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:51.369
 The reason is because there are already members of the aura band of considerable sound group in the north storehouse, so Komatsu 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.079
 I apologize for less 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.749
 It seems that it is a simple landscape history. Well, 20 people are thinking that I will take a little bit bigger here. 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:02.799
 I also want more than 200 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:04.880
 Too little or gather in the Well I 12 is the price have a child 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.880
 Hey you 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.680
 I don't have Fukushima but with over 150 people 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:18.230
 In I'd is written only to the person who is confident that nettle the more alien because if write 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:22.970
 It was Horu in the 8 or that the price of 8 or less is particularly not have my taking the star 3 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.900
 Because I do not who I Well selfish is the place Oiteeemaa in not a clan pair 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.010
 Yue's basic children 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:33.720
 All about the bullet All about hurry about him 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.200
 If you're good enough for me , I'll take an ordinary child , so I'll do my best for the attack 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.849
 I want to 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:43.530
 With regard to orders for dumplings, it seems that the level difference is also fierce. 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.890
 Well I think that the basic maintenance or Well great if Torere 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.420
 Well yeah 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.870
 Ne 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.030
 Certainly I want you to want this specific now 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:57.220
 I told you about it, but 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:01.690
 Vise If you're in a clan you can't do very well but you're good at fighting yourself 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:04.960
 I think there is something I can not see now 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:09.400
 So that Tse small to achievement 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.960
 It 's not that I'm not sure if I'm getting lost or not, so I'm really really 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.340
 Body really have confidence 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.110
 If you are confident that you can get along with me properly, let's press 1 for application. 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.520
 Yeah Well 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.710
 Intention display a little more if you can write well in newborns of like a Onemasu 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.610
 The 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:30.400
 It is not 100%, but I would like to consider it a little more 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:35.530
 The fact that Well there is on that confidence by all means I do not meet the above-mentioned 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.330
 I am done with you You're Well, that last time Anna severely I think if you fix it 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:43.550
 Or a is Eemaa unit level 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.750

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.880

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:54.400
 I think I'm going to approve if it has not been raised early if it has risen to some extent 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:59.500
 Well then I think how to decide such a thing 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.720
 There is it before very something too much detail for the last time Eemaa 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.780
 Something 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:10.140

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:16.049
