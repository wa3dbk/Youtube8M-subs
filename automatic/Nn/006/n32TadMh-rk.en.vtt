00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
so we're gonna teach you hand switching

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.900 
so we're gonna teach you hand switching
and<00:00:14.900> what<00:00:15.019> we<00:00:15.139> mean<00:00:15.289> by<00:00:15.440> that<00:00:15.469> is<00:00:15.830> from<00:00:16.580> doing<00:00:16.820> a

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
and what we mean by that is from doing a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.060 
and what we mean by that is from doing a
regular<00:00:17.119> four<00:00:17.689> beat<00:00:17.900> we've<00:00:18.170> both<00:00:18.770> of<00:00:18.980> our

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
regular four beat we've both of our

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.810 
regular four beat we've both of our
right<00:00:19.279> hands<00:00:19.520> are<00:00:19.700> doing<00:00:19.939> the<00:00:20.029> weave<00:00:20.180> and<00:00:21.820> when

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
right hands are doing the weave and when

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.210 
right hands are doing the weave and when
I<00:00:22.849> shift<00:00:23.180> hands<00:00:23.660> I'm<00:00:24.080> gonna<00:00:24.380> match<00:00:24.680> that<00:00:24.710> same

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
I shift hands I'm gonna match that same

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.099 
I shift hands I'm gonna match that same
pattern<00:00:25.640> with<00:00:25.849> her<00:00:26.029> hand<00:00:26.329> but<00:00:26.599> I'm<00:00:26.720> gonna<00:00:26.840> put

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
pattern with her hand but I'm gonna put

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.189 
pattern with her hand but I'm gonna put
my<00:00:27.289> left<00:00:27.560> hand<00:00:27.710> in<00:00:28.099> instead<00:00:28.820> she<00:00:29.599> keeps<00:00:29.840> doing

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
my left hand in instead she keeps doing

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.439 
my left hand in instead she keeps doing
the<00:00:30.289> same<00:00:30.320> weave<00:00:31.870> and<00:00:32.870> I<00:00:32.960> have<00:00:33.080> to<00:00:33.230> compensate

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
the same weave and I have to compensate

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:43.640 
the same weave and I have to compensate
with<00:00:35.449> my<00:00:35.629> hand<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.650> now<00:00:36.800> I<00:00:36.830> can<00:00:37.010> shift<00:00:37.400> back

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.740 

this<00:00:44.490> is<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> most<00:00:44.910> common<00:00:45.240> way<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.630> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
this is the most common way to do the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.450 
this is the most common way to do the
four<00:00:45.960> beat<00:00:46.140> right<00:00:46.560> hand<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.860> right<00:00:47.010> hand<00:00:47.040> or

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
four beat right hand to right hand or

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.150 
four beat right hand to right hand or
left<00:00:47.490> hand<00:00:47.880> to<00:00:48.000> left<00:00:48.030> hand<00:00:48.650> so<00:00:49.650> we<00:00:49.800> reached<00:00:50.010> an

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
left hand to left hand so we reached an

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.950 
left hand to left hand so we reached an
interesting<00:00:50.640> challenge<00:00:50.940> when<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.480> try<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.870> do

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
interesting challenge when we try and do

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.890 
interesting challenge when we try and do
it<00:00:52.110> left<00:00:52.860> hand<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.490> right<00:00:53.520> hand<00:00:53.700> or<00:00:54.390> right<00:00:54.630> hand

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
it left hand to right hand or right hand

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.040 
it left hand to right hand or right hand
to<00:00:55.020> left<00:00:55.050> hand<00:00:55.790> because<00:00:56.790> you<00:00:57.450> end<00:00:57.600> up<00:00:57.720> having

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
to left hand because you end up having

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.110 
to left hand because you end up having
to<00:00:58.200> do<00:00:58.740> an<00:00:58.920> extra<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.520> something<00:00:59.790> with

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
to do an extra little something with

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.000 
to do an extra little something with
your<00:01:00.720> wrist<00:01:00.960> which<00:01:01.320> you'll<00:01:01.500> find<00:01:01.680> out<00:01:01.860> by

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
your wrist which you'll find out by

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.770 
your wrist which you'll find out by
trying<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.370> with<00:01:02.460> your<00:01:02.610> partner<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.720> were

hand switching you have to remember that
that<00:02:11.709> circle<00:02:12.310> will<00:02:12.459> always<00:02:12.790> keep<00:02:13.000> going<00:02:13.360> in

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
that circle will always keep going in

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.420 
that circle will always keep going in
the<00:02:13.569> same<00:02:13.720> direction<00:02:13.780> if<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.860> want<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.160> put<00:02:15.310> my

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.489 

and<00:02:57.909> by<00:02:58.540> communicating<00:02:59.200> with<00:02:59.319> your<00:02:59.439> partner

00:02:59.489 --> 00:02:59.499 
and by communicating with your partner

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:01.830 
and by communicating with your partner
you<00:02:59.980> can<00:03:00.129> also<00:03:00.249> decide<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.700> shift<00:03:01.569> the

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
you can also decide to shift the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.369 
you can also decide to shift the
direction<00:03:01.989> of<00:03:02.439> the<00:03:03.400> circle<00:03:03.790> going<00:03:04.569> around<00:03:04.810> so

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
direction of the circle going around so

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.530 
direction of the circle going around so
let's<00:03:05.530> go<00:03:05.709> from<00:03:05.980> this<00:03:06.219> direction<00:03:06.790> now

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
let's go from this direction now

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.649 
let's go from this direction now
switching<00:03:08.519> so<00:03:09.519> we<00:03:09.609> come<00:03:09.849> back<00:03:09.999> the<00:03:10.239> other<00:03:10.389> way

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
switching so we come back the other way

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.839 
switching so we come back the other way
and<00:03:11.069> for<00:03:12.069> me<00:03:12.159> that's<00:03:12.280> gone<00:03:12.549> from

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
and for me that's gone from

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.110 
and for me that's gone from
counterclockwise<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.840> clockwise<00:03:14.909> and<00:03:15.909> again

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
counterclockwise to clockwise and again

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.050 
counterclockwise to clockwise and again
I<00:03:16.209> can<00:03:16.359> just<00:03:16.389> maintain<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.019> pattern

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
I can just maintain the pattern

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.160 
I can just maintain the pattern
switching<00:03:19.060> my<00:03:19.180> arms<00:03:19.510> in<00:03:19.689> the<00:03:19.780> four-beat

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
switching my arms in the four-beat

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.470 
switching my arms in the four-beat
whenever<00:03:20.469> I<00:03:20.530> choose<00:03:20.909> so<00:03:21.909> not<00:03:22.060> only<00:03:22.180> can<00:03:22.420> we

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
whenever I choose so not only can we

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.149 
whenever I choose so not only can we
shift<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:23.139> way<00:03:23.260> our<00:03:23.379> hands<00:03:23.680> are<00:03:23.799> going<00:03:23.829> by

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
shift the way our hands are going by

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.330 
shift the way our hands are going by
communicating<00:03:24.819> now<00:03:25.859> we'll<00:03:26.859> also<00:03:26.980> show<00:03:27.189> you<00:03:27.219> a

way to shift the way the direction our

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.729 
way to shift the way the direction our
poi<00:03:29.379> are<00:03:29.560> going<00:03:29.829> by<00:03:30.250> using<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.639> stall<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.959> you

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
poi are going by using a stall so you

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.199 
poi are going by using a stall so you
need<00:03:32.889> to<00:03:32.980> set<00:03:33.159> up<00:03:33.189> a<00:03:33.400> means<00:03:33.639> of<00:03:33.760> communication

downbeat of one okay and we're going to

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.059 
downbeat of one okay and we're going to
be<00:03:52.000> doing<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.419> weave<00:03:52.599> and<00:03:52.900> then<00:03:53.199> stalling<00:03:53.829> to

be doing the weave and then stalling to

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.740 
be doing the weave and then stalling to
shift<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.430> direction<00:03:54.549> of<00:03:54.849> our<00:03:54.969> poi<00:03:55.180> then

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
shift the direction of our poi then

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.659 
shift the direction of our poi then

pattern<00:04:42.230> you<00:04:42.620> just<00:04:42.950> have<00:04:43.160> to<00:04:43.340> have<00:04:43.520> one

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
pattern you just have to have one

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.030 
pattern you just have to have one
established<00:04:44.510> pattern<00:04:44.930> then<00:04:45.500> you<00:04:45.620> can<00:04:45.770> start

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
established pattern then you can start

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.770 
established pattern then you can start
elaborating<00:04:46.820> from<00:04:47.030> there<00:04:52.510> so<00:04:53.510> with<00:04:53.630> these

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
elaborating from there so with these

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.360 
elaborating from there so with these
techniques<00:04:54.140> we've<00:04:54.380> shown<00:04:54.620> you<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:55.010> can<00:04:55.130> start

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
techniques we've shown you you can start

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.770 
techniques we've shown you you can start
to<00:04:55.490> play<00:04:55.700> with<00:04:55.730> your<00:04:56.000> partner<00:04:56.360> make<00:04:56.600> sure

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
communicating but as long as the pattern

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.620 
communicating but as long as the pattern
isn't<00:05:00.200> changing<00:05:01.160> you<00:05:01.400> can<00:05:01.910> shift<00:05:02.240> your<00:05:02.360> arms
