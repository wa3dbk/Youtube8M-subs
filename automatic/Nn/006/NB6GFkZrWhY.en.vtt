regarding the plant production and amino

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.520 
regarding the plant production and amino
acids<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.540> general<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.200> know<00:02:26.290> I've<00:02:26.350> spoken

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
acids in general you know I've spoken

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.979 
acids in general you know I've spoken
about<00:02:26.739> this<00:02:26.860> before<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:28.390> really<00:02:28.630> relates

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
about this before and it really relates

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.190 
about this before and it really relates
to<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:30.000> microorganisms<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.239> amino<00:02:31.810> acid

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
to the microorganisms and the amino acid

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.260 
to the microorganisms and the amino acid
interaction<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:33.160> for<00:02:33.430> example<00:02:33.910> I've

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
interaction so for example I've

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.910 
interaction so for example I've
considered<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.840> amino<00:02:35.080> acids<00:02:35.470> an<00:02:35.560> ionic

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
considered the amino acids an ionic

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.680 
considered the amino acids an ionic
precursor<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.550> something<00:02:36.819> as<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.390> all<00:02:37.510> know

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
precursor to something as you all know

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.750 
precursor to something as you all know
rooting<00:02:38.080> powders<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.830> specific<00:02:39.340> solutions

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
rooting powders and specific solutions

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.320 
rooting powders and specific solutions
have<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.680> Olli<00:02:41.890> acetic<00:02:42.340> acid<00:02:42.730> which<00:02:43.030> by

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
have I a and Olli acetic acid which by

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.390 
have I a and Olli acetic acid which by
itself<00:02:43.660> is<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.350> plant<00:02:44.620> growth<00:02:44.769> regulator<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.370> a

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
itself is a plant growth regulator and a

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.550 
itself is a plant growth regulator and a
hormone<00:02:45.610> that's<00:02:45.760> regulated<00:02:46.150> by<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.450> EPA<00:02:46.570> etc

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
hormone that's regulated by the EPA etc

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.740 
hormone that's regulated by the EPA etc
well<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.610> just<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:48.880> happens<00:02:48.910> that<00:02:49.209> tryptophan

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
well it just so happens that tryptophan

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.460 
well it just so happens that tryptophan
when<00:02:50.500> utilized<00:02:50.950> in<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.840> nutrient<00:02:52.840> solution<00:02:53.290> and

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
when utilized in a nutrient solution and

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.560 
when utilized in a nutrient solution and
the<00:02:53.620> microorganisms<00:02:54.090> consume<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.269> they

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
the microorganisms consume that they

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.900 
the microorganisms consume that they
actually<00:02:55.750> convert<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.620> amino<00:02:57.220> acid<00:02:57.670> into

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
actually convert that amino acid into

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.300 
actually convert that amino acid into
IAA<00:02:58.450> into<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.140> root<00:02:59.290> zone<00:02:59.320> so<00:02:59.980> you're<00:03:00.100> getting

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
IAA into the root zone so you're getting

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.880 
IAA into the root zone so you're getting
a<00:03:00.400> roof<00:03:00.580> mass<00:03:00.820> increase<00:03:01.780> in<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.050> benefit<00:03:02.440> from

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
a roof mass increase in the benefit from

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.559 
a roof mass increase in the benefit from

is 10 to 20 mils per gallon right and

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.250 
is 10 to 20 mils per gallon right and
when<00:04:01.390> you<00:04:01.450> look<00:04:01.570> at<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.750> price<00:04:01.960> point<00:04:01.990> in

when you look at the price point in

when you look at the price point in
comparisons<00:04:02.830> of<00:04:02.950> amino<00:04:03.130> acids<00:04:03.490> the<00:04:03.850> thing<00:04:04.030> is

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
comparisons of amino acids the thing is

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.540 
comparisons of amino acids the thing is
is<00:04:04.360> you<00:04:04.480> don't<00:04:04.630> necessarily<00:04:04.750> have<00:04:05.470> to<00:04:05.550> use

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
is you don't necessarily have to use

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.950 
is you don't necessarily have to use
that<00:04:06.790> much<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.240> get<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.510> same<00:04:07.690> amino

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
that much to get the same amino

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.990 
that much to get the same amino
concentration<00:04:08.920> so<00:04:09.250> when<00:04:09.430> we<00:04:09.580> say<00:04:09.790> there's

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
concentration so when we say there's

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.270 
concentration so when we say there's
0.28<00:04:10.600> grams<00:04:10.870> per<00:04:11.140> ounce<00:04:11.350> of<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.890> amino<00:04:12.160> acid

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
0.28 grams per ounce of the amino acid

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.520 
0.28 grams per ounce of the amino acid
and<00:04:12.760> you<00:04:13.150> use<00:04:13.330> about<00:04:13.510> five<00:04:13.900> mils<00:04:14.200> you're<00:04:14.380> going

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
and you use about five mils you're going

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.870 
and you use about five mils you're going
to<00:04:14.590> get<00:04:14.710> about<00:04:14.890> a<00:04:14.920> fifty<00:04:15.310> parts-per-million

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
to get about a fifty parts-per-million

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.490 
to get about a fifty parts-per-million
increase<00:04:16.270> in<00:04:16.420> your<00:04:16.480> feet<00:04:16.720> so<00:04:16.959> expect<00:04:17.320> that

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
increase in your feet so expect that

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.680 
increase in your feet so expect that
that's<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:17.890> point<00:04:18.130> nine<00:04:18.400> point<00:04:18.820> two<00:04:18.910> point<00:04:19.420> two

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
that's a point nine point two point two

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.400 
that's a point nine point two point two
so<00:04:20.140> the<00:04:20.350> NPK<00:04:20.830> is<00:04:20.950> relatively<00:04:21.549> inert<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.410> some

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
so the NPK is relatively inert and some

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.620 
so the NPK is relatively inert and some
of<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.650> typical<00:04:24.280> amino<00:04:24.730> acid<00:04:25.120> sources<00:04:25.540> that

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
of the typical amino acid sources that

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.390 
of the typical amino acid sources that
you<00:04:25.780> get<00:04:25.960> have<00:04:26.140> such<00:04:26.320> a<00:04:26.350> high<00:04:26.560> nitrogen<00:04:26.710> which

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
you get have such a high nitrogen which

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.800 
you get have such a high nitrogen which
a<00:04:27.490> lot<00:04:27.640> of<00:04:27.670> people<00:04:27.850> don't<00:04:28.120> want<00:04:28.300> later<00:04:28.510> on<00:04:28.660> in

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
a lot of people don't want later on in

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.270 
a lot of people don't want later on in
flowering<00:04:29.200> because<00:04:29.290> of<00:04:29.560> other<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:30.220> know

kalmec<00:04:30.730> products<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.240> have<00:04:31.360> a<00:04:31.390> 2%<00:04:31.720> nitrogen

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
kalmec products that have a 2% nitrogen

kalmec products that have a 2% nitrogen

one-horse<00:04:34.870> you<00:04:34.960> get<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.110> one<00:04:35.350> on<00:04:35.500> this<00:04:35.680> but<00:04:35.920> yeah

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
one-horse you get a one on this but yeah

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.170 
one-horse you get a one on this but yeah
you<00:04:36.130> wouldn't<00:04:36.310> want<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:36.520> be<00:04:36.670> the<00:04:36.820> team<00:04:36.970> that

right they have a little bit that that

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.119

this<00:04:47.969> is<00:04:48.150> going<00:04:48.180> to<00:04:48.330> be<00:04:48.479> more<00:04:48.719> of<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:49.020> lighter

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680

vanilla green color it has a sweet odor
it's<00:04:52.889> not<00:04:53.099> so<00:04:53.310> rancid<00:04:53.789> as<00:04:53.879> some<00:04:54.029> of<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.270> other

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:55.159 
it's not so rancid as some of the other

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.709 
it's not so rancid as some of the other

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:57.719 
amino acid products on the market so

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:59.089 
amino acid products on the market so
how's<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.229> garden<00:04:58.439> came<00:04:58.590> out<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.770> product

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
how's the garden came out the product

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:00.920 
how's the garden came out the product
recently<00:04:59.460> and<00:04:59.729> they<00:04:59.789> did<00:04:59.999> a<00:05:00.029> really<00:05:00.659> big

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
recently and they did a really big

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.600 
recently and they did a really big

it's<00:05:13.349> that<00:05:14.150> I've<00:05:15.150> you<00:05:15.240> done<00:05:15.419> any<00:05:15.629> research<00:05:15.779> to

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
it's that I've you done any research to

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.839 
it's that I've you done any research to
see<00:05:16.379> what<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.770> differences<00:05:17.250> of<00:05:17.279> an<00:05:17.639> amino

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
see what the differences of an amino

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.610 
see what the differences of an amino
treatment<00:05:18.300> versus<00:05:18.599> mcquaig<00:05:18.870> oh<00:05:19.020> yeah

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
treatment versus mcquaig oh yeah

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.230 
treatment versus mcquaig oh yeah
actually<00:05:19.830> looking<00:05:20.279> at<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.520> amino<00:05:20.759> treatment

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
actually looking at the amino treatment

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.990 
actually looking at the amino treatment
myself<00:05:21.689> we<00:05:22.469> kind<00:05:22.979> of<00:05:23.069> determine<00:05:23.430> it<00:05:23.550> it's<00:05:23.759> not

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
myself we kind of determine it it's not

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.089 
myself we kind of determine it it's not
the<00:05:24.180> full<00:05:24.330> 20l<00:05:24.870> aminos<00:05:25.259> there's<00:05:25.560> a<00:05:25.620> special

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
the full 20l aminos there's a special

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:27.619 
the full 20l aminos there's a special
select<00:05:26.580> just<00:05:26.909> like<00:05:27.090> we<00:05:27.270> have<00:05:27.419> in<00:05:27.539> our

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:27.629 
select just like we have in our

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
avalanche and our jumpstart what I've

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.070 
avalanche and our jumpstart what I've
read<00:05:29.729> from<00:05:30.029> house<00:05:30.180> and<00:05:30.389> garden<00:05:30.629> I<00:05:30.689> believe<00:05:30.960> it

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
read from house and garden I believe it

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.040 
read from house and garden I believe it
was<00:05:31.259> around<00:05:31.500> six<00:05:32.250> five<00:05:32.879> five<00:05:33.509> six

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
was around six five five six

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.439 
was around six five five six
yeah<00:05:34.199> and<00:05:34.919> it's<00:05:35.069> a<00:05:35.129> got<00:05:35.279> silica<00:05:35.819> in<00:05:36.000> a<00:05:36.060> basket

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
yeah and it's a got silica in a basket

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:37.610 
yeah and it's a got silica in a basket
in<00:05:36.539> there<00:05:36.689> as<00:05:36.779> well<00:05:36.930> that's<00:05:37.409> what<00:05:37.529> they

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
in there as well that's what they

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.079 
in there as well that's what they
claimed<00:05:37.889> but<00:05:38.039> unfortunately<00:05:38.580> on<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:38.789> label

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:39.089 
claimed but unfortunately on the label

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.999 
claimed but unfortunately on the label
they<00:05:39.180> don't<00:05:39.360> make<00:05:39.479> any<00:05:39.689> percentages<00:05:40.349> to<00:05:40.589> what

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
they don't make any percentages to what

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:42.679 
they don't make any percentages to what
source<00:05:41.339> of<00:05:41.580> silica<00:05:41.999> whether<00:05:42.210> it's<00:05:42.419> coming

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:42.689 
source of silica whether it's coming

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:44.360 
source of silica whether it's coming
from<00:05:42.839> a<00:05:42.990> potassium<00:05:43.259> silicon<00:05:43.919> amount<00:05:44.310> of

from a potassium silicon amount of
silicic<00:05:44.759> acid<00:05:44.909> there's<00:05:45.719> four<00:05:45.870> different

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
silicic acid there's four different

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.869 
silicic acid there's four different
types<00:05:46.289> of<00:05:46.409> silica<00:05:46.770> so<00:05:47.009> of<00:05:47.370> course<00:05:47.550> I'm<00:05:47.759> not

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
types of silica so of course I'm not

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.579 
types of silica so of course I'm not
sure<00:05:48.089> exactly<00:05:48.330> the<00:05:48.629> concentration<00:05:49.259> of<00:05:49.349> it<00:05:49.469> in

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:49.589 
sure exactly the concentration of it in

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:51.740 
sure exactly the concentration of it in
there<00:05:49.740> no<00:05:50.189> I<00:05:50.219> could<00:05:50.819> tell<00:05:50.849> you<00:05:51.150> that<00:05:51.360> there<00:05:51.569> was

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
there no I could tell you that there was

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.749 
there no I could tell you that there was
