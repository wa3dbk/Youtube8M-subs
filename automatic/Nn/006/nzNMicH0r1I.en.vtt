00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello very good to all how about how 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.879
 you are welcome to the youtube channel 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.440
 Tai Shan to Goltv 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.389
 I am being that you can find me in 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.009
 twitter to steal is navas 10 and in this 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.900
 video I want to recommend another tweet 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.610
 to say is already called control tas and I 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.680
 it seems fantastic the truth is that it is 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.420
 very cool is completely free is 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.970
 available in the pivot repository and 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.949
 It is compatible with iOS 7 iphone and ipad 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.930
 only for the moment as you see here with 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.369
 the ipad is not compatible yet and 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.989
 what does this tweet that you are seeing 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.879
 some screenshot to get an idea 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.680
 but do the following set us 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.449
 we go to the control center and we 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.659
 vitamin in such a way that it puts the 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.790
 multitasking typical of ios 6 and earlier 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:46.409
 not the truth is that fantastic is 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.360
 incredible because from here we are going to 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:50.129
 be able to access all these applications 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.199
 we are going to go to the year for example to fix 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.089
 that we can travel in this way so 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.890
 simple among all our 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.659
 applications this ticket is configurable 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.909
 so let's go the adjustments and 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.589
 let's go to the configuration of 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.750
 tweet that is control cast is this 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.489
 here and we have different options for 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.869
 one side we can tell you that only 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.400
 show four incognitos of 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.080
 applications I like more here 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.000
 it seems that five appear if it seems 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.920
 that is a little more taken advantage of and 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.080
 then we can say that no default 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.640
 appear the typical buttons that 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.259
 we always have in the control center no 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.420
 I think it's more practical to have here 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.860
 multitasking so good I got it 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.540
 so you can move through all the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.369
 applications and sliding towards this 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.140
 side you have the typical buttons of the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.030
 control center of a very cool thing 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.830
 also that you can close all the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.659
 hit applications fix that 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.759
 we have all these apps in second 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.430
 flat if we make a gesture that is 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.990
 to fix them we have closed them all and 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.090
 now we do not have any application 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.039
 open as you are seeing the truth is 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.810
 that I think a tweet really a lot 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.729
 what improves even multitasking 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.740
 conventional maybe not so pretty 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.420
 because we go back to the multitasking of 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.789
 yesterday in 6 but it seems much more 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.069
 practical with a single gesture have here the 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.990
 integrated multitasking in this fantastic 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.270
 control center that I like every time 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.319
 much more a super recommended tweet and 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.030
 nothing here I say goodbye I hope that I have 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.530
 liked the video if it is like that, support us with 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.360
 I like to share this video with 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.130
 your friends and see you in a 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.970
 next video of neixÃ³n ago punto net 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.570
 bye 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.570
