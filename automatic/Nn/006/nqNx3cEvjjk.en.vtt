00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.730
 bringing a video tutorial to 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.860
 You and in today's video I'm going to teach 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.009
 how is the equipment released there? 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.650
 new kit of the engineer kit 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.130
 This equipment is called mna or 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.130
 aerial mine not thus producing it 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.289
 it is theirs and naval stryker that in 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.970
 last update to 10 if allowed 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.039
 release for prizes 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.219
 So these are the foods that have to 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.860
 be done that are the three followed by 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.280
 atp that are more self-defense weapons 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.550
 destroy five air strike vehicles 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.739
 That's the only thing with rocket launchers. 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.110
 for those who do not know are the weapons of 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.500
 more personal defense and this weapon kit 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.980
 only for the engineer class too 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:57.020
 repeating 3 gbp insignia that are these 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.600
 weapons there and destroy five vehicles 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.239
 attacking air vehicles is only remembering 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.970
 have to be of the same type attack 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.159
 the support helicopter does not 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.650
 You're not going to tell that to health. 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.930
 then this equipment does not have 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.240
 not very strong but it does damage 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.009
 and the good that it puts very fast and 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.619
 take off very fast as you are seeing 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.750
 then the guy despaired took a 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.040
 Helicopter hopped hopped and I killed him 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.220
 I'm sorry for choosing this one. 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.470

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.270
