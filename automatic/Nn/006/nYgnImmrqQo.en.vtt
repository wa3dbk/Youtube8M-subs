I<00:00:17.009> spent<00:00:18.009> quite<00:00:18.160> a<00:00:18.279> while<00:00:18.580> calculating<00:00:19.000> and

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
I spent quite a while calculating and

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.200 
I spent quite a while calculating and

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.380 

I'm<00:00:29.789> laying<00:00:30.119> out<00:00:30.300> foundation

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
I'm laying out foundation

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.350 
I'm laying out foundation
two<00:00:31.480> containers<00:00:31.990> to<00:00:32.439> go<00:00:32.619> end-to-end

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
two containers to go end-to-end

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:43.440 
two containers to go end-to-end
overlooking<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:34.510> view

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.330 

when<00:00:44.450> I<00:00:44.480> marked<00:00:44.900> out<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.110> first<00:00:45.530> site<00:00:45.829> I<00:00:45.860> used

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
when I marked out the first site I used

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.910 
when I marked out the first site I used
lots<00:00:46.610> of<00:00:46.850> string<00:00:47.210> guides<00:00:47.510> this<00:00:48.440> time<00:00:48.710> I've

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
lots of string guides this time I've

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.190 
lots of string guides this time I've
learned<00:00:49.280> from<00:00:49.520> that<00:00:49.580> experience<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:50.630> I'm

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
learned from that experience and I'm

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.310 
learned from that experience and I'm
using<00:00:51.559> single<00:00:52.550> lengths<00:00:53.030> guides<00:00:53.390> which<00:00:53.989> makes

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
using single lengths guides which makes

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.090 
using single lengths guides which makes
it<00:00:54.530> much<00:00:54.680> quicker<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.220> easier<00:00:55.340> I<00:00:56.800> dug<00:00:57.800> holes

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
it much quicker and easier I dug holes

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.270 
it much quicker and easier I dug holes
for<00:00:58.520> foundations<00:00:59.269> which<00:00:59.510> are<00:00:59.690> 500<00:01:00.320> by<00:01:00.470> 500<00:01:00.769> by
