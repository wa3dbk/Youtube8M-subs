00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.589
 certainly not yet affected in 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:14.490
 mouth every picture then excuse me 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:17.059
 I put back to the thing that sucks though ad screen 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.059
 region 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:37.860
 I don't know nothing goes wrong to describe not 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:48.300
 go and pine those who made screen 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:53.640
 their region wants the last three 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.379
 we are always those scenes 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.640
 two three seconds delay 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.039
 ok i did the battery while you see it 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.879
 which was this qua install that 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.879
 put at 3 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.920
 1214 ok ok guys I have my arm 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.880
 mechanical working as a pick is true 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.710
 that if you put it there it will not make the pick 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.300
 shoot some people shoot at you ok 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.880
 found and put the battery of entered 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:33.870
 it is however not pietta of rimetter 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.160
 the ability of the pp if I'm not mistaken if it is 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.160
 it should be one of many 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:52.290
 however, I confirm that it looks good well 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:54.600
 as someone knows how little a book is 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.420
 they call the book but no one who bores you 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:08.070
 but does not look for excellent local scripting 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:11.910
 book air so an out backstreet the psr 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.560
 belcredi ebook is but was not native was 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.420
 a feather is a book by name alone is not 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.880
 more so there is no crafting you need a 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:23.790
 to do this you need to do the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:31.049
 booking to the bucolic Mukden 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:33.870
 of the mayor we see the ox joined 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:37.290
 images put it in Genoa from three 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.700
 ferries what it says to do it 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.700
 to sell off 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.420
 then do this I have it classic 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.020
 look at the moment can put two there 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:57.750
 then he wants when I just put them on 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:00.750
 the skin and the beautiful sheets and sheets then 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:05.940
 skin and two gatherings sheets we know and then 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:10.080
 I immediately feel like a sheet of paper 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.930
 once the skin puts it to the left no yes 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:20.780
 on the right you file a sheet in fact 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.780
 seen put the sheets no as hell was 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.680
 giovanni then go to the sheet the iphone 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.060
 they want me to put on the gray 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:35.580
 big on that big gray thing you are 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:38.430
 yes it has a right hand sheet and then 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.260
 from the name use o gives them the name or a 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.080
 torino even later in the ex ebook makes it 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.860
 things is marco velieri and crafting 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.860
 very hard 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.850
 I almost create a world myself but 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.049
 who fuck me or why only you 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.850
 I myself because I wanted to go 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.100

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.269
 book we make it so i 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.000

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:08.070
 a moment away how it will serve I have to pick up 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.959
 and how to make chopsticks 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.060
 I remember more 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.329

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.739
 below ok if they commanded an image of 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.739

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:35.470
 the green book is done raining blacks dark 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:40.000
 I came to the arm 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:43.710
 totÃ² here this langer three are investigated 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.010

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.020
 minecraft volumes but what a mess 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:53.290
 I never have to restart a book 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.760
 green for the return or not that I am 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.460
 badly poisoned gradually 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:02.470
 our nerd world but why all 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:05.290

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.860
 rino via cassino si va bene remained 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.930
 a certain openness opens me nothing more 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.440
 I have the god I speak it all 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:18.310
 crooked guys not all drunk yes but 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.660
 like from this so that their vein 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.900
 track once there was the world of 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.140
