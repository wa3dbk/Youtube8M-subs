00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.040
 we have such a tricky device 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.820
 which is called what scream communication 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.940
 bought a year ago 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.980
 production conditionally call one very 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.980
 just making if hands grow out 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.210
 right place 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.250
 clear instruction not to deal with was not 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.260
 so the heat part had to 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.560
 realize on my own but about this i 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.630
 mom skin so consider us vacu 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.750
 closer we have a tin box of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.160
 galvanized tin it is very important also 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.260
 galvanized in this business use 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.170
 it is impossible to be cut off when heated 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.120
 zinc products rather galvanized 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.850
 emits toxic substance ie 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.010
 the products you smoke in 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.090
 this smoking box 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:56.250
 let's call it so may become a soft aria 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.079
 David them about the material most important 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.800
 place is a construction in my opinion all 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.339
 this life is pretty thin 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.100
 nakara thin that is if feathers 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.909
 a little thicker block is probably nicer and 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.220
 more interesting so well here as we see 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.060
 the cap on the cap will immediately receive a relay 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:22.049
 cork to remove the cover normally 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.479
 when it is heated by heating it 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.970
 very hot so without cork you can 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.970
 get burned and so look inside 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.659
 see mesh 2 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:54.270
 pallet pallet is needed in order to fat with 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.110
 products did not drip burning logs then 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:03.840
 I will tell further in more detail but also on 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:07.079
 the cover see the hooks the author does not 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.410
 bother to be ahead of making of 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.989
 I will immediately tell you that the nets 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.599
 principle do not use deliver only 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.459
 in order to show you in principle 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.849
 opportunity implemented such that 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.950
 lay down on different levels if you see 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.660
 that is, on the edge at different distances from 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.379
 heated surface from dust on 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:34.400
 here directly visible depth log 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.400
 Now I will also tell you more 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:44.489
 now about the smoke for donated came 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.299
 You can buy a regular market oven at 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.299
 any bazaar 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:55.040
 deficiency is not how 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:03:05.190
 put me on top of the stove puts on 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:06.630
 data which only needs height 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.140
 fine not complex 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.459
 now show 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.680
 thousand to is thus driven away 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.250
 maximum contact with pour 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.400
 the surface is thus realized 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.890
 further heating as expressed 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.660
 system take fell on fruit tree 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.709
 In this case, someone cherry cherry on not 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:37.040
 I remember exactly but warms up the market 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:43.830
 pussy take a pallet to collect fat 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:47.220
 can light in order to same with the product 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:52.760
 did not drip right on the log after that 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.760
 lattice case 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.000
 we use dreams i use hooks 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:10.200
 either hang a product on a hook 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.600
 must first be processed 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.490
 depending on the recipe but still 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:20.370
 before smoking not about them 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:24.330
 necessary to wrap could the whole thing 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:27.390
 we cover and turn on the stove network stove 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.580
 night warm polina respectively 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.050
 glues as a result in this cabinet 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.390
 thermo gas chamber is obtained 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.690
 the characteristics of this camera are pretty 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.440
 quite good in said lets pretty for 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.180
 short term 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.170
 prepare the product we need for example 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.570
 we did 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.530
 homemade hot smoked picture 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.960
 but she smoked conditionally 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.670
 saying colder than here and those 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.420
 products that can be made for 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.350
 several hours 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.450
 there have been a day or two 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:07.320
 Well, all as a result I will say that the thing is very 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:10.770
 worthy is not scary a little thin 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.910
 big i'm also very simple if 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.750
 interested in measurements 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.080
 write in a comment or do in a personal 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.080
 roller
