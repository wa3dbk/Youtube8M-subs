00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
it did was he took the back off you put

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.210 
it did was he took the back off you put
the<00:00:24.210> batteries<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:25.439> unwound<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.949> cord

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
the batteries in you unwound the cord

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.070 
the batteries in you unwound the cord
and<00:00:26.820> whatever<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.269> stuck<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.779> turned<00:00:27.960> it

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
and whatever this stuck to it turned it

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.710 
and whatever this stuck to it turned it
into<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.289> speaker<00:00:28.670> with<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> brand<00:00:30.029> new<00:00:30.240> rocket

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
into a speaker with the brand new rocket

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.269 
into a speaker with the brand new rocket
would<00:00:30.929> basically<00:00:31.140> improved<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.070> shape

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
would basically improved on the shape

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.549 
would basically improved on the shape
improved<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.210> winding<00:00:33.630> capability<00:00:34.230> and

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
improved on the winding capability and

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.170 
improved on the winding capability and
we've<00:00:34.680> made<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.920> sleeker<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.430> smaller<00:00:35.910> and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
we've made it sleeker and smaller and

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.180 
we've made it sleeker and smaller and
better<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.809> now<00:00:37.469> how<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.649> rocket<00:00:38.040> works

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
better for you now how the rocket works

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.000 
better for you now how the rocket works
is<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:39.360> rocket<00:00:39.690> pod<00:00:39.899> unsnaps<00:00:40.530> from<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.860> main

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
is the rocket pod unsnaps from the main

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.369 
is the rocket pod unsnaps from the main
body<00:00:41.040> like<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.700> whatever<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.750> sticks<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.200> it

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
body like so whatever this sticks to it

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.810 
body like so whatever this sticks to it
will<00:00:43.469> turn<00:00:43.590> anything<00:00:43.920> literally<00:00:44.579> anything

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
will turn anything literally anything

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.170 
will turn anything literally anything
into<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.809> speaker<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:47.760> plug<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.059> in

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
into a speaker so you can plug it in

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.020 
into a speaker so you can plug it in
with<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> standard<00:00:49.079> headphone<00:00:49.379> jack<00:00:49.559> cord
