one was I'm like a one more home would
like<00:01:03.879> a<00:01:03.909> heavy<00:01:04.269> protein<00:01:04.899> and<00:01:05.140> then<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.830> other

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
like a heavy protein and then the other

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.670 
like a heavy protein and then the other
one<00:01:06.539> it's<00:01:07.539> kind<00:01:07.659> of<00:01:07.750> like<00:01:07.899> it<00:01:08.080> like<00:01:08.229> protein

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
one it's kind of like it like protein

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.889 
one it's kind of like it like protein
and<00:01:08.860> both<00:01:09.070> of<00:01:09.100> them<00:01:09.369> at<00:01:09.580> that<00:01:09.789> time<00:01:10.119> that<00:01:10.869> I

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
and both of them at that time that I

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.690 
and both of them at that time that I
used<00:01:11.289> it<00:01:11.470> because<00:01:11.619> I<00:01:11.800> try<00:01:12.039> them<00:01:12.250> like<00:01:12.490> three

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
used it because I try them like three

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.559 
used it because I try them like three
times<00:01:12.940> each<00:01:13.240> they<00:01:13.990> were<00:01:14.050> all<00:01:14.319> to<00:01:15.569> protein

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:16.569 
times each they were all to protein

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:19.289 
times each they were all to protein
sensitive<00:01:17.200> for<00:01:17.380> me<00:01:17.560> so<00:01:18.069> that's<00:01:18.310> why<00:01:18.490> i'm<00:01:18.789> not

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
sensitive for me so that's why i'm not

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.690 
sensitive for me so that's why i'm not
using<00:01:19.600> those<00:01:19.840> conditioners<00:01:20.500> anymore<00:01:20.979> so<00:01:21.670> I

said you know what let me give red came
one<00:01:23.679> more<00:01:23.890> time<00:01:24.100> before<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.490> write<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.880> muffin

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
one more time before I write the muffin

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.660 
one more time before I write the muffin
write<00:01:26.080> them<00:01:26.229> off<00:01:26.409> my<00:01:26.649> conditioner<00:01:27.220> list<00:01:27.490> of

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
write them off my conditioner list of

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.059 
write them off my conditioner list of
not<00:01:27.909> to<00:01:28.119> try<00:01:28.420> anymore<00:01:28.720> so<00:01:29.440> I<00:01:29.470> went<00:01:29.679> out<00:01:29.860> there

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
not to try anymore so I went out there

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:33.139 
not to try anymore so I went out there
and<00:01:30.130> got<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.909> Greg<00:01:31.179> Kihn<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:32.110> butter<00:01:32.350> tree<00:01:32.709> and

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
and got a Greg Kihn the butter tree and

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.850 
and got a Greg Kihn the butter tree and
it<00:01:34.149> comes<00:01:34.360> like<00:01:34.569> in<00:01:34.720> this<00:01:34.869> brown<00:01:35.229> container

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
it comes like in this brown container

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.080 
it comes like in this brown container
and<00:01:36.250> it<00:01:36.789> says<00:01:37.030> um<00:01:37.740> redken<00:01:38.740> smooth<00:01:39.580> down<00:01:39.759> it's

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
and it says um redken smooth down it's

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.480 
and it says um redken smooth down it's
the<00:01:40.240> smooth<00:01:40.539> dloan<00:01:41.020> lying<00:01:41.679> because<00:01:42.130> they<00:01:42.219> have

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
the smooth dloan lying because they have

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.099 
the smooth dloan lying because they have
like<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.700> curly<00:01:43.060> in<00:01:43.270> line<00:01:43.420> they<00:01:43.719> have<00:01:43.899> like<00:01:44.079> a

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
like a curly in line they have like a

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.170 
like a curly in line they have like a
strengthening<00:01:44.710> line<00:01:45.100> but<00:01:45.700> this<00:01:45.850> is<00:01:46.030> the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
strengthening line but this is the

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.359 
strengthening line but this is the
smooth<00:01:46.509> down<00:01:46.750> so<00:01:47.350> that's<00:01:47.560> why<00:01:47.680> i<00:01:47.710> also<00:01:47.920> got<00:01:48.219> it

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
smooth down so that's why i also got it

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:49.889 
smooth down so that's why i also got it
because<00:01:48.609> i'm<00:01:48.759> thinking<00:01:49.119> smooth<00:01:49.420> down<00:01:49.630> and

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
because i'm thinking smooth down and

this is the butter tree and it's a
smoothing<00:01:56.579> treatment<00:01:57.579> it<00:01:58.030> helps<00:01:58.299> for<00:01:58.539> strong

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
smoothing treatment it helps for strong

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
you're out there and you're protein

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.930 
you're out there and you're protein
sensitive<00:06:16.180> like<00:06:16.389> me<00:06:16.419> um<00:06:17.279> this<00:06:18.279> conditioner

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
sensitive like me um this conditioner

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.059 
sensitive like me um this conditioner
does<00:06:19.300> not<00:06:19.539> have<00:06:19.779> any<00:06:19.990> proteins<00:06:20.529> in<00:06:20.710> that<00:06:20.860> mean

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.069 
does not have any proteins in that mean

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:24.749 
does not have any proteins in that mean
is<00:06:21.610> it<00:06:21.759> every<00:06:21.969> important<00:06:23.099> no<00:06:24.099> it<00:06:24.250> doesn't<00:06:24.639> have

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:24.759 
is it every important no it doesn't have

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.820 
is it every important no it doesn't have
any<00:06:24.969> proteins<00:06:25.539> in<00:06:25.719> it<00:06:25.839> and<00:06:26.050> so<00:06:26.259> it's<00:06:26.500> just<00:06:26.650> all

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
any proteins in it and so it's just all

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.980 
any proteins in it and so it's just all
straight<00:06:27.490> up<00:06:27.610> moisture<00:06:27.879> and<00:06:28.300> conditioning<00:06:28.839> if

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
straight up moisture and conditioning if

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.679 
straight up moisture and conditioning if
you<00:06:29.529> want<00:06:29.740> strength<00:06:30.219> if<00:06:30.490> you<00:06:30.819> want<00:06:31.060> something

you want strength if you want something

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:33.179 
you want strength if you want something
to<00:06:31.839> give<00:06:32.080> your<00:06:32.169> protein<00:06:32.560> and<00:06:32.740> strength<00:06:33.039> you

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:33.189 
to give your protein and strength you

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:35.730 
to give your protein and strength you
have<00:06:33.219> to<00:06:33.339> go<00:06:33.490> use<00:06:33.699> the<00:06:33.729> other<00:06:34.740> redken

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
have to go use the other redken

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.790 
those ones have proteins if you want
protein<00:06:39.969> strength<00:06:40.599> you<00:06:41.289> have<00:06:41.319> to<00:06:41.469> go<00:06:41.589> use<00:06:41.770> the

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 
protein strength you have to go use the

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.260 
protein strength you have to go use the
other<00:06:41.979> ones<00:06:42.219> but<00:06:42.279> if<00:06:42.460> you<00:06:42.550> just<00:06:42.699> want<00:06:42.789> straight
