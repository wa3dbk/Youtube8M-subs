00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.130
 hi friends from youtube greets them 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.170
 friend elvis what in January today they 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.240
 I bring a video in which I will explain a 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.059
 little theory he called foxy 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.230
 our colleague aching good no more 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.230
 preambles let's start 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.900
 before starting and explaining this theory 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.390
 we must know from which one we are 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.149
 speaking and in this case this is the one of 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.669
 video game five nights in phoenix good 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.800
 in short words five nights in 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.650
 Fredys is a horror video game that 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.960
 it became very popular quickly but today it does not 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.780
 we will talk about the game but about the character 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.909
 already mentioned foxy first let's review a 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.030
 little what the appearance of foxy says 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:50.250
 according to the wiki as its name indicates foxy 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.920
 is a great animatronic fox with brown 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.199
 reddish tattered skin has a 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.030
 hook as his right hand and a patch 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.790
 in the eye that bends over your 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.619
 right eye he is usually seen with 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.049
 him over his eye instead of 

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:05.850
 cover the fox and wear linen pants 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.729
 brown color that are especially 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.619
 crushed in the legs he seems 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.590
 be damaged as part of your machinery 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.479
 are exposed you can see clearly 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.970
 that his legs are completely 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.430
 naked exposing the endoskeleton of 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.049
 metal his chest was ripped in some 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.390
 places that the endoskeleton shows 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.850
 below and your arms and stomach are 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.010
 separate also seems to have a 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.690
 broken lower jaw so it's from 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.330
 way that the mouth can not close 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.460
 correctly it also seems to have a 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.680
 left eyelid slightly fallen 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.870
 after having heard this 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.120
 we could say that foxy has received 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.890
 a lot of damage to your physical structure and 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.440
 that this one is damaged and his friends 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.300
 not animatronic but this brings me to a 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.580
 theory that has to do with all the 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.710
 game and it's the following according to the 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.690
 story of the game or rather the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.380
 guy on the phone tells us what happened 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.360
 an incident in the year 1987 in which 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.640
 an animatronic caused damage to a 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.070
 person and since that day nothing has been 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.680
 same with this information I take the 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.409
 next foxy theory was the animatronic 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.420
 that damaged that person so I say this 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.580
 because fox and is the most animatronic 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.950
 dangerous of all because it has a 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.019
 sharp weapon as right hand its 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.840
 hook or what a pirate would call it 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.580
 is this a grapple then after 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.700
 fox and it will cause harm to the person 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.890
 in 87 this one was separated from his others 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.590
 animatronic and abandoned friends so that 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.670
 the Fredys pizzeria was not demanded of 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.980
 sure the owner of the 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.230
 it would be what sent him to hit some of the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.060
 anger that I had and that's why it's fox and 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.910
 some parts of his body are missing 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.220
 electronic but this one was not all 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.110
 rejected was only put behind the 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.180
 curtain the pirate cover and opposite 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.700
 They put an off-service sign 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.010
 so that nobody would see it after giving 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.530
 that theory now I can pose well 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.620
 the theory that he called foxy our 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.470
 colleague aching but first let's analyze 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.480
 something according to the guy on the phone is 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.880
 prohibited that animatronics platform without 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.980
 his suit so if they see a 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.930
 human will confuse him with an animatronic 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.360
 no suit and they will put it in one 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.519
 necessarily to kill him then seeing 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.620
 now let's move on to something else that says 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.780
 wiki about a possible theory of why 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.480
 foxy is hidden and not put in 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.400
 exhibit like your big fellows 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.549
 parts of the foxy endoskeleton are 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.650
 visible mainly the legs if 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.510
 phone guy is correct to inform 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.489
 the player who is against the 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.620
 rules of an endoskeleton being without a 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.290
 suit may be possible for the others 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.380
 animatronics would try to push foxy on 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.440
 another suit and rum 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.360
 since you do not remove your current suit this 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.580
 could you tell us that foxx and is in the 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.830
 same danger as us and that's why 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.230
 he hides from his supposed friends but 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.180
 many of you will wonder why 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.940
 foxx and also attacks us and does not help us 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.980
 The answer is very simple this 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.350
 it also attacks us because this one is 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.150
 programmed like their peers if 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.490
 he sees an animatronic without his suit 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.190
 he is obliged to put one on him since 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.170
 it is forbidden to walk without it but according to 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.150
 this must be highlighted a point 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.580
 important and that is that in the game 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.920
 they handle two antagonist controls which 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.380
 we could call constituted principal 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.720
 by freddy girl and bobby and the side that 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.760
 I like to call the lonely side that 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.610
 would be the one that is only constituted by 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.710
 fox and good now I will give the explanation 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.540
 Fock's why if you not afraid that 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.850
 we see it in motion and it's running 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.250
 so fast towards the door the reason is 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.350
 because he knows we are watching and 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.480
 it will wait for my girl and freddy 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.520
 neither I nor can you see this one will take advantage 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.510
 that opportunity to get out of the curtain 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.400
 the pirate cover 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.620
 and go running at full speed 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.660
 is able to kill us if not 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.090
 we close the door so that it does not 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.949
 can enter this will try to hit the 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.720
 door gently to try the 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.880
 to collapse but at the same time that freddy and 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.040
 others do not listen to it like this one 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.990
 that does not succeed in opening the door it 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.330
 will return at full speed to its place 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.910
 safe behind the pirate curtain 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.770
 good kobe now something that for sure 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.060
 and some wondered why 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.550
 I call this theory 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.860
 foxx and our colleague sore because 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.500
 our colleague if this one also us 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.660
 tries to kill Well I put the 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.970
 part of colleague because if the characters 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.070
 Game do something more than 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.530
 are programmed could do others 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.780
 things one thing that could do our 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.789
 character would be that like this is 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.130
 fired on the seventh night by according to 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.800
 the boss manipulating the animatronic 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.289
 someone else would go to his place and this one 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.510
 I would know what this would feel like then 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.669
 if I can change the difficulty of the 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.889
 animatronics this could change the 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.870
 foxx standards and doing that instead of 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.970
 put everyone who does not have a suit 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.870
 one that would destroy or tear those who 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.120
 they have one 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.050
 excluding the clearing thus making 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.419
 foxx and sean 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.699
 on his back and could destroy freddy 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.860
 and his gang or rather fox and he 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.560
 would become our aching colleague 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.720
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.759
 video comment on how you like this 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.370
 theory about the foxy character of the 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:09.360
 video game five nights in phoenix we 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.360
 we see and until the next
