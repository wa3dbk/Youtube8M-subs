00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.960 
magazine here it is that now I was look
look<00:00:19.439> at<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.619> fun<00:00:19.770> page<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.130> felt<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.730> front

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
look at the fun page I felt the front

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.170 
look at the fun page I felt the front
page<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.300> feels<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.539> bit<00:00:21.630> weird<00:00:21.830> I<00:00:23.180> think

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
page and it feels a bit weird I think

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.019 
page and it feels a bit weird I think
that<00:00:24.330> could<00:00:24.480> be<00:00:26.000> um<00:00:27.680> just<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.849> texture<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
that could be um just the texture of the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.979 
that could be um just the texture of the
black<00:00:30.240> though<00:00:30.510> anyway<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:32.989> unnoticeable

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
black though anyway I unnoticeable

equate<00:00:34.320> i<00:00:34.350> read<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> front<00:00:34.860> curve<00:00:35.010> when<00:00:35.130> it

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
equate i read the front curve when it

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.240 
equate i read the front curve when it
says<00:00:35.780> 3d<00:00:36.780> cover<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.290> apparently<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.190> a
