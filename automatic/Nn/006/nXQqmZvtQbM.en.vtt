well<00:02:29.170> well<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.200> think<00:02:30.410> coach<00:02:30.770> had<00:02:30.980> made<00:02:31.160> it

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
well well I think coach had made it

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.040 
well well I think coach had made it
really<00:02:31.430> easy<00:02:31.550> for<00:02:31.730> me<00:02:32.030> because<00:02:32.180> he<00:02:32.600> wants<00:02:32.900> me

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
really easy for me because he wants me

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.840 
really easy for me because he wants me
to<00:02:33.260> look<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.650> score<00:02:33.980> first<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.490> you<00:02:34.580> know<00:02:34.700> he

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
to look the score first and you know he

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.750 
to look the score first and you know he
always<00:02:35.030> sits<00:02:35.810> in<00:02:35.990> my<00:02:36.140> head<00:02:36.320> that<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.830> my

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
always sits in my head that that my

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.490 
always sits in my head that that my
first<00:02:38.060> option<00:02:38.420> is<00:02:38.510> always<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.930> look<00:02:39.050> to<00:02:39.200> score

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
first option is always to look to score

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.530 
first option is always to look to score
and<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.220> makes<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.520> a<00:02:40.580> lot<00:02:40.820> easier<00:02:40.880> when<00:02:41.390> you're

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
and it makes it a lot easier when you're

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.050 
and it makes it a lot easier when you're
looking<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:41.870> score<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.650> then<00:02:42.890> defenders<00:02:43.850> have

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
looking to score and then defenders have

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.090 
looking to score and then defenders have
to<00:02:44.180> play<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:44.480> for<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.500> then<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:45.830> makes

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
to play you for that and then that makes

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.310 
to play you for that and then that makes
it<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.310> lot<00:02:46.430> easier<00:02:46.610> for<00:02:46.820> me<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.060> find<00:02:47.360> my<00:02:47.510> open
