00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.360
 Good day friends and this is a fashion course 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.900
 sketch my name i am with you artside game with 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.759
 center of creative development and our theme 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.140
 video 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.740
 installation features of a figure in fashion 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.740
 drawings 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.810
 designer drawing is different from 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.640
 classical or academic its still 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.470
 called drawing shapes and not only 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.989
 elongated proportions instead 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.840
 oh vivo 8 how it took 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.180
 taken in academic drawings from us 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.469
 eight and a half 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:49.469
 more often 9 or even all 10 12 all dependencies 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.250
 from copyright liberties that even 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.780
 welcome as a stylistic find or 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.260
 Another very special handwriting of the author 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.120
 The important difference with the flash figure is 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.970
 generalizing planar interpretation 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.160
 image conditional statement of a figure in 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.259
 dynamics or statics depending on 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.060
 your tasks 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:18.660
 character suit on some details 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.840
 which simply need to be shown when 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.050
 image is very important to choose the movement 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.990
 correct view of the model it can be 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.560
 static setting based on two 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.410
 legs 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.679
 such as you see now either 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.929
 dynamic 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.170
 and sometimes and according to us on one 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.170
 a leg 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.640
 When drawing a figure, special attention 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.440
 needed to be able to till on the line 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.440
 which is axis balance 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.360
 which passes 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.310
 which is the center of gravity of the figure 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.920
 it runs in the center of the jugular fossa 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.900
 down to the intersection with the horizontal 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.940
 line connecting the fulcrum 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.880
 usually takes a foothold 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.770
 plane stop and an important moment when 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.170
 image shapes and speakers 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:22.239
 very important that the center of gravity 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:25.360
 accounted for the foot which is 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:30.880
 support simply need it in order 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:33.700
 so that our figure does not fall the middle line 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.310
 from the figure can have a configuration like 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.459
 straight smoothly 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.820
 so and s-shaped if you only 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.019
 start drawing something hard enough 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.110
 to depict the model in dynamics 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.329
 at the same time take into account the proportion 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.970
 which provided for fashion 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.400
 drawings and also not forget about 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.620
 anatomical features because despite 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.980
 the fact that fashion design implies 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.190
 some convention and and stylization in 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.650
 Images 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.910
 image of knowledge on dance from throwing 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.910
 man still needed 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.290
 if you find an interesting head tilt 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.540
 the position of the arms of the legs even with static 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.750
 put them can be very impressive 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:27.240
 demonstrate complex silhouette and 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.470
 style directions original forms 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.370
 but our task 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.590
 portray the figure in dynamics exactly on 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.570
 figures to in active movement most 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.730
 impressively look complex bulk 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:45.220
 uniforms and modern silhouette and costumes 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.960
 our static figure is depicted in 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.410
 proportions eight and a half 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.560
 for the module is taken head in the dynamics we 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:58.390
 let's depict as 9 parts 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:00.550
 9 modules now I will draw lines with 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.160
 help and identify some points 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.650
 auxiliary points due to which 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.650
 we will facilitate drawing in dynamics 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.750
 wall 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.180
 I have defined points for myself and 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.510
 auxiliary lines that will be me 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.410
 hint when drawing shapes in 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:43.750
 the dynamics I have drawn for myself 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:46.360
 scribbled lines that will be me 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:52.580
 talk about proportions 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.720
 divided into 9 parts and now stand 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.950
 that he points 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.950
 already in the position that I conceived 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:24.540
 we had a static figure we 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.470
 identified points that are certain 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:32.610
 hinges 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:35.340
 these are the shoulders the elbows and the knees the line of the hips and in 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.650
 according to our chosen 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.669
 position we have such a here 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.800
 a kind of skeleton lined in view 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.979
 prospects 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.560
 note that the shoulder line is no longer 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:51.690
 parallel to the hips as a figure in 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:57.330
 dynamics and the middle line 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:06:03.150
 the axis of the figure has an s-shaped configuration 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:08.210
 and the support falls somewhere closer to this 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.210
 leg somewhere here in this part 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.150
 so having points and 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.720
 auxiliary lines we go from 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.630
 reverse 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.080
 and it remains for us to increase this basis 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.080
 masses 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.990
 the guests 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.990
 these 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:05.870
 in exactly this way as an option you can 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:11.210
 portray the figure absolutely in any 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:13.930
 position you can even take any 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.729
 magazine photos identify 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.160
 auxiliary points and with ease 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:22.930
 to transfer 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:25.460
 repeat this movement in your drawing 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.979
 today we drew a figure in dynamics 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.010
 with you was the pit center creative 

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:33.190
 development arcade gras paint draw 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:36.190
 a lot and you will succeed 

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.190
 until
