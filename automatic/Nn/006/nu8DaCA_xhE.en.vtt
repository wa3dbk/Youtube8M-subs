00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 ladies gentlemen welcome to this 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.580
 overexposed video only mine 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.230
 very first tuesday tip so would be nice 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.970
 if you like it and one 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.740
 green thumb are really nice 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.400
 what did I tip girl in the Tuesday 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.170
 the description bit unclear though 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.170
 this hummer is controllable 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.150
 I just want to talk about the design 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.829
 talk because the design is so cool to me 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.239
 done because you are kind of 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.070
 to a minimum 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.739
 know i feel that stuff up to mirror glass 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.850
 sorry you see if it seems to the 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.800
 showroom model disadvantage of this whole thing 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.589
 is it is unpacking 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.629
 well the outside that goes on itself 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.909
 but there i will say what it is after 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.570
 the wax of this hummer she had 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:56.960
 this thing will fix on this car 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.339
 then you have to imagine that this is done 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.019
 this thing this block to if you like it so 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.269
 then it cannot drive on the ground 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.280
 what he touches the ground 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.930
 so this must have looked off 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.670
 for the screws in every entrances 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.200
 well i couldn't find a screwdriver 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.710
 who fitted it so I just got it 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.380
 but with this pair of tongs I finish it 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.130
 had to cut to be able to do that block 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.079
 remove 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.180
 so that really wasn't 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.400
 user now makes itself 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.110
 it all no ass from the cart 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.350
 also has a and yes control and in 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.579
 control to do 4 ah batteries so they 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.890
 I just bought in the store 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.340
 because yes he knows people have it 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.909
 always is without batteries 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.439
 well then let's see if this well then 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.659
 you must be on a no with one or one 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.210
 button and so let's get that thing 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.979
 of testing whether you are actually driving 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.990
 well okay 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.429
 just show it live i click to 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.429
 for pro 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.130
 and the wheels 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.130
 we also like it 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.820
 Cute device is to say 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.860
 but this is very easy to control 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.959
 this is forward and this is from the left 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.390
 to the right where you are sitting on top one 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.519
 button and the hull you make sure 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.739
 he gets a fine there is a button 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.989
 also you would see the light and impression 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.170
 it says on live lite 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.540
 so that that is done to let just 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.430
 the tests that are very on the floor covering 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.160
 He shares well but the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.420
 turns that makes it very difficult if 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.569
 he does the speed boost as well 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.250
 all just the yes spinning that you 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.140
 just really want on a flat floor 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.959
 you worth your driving too 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.540
 backwards is very difficult and you 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.630
 not much better outside 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.160
 Control involves crazy for with 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.329
 their those stones also you though I give one too 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.880
 send 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:54.019
 see if you know it does it too 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.019
 steering is very difficult 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.349
 after it was also pretty funny because bartender 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.200
 placed an order and it appears 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.939
 so that a hummer was added 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.590
 a black is actually not that whole 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:20.370
 strong gadget 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.379
 but it does work and that is important 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.519
 so you actually want a very cheap one 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:28.560
 and have a nice gadget and love you 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.090
 board jobs things like a little one 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.170
 you keep it from you very little 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:38.790
 take up space then I would say he 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.540
 is around 15 euros is almost no money 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.909
 it's just a lot of fun 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.280
 gadget and especially if you do 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.590
 I would have two then yes I would 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.379
 found there could race each other or something 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.700
 but yes with that wheel it was with you 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.120
 I think it's going to be difficult 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.120
 and therefore 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.070
 I hope not 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.890
 the 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.890
 on
