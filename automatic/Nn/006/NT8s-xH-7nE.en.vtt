00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550 

Oh

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:02.560 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.129 

I<00:00:04.439> just<00:00:05.439> got<00:00:05.620> a<00:00:05.649> set<00:00:06.009> of<00:00:06.189> the<00:00:06.370> new<00:00:07.139> 9450

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:08.139 
I just got a set of the new 9450

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:09.840 
I just got a set of the new 9450
high-performance<00:00:08.980> propellers<00:00:09.549> and<00:00:09.580> I'm

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:09.850 
high-performance propellers and I'm

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.840 
high-performance propellers and I'm
going<00:00:10.180> to<00:00:10.240> do<00:00:10.389> a<00:00:10.420> little<00:00:10.540> test<00:00:11.049> to<00:00:11.230> compare<00:00:11.850> the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:12.850 
going to do a little test to compare the

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.710 
going to do a little test to compare the
stock<00:00:13.150> propellers<00:00:13.869> to<00:00:14.080> the<00:00:14.199> new<00:00:14.379> 94<00:00:15.070> 50s<00:00:15.639> I<00:00:15.879> can

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
stock propellers to the new 94 50s I can

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.099 
stock propellers to the new 94 50s I can
tell<00:00:16.960> you<00:00:17.080> that<00:00:17.260> the<00:00:17.380> 94<00:00:17.920> 50s<00:00:18.490> are<00:00:18.849> more<00:00:19.300> rigid

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:20.109 
tell you that the 94 50s are more rigid

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.849 
tell you that the 94 50s are more rigid
than<00:00:20.140> the<00:00:21.130> originals<00:00:22.320> somewhat<00:00:23.320> like<00:00:23.349> a

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
than the originals somewhat like a

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.849 
than the originals somewhat like a
carbon<00:00:24.490> fiber<00:00:24.880> may<00:00:25.329> be<00:00:25.599> so<00:00:26.349> I'm<00:00:26.470> not<00:00:26.619> sure<00:00:26.679> what

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
carbon fiber may be so I'm not sure what

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.089 
carbon fiber may be so I'm not sure what
the<00:00:27.160> characteristics<00:00:27.999> will<00:00:28.179> be<00:00:28.679> but<00:00:29.679> the<00:00:29.829> test

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
the characteristics will be but the test

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.569 
the characteristics will be but the test
is<00:00:30.279> going<00:00:30.519> to<00:00:30.699> involve<00:00:30.939> just<00:00:31.509> a<00:00:31.630> quick<00:00:32.579> ground

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
is going to involve just a quick ground

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:40.020 
is going to involve just a quick ground
level<00:00:34.060> 2<00:00:34.300> 400<00:00:34.990> foot<00:00:36.210> climb<00:00:37.210> test<00:00:37.930> and<00:00:39.030> right

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
level 2 400 foot climb test and right

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.080 
level 2 400 foot climb test and right
now<00:00:40.090> on<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.630> quad<00:00:40.900> are<00:00:41.560> the<00:00:41.860> stock<00:00:42.160> drops<00:00:42.610> so

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
now on the quad are the stock drops so

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.060 
now on the quad are the stock drops so
I'm<00:00:43.180> going<00:00:43.420> to<00:00:43.450> do<00:00:43.600> that<00:00:43.780> test<00:00:44.050> first<00:00:44.380> I'm

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
I'm going to do that test first I'm

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.060 
I'm going to do that test first I'm
going<00:00:45.310> to<00:00:45.370> go<00:00:45.550> straight<00:00:46.090> out<00:00:46.270> about<00:00:47.020> the<00:00:47.470> 50<00:00:48.040> or

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
going to go straight out about the 50 or

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.730 
going to go straight out about the 50 or
75<00:00:48.580> feet<00:00:49.060> and<00:00:49.510> then<00:00:49.870> I'm<00:00:49.990> going<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.230> just<00:00:50.440> time

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
75 feet and then I'm going to just time

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.180 
75 feet and then I'm going to just time
and<00:00:51.040> ascent<00:00:51.490> up<00:00:51.700> to<00:00:51.760> 400<00:00:52.480> feet<00:00:52.950> will<00:00:53.950> be<00:00:54.070> able

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
and ascent up to 400 feet will be able

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.040 
and ascent up to 400 feet will be able
to<00:00:54.370> see<00:00:54.640> some<00:00:54.850> more<00:00:55.000> detail<00:00:55.420> on<00:00:55.450> that<00:00:55.630> on<00:00:55.960> the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
to see some more detail on that on the

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.650 
to see some more detail on that on the
telemetry<00:00:56.350> provided<00:00:57.310> by<00:00:57.490> the<00:00:57.550> flight<00:00:58.330> Rick's

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
telemetry provided by the flight Rick's

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.800 
telemetry provided by the flight Rick's
live<00:00:59.290> that's<00:00:59.710> installed<00:01:00.160> so<00:01:01.150> let's<00:01:01.480> try<00:01:01.750> this

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
live that's installed so let's try this

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.890 
live that's installed so let's try this
first<00:01:02.230> test<00:01:02.590> I'm<00:01:03.010> going<00:01:03.970> to<00:01:04.059> double<00:01:04.689> check

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
first test I'm going to double check

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.420 
first test I'm going to double check
make<00:01:05.080> sure<00:01:05.320> my<00:01:05.650> recording<00:01:06.159> is<00:01:06.250> going

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
make sure my recording is going

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.540 
make sure my recording is going
and<00:01:07.580> now<00:01:08.390> we're<00:01:08.570> going<00:01:08.720> to<00:01:08.780> go<00:01:08.960> out<00:01:08.990> about<00:01:09.740> 50

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
and now we're going to go out about 50

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.450 
and now we're going to go out about 50
or<00:01:10.670> 75<00:01:11.060> feet<00:01:11.510> and<00:01:11.840> then<00:01:12.440> i'll<00:01:12.590> do<00:01:12.860> that<00:01:13.040> climb

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
or 75 feet and then i'll do that climb

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.730 
or 75 feet and then i'll do that climb
so<00:01:13.880> let's<00:01:14.330> see<00:01:14.570> what<00:01:14.600> happens<00:01:15.260> here<00:01:17.530> okay<00:01:18.530> I'm

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
so let's see what happens here okay I'm

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.000 
so let's see what happens here okay I'm
out<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:19.010> little<00:01:19.250> way<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:20.080> I'm<00:01:21.080> going<00:01:21.470> to<00:01:21.650> start

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
out a little way and I'm going to start

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:34.330 
out a little way and I'm going to start
my<00:01:22.280> ascent<00:01:22.850> right<00:01:23.420> now<00:01:32.470> I'm<00:01:33.470> at<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.740> hundred<00:01:34.130> and

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
my ascent right now I'm at a hundred and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:50.070 
my ascent right now I'm at a hundred and
forty<00:01:34.790> feet<00:01:37.420> 200<00:01:38.420> feet<00:01:38.690> now<00:01:43.000> 300<00:01:44.000> feet<00:01:47.710> 357<00:01:48.710> and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
forty feet 200 feet now 300 feet 357 and

00:01:50.080 --> 00:02:00.540 
forty feet 200 feet now 300 feet 357 and
that's<00:01:51.080> 400<00:01:51.800> feet<00:01:52.899> and<00:01:53.979> it<00:01:54.979> took<00:01:55.390> 30<00:01:56.390> seconds

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:10.910 

30<00:02:01.270> seconds<00:02:05.760> well<00:02:06.780> 90<00:02:07.780> was<00:02:08.470> on<00:02:08.650> the<00:02:08.830> ground<00:02:08.979> run

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
30 seconds well 90 was on the ground run

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.060 
30 seconds well 90 was on the ground run
you<00:02:11.920> get<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.340> idea<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:14.290> now<00:02:14.530> I'm<00:02:14.740> going<00:02:14.950> to

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
you get the idea so now I'm going to

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.920 
you get the idea so now I'm going to
just<00:02:15.250> lazily<00:02:15.970> bring<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.540> thing<00:02:16.600> down<00:02:18.930> change

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
just lazily bring this thing down change

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.670 
just lazily bring this thing down change
the<00:02:20.200> props<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.160> new<00:02:21.370> 94<00:02:22.150> 50s<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:25.680> heard

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
the props to the new 94 50s I heard

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.650 
the props to the new 94 50s I heard
someone<00:02:27.070> say<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.820> new<00:02:28.090> props<00:02:28.420> were

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
someone say that the new props were

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.960 
someone say that the new props were
quieter<00:02:29.290> too<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.830> don't<00:02:30.280> know<00:02:30.430> about<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:30.700> but

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
quieter too I don't know about that but

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.570 
quieter too I don't know about that but
I<00:02:31.210> did<00:02:31.510> bring<00:02:31.540> my<00:02:32.790> SuperDuper<00:02:33.790> Scotia<00:02:34.510> sound

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
I did bring my SuperDuper Scotia sound

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.850 
I did bring my SuperDuper Scotia sound
level<00:02:36.630> tester<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:40.330> ambient<00:02:41.110> sound<00:02:41.530> here

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
level tester and the ambient sound here

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.750 
level tester and the ambient sound here
was<00:02:42.070> showing<00:02:42.630> about<00:02:43.630> 70<00:02:44.410> decibels<00:02:44.760> average

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
was showing about 70 decibels average

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.910 
was showing about 70 decibels average
and<00:02:46.890> just<00:02:47.890> at<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.900> hovering<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:53.110> went<00:02:53.410> up<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.620> an

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
and just at a hovering it went up to an

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.850 
and just at a hovering it went up to an
average<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.370> about<00:02:54.810> 76<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:58.450> at<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:59.020> level<00:02:59.350> it

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
average of about 76 so at this level it

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.040 
average of about 76 so at this level it
added<00:03:00.280> about<00:03:00.550> six<00:03:00.940> decimals<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.600> this<00:03:01.780> is

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
added about six decimals and this is

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.030 
added about six decimals and this is
none<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.040> this<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.670> scientific<00:03:06.150> I'd<00:03:07.150> consider

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
none of this is scientific I'd consider

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.580 
none of this is scientific I'd consider
logical<00:03:09.040> rather<00:03:09.310> than<00:03:09.580> scientific<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:11.380> I'm

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
logical rather than scientific so I'm

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.400 
logical rather than scientific so I'm

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.300 
go up to 400 feet last time it took 30
seconds<00:07:12.139> so<00:07:13.139> here<00:07:13.439> we<00:07:13.560> are<00:07:13.710> ready<00:07:13.979> to<00:07:14.069> start

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.310 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:34.960 

now<00:07:19.969> I'm<00:07:20.969> at<00:07:25.069> 121<00:07:26.069> feet

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:34.970 

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:40.010 

300

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:46.800 

400<00:07:41.020> now<00:07:41.050> and<00:07:41.530> that<00:07:42.250> took<00:07:42.490> 23<00:07:43.090> seconds<00:07:44.640> so<00:07:45.810> 23

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:46.810 
400 now and that took 23 seconds so 23

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:51.740 
400 now and that took 23 seconds so 23
seconds<00:07:48.090> to<00:07:49.090> get<00:07:49.270> to<00:07:49.330> 400<00:07:50.140> feet<00:07:50.380> with<00:07:50.740> the<00:07:51.010> new

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:51.750 
seconds to get to 400 feet with the new

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:57.300 
seconds to get to 400 feet with the new
9450<00:07:52.750> propellers<00:07:53.610> versus<00:07:54.610> 30<00:07:55.540> seconds<00:07:56.350> with

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:57.310 
9450 propellers versus 30 seconds with

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.660 
9450 propellers versus 30 seconds with
the<00:07:57.640> old<00:07:57.940> stock<00:07:58.630> propellers<00:07:59.380> so<00:08:00.340> that's<00:08:00.550> a

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:00.670 
the old stock propellers so that's a

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.380 
the old stock propellers so that's a
difference<00:08:01.090> of<00:08:01.210> seven<00:08:01.690> seconds
