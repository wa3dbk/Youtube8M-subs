00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
top to halfway and then you go for range

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.110 
top to halfway and then you go for range
of<00:04:55.539> motion<00:04:55.600> five<00:04:56.289> reps<00:04:56.590> all<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.610> way<00:04:57.699> down<00:04:57.910> and

then you start all over bottom top and

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.189 
then you start all over bottom top and
tire<00:05:01.810> you<00:05:02.560> do<00:05:02.680> that<00:05:02.830> three<00:05:03.370> times<00:05:03.570> so<00:05:04.570> it's<00:05:05.080> a

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
tire you do that three times so it's a

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.409
