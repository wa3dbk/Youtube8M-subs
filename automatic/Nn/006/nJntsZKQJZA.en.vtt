and try to keep it as kind of as uniform

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.980 
and try to keep it as kind of as uniform
as<00:01:47.640> possible<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:48.330> don't<00:01:48.360> want<00:01:48.630> some<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.900> be

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
as possible you don't want some to be

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.450 
as possible you don't want some to be
two<00:01:49.170> diagonal<00:01:49.619> others<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.040> look<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.190> little<00:01:50.280> bit

two diagonal others to look a little bit

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.650 
two diagonal others to look a little bit
straighter<00:01:50.760> then<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:52.200> happens

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
straighter then this happens

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.750 
straighter then this happens
so<00:01:54.660> I<00:01:55.140> don't<00:01:55.320> know<00:01:56.010> how<00:01:56.190> I<00:01:56.220> did<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:56.640> I

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
so I don't know how I did it but I

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.390 
so I don't know how I did it but I
managed<00:01:57.150> to<00:01:57.210> UM<00:01:57.770> get<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.830> little<00:01:59.040> bit<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.220> piece

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
managed to UM get a little bit of piece

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.310 
managed to UM get a little bit of piece
here<00:01:59.760> that<00:01:59.940> was<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.120> kind<00:02:00.720> of<00:02:00.750> naked<00:02:01.140> and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
here that was just kind of naked and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.470 
here that was just kind of naked and
just<00:02:02.010> fitting<00:02:02.280> my<00:02:02.400> ruffles<00:02:02.730> in<00:02:02.940> between<00:02:03.270> there

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
just fitting my ruffles in between there

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.960 
just fitting my ruffles in between there
so<00:02:03.510> it's<00:02:03.750> really<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.440> an<00:02:04.590> easy<00:02:04.770> fix<00:02:05.070> but<00:02:05.880> if

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
so it's really it's an easy fix but if

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.820 
so it's really it's an easy fix but if
you<00:02:06.060> were<00:02:06.120> to<00:02:06.210> keep<00:02:06.360> them<00:02:06.630> straight<00:02:07.080> all<00:02:07.440> the

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
you were to keep them straight all the

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.900 
you were to keep them straight all the
way<00:02:07.950> around<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.489> wouldn't<00:02:08.730> have<00:02:08.820> this

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
way around you wouldn't have this

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.020 
way around you wouldn't have this
problem<00:02:10.130> like<00:02:11.130> I<00:02:11.280> said<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.580> really<00:02:11.790> couldn't

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
problem like I said you really couldn't

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.820 
problem like I said you really couldn't
tell<00:02:12.209> at<00:02:12.360> all<00:02:12.390> which<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.780> great<00:02:13.170> but<00:02:13.650> that

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
tell at all which is great but that

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.900 
tell at all which is great but that
becomes<00:02:14.100> your<00:02:14.280> back<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.610> got<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.820> be

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
becomes your back you got to be

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.820 
becomes your back you got to be
inventive<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.420> keep<00:02:15.600> decorating<00:02:16.110> can<00:02:16.769> be

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
inventive and keep decorating can be

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.009 
inventive and keep decorating can be
very<00:02:17.010> creative<00:02:17.280> with<00:02:17.640> how<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:17.910> mask<00:02:18.780> the

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
very creative with how you mask the

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.140 
very creative with how you mask the
mistakes<00:02:19.850> looks<00:02:20.850> just<00:02:21.030> like<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:23.060> then<00:02:24.060> I'm

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
mistakes looks just like that then I'm

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.520 
mistakes looks just like that then I'm
going<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.330> make<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.630> ruffle<00:02:24.959> flower<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.320> top

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
going to make the ruffle flower on top

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.380 
going to make the ruffle flower on top
so<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.739> have<00:02:25.950> three<00:02:26.220> different<00:02:26.370> cutters<00:02:26.700> and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
so I have three different cutters and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.560 
so I have three different cutters and
I'm<00:02:28.380> using<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.769> scalloped<00:02:29.340> edge<00:02:29.640> side<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.420> cut

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
I'm using the scalloped edge side to cut

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.740 
I'm using the scalloped edge side to cut
those<00:02:30.720> out<00:02:31.310> then<00:02:32.310> again<00:02:32.580> using<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.150> phone<00:02:33.540> mat

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
those out then again using the phone mat

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.259 
those out then again using the phone mat
and<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> bolt<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.410> coned<00:02:34.709> bulbs<00:02:35.190> tool<00:02:35.400> running<00:02:36.180> it

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
and a bolt a coned bulbs tool running it

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.170 
and a bolt a coned bulbs tool running it
back<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.630> forth<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:38.489> just<00:02:38.549> creating<00:02:39.060> those

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
back and forth and just creating those

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.030 
back and forth and just creating those
ruffles<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:39.930> stretching<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.440> down<00:02:40.560> pulling<00:02:40.890> it

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
ruffles so stretching it down pulling it

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.910 
ruffles so stretching it down pulling it
up<00:02:41.160> making<00:02:41.760> sure<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.150> overlap<00:02:42.269> each<00:02:43.040> time<00:02:45.920> then

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
up making sure to overlap each time then

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.410 
up making sure to overlap each time then
just<00:02:47.070> layer<00:02:47.220> them<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.459> top<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.850> each<00:02:48.000> other<00:02:48.209> and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
just layer them on top of each other and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.420 
just layer them on top of each other and
pinch<00:02:48.840> them<00:02:49.049> at<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.530> edges<00:02:49.860> just<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.190> try<00:02:50.400> and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
pinch them at the edges just to try and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.979 
pinch them at the edges just to try and
lift<00:02:50.760> them<00:02:50.880> up<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.090> bit<00:02:51.239> give<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.660> flower<00:02:51.870> a

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
lift them up a bit give it the flower a

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.590 
lift them up a bit give it the flower a
little<00:02:52.019> bit<00:02:52.260> more<00:02:52.440> dimension<00:02:53.450> pop<00:02:54.450> it

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
little bit more dimension pop it

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.540 
little bit more dimension pop it
directly<00:02:54.930> over<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.230> cake

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
directly over the cake

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.210 
directly over the cake
and<00:02:57.450> again<00:02:57.750> just<00:02:58.020> manipulate<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.740> however<00:02:58.950> you

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
and again just manipulate it however you

and again just manipulate it however you
need<00:02:59.400> make<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.420> look<00:03:00.540> nicer<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:02.720> then<00:03:03.720> I'm

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
need make it look nicer for then I'm

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.600 
need make it look nicer for then I'm
going<00:03:04.020> in<00:03:04.110> with<00:03:04.140> an<00:03:04.410> airbrush<00:03:04.740> here<00:03:05.100> just<00:03:05.430> at

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
going in with an airbrush here just at

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.070 
going in with an airbrush here just at
the<00:03:05.700> bottom<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.210> cake<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.660> create<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.960> bit

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
the bottom of the cake to create a bit

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.230 
the bottom of the cake to create a bit
of<00:03:07.110> an<00:03:07.260> ombre<00:03:07.560> effect<00:03:07.640> whether<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:08.820> can<00:03:08.970> skip

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
of an ombre effect whether you can skip

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.370 
of an ombre effect whether you can skip
this<00:03:09.390> step<00:03:09.450> completely<00:03:10.020> is<00:03:10.080> really

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
this step completely is really

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.220 
this step completely is really
unnecessary<00:03:10.920> but<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.640> love<00:03:12.390> my<00:03:12.510> airbrush<00:03:12.750> so

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
unnecessary but I love my airbrush so

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.650 
unnecessary but I love my airbrush so
just<00:03:13.740> put<00:03:13.860> in<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.040> little<00:03:14.070> bit<00:03:14.540> then<00:03:15.540> i'm<00:03:15.630> using

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
just put in a little bit then i'm using
