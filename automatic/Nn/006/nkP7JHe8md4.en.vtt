that you would expect from a android

google<00:00:19.650> android<00:00:19.949> 3.2<00:00:20.490> honeycomb<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.750> was

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
google android 3.2 honeycomb and it was

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.240 
google android 3.2 honeycomb and it was
released<00:00:22.970> earlier<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.029> year<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:25.039> one<00:00:26.039> thing

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
released earlier this year the one thing

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.679 
released earlier this year the one thing
that<00:00:26.279> really<00:00:26.490> sets<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.849> apart<00:00:26.970> from<00:00:27.240> others

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
that really sets it apart from others

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.480 
that really sets it apart from others
though<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.980> little<00:00:29.010> bit<00:00:29.220> thicker

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
though is that it's a little bit thicker

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.070 
though is that it's a little bit thicker
and<00:00:29.730> heavier<00:00:29.880> because<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.420> has<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.779> sort<00:00:31.019> of

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
and heavier because it has a sort of

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.860 
and heavier because it has a sort of
two-part<00:00:31.740> construction<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.420> use<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.600> as

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
two-part construction you can use it as

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.840 
two-part construction you can use it as
a<00:00:33.899> standard<00:00:34.410> tablet<00:00:35.040> by<00:00:35.309> holding<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.790> in

put<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.450> down<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> table<00:00:40.140> pull<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:42.739> use<00:00:43.739> it

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
put it down on a table pull and use it

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.090 
put it down on a table pull and use it
in<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.489> sort<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.910> laptop<00:00:45.480> mode<00:00:45.840> now<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.440> laptop

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
in a sort of laptop mode now the laptop

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.069 
in a sort of laptop mode now the laptop
mode<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.969> not<00:00:48.149> adjustable<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.930> you're

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
mode this is not adjustable so you're

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.779 
mode this is not adjustable so you're
always<00:00:49.289> sort<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.620> added<00:00:49.770> an<00:00:50.129> interesting

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
always sort of added an interesting

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.090 
always sort of added an interesting
angle<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.500> got<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> nice<00:00:52.800> solid

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
angle here but it's got a nice solid

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250 
angle here but it's got a nice solid
base<00:00:53.550> construction<00:00:53.969> which<00:00:54.780> makes<00:00:55.110> it

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
base construction which makes it

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.990 
base construction which makes it
actually<00:00:55.770> balanced<00:00:56.309> pretty<00:00:56.550> well<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.910> can

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
actually balanced pretty well so you can

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.209 
actually balanced pretty well so you can
put<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.239> your<00:00:57.300> lab<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> table<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.530> use<00:00:59.070> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
put it on your lab or a table and use it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.130 
put it on your lab or a table and use it
for<00:00:59.340> typing<00:00:59.730> let's<00:01:00.600> take<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.809> quick<00:01:01.109> look

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
back to the first one so overall it's a

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.490 
back to the first one so overall it's a
lot<00:05:58.820> like<00:05:59.000> using<00:05:59.360> a<00:05:59.600> laptop<00:05:59.810> but<00:06:00.050> you're<00:06:00.350> using

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
lot like using a laptop but you're using

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
of days I really just got a chance to to

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.100 
of days I really just got a chance to to
start<00:06:36.620> playing<00:06:36.919> with<00:06:37.040> it<00:06:37.100> earlier<00:06:37.370> today<00:06:37.700> and

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
the overall user experience is

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.020 
the overall user experience is
interesting<00:06:42.500> because<00:06:42.710> it's<00:06:42.979> it's<00:06:43.580> like<00:06:43.729> using

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
interesting because it's it's like using

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.730 
interesting because it's it's like using
a<00:06:44.210> google<00:06:44.479> android<00:06:44.840> tablet<00:06:45.260> because<00:06:45.440> that's

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
a google android tablet because that's

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.080 
a google android tablet because that's
what<00:06:45.890> it<00:06:45.979> is<00:06:46.100> but<00:06:46.400> then<00:06:46.520> it<00:06:46.610> is<00:06:46.669> also<00:06:46.880> a<00:06:46.910> little

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
what it is but then it is also a little

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.190 
what it is but then it is also a little
bit<00:06:47.270> like<00:06:47.419> using<00:06:47.660> a<00:06:48.640> notebook<00:06:49.640> and<00:06:50.200> where

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200 
bit like using a notebook and where

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.830 
bit like using a notebook and where
those<00:06:51.350> two<00:06:51.650> things<00:06:52.070> sort<00:06:52.340> of<00:06:52.460> crossover<00:06:53.150> is<00:06:53.390> is

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
those two things sort of crossover is is

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.570 
those two things sort of crossover is is
an<00:06:53.990> interesting<00:06:54.380> space<00:06:54.590> and<00:06:54.860> i'll<00:06:55.310> be<00:06:55.430> curious

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
an interesting space and i'll be curious

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.310 
an interesting space and i'll be curious
to<00:06:55.789> see<00:06:56.030> how<00:06:56.360> it<00:06:56.539> sort<00:06:56.660> of<00:06:56.780> fits<00:06:56.930> into<00:06:57.140> my

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:57.320 
to see how it sort of fits into my

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.180 
to see how it sort of fits into my
regular<00:06:57.940> workflow<00:06:58.940> so<00:06:59.600> that's<00:07:00.500> a<00:07:00.620> first<00:07:00.890> look

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
regular workflow so that's a first look

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:06.010 
regular workflow so that's a first look
at<00:07:01.460> the<00:07:03.340> not<00:07:04.340> sure<00:07:04.460> why<00:07:04.580> it's<00:07:04.729> showing<00:07:05.020> bunch

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020
