00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.170
 ae 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:53.610
 it's true the fable galley 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.730
 the idea of this link is a cluster of 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.420
 ideas about technique other about the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.980
 theory this link it contains fragments 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.070
 from a video I made a while back 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.340
 that I put the title of intent 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.790
 modal if you did not see I'll leave the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.549
 olympique of him here in the discretion so that 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.140
 You can know what this is. 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.190
 intention to change what I meant in 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.210
 video side there is the real is that a lot of people 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:27.960
 Come in and I think there's a class there. 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.720
 it is a lesson that there are tips 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.360
 as you see the Greek ways and 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.190
 how do you understand this intention that 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.560
 each mode passes to you 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.180
 I ask you to watch the video pausen and 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.640
 Your assistant first thinks it will not 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.610
 make a difference then this link 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.380
 it contains fragments of the thing modes 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.360
 extremely simple 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.400
 I'm leaving his tab here in the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.409
 description will also leave a path 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.600
 or by afternoon in my group there in the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.720
 facebook and I'll leave the link here 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.130
 group so that you can go there and 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:05.750
 then take this're the idea of this link is 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:09.420
 you use a link just to study in 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.060
 34 different techniques for you 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.819
 can be analyzing with dictation 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.810
 if you are not in 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.680
 all techniques but sometimes the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.630
 The tep never cool sometimes is your 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.480
 alternate palette that is not legal 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.090
 a good tip is to do an exercise do 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.700
 him with a technician connected to do so 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.840
 nothing that seems to alternate with mutti with 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.220
 the stuffy strings 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.230
 this link is a link that I knew 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.630
 a while ago and I changed a lot 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.840
 moral and after I had the idea of 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.060
 Use it to make this video to speak 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.030
 to talk about time as well 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.700
 this link is the only feature of the hit 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.370
 kotze I do not remember where I first met 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.900
 But it's a simple thing, it's nothing. 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.049
 abnormal in him just to make it clear that 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.299
 I did not create it, I found some 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.370
 And I took advantage of this to say a 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.920
 little to you, which is cool any 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.260
 my intention here you train in 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.930
 all possible techniques above 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.310
 this link preferably records months and 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.519
 there's no where to record records on your cell phone 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.430
 Record knows anyway for you. 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:26.000
 to listen as your different each technique and 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.329
 Today you have more problems, it's a note that 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.709
 brings teja note that enters does not study 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:35.959
 slowly it goes up speed and cilic 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.359
 It will help you very accurately to 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.730
 help open your eyes to what you 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:43.130
 you need to study more and go in 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.440
 The tip of the tip I gave you 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.900
 playing with three or four techniques 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.720
 different ee oprah sees it as it is 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.970
 sounding and what is cooler what 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.920
 you need to study some more tips 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.989
 that I'll let you study 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.989
 mainly in attached train forces 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:11.630
 Hey 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:11.630
 and is to some passages 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.569
 then the slap you look at is important 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:50.039
 and it's important that you keep your hand here 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:55.229
 this mother who eventually came to his 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:57.990
 technique here revolves around the slap 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:05.130
 left hand if this 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:07.409
 legal note to conduct mainly 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.690
 Have you been doing the subway? Make me 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:12.440
 Metronome for you to drive the maximum 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:16.819
 possible 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.819
 here's the goal but you think it's important 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.069
 this note she has to appear 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:32.550
 if you already did you do it here 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.300
 sometimes it will not appear in the middle of 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.300
 if you walk here 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:47.130
 is marked here it seems that it is a 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:50.010
 choking that you're giving but it's not 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:53.400
 You 're there, you're marking that note. 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.110
 good this is so a simple link is is 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.300
 something that sometimes we do not give 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.970
 A lot of moral but it's worth you to stop. 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.300
 to think it over , this is a bid that goes 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:06.960
 improve your tep technique to have nothing 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:18.300
 on footprint mainly footprint 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:22.440
 the guys today top puts the Moor who is 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:26.600
 to take sound from her you 're going to get well 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.600
 it was okay, eichmann was 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.510
 is
