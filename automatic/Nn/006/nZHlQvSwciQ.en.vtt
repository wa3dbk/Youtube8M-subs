00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.880 
the website and it can range anyway from
M<00:00:52.310> currently<00:00:53.310> on<00:00:53.460> my<00:00:53.880> screen<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.410> highest

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
M currently on my screen it the highest

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.170 
M currently on my screen it the highest
amount<00:00:56.310> is<00:00:57.680> 21<00:00:58.680> dollars<00:00:59.130> per<00:00:59.460> thousand<00:01:00.150> views

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
amount is 21 dollars per thousand views

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.500 
amount is 21 dollars per thousand views
all<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.230> way<00:01:01.350> down<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.070> seven<00:01:02.790> dollars<00:01:03.180> per

all the way down to seven dollars per
thousand<00:01:04.199> views<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.759> really<00:01:06.240> depends<00:01:06.660> on

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
thousand views so it really depends on
