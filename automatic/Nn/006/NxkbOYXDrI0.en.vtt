blue<00:00:29.760> tint<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.269> really<00:00:30.630> took<00:00:30.779> away<00:00:30.990> from

blue tint that really took away from

blue tint that really took away from
combat<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.830> made<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.460> really<00:00:32.669> hard<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.059> pick

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239

giving<00:00:38.219> Metro<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.579> post-apocalyptic<00:00:39.210> feel

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
giving Metro this post-apocalyptic feel

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.709 
giving Metro this post-apocalyptic feel
to<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.200> metro<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.100> taking<00:00:41.550> place<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.969> 2014

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
been added in rush these make attacking

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.380 
been added in rush these make attacking
and<00:01:04.140> rush<00:01:04.379> pretty<00:01:04.710> easy<00:01:04.949> now<00:01:05.250> although<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.119> have

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
and rush pretty easy now although I have

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.640 
and rush pretty easy now although I have
not<00:01:06.420> been<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.930> game<00:01:07.140> yet<00:01:07.350> where<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
not been in a game yet where the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.200 
not been in a game yet where the
attacking<00:01:07.979> team<00:01:08.130> has<00:01:08.460> gotten<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> last

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
attacking team has gotten to the last

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.300 
attacking team has gotten to the last
set<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.420> em<00:01:09.630> comes<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.170> think<00:01:10.770> because<00:01:10.860> there<00:01:11.220> is

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
set of em comes I think because there is

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.010 
set of em comes I think because there is
such<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.580> standstill<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> third<00:01:12.570> set<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.869> em

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
such a standstill at the third set of em

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.539 
such a standstill at the third set of em
comes<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.530> makes<00:01:13.680> attacking<00:01:14.220> nearly

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
comes it makes attacking nearly

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.090 
comes it makes attacking nearly
impossible<00:01:14.909> well<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.439> grenade<00:01:16.680> spam<00:01:16.890> of

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
impossible well that in grenade spam of

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.460 
impossible well that in grenade spam of
course<00:01:17.360> anyways<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.540> think<00:01:18.780> dice<00:01:18.930> has<00:01:19.140> really

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
course anyways I think dice has really

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.960 
course anyways I think dice has really
stepped<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:19.890> their<00:01:20.070> game<00:01:20.130> with<00:01:20.520> these<00:01:20.670> maps

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
stepped up their game with these maps

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.700 
stepped up their game with these maps
because<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.540> graphics<00:01:21.960> look<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.229> thousand

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
because the graphics look a thousand

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.380 
because the graphics look a thousand
times<00:01:22.920> better<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.430> these<00:01:23.640> maps<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
times better on these maps then on the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.969 
times better on these maps then on the
vanilla<00:01:24.689> maps<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.140> game<00:01:25.409> now<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
vanilla maps in the game now the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.130 
vanilla maps in the game now the
textures<00:01:26.520> load<00:01:26.790> slower<00:01:27.180> still<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.780> dice<00:01:27.930> did

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
textures load slower still but dice did

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.319 
textures load slower still but dice did
a<00:01:28.170> fantastic<00:01:28.530> job<00:01:29.100> with<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.579> look<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.060> feel

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
a fantastic job with the look and feel

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.899 
a fantastic job with the look and feel
of<00:01:30.390> these<00:01:30.840> maps<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.710> LEvolution<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.490> Metro

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
of these maps the LEvolution for Metro

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.940 
of these maps the LEvolution for Metro
is<00:01:33.060> very<00:01:33.360> very<00:01:33.540> miniscule<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.619> shoot<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
is very very miniscule if you shoot the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.740 
is very very miniscule if you shoot the
thousands<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.610> wooden<00:01:35.880> beams<00:01:36.090> supporting<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
thousands of wooden beams supporting the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.840 
thousands of wooden beams supporting the
roof<00:01:36.900> pieces<00:01:37.500> will<00:01:37.799> fall<00:01:38.009> down<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.579> crush

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
roof pieces will fall down and crush

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.490 
roof pieces will fall down and crush
anyone<00:01:39.180> who<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.540> standing<00:01:39.750> under<00:01:40.170> them<00:01:40.320> I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
anyone who is standing under them I

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.260 
anyone who is standing under them I
really<00:01:41.250> would<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.460> liked<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.820> see<00:01:42.000> something

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
really would have liked to see something

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.389 
really would have liked to see something
along<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> lines<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.200> Metro<00:01:43.680> flooding<00:01:44.189> or<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
along the lines of Metro flooding or a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.950 
along the lines of Metro flooding or a
train<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.850> constantly<00:01:45.360> pass<00:01:45.600> through

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
train that constantly pass through

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.139 
train that constantly pass through
blocking<00:01:46.409> off<00:01:46.530> main<00:01:46.799> lines<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.280> sites<00:01:47.549> now<00:01:48.119> I

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
blocking off main lines of sites now I

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.130 
blocking off main lines of sites now I
think<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.479> would<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.780> helped<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
think this would have helped the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.780 
think this would have helped the
attackers<00:01:49.649> advance<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.159> little<00:01:50.460> bit<00:01:50.579> easier

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
attackers advance a little bit easier

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.969 
attackers advance a little bit easier
because<00:01:51.479> by<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> time<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.229> train<00:01:52.470> passes<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
because by the time the train passes the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.130 
because by the time the train passes the
enemy<00:01:53.430> doesn't<00:01:53.640> know<00:01:53.850> where<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.149> are<00:01:54.329> even

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
enemy doesn't know where you are even

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.450 
enemy doesn't know where you are even

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
entrances have sort of changed the map

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
entrances have sort of changed the map
it<00:01:58.649> doesn't<00:01:59.009> offer<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.280> huge<00:01:59.670> advantage<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.329> the

it doesn't offer a huge advantage to the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.480 
it doesn't offer a huge advantage to the
attackers<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:00.930> rush<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> would<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.219> liked

attackers in rush so I would have liked

attackers in rush so I would have liked

operation firestorm in this DLC pretty
much<00:02:12.450> anyone<00:02:12.750> hated<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.349> map<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.709> bed

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950

I<00:02:16.290> think<00:02:16.500> they<00:02:16.800> chose<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.250> maps<00:02:17.459> was<00:02:17.670> by<00:02:17.819> how

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
I think they chose the maps was by how

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.820 
I think they chose the maps was by how
many<00:02:18.030> servers<00:02:18.450> were<00:02:18.720> rented<00:02:19.110> just<00:02:19.379> to<00:02:19.470> play<00:02:19.680> on

many servers were rented just to play on
them<00:02:20.040> if<00:02:20.519> you<00:02:20.670> think<00:02:20.790> about<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.060> operation

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.809 
them if you think about it operation
firestorm<00:02:21.930> was<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.560> most<00:02:22.739> hated<00:02:23.010> but<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.640> was

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
firestorm was the most hated but it was

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.729 
firestorm was the most hated but it was
the<00:02:24.000> number<00:02:24.330> one<00:02:24.360> choice<00:02:24.720> for<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:25.110> flying<00:02:25.470> map

this was a really smart move because the

the enemy spawn so if I were you I would

the enemy spawn so if I were you I would

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
not like Metro firestorm has also gotten

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.370 
not like Metro firestorm has also gotten
some<00:02:50.760> vast<00:02:51.090> improvements<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.049> look<00:02:52.230> of

the map now for one the map is really

that<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.560> pretty<00:03:19.709> much<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.130> only<00:03:20.160> thing<00:03:20.609> it

was<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.579> actually<00:03:47.880> win<00:03:48.269> a<00:03:48.299> game<00:03:48.510> of<00:03:48.750> rush<00:03:48.989> while

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
was to actually win a game of rush while

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
attacking now if you have the right team

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.940 
attacking now if you have the right team
you<00:03:51.450> can<00:03:51.600> actually<00:03:51.720> push<00:03:52.079> up<00:03:52.260> past<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.709> first

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
you can actually push up past the first

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.770 
you can actually push up past the first
set<00:03:53.100> of<00:03:53.190> em<00:03:53.340> comes<00:03:53.579> now<00:03:53.850> well<00:03:54.389> what<00:03:54.569> a<00:03:54.600> big

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
set of em comes now well what a big

set of em comes now well what a big
shocker<00:03:55.139> there<00:03:55.319> however<00:03:56.069> you<00:03:56.280> will<00:03:56.400> need<00:03:56.489> to

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
shocker there however you will need to

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.280 
shocker there however you will need to
coordinate<00:03:57.060> an<00:03:57.209> all-out<00:03:57.389> attack<00:03:57.840> where<00:03:58.139> your

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
coordinate an all-out attack where your

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.470 
coordinate an all-out attack where your
entire<00:03:58.590> team<00:03:58.859> pushes<00:03:59.160> up<00:03:59.400> at<00:03:59.549> once<00:03:59.790> this<00:04:00.299> will

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
entire team pushes up at once this will

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.180 
entire team pushes up at once this will
work<00:04:00.599> pretty<00:04:00.870> much<00:04:00.959> any<00:04:01.290> time<00:04:01.650> but<00:04:01.889> you<00:04:02.010> might

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
work pretty much any time but you might

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.710 
work pretty much any time but you might
want<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.459> wait<00:04:02.579> until<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.970> sand<00:04:03.239> storm<00:04:03.480> rolls

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
in to actually do this it will give you

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.699 
in to actually do this it will give you
a<00:04:05.730> significant<00:04:06.569> amount<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.959> cover<00:04:07.230> because

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
a significant amount of cover because

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.080 
a significant amount of cover because
you<00:04:07.920> only<00:04:08.099> have<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.370> hundred<00:04:08.519> metres<00:04:08.940> of

play<00:04:11.250> this<00:04:11.819> strategy<00:04:12.120> makes<00:04:12.599> attacking<00:04:13.079> much

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
play this strategy makes attacking much

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.409 
play this strategy makes attacking much
easier<00:04:13.709> now<00:04:13.950> as<00:04:14.220> for<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.459> cosmetic<00:04:14.940> changes<00:04:15.299> i

easier now as for the cosmetic changes i

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.210 
easier now as for the cosmetic changes i
have<00:04:15.510> not<00:04:15.660> really<00:04:15.900> noticed<00:04:16.289> any<00:04:16.470> once<00:04:17.070> the

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220

sand storm rolls in it makes the map

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.779

this<00:04:18.900> really<00:04:19.260> dull<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.680> ugly<00:04:19.829> color<00:04:20.220> but<00:04:20.760> it

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
this really dull and ugly color but it

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.670 
this really dull and ugly color but it
simulates<00:04:21.090> how<00:04:21.419> an<00:04:21.539> actual<00:04:21.900> sandstorm<00:04:22.409> would

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
simulates how an actual sandstorm would
