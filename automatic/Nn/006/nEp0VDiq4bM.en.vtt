that's<00:01:32.460> my<00:01:32.610> opinion<00:01:32.820> anyway<00:01:33.060> let<00:01:33.659> me<00:01:33.689> know

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
that's my opinion anyway let me know

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.179 
that's my opinion anyway let me know
what<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.990> think<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.409> comment<00:01:34.920> section

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
what you think in the comment section

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.310 
what you think in the comment section
and<00:01:35.340> we'll<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.329> straight<00:01:36.570> into<00:01:36.689> Game<00:01:36.900> one<00:01:37.110> so

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
and we'll get straight into Game one so

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.649 
and we'll get straight into Game one so
here<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.740> go<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.460> DOTA<00:01:39.180> straight<00:01:39.540> to

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
here I just go to a DOTA straight to

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.810 
here I just go to a DOTA straight to
this<00:01:39.780> goal<00:01:39.960> gee<00:01:40.860> they're<00:01:41.100> chipping<00:01:41.400> people

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
this goal gee they're chipping people

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.249 
this goal gee they're chipping people
with<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> weak<00:01:42.390> foot<00:01:42.600> which<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> very<00:01:43.079> nice

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
with is a weak foot which is a very nice

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.740 
with is a weak foot which is a very nice
goal<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.799> spills<00:01:44.729> out<00:01:44.880> again<00:01:45.060> 4g<00:01:45.420> goes<00:01:45.600> from

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
goal and spills out again 4g goes from

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.410 
goal and spills out again 4g goes from
another<00:01:45.930> shot<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.439> i<00:01:46.740> would<00:01:47.310> say<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.520> G<00:01:48.180> at

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
another shot so i would say that G at

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.300 
another shot so i would say that G at
moment<00:01:48.869> or<00:01:48.960> joy<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.530> probably<00:01:50.040> one<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.220> my

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
moment or joy is probably one of my

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.340 
moment or joy is probably one of my
favorite<00:01:50.820> players<00:01:51.030> use<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:52.110> very

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
favorite players use and it's just very

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.020 
favorite players use and it's just very
all<00:01:52.619> round<00:01:52.920> good<00:01:53.070> everything<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.729> think<00:01:53.939> it's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
all round good everything I think it's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.149 
all round good everything I think it's
got<00:01:54.119> 70s<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.720> pretty<00:01:54.930> much<00:01:54.960> most<00:01:55.590> attributes

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
got 70s and pretty much most attributes

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.910 
got 70s and pretty much most attributes
and<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.390> do<00:01:57.509> win<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.840> game<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.200> which

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
and but we do win that game and which

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.350 
and but we do win that game and which
means<00:01:59.159> we<00:01:59.280> get<00:01:59.399> one<00:01:59.579> more<00:01:59.700> dream<00:01:59.880> team<00:02:00.090> point

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
means we get one more dream team point

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.719 
means we get one more dream team point
but<00:02:00.540> obviously<00:02:00.780> no<00:02:00.960> rare<00:02:01.399> ability<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.549> buy<00:02:02.700> a

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
but obviously no rare ability to buy a

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.700 
but obviously no rare ability to buy a
rare<00:02:03.000> player<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.509> offer<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.930> looked<00:02:04.320> around<00:02:04.469> for

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
rare player so offer I looked around for

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.859 
rare player so offer I looked around for
some<00:02:04.979> silver<00:02:05.310> non-res<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.240> thought<00:02:06.450> you

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
some silver non-res and I thought you

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.540 
some silver non-res and I thought you
know<00:02:06.899> what<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.110> actually<00:02:07.380> get<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.890> left-back

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
know what I actually get a left-back

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.919 
know what I actually get a left-back
because<00:02:08.819> here<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.270> see<00:02:09.420> one<00:02:09.599> left<00:02:09.780> back

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
because here you can see one left back

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.570 
because here you can see one left back
at<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.140> moment<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.530> kind<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.950> getting<00:02:11.730> no<00:02:11.910> con

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
at the moment is kind of getting no con

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.610 
at the moment is kind of getting no con
links<00:02:12.940> at<00:02:13.120> all<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:13.600> it'd<00:02:13.750> be<00:02:13.780> best<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.320> get<00:02:14.560> a

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
links at all so it'd be best to get a

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.350 
links at all so it'd be best to get a
left-back<00:02:15.010> chemistry<00:02:15.520> reasons<00:02:15.850> for

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
left-back chemistry reasons for

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.940 
left-back chemistry reasons for
chemistry<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.990> sorry<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.830> basically

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
chemistry and sorry and it basically

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.620 
chemistry and sorry and it basically
boosted<00:02:18.520> my<00:02:18.580> chemistry<00:02:18.940> what<00:02:19.120> about<00:02:19.390> another

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
boosted my chemistry what about another

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.560 
boosted my chemistry what about another
ten<00:02:19.930> just<00:02:20.200> because<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.740> chemistry<00:02:21.570> around

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
ten just because of the chemistry around

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.070 
ten just because of the chemistry around
the<00:02:22.810> scent<00:02:23.020> CDM<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.190> sense<00:02:24.370> back<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.660> went

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
the scent CDM and the sense back so went

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.260 
the scent CDM and the sense back so went
for<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.260> play<00:02:26.410> called<00:02:26.560> Olson<00:02:26.980> 84<00:02:27.490> pays<00:02:27.700> about

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
for a play called Olson 84 pays about

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.510 
for a play called Olson 84 pays about
six<00:02:28.780> was<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.410> six<00:02:29.620> hundred<00:02:29.920> coins<00:02:30.040> or<00:02:30.340> maybe

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
six was it six hundred coins or maybe

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.790 
six was it six hundred coins or maybe
just<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.790> little<00:02:30.940> bit<00:02:31.090> more<00:02:31.240> and<00:02:31.450> yet<00:02:32.140> 84<00:02:32.590> pays

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
just a little bit more and yet 84 pays

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.390 
just a little bit more and yet 84 pays
from<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.220> brick<00:02:33.640> BPL<00:02:34.450> it's<00:02:35.290> pretty<00:02:36.220> much<00:02:36.340> a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
from the brick BPL it's pretty much a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.820 
from the brick BPL it's pretty much a
bargain<00:02:36.910> if<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.330> ask<00:02:37.510> me<00:02:37.690> anyway<00:02:38.380> we<00:02:38.590> go<00:02:38.710> into

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
bargain if you ask me anyway we go into

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.440 
bargain if you ask me anyway we go into
the<00:02:38.950> next<00:02:38.980> game<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.460> you<00:02:39.580> can<00:02:39.730> see<00:02:39.880> here<00:02:40.090> in<00:02:40.150> 15

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
the next game and you can see here in 15

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.240 
the next game and you can see here in 15
minute<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:40.750> knew<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:40.930> was<00:02:41.080> in<00:02:41.140> trouble<00:02:41.250> just

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
minute I knew I was in trouble just

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.800 
minute I knew I was in trouble just
because<00:02:42.550> of<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.880> sheer<00:02:43.120> amount<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:43.540> pace<00:02:43.780> that

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
because of the sheer amount of pace that

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.690 
because of the sheer amount of pace that
guy<00:02:44.140> got<00:02:44.350> through<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.770> found<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.400> very<00:02:45.490> easy

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
guy got through and found it very easy

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.280 
guy got through and found it very easy
again<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.210> pretty<00:02:46.390> much<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.600> same<00:02:46.750> situation

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
again and pretty much the same situation

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.120 
again and pretty much the same situation
coming<00:02:47.530> from<00:02:47.770> that<00:02:47.830> bottom<00:02:48.430> right<00:02:49.090> corner<00:02:49.120> and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
coming from that bottom right corner and

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.680 
coming from that bottom right corner and
it<00:02:51.130> scores<00:02:51.310> again<00:02:51.520> just<00:02:51.700> by<00:02:51.820> passing<00:02:52.240> in<00:02:52.360> one

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
it scores again just by passing in one

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.390 
it scores again just by passing in one
touch<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:52.990> then<00:02:53.350> around<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:53.890> shooting

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
touch and then around the shooting

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.640 
touch and then around the shooting
around<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.640> keeper<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.230> what<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.260> was<00:02:56.440> playing

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
around the keeper and what I was playing

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.080 
around the keeper and what I was playing
I<00:02:56.740> was<00:02:56.770> thinking<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.190> know<00:02:57.340> what<00:02:57.550> I<00:02:57.670> think<00:02:57.760> I

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
I was thinking you know what I think I

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.520 
I was thinking you know what I think I
really<00:02:58.360> do<00:02:58.480> need<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:58.750> upgrade<00:02:58.900> my<00:02:59.080> keeper

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
really do need to upgrade my keeper

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.620 
really do need to upgrade my keeper
although<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.340> concentration<00:03:01.060> was<00:03:01.209> my<00:03:01.360> fault

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
although that concentration was my fault

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.330 
although that concentration was my fault
and<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.200> keeper<00:03:02.530> could<00:03:03.010> have<00:03:03.160> had<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.280> better
