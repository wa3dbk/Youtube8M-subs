00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
myself could use a little practice in

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.090 
myself could use a little practice in

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
near you you've got all the space in the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.469 
near you you've got all the space in the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
world there is no excuse not to bury

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.880 
world there is no excuse not to bury
that<00:01:27.659> chance<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.080> see<00:01:28.259> people<00:01:28.380> time<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.710> time

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
that chance I see people time and time

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.460 
that chance I see people time and time
again<00:01:29.009> not<00:01:29.880> score<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.390> complete<00:01:30.990> breakaways

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
again not score on complete breakaways

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.050 
again not score on complete breakaways
and<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.950> one<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.250> largest<00:01:32.610> mistakes

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and that is one of the largest mistakes

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.330 
and that is one of the largest mistakes
and<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.750> what<00:01:33.900> separates<00:01:34.259> not<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.220> good

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.460 
from the corner type of thing so you're
coming<00:02:42.360> out<00:02:42.480> from<00:02:42.629> behind<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.870> net<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.440> just

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
coming out from behind the net you just

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.770 
coming out from behind the net you just
roll<00:02:43.829> it<00:02:43.950> around<00:02:44.069> you<00:02:44.790> can<00:02:44.819> easily<00:02:45.180> snipe<00:02:45.599> on

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
roll it around you can easily snipe on

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.849 
roll it around you can easily snipe on
the<00:02:45.870> goalie<00:02:46.049> most<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.470> time<00:02:46.680> there<00:02:46.829> you

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
the goalie most of the time there you

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.289 
the goalie most of the time there you
can<00:02:47.040> also<00:02:47.160> do<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.519> backhand<00:02:47.879> but<00:02:48.060> it's<00:02:48.180> not

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
can also do on the backhand but it's not

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.990 
can also do on the backhand but it's not
as<00:02:48.480> effective<00:02:48.959> but<00:02:49.859> so<00:02:50.040> what<00:02:50.549> you<00:02:50.670> guys<00:02:50.760> want

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
as effective but so what you guys want

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.229 
as effective but so what you guys want
to<00:02:51.060> do<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.390> if<00:02:51.780> necessary<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.670> miss<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.090> net

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
to do is if necessary and miss the net

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.000 
to do is if necessary and miss the net
amount<00:02:54.450> if<00:02:54.840> necessary<00:02:55.410> just<00:02:55.620> go<00:02:55.799> into

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
amount if necessary just go into

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.550 
amount if necessary just go into
practice<00:02:56.430> for<00:02:56.640> 15<00:02:57.090> minutes<00:02:57.329> you<00:02:57.959> know<00:02:58.079> trying

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
practice for 15 minutes you know trying

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.140 
practice for 15 minutes you know trying
out<00:02:58.769> with<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.920> right-handed<00:02:59.430> player<00:02:59.549> and<00:02:59.879> a

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
out with a right-handed player and a

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.280 
out with a right-handed player and a
left-handed<00:03:00.540> player<00:03:00.720> because<00:03:01.019> if<00:03:01.140> you're

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
left-handed player because if you're

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.349 
left-handed player because if you're
playing<00:03:01.440> hut<00:03:01.739> or<00:03:01.920> vs<00:03:02.430> you're<00:03:03.060> going<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.239> have

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
playing hut or vs you're going to have

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.970

probably<00:03:03.870> both<00:03:04.170> types<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.620> players<00:03:04.769> on<00:03:04.950> your

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
probably both types of players on your

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.559 
probably both types of players on your
team<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.819> don't<00:03:06.000> want<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.209> be<00:03:06.299> able<00:03:06.390> to
