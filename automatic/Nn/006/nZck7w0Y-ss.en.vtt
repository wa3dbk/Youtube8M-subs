00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.960
 we live in an economic system that 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.970
 imitates the lonely where the elite 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.099
 financially he would have it and it is 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.650
 feeding on us and do not like 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.510
 that their tricks are discovered after 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.550
 that Katherine began to uncover the 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.220
 government corruption in the highest 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.020
 levels the fbi conducted a raid 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.570
 in his company and he confiscated his 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.490
 belongings had to go trial in 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.150
 trial for ten years until the 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.150
 they declared innocent 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.739
 so we have the federal reserve a 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.929
 private corporation with the monopoly of 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.269
 create money but without having to pay 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:38.789
 accounts and that is also supported by the 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.199
 government with the monopoly of force 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:43.600
 they have deceived the country by making him believe 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.760
 that the reserve is an institution that 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.429
 helps stabilize the economy and that does not 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.530
 it depends on the policy but in fact in 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.269
 nearly a century of existence 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.879
 federal reserve has done just what 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.159
 the opposite since it was launched 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.260
 They have robbed us through inflation 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:03.420
 and the purchasing power of the dollar has 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.420
 decreased more than 97 percent 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.070
 and the difference between rich and poor 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.790
 makes it clear that the money is going to stop 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.790
 hands of a few 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.930
 only 16 years after the reservation 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.240
 federal to accede to power the usa 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.280
 they suffered the great depression in the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.680
 investigation I discovered that before 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.360
 that the crack should occur 29 the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.270
 elite bankers took their money from 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.920
 market after the crack they used that 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.750
 money to buy all the shares 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.659
 cheap and bankrupt banks 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.819
 small for little money 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.130
 among the bankers who consolidated their 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.950
 fortune in this way we find the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.719
 rocha in the rockefeller and the morgan a 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.539
 similar case happened with the collapse 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.069
 financial year 2008 in which again 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.560
 they returned to benefit the same 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.630
 bankers in the years before the collapse 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.119
 the biggest banks including bank of 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.740
 america citigroup and chase all of them 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.929
 controlled by rocha in the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.149
 rockefeller and the morgans were lined and 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.500
 they traded with junk loans whose 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.219
 money they knew they were not going to be able 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.219
 recover 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.790
 it's like putting some rotten oranges 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.980
 in a box and sell them as if they were 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.050
 of the best quality those who had 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.480
 based on that product they knew that late or 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.910
 early someone would open the box and see 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.770
 that did not contain anything of value because 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.090
 After all they had packaged 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.280
 said boxes 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.349
 when the rotten oranges what 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.879
 we know as junk credits the 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.590
 derivatives and hedges for 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.480
 credit default 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.940
 they discovered finally ended up 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.610
 affect everyone the people started 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.060
 to lose their houses jobs business and 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.680
 retirement funds meanwhile the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.840
 large banks that were the ones in 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.269
 reality created the problem were the 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.420
 unique to those who rescued and that for 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.190
 what because the federal reserve was going to give 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.560
 to the banks trillions of dollars though 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.819
 most Americans 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.250
 be against the rescues 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.319
 in and because they did not help the more 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.230
 in need I started helping those who 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.579
 perpetrated the financial collapse my 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.739
 investigation led me to the conclusion 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.750
 that the same people who created 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.250
 the federal reserve los rocha in the 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.379
 rockefeller and the morgans 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.239
 they still controlled it and they used this 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.239
 structure to be saved at our expense 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.710
 many of the banks created are still 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.720
 being the most powerful lobby in the 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.030
 capitol of the united states and them 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.400
 They are sincerely the owners of the place 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.709
 I am convinced that the recent 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.720
 financial collapse of 2008 was the 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.730
 result of a scheme to inflate and 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.740
 Orchestrated pull designed and executed 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.590
 by the big bankers for 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.480
 consolidate your fortunes and your power to 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.250
 life and explains how he sees the 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.850
 so-called business cycles of the 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.850
 federal Reserve 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.230
 phase 1 is like launching the phase 1 fishing line 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.810
 you put a lot of money units 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.090
 exchange outstanding for this 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.400
 you lower the interests and you grant many 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.390
 loans this is the part of the cycle that 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.390
 we call boom 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.420
 as there are many exchange units 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.459
 in circulation there is a lot of money 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.310
 that changes hands that generates a great 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.739
 economic activity that generates employment and 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.720
 how you spend more and more money increases 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.390
 the demand so the companies 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.250
 they request more credits of money just 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.630
 come out of the oven to increase its 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.000
 production people take confidence their 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.100
 routine as it turns out that I work for such 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.140
 company and has many orders works 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.880
 of wonder I have work assured and 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.520
 you know I'm thinking of buying a 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.180
 biggest house 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.280
 and then they start to change what they do 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.080
 is to pull the line the types of 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.080
 interest 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.510
 knauf and pipo now every time there is less 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.150
 people who get the credits 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.840
 because the concession conditions are 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.770
 have hardened and also by increasing the 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.840
 interest rates 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.569
 a large part of the salary of 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.259
 people are destined to pay that rise 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:14.810
 of interest and not consumption of 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:17.930
 suddenly there is not much money in 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.950
 circulation and therefore buy less 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.170
 things 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.300
 the profits of the companies begin 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.520
 to decrease they begin to reduce 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.660
 jobs and some start to 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.070
 close and people lose their jobs already 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.630
 they can not pay the mortgages of those 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.729
 large houses that had been purchased 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.219
 when everything went well 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.319
 now banks start collecting the 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:42.300
 line because while people are 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:44.490
 declares bankruptcy both 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.529
 companies like people banks 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.289
 they stay with the fortunes that yes that 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:51.889
 they are really 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.509
 with the properties the lands the 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.539
 resources that they had put as collateral 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.460
 so that you simply lend them in a few 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.099
 figures that only appeared on the screen 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.110
 of the computer and we have been with this 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.119
 economic cycle of pulling the line and 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.009
 pick up from injecting a lot of 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:08.930
 currency chop them 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:11.240
 and what has been done is actually 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.949
 steal and has been encouraged to accumulate 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.460
 the true wealth of the world in hands 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.460
 Of a few 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.200
 internationally banks 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.540
 central banks use the world bank and the 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.250
 international monetary fund to make 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.260
 more money while they exploit 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.300
 resources of those countries to which 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.700
 they lend you money and with this process 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.920
 they end up taking them to bankruptcy the 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.440
 central bank of central banks is 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.670
 the bank created by the rocha the bank 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.670
 of international payments 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.330
 the elite is positioning itself for 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:52.010
 control access to virtually everything 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.010
 what we need to survive 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.740
 it does not matter which part of the world you go 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.430
 because money is controlled by the 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.430
 banking system 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:05.310
 they decide if people eat or do not eat 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.080
 who becomes a billionaire and 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.200
 who survives with less than a dollar to 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.200
 day 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:14.550
 the one who controls the money controls the 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.970
 world and very few people control the 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.970
 money 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.289
 At this point my conception of 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:26.669
 world took a turn I started to face 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:29.100
 to the fact that failure and 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:31.470
 suffering of many is actually the 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.240
 success and realization of a few the 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.860
 elite of bankers who has cheated 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.530
 to the world and to those who have been allowed 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:40.560
 create money they all already own 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:44.570
 of vast fortunes then what is your 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.570
 purpose what are your objectives
