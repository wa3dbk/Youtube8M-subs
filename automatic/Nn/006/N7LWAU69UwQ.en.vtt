I<00:02:33.260> think<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.710> most<00:02:34.010> information<00:02:34.370> on<00:02:34.820> is<00:02:35.020> the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
I think the most information on is the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.100 
I think the most information on is the
two<00:02:36.440> things<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.860> world<00:02:37.220> itself<00:02:38.110> everything

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110
