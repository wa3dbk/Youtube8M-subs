00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello here today we're going 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.030
 disassemble the iphone 5 pieces 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.730
 with a small comparison on the iphone 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.679
 with the iphone 5 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.740
 so for dismantling 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.779
 in the same spirit as the others 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.820
 appliances 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.039
 you have currencies that is at 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.029
 the end of the phone where you have the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.029
 charging connector 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:36.120
 so here are two small screws next for 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.040
 take out the screen you have to go 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.140
 moderately and have some 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:47.730
 technical because in fact you have the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:50.059
 button that is him connect to the map 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.059
 mother 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.460
 you see that you still need a 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.140
 some way of doing to be able to 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.140
 take out this screen which is enough 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:25.600
 so here you see you have the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:36.700
 screen connector and no button 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:45.040
 skin here it must be of course some 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:51.760
 way to do so here we went off the hook 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:54.550
 the screen the button already on the screen and 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.110
 then you have the little plate that 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.110
 comes on the motherboard 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.019
 here 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.230
 the little room that holds on the screen 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.300
 so we will dissociate the screen from the map 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.300
 mother 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:12.220
 here we have disassembled the screen with the 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:18.739
 button with fingerprint 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:21.049
 we behave from the phone we go 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.879
 now disassemble the iphone 4s and make 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.909
 a little comparison between the two 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:29.829
 appliances 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:33.590
 the iphone is yes yes sorry iphone 5 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.420
 and 5 aces I repeat it's between the 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.019
 comparison between iphone 5s and 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.019
 the iphone 5 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:52.370
 so here too it is a certain fingering 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:04:03.470
 to be able to dissociate the screen from 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:09.220
 outline is often the screens are very 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:12.910
 very hard to remove so it takes above all 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.260
 not forced not to break the screen or 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.449
 or if the screen is filed the problem 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.150
 is that we can not suckers and 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:23.289
 so it takes some fingering to 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.289
 to be able to exit the screen 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.510
 so here we go open the iphone 5 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.760
 the iphone 5 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.240
 at 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.360
 there are only three vices unlike 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:34.310
 to the five rooms where you have four 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.310
 vices that hold a plate 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.669
 and here is the iphone 5 and iphone 5 is this 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:07.629
 you see that inside 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.129
 it's pretty much the same thing 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:09.810
 battery level it's practically 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:12.099
 the same 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:16.030
 the only difference is that you have 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:21.629
 the button with the fingerprint 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.629
 we do not have on the iphone 9.5 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:29.259
 then it's the processor 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.469
 which is different here is the 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:40.910
 processor that is on the map 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:43.460
 mother so I'll see you soon for 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.290
 rodez mount and for any repairs 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.660
 done by a professional come 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.000
 with us we are located two steps 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.970
 from the place of the star to 6 of the street 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.680
 rough in the 16th and one is open without 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:58.600
 interruption from 10 am to 8 pm 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.600
