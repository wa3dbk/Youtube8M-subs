00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.330
 [Music] 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:11.550
 ben ali is nearing its end these markers for 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.210
 a new video of dead island so 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.180
 this time it's just to show 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.670
 exclusive to download 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.810
 so here we call the ripper so 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.960
 surely some of you have it 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.140
 already also I show you and this after the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.140
 loading 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.680
 so that's it here I just have a bat 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.680
 will change 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:52.140
 so that's actually I think we can 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:55.829
 surely make it one of the others 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.510
 sticks so I remember pretty much from 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.320
 what would it take to make it l 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.110
 age use a baseball bat so 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.789
 I found the circular ribbon 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.200
 adhesive 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:09.780
 it seems to me beyond the batteries I 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.810
 has been preparing for three years so we're going 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.950
 can test what it looks like on 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.479
 inspect it and admit that there 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.479
 by making it yes 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.210
 here is a 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.570
 so sometimes we kill them from the first 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:49.250
 shot of all times no it's huge 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:55.600
 I find only able to lie in 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.600
 did another one that was pretending 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.960

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.070
