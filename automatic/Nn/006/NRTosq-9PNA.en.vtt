that<00:00:00.539> that<00:00:01.260> our<00:00:01.410> side<00:00:01.709> would<00:00:01.979> have<00:00:02.129> lost<00:00:02.310> this

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
that that our side would have lost this

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.210 
that that our side would have lost this
match<00:00:02.760> at<00:00:03.149> this<00:00:03.600> point<00:00:04.850> it's<00:00:05.850> hard<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.240> tell<00:00:07.220> is

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
match at this point it's hard to tell is

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.070 
match at this point it's hard to tell is
the<00:00:08.519> map<00:00:08.790> advantage<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.480> definitely<00:00:09.840> for<00:00:09.960> our

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
the map advantage is definitely for our

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.520 
the map advantage is definitely for our
team<00:00:10.490> but<00:00:11.490> it's<00:00:11.910> definitely<00:00:12.300> possible<00:00:12.780> for

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
team but it's definitely possible for

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.660 
team but it's definitely possible for
the<00:00:13.920> enemy<00:00:14.460> team<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:15.770> to<00:00:16.770> defend<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.400> still

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
the enemy team to to defend this I still

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.590 
the enemy team to to defend this I still
think<00:00:17.699> they<00:00:17.910> have<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.060> edge<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.539> a

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
think they have the edge in a

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.590 
think they have the edge in a
straight-up<00:00:18.960> teamfight<00:00:19.670> so<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:21.270> know<00:00:21.359> just

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
straight-up teamfight so you know just

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.630 
straight-up teamfight so you know just
sort<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.109> three<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.470> three<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.189> enemy<00:00:23.519> team

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
sort of three on three the enemy team

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.160 
sort of three on three the enemy team
has<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> edge<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.600> it's<00:00:24.750> going<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.930> come<00:00:25.109> down

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
has the edge so it's going to come down

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.689 
has the edge so it's going to come down
to<00:00:25.350> tactical<00:00:26.310> mistakes<00:00:27.050> made<00:00:28.050> by<00:00:28.380> one<00:00:29.220> team<00:00:29.460> or

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
to tactical mistakes made by one team or

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.760 
to tactical mistakes made by one team or
the<00:00:29.730> other<00:00:32.780> so<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.989> enemy<00:00:34.140> team<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.620> going<00:00:34.710> to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
the other so the enemy team is going to

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.990 
the other so the enemy team is going to
be<00:00:34.860> pinned<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.190> little<00:00:35.430> bit<00:00:35.550> by<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.730> fact<00:00:35.940> that

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
be pinned a little bit by the fact that

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.340 
be pinned a little bit by the fact that
there's<00:00:36.210> super<00:00:36.450> minions<00:00:36.630> coming<00:00:37.050> their<00:00:37.170> way

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
there's super minions coming their way

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.380 
there's super minions coming their way
now<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.760> going<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.969> be<00:00:39.030> pretty

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
now and that is going to be pretty

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.880 
now and that is going to be pretty
talent<00:00:39.840> because<00:00:39.989> they<00:00:40.140> may<00:00:40.320> not<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.649> able<00:00:40.739> to

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
talent because they may not be able to

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.290 
talent because they may not be able to
engage<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.340> three-on-three<00:00:41.670> situation

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
engage in a three-on-three situation

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.639 
engage in a three-on-three situation
especially<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:43.050> they're<00:00:43.200> if<00:00:43.379> they're<00:00:43.530> having

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
especially if they're if they're having

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.430 
especially if they're if they're having
the<00:00:43.800> bot<00:00:43.950> defend<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> bottom<00:00:44.850> turret<00:00:45.440> it's

the bot defend the bottom turret it's

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.709 
the bot defend the bottom turret it's
really<00:00:47.070> hard<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.309> tell<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:48.030> think<00:00:48.600> it's

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
really hard to tell I I think it's

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.720 
really hard to tell I I think it's

doesn't have it built into our character

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.060 
doesn't have it built into our character
unless<00:01:29.189> she's<00:01:29.340> able<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.670> turn<00:01:30.180> invisible<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
unless she's able to turn invisible and

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.649 
unless she's able to turn invisible and
without<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.189> flash<00:01:32.579> or<00:01:32.909> something<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:33.600> that

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
without a flash or something like that

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.929 
without a flash or something like that
she<00:01:33.960> had<00:01:34.049> nothing<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.770> possible<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.700> our

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
she had nothing it's possible that our

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.050 
she had nothing it's possible that our
team<00:01:36.329> has<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.650> Oracles<00:01:37.650> i'm<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:38.729> sure<00:01:38.939> if

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
team has a Oracles i'm not sure if

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.130 
team has a Oracles i'm not sure if
silver<00:01:39.299> doesn't<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.869> that's<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.229> sure

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
silver doesn't have it that's for sure

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.730 
silver doesn't have it that's for sure
and<00:01:43.159> I<00:01:44.240> think<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.630> probably<00:01:46.170> game

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and I think that this is probably game

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.560 
and I think that this is probably game
here<00:01:47.189> at<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.759> point<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> levels<00:01:48.360> are<00:01:48.450> high

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
here at this point the levels are high

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.789 
here at this point the levels are high
enough<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.899> Katarina<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.649> dead

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799

bush on the bottom turret which is

bush on the bottom turret which is
really<00:01:57.719> what<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.930> would<00:01:58.140> exist<00:01:58.409> would<00:01:58.950> have

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
really what I would exist would have

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.280 
really what I would exist would have
expected<00:01:59.520> I<00:02:00.119> don't<00:02:00.750> think<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.079> wave<00:02:01.259> is

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
expected I don't think this wave is

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.359 
expected I don't think this wave is
going<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.590> accomplish<00:02:01.740> too<00:02:02.040> much<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.280> a

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
going to accomplish too much of a

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.709 
going to accomplish too much of a
perhaps<00:02:02.670> there<00:02:02.880> are<00:02:02.909> two<00:02:03.149> super<00:02:03.479> minions

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
perhaps there are two super minions

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.319 
perhaps there are two super minions
there<00:02:04.460> chogath<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.820> try<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.000> fend<00:02:06.270> it

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
there chogath is going to try to fend it

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.510 
there chogath is going to try to fend it
off<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.860> yeah<00:02:07.860> he's<00:02:08.069> going<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> do<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.369> pretty

this true but here comes the push in the
bottom<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.319> now<00:02:13.470> yeah<00:02:13.709> they're<00:02:13.860> going<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.040> have

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.160 
bottom so now yeah they're going to have
a<00:02:14.160> hard<00:02:14.400> time<00:02:14.580> putting<00:02:15.510> up<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.750> convincing

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
a hard time putting up a convincing

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.009 
a hard time putting up a convincing
three-on-three<00:02:17.069> fight<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:18.420> tower<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:18.810> that

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
three-on-three fight this tower is that

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.089 
three-on-three fight this tower is that
about<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.230> third<00:02:19.319> health<00:02:19.709> it's<00:02:19.860> going<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.040> go

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
about a third health it's going to go

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.309 
about a third health it's going to go
down<00:02:20.129> almost<00:02:20.430> instantly<00:02:21.030> look<00:02:21.660> at<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.810> go<00:02:21.840> just

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
down almost instantly look at it go just

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.250 
down almost instantly look at it go just
drops<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.269> certainly<00:02:24.959> going<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.200> be

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
drops and that is certainly going to be

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.630 
drops and that is certainly going to be
game<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.739> don't<00:02:25.980> see<00:02:26.129> any<00:02:26.250> way<00:02:26.280> for<00:02:26.459> them<00:02:26.550> to

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
game I don't see any way for them to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.930 
game I don't see any way for them to
stop<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.330> inhibitor<00:02:27.720> from<00:02:27.840> dying<00:02:28.110> here

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
stop the inhibitor from dying here

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.039 
stop the inhibitor from dying here
definitely<00:02:29.940> not<00:02:30.090> since<00:02:30.299> no<00:02:30.569> one<00:02:30.690> has<00:02:30.810> showed

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
definitely not since no one has showed

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.460 
definitely not since no one has showed
up<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.910> could<00:02:33.090> be<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.330> catharina<00:02:33.870> was<00:02:34.080> still

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
up it could be the catharina was still

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.410 
up it could be the catharina was still
dead<00:02:34.680> even<00:02:34.890> at<00:02:35.099> that<00:02:35.250> point<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.700> only<00:02:36.180> see

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
dead even at that point I only see

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.240 
dead even at that point I only see
choked<00:02:36.720> off<00:02:36.870> maybe<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.799> other<00:02:37.920> team<00:02:38.129> has

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
choked off maybe the other team has

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.240 
choked off maybe the other team has
given<00:02:38.610> up<00:02:38.700> at<00:02:38.819> this<00:02:38.970> point<00:02:39.830> yeah<00:02:40.830> where<00:02:41.099> are

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
given up at this point yeah where are

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.920 
given up at this point yeah where are
they<00:02:41.430> unless<00:02:42.180> they're<00:02:42.390> doing<00:02:42.540> some<00:02:42.690> sort<00:02:42.900> of
