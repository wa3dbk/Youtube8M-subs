put it both spots put the target delay

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.109 
put it both spots put the target delay
at<00:00:17.760> what<00:00:18.029> we<00:00:18.180> wanted<00:00:18.539> three<00:00:19.020> 786<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.070> then<00:00:21.000> we

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
put the calibrated delay at 5:50 what

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.980 
put the calibrated delay at 5:50 what
you're<00:00:24.900> gonna<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.769> hit<00:00:26.490> start<00:00:27.590> and

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
you're gonna do here is hit start and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.110 
you're gonna do here is hit start and
minutes<00:00:30.990> be<00:00:31.109> minutes<00:00:31.830> before<00:00:32.130> target<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.850> two

854<00:02:54.620> again<00:02:55.400> if<00:02:55.520> it's<00:02:55.670> one<00:02:55.850> minute<00:02:56.060> 855<00:02:56.959> if<00:02:57.350> it's

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
854 again if it's one minute 855 if it's

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.290 
854 again if it's one minute 855 if it's
0<00:02:57.770> minute<00:02:58.040> zero<00:02:58.220> minutes<00:02:59.140> 856<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:01.280> keep<00:03:02.120> that

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
0 minute zero minutes 856 so keep that

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.040 
0 minute zero minutes 856 so keep that
in<00:03:02.450> consideration

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.510 

so<00:03:06.050> obviously<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.770> clocks<00:03:07.220> will<00:03:07.370> be

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
so obviously the clocks will be

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.280 
so obviously the clocks will be
different<00:03:07.850> for<00:03:07.970> everybody<00:03:08.209> depending<00:03:09.050> on

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
different for everybody depending on

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.920 
different for everybody depending on
what<00:03:10.780> your<00:03:11.890> what<00:03:12.890> your<00:03:13.070> delay<00:03:13.850> is<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:14.540> here<00:03:14.840> we

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
what your what your delay is so here we

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.750 
what your what your delay is so here we
go<00:03:15.050> we're<00:03:15.170> gonna<00:03:15.260> hit<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.530> once<00:03:15.980> this<00:03:16.160> hits<00:03:16.370> zero

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
go we're gonna hit a once this hits zero

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:25.810 
go we're gonna hit a once this hits zero
on<00:03:17.090> continue<00:03:23.020> all<00:03:24.020> right<00:03:24.080> there<00:03:24.620> we<00:03:24.769> go<00:03:24.820> we're

on continue all right there we go we're

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.500 
on continue all right there we go we're
gonna<00:03:25.910> go<00:03:26.300> ahead<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.100> hit<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.250> hello<00:03:28.510> or

exam I would put in hello put its nature

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.110 
exam I would put in hello put its nature
and<00:04:29.360> after<00:04:29.570> I<00:04:29.600> count<00:04:29.930> it<00:04:30.140> and<00:04:31.120> characteristic

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
and after I count it and characteristic

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.570 
and after I count it and characteristic
and<00:04:32.330> all<00:04:32.539> its<00:04:32.720> stats<00:04:33.020> okay<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.250> then<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:34.550> can

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
and all its stats okay and then you can

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.090 
and all its stats okay and then you can
mark<00:04:34.880> HGS<00:04:35.660> s<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:37.120> then<00:04:38.120> you'd<00:04:38.300> hit<00:04:38.479> find<00:04:39.100> now

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
mark HGS s and then you'd hit find now

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.820 
mark HGS s and then you'd hit find now
it<00:04:40.340> gives<00:04:40.640> you<00:04:40.820> a<00:04:40.850> time<00:04:41.510> and<00:04:41.960> seed<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.820> a<00:04:43.820> delay

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
it gives you a time and seed and a delay

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.060 
it gives you a time and seed and a delay
keep<00:04:45.830> in<00:04:46.010> mind<00:04:46.220> that<00:04:47.090> delay<00:04:47.560> go<00:04:48.560> back<00:04:48.800> to<00:04:49.039> your

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
keep in mind that delay go back to your

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.890 
keep in mind that delay go back to your
timer<00:04:49.460> I<00:04:49.760> wouldn't<00:04:50.120> do<00:04:50.180> it<00:04:50.210> now<00:04:50.419> cuz<00:04:50.630> I<00:04:50.690> didn't

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
timer I wouldn't do it now cuz I didn't

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.870 
timer I wouldn't do it now cuz I didn't
catch<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.110> but<00:04:51.800> this<00:04:51.919> is<00:04:52.100> what<00:04:52.250> I<00:04:52.280> would<00:04:52.760> do

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
catch it but this is what I would do

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.260 
catch it but this is what I would do
after<00:04:53.090> I<00:04:53.330> caught<00:04:53.660> it<00:04:53.840> I'd<00:04:54.740> go<00:04:54.979> to<00:04:55.039> the<00:04:55.580> get<00:04:56.240> the

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
after I caught it I'd go to the get the

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.180 
after I caught it I'd go to the get the
delay<00:04:56.660> from<00:04:56.900> here<00:04:57.200> make<00:04:57.770> sure<00:04:57.800> you<00:04:58.010> put<00:04:58.160> all

you're<00:05:05.320> gonna<00:05:05.440> hit<00:05:05.590> find<00:05:05.920> get<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:06.910> delay<00:05:08.820> go

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
you're gonna hit find get the delay go

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.880 
you're gonna hit find get the delay go
back<00:05:10.000> to<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.300> timer<00:05:10.600> and<00:05:11.350> then<00:05:11.680> you're<00:05:11.800> gonna

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
back to the timer and then you're gonna

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.110 
back to the timer and then you're gonna
put<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.280> delay<00:05:12.460> hit

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
put the delay hit

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.660 
put the delay hit
you're<00:05:13.270> gonna<00:05:13.360> put<00:05:13.600> what<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:13.930> got<00:05:14.280> in<00:05:15.280> the

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
you're gonna put what you got in the

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.200 
you're gonna put what you got in the
delay<00:05:16.630> and<00:05:16.930> then<00:05:17.500> you're<00:05:17.650> gonna<00:05:17.770> hit<00:05:18.210> update

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
delay and then you're gonna hit update

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.560 
delay and then you're gonna hit update
and<00:05:19.770> what<00:05:20.770> would<00:05:20.890> happen<00:05:21.040> is<00:05:21.340> this<00:05:21.580> calibrated

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
and what would happen is this calibrated

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.010 
and what would happen is this calibrated
delay<00:05:22.750> of<00:05:22.840> 550<00:05:23.500> would<00:05:24.400> change<00:05:24.790> into<00:05:25.540> a<00:05:25.570> number

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
delay of 550 would change into a number

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.290 
delay of 550 would change into a number
that<00:05:26.410> you<00:05:26.890> know<00:05:27.010> you<00:05:27.340> would<00:05:28.320> you<00:05:29.320> would<00:05:29.440> be

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
that you know you would you would be

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.400 
that you know you would you would be
good<00:05:31.300> for<00:05:31.540> good<00:05:31.840> for<00:05:31.870> you

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
good for good for you

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.170 
good for good for you
alright<00:05:33.130> so<00:05:33.490> change<00:05:34.180> into<00:05:34.480> that<00:05:34.630> number<00:05:34.840> now<00:05:35.770> I

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
alright so change into that number now I

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.180 
alright so change into that number now I
would<00:05:37.180> do<00:05:37.330> this<00:05:37.510> the<00:05:37.690> first<00:05:37.930> few<00:05:38.140> time<00:05:38.380> so<00:05:38.920> when

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
would do this the first few time so when

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.220 
would do this the first few time so when
you<00:05:39.280> get<00:05:39.430> that<00:05:39.550> number<00:05:39.760> so<00:05:40.120> for<00:05:40.780> example<00:05:41.080> I've

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
you get that number so for example I've

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.970 
you get that number so for example I've
already<00:05:41.560> done<00:05:41.710> this<00:05:41.890> in<00:05:42.100> my<00:05:42.280> number<00:05:42.640> was<00:05:42.790> 713

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
already done this in my number was 713

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.850 
already done this in my number was 713
right<00:05:44.980> so<00:05:45.700> say<00:05:45.880> I<00:05:45.910> got<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.480> my<00:05:47.020> next<00:05:47.260> delay<00:05:47.530> was

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
right so say I got and my next delay was

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.160 
right so say I got and my next delay was
um<00:05:48.250> the<00:05:48.610> delay<00:05:49.510> I<00:05:49.540> hit<00:05:49.870> was<00:05:50.730> who<00:05:51.730> knows<00:05:51.970> uh

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
um the delay I hit was who knows uh

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.100 
um the delay I hit was who knows uh
three<00:05:53.170> seven<00:05:53.980> nine<00:05:54.340> eight<00:05:54.790> instead<00:05:55.720> of<00:05:55.840> three

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
three seven nine eight instead of three

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.430 
three seven nine eight instead of three
seven<00:05:56.440> eight<00:05:56.590> six<00:05:56.860> I'd<00:05:57.700> update<00:05:58.180> it<00:05:58.360> and<00:05:59.050> it

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
seven eight six I'd update it and it

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.130 
seven eight six I'd update it and it
would<00:05:59.530> go<00:05:59.650> up<00:05:59.740> to<00:05:59.770> 725<00:06:00.700> but<00:06:01.030> I've<00:06:01.180> known<00:06:01.480> that

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
would go up to 725 but I've known that

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.870 
would go up to 725 but I've known that
my<00:06:02.290> delay<00:06:02.590> is<00:06:02.650> seven<00:06:02.980> thirteen<00:06:03.370> because<00:06:03.580> I've

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
my delay is seven thirteen because I've

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.650 
my delay is seven thirteen because I've
hit<00:06:04.060> it<00:06:04.210> so<00:06:04.420> many<00:06:04.600> times<00:06:05.190> so<00:06:06.190> way<00:06:06.340> to<00:06:06.660> increase

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
hit it so many times so way to increase

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.650 
hit it so many times so way to increase
your<00:06:07.690> accuracy<00:06:08.140> hitting<00:06:08.950> the<00:06:09.100> timer<00:06:09.660> just

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
your accuracy hitting the timer just

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.690 
your accuracy hitting the timer just
make<00:06:11.050> sure<00:06:11.200> you<00:06:11.320> calibrate<00:06:11.980> the<00:06:12.100> delay<00:06:12.430> and

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
make sure you calibrate the delay and

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.030 
make sure you calibrate the delay and
then<00:06:13.120> keep<00:06:13.360> putting<00:06:13.750> in<00:06:13.900> if<00:06:14.080> you<00:06:14.200> want<00:06:14.440> keep

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
then keep putting in if you want keep

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.140 
then keep putting in if you want keep
catching<00:06:15.400> the<00:06:15.460> Pokemon<00:06:15.820> if<00:06:15.940> you<00:06:16.000> have<00:06:16.120> a

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
catching the Pokemon if you have a

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.910 
catching the Pokemon if you have a
master<00:06:16.510> bowl<00:06:16.690> it's<00:06:16.870> even<00:06:17.110> better<00:06:17.260> catch<00:06:17.560> it

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
master bowl it's even better catch it

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.220 
master bowl it's even better catch it
get<00:06:18.610> the<00:06:18.730> delay<00:06:19.030> and<00:06:19.390> then<00:06:19.540> keep<00:06:19.750> putting<00:06:20.140> in

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.230 
get the delay and then keep putting in

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.960 
get the delay and then keep putting in
the<00:06:20.350> delay<00:06:20.590> and<00:06:20.770> hit<00:06:21.100> update<00:06:21.310> make<00:06:21.760> sure<00:06:21.880> you

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
the delay and hit update make sure you

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.670 
the delay and hit update make sure you
only<00:06:22.060> hit<00:06:22.240> update<00:06:22.480> once<00:06:22.870> or<00:06:23.110> also<00:06:23.290> to<00:06:23.470> mess

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
only hit update once or also to mess

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.680 
only hit update once or also to mess
everything<00:06:23.830> up<00:06:24.220> and<00:06:24.760> it<00:06:24.970> should<00:06:25.150> change<00:06:25.420> your

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
everything up and it should change your

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.110 
everything up and it should change your
delay<00:06:26.050> until<00:06:26.680> you<00:06:27.010> get<00:06:27.190> a<00:06:27.220> delay<00:06:27.580> that<00:06:27.790> you

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
delay until you get a delay that you

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.570 
delay until you get a delay that you
keep<00:06:28.360> hitting<00:06:28.570> you<00:06:29.290> know<00:06:29.380> that's<00:06:30.220> good<00:06:30.400> for

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
keep hitting you know that's good for

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.010 
keep hitting you know that's good for
you<00:06:31.410> so<00:06:32.410> in<00:06:32.470> my<00:06:32.590> case<00:06:32.770> it<00:06:32.920> was<00:06:32.950> seven<00:06:33.310> thirteen

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
you so in my case it was seven thirteen

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.250 
you so in my case it was seven thirteen
alright<00:06:35.020> so<00:06:35.230> that's<00:06:35.410> how<00:06:35.500> you<00:06:35.620> do<00:06:35.830> that

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260 
alright so that's how you do that

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.630 
alright so that's how you do that
check<00:06:38.260> out<00:06:38.410> the<00:06:38.560> orangie<00:06:38.950> video<00:06:39.280> I<00:06:39.340> have<00:06:39.580> a

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640 
check out the orangie video I have a

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.600 
check out the orangie video I have a
little<00:06:39.910> more<00:06:40.090> in-depth<00:06:40.390> on<00:06:40.600> there<00:06:40.810> but<00:06:41.610> that's

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
little more in-depth on there but that's

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.150 
little more in-depth on there but that's
about<00:06:42.880> it<00:06:43.090> for<00:06:43.240> that<00:06:43.420> so<00:06:43.930> I'm<00:06:44.260> gonna<00:06:44.500> go<00:06:44.830> ahead
