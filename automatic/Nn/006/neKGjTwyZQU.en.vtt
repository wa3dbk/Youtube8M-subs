is<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.190> think<00:00:53.219> more<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.449> everyday<00:00:54.780> use<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.949> keep

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
is I think more for everyday use to keep

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.270 
is I think more for everyday use to keep
the<00:00:56.280> back<00:00:56.460> from<00:00:56.699> scratching<00:00:57.710> as<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.100> see

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the back from scratching as you can see

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.770 
the back from scratching as you can see
there<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.520> no<00:00:59.670> protection<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
there is no protection here on the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.880 
there is no protection here on the
bottom<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.100> drop<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:03.589> this<00:01:04.589> will<00:01:04.769> get

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
bottom so if you drop it this will get

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.789 
bottom so if you drop it this will get
damaged<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.610> well<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> top<00:01:08.540> there<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:10.200> no<00:01:10.470> lip
