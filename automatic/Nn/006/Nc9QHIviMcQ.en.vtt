00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.679
 and 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.050
 and 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.290
 good morning to all boys and girls 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.510
 here you have a game in the 'operation 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.939
 assault meter patrol this mode of 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.500
 game that nobody plays although I understand 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.090
 because it's one game that the truth is 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.730
 which is quite funny I was not wearing 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.919
 time without playing and I started playing yesterday 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.750
 some games and such to actually record 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.590
 we left him if he wanted to play but he told me 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.930
 Not that he was going to sleep his ladybug 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.579
 that sleeping is for cowards and the truth 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.100
 is that it's a pretty game mode 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.140
 fun in fact especially playing 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.570
 with friends it's very very funny and very 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.219
 very easy to win but very very easy to 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.379
 win and especially if you're going to play 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.269
 competitive is a game mode that I 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.699
 I think it's quite worth it because 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.059
 it's a game that is very practical and 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.789
 you learn to defend both in an assault 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.170
 as in conquest you learn to defend 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.809
 eggs learn to defend or attack 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.000
 you also learn and as I told you 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.340
 it's kind of fun because it's 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.350
 pretty fluid because one hundred percent 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.500
 they are tickets and they are four against 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.390
 four and there are only two pumps that is 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.820
 they go by quite fast from the rounds 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.120
 in fact they can 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.890
 5 or 6 minutes at most eight that lasted 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.020
 a game that I also have recorded 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.570
 that I would upload later that is 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.540
 better even than this one although good this 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.920
 It's not a big deal but the one that has very 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.830
 recorded the truth is that it is quite 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.050
 quite well and I remember doing 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.840
 background time and I were talking about 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.600
 whatsapp and we set ourselves as goal 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.240
 make us the patrol assault medal and 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.550
 the truth is that we got it in 12 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.220
 days may be yes I think it's still 12 days 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.840
 playing with sound alone good with the 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.399
 people that were our patrol of 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.700
 there were people who even 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:59.450
 sample messages sent thanks for 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.119
 hold 10 rounds so to get the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.100
 medal and things like that the truth is that we 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.990
 we had a good time and we made ourselves 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.259
 pretty good games because apart 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.970
 is one is a game mode that makes you 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.310
 that you can get good very good 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.100
 split the truth so whoever 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.170
 I want to get good games roll I do not know 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.250
 I was playing yesterday and there were people who 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.350
 I took 900 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.820
 game very very good to get good 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.450
 games because there are only four 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.180
 Well, the time is not come when you see yourself 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.150
 there outnumbered or better 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.740
 you find two but no more than two 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.420
 you can find more than two the truth 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.070
 and that's also why I think it's a very 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.870
 good game mode to learn to play 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.150
 to jump well to the assault and everything but 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.520
 especially the assault is a very good way 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.530
 of game because as you see the bombs 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.440
 they are in the same place as in assault 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.580
 normal although there is only one but it is in 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.680
 the same site 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.060
 the next one is in the house of the 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.970
 left is not where the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.880
 van but in the house there are only two 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.590
 pumps per round so it's going 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.500
 pretty fast so it's pretty 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.760
 fluid everything and you learn to play you learn 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.709
 to move by assault because it's not what 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.750
 same move in assault that move in 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.700
 conquest and apart is a game mode 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.610
 very clean because you do not usually find 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.980
 Some campers will find you with c4 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.200
 there to the bastard in the bomb but in his 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.670
 most you can not find champions 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.830
 most people usually go to 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.680
 target is usually going to defend or attack 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:36.180
 do saved or do any 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.610
 foolishness do not usually throw smoke with the 220 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.230
 I do not usually throw what I do there will be some 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.510
 I pull it but the truth is that they tend to 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.040
 throw it and here the super streak starts 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.220
 in the game that the truth is that I 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.320
 killed six or seven can be followed 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.050
 in plan, none of the rest is loaded 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.700
 of the team less cargo I all the 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.160
 truth is that the team did not do 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.410
 great thing and wanted to also warn that 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.450
 the 8080 special is not yet engraved 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.330
 because you are fucking cracks and I thought 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.210
 that God and 8,000 within a 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.850
 week or so and in the end we reached 28 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.560
 thousand one hundred and one peak or that is incredible the 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.650
 truth is that many thanks for the 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.380
 support you always give us and record me and 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.930
 the special so I hope that inside 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.180
 a day two how much this special 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.920
 uploaded and you have it uploaded here so 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.050
 You already know in these next days to go up 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.620
 especially at 8080 that will end up in the end 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.290
 being special 8888 because I've seen 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.330
 the seen will end up being like that I hope that 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.090
 start playing a little more assault 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.210
 patrol because it's a game mode 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.800
 a lot of grief and very few people play 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.340
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.340
 see you
