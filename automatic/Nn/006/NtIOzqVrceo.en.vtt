really more of a fan of just getting the
job<00:00:10.380> done<00:00:10.410> versus<00:00:11.130> always<00:00:11.849> trying<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.269> Capra

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660

capture<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.410> training<00:00:13.830> on<00:00:13.950> film<00:00:14.250> back<00:00:14.639> and

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849

capture the training on film back and
forth<00:00:15.059> between<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.570> sets<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.619> hopefully<00:00:17.070> you

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
you guys some of the bench inge that i'm

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.419 
you guys some of the bench inge that i'm
doing<00:00:27.390> i'm<00:00:28.050> right<00:00:28.349> now<00:00:28.529> around<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:29.010> my<00:00:29.130> fifth

set coupled with one arm rows and really

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.220 
set coupled with one arm rows and really
what<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.820> want<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> talk<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.390> about<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.809> not

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
what I want to talk to you about is not

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.560 
what I want to talk to you about is not
just<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.559> bench<00:00:34.920> work<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.640> I'm<00:00:35.730> doing<00:00:35.760> but

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
just the bench work that I'm doing but

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.450 
just the bench work that I'm doing but
the<00:00:36.719> mental<00:00:36.989> toughness<00:00:37.230> involved<00:00:37.950> with<00:00:38.280> doing

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the mental toughness involved with doing

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.790 
the mental toughness involved with doing
couplets<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.719> one<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.079> simplest<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
couplets that is one of the simplest and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.400 
couplets that is one of the simplest and
quickest<00:00:41.160> ways<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.670> begin<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.629> develop<00:00:42.899> mental

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
quickest ways to begin to develop mental

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.819 
quickest ways to begin to develop mental
toughness<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.040> also<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> develop<00:00:45.120> more<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.660> a

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
toughness and also to develop more of a

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.529 
toughness and also to develop more of a
strength<00:00:46.829> endurance<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.789> power<00:00:48.090> endurance

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
strength endurance and a power endurance

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.200 
strength endurance and a power endurance
style<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.170> training<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:50.579> I'm<00:00:50.670> not<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> power

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
style of training so I'm not a power

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.779 
style of training so I'm not a power
lifter<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.230> I'm<00:00:52.320> not<00:00:52.469> specifically<00:00:53.280> training

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
lifter so I'm not specifically training

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.490 
lifter so I'm not specifically training
for<00:00:53.940> absolute<00:00:54.390> strength<00:00:54.690> although<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.230> have

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
for absolute strength although I do have

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.650 
for absolute strength although I do have
workouts<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.340> realm<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:57.210> I'm<00:00:57.300> doing<00:00:57.480> a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
workouts in that realm but I'm doing a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.200 
workouts in that realm but I'm doing a
lot<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.840> sets<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> press<00:00:59.219> anywhere

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210
