00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.219 
good to go let's do this all right now
the<00:00:59.799> chances<00:01:00.309> are<00:01:00.430> here<00:01:00.699> guys<00:01:00.879> if<00:01:01.839> you<00:01:01.989> look<00:01:02.110> at

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
the chances are here guys if you look at

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.810 
the chances are here guys if you look at
the<00:01:02.290> ranks<00:01:02.680> he<00:01:02.799> was<00:01:02.920> really<00:01:03.189> low<00:01:03.369> ranked

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
the ranks he was really low ranked

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.340 
the ranks he was really low ranked
compared<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.299> me<00:01:04.449> so<00:01:05.140> I<00:01:06.450> am<00:01:07.450> probably<00:01:07.780> going<00:01:08.200> to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
compared to me so I am probably going to

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.929 
compared to me so I am probably going to
be<00:01:08.439> able<00:01:08.680> to<00:01:08.740> just<00:01:08.890> toy<00:01:09.130> with<00:01:09.159> this<00:01:09.490> guy<00:01:09.670> and

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
be able to just toy with this guy and

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.270 
be able to just toy with this guy and
just<00:01:11.070> confusing<00:01:12.070> so<00:01:13.170> Goku<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.380> probably<00:01:15.070> one

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
just confusing so Goku is probably one

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.499 
just confusing so Goku is probably one
of<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.490> characters<00:01:15.909> that<00:01:16.030> I<00:01:16.090> really<00:01:16.479> enjoy

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
of the characters that I really enjoy

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.749 
of the characters that I really enjoy
playing<00:01:16.810> because<00:01:17.380> you<00:01:17.530> can<00:01:17.710> you<00:01:18.340> can<00:01:18.490> change

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
playing because you can you can change

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.480 
playing because you can you can change
your<00:01:18.939> form<00:01:19.299> like<00:01:19.539> three<00:01:19.810> or<00:01:19.929> four<00:01:19.990> times<00:01:20.490> but

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
your form like three or four times but

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.760 
your form like three or four times but
my<00:01:21.700> best<00:01:22.060> character<00:01:22.570> is<00:01:22.810> probably<00:01:23.170> medical<00:01:23.649> or

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
my best character is probably medical or

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.919 
exciting for you guys to watch so he's
also<00:01:37.030> a<00:01:37.179> character<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.659> can<00:01:37.899> go<00:01:38.829> and

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
transform and stuff like that so we're

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.279 
transform and stuff like that so we're
gonna<00:01:42.039> do<00:01:42.189> the<00:01:42.310> city<00:01:42.600> all<00:01:43.600> right<00:01:43.899> this<00:01:44.079> guy's<00:01:44.259> a

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
gonna do the city all right this guy's a

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.050 
gonna do the city all right this guy's a
low-level<00:01:44.710> rank<00:01:45.100> but<00:01:45.249> I<00:01:45.310> have<00:01:45.429> to<00:01:45.549> be<00:01:45.579> careful

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
low-level rank but I have to be careful

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.999 
low-level rank but I have to be careful
because<00:01:46.090> sometimes<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.200> low<00:01:47.350> level<00:01:47.530> ranks

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
because sometimes the low level ranks

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.260 
because sometimes the low level ranks
are<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.189> people<00:01:48.490> that<00:01:48.520> like<00:01:48.850> kind<00:01:49.090> of<00:01:49.210> like
