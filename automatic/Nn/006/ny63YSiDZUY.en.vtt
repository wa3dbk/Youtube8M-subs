 a video that lasts but these initials 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.309

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.330
 not what it is true that there behind 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.100
 of arles pc you do not see and where you 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.640

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.290
 you will see 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.210
 during the faq i will thank you a 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.920
 little bit better finally my name for this 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.540
 which is pack so when one is a 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.680
 creative that's how blocks you 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.060
 know them if you look at my 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.490
 videos because that's right it's in 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.090
 being I played pretty well with this pack 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.150
 otherwise, in terms of food 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.430
 that's the stuff like that 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.050
 that's all good I think if you have 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.000
 really liked my pacsÃ©s compared 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.970
 to the thick ones I put not that I did 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.980
 you have to know that there is less 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.470
 of a year I simply create these 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.670
 swords and I had them I had them a 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.320
 little left abandoned because I had 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.900
 a PC a little bit moldy compared to 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.910
 now and so she was she 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.100
 are in 512 by 512 so that made me 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.780
 super a lot the war of the blow there I 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.940
 I have them I added a sleeve 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.500
 I find the swords ben I find that 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.629
 this is the most beautiful I've seen a 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.720
 blame himself 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:14.159
 without being too pretentious 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.599
 but really really very very pretty 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.859
 so I think half of 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.579
 people who want the pacs and especially 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.660
 for ep 1 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.280
 me what I can that we 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.050
 there is no problem the armor is 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.610
 the default armor until then color 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.530
 blue was a little bit modified but 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.600
 nothing good, nothing good 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.400
 if not for decoration items ben lo 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.570
 it's all in the same pack 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.590
 the blocks I'm not there 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.120
 maybe a few that I did 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.990
 but most of them I picked up others 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.070
 packs I prefer to prevent 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.240
 if not for all that is 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.520
 objects I will leave you anyway 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.630
 discover for yourself so if not as 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.760
 you see it there at the start is everything 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.620
 simply 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.180
 wait, let 's do that, that's the high 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.640
 simply bared ultra personalized 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.780
 because there is my banner I wanted 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.230
 put my banner I think it makes 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.570
 pretty good 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.400
 and if not when I put myself in games 0 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.020
 that's about hearts etc 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.440
 and inventory and like this so 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.940
 again with my character 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.380
 that's narcissistic icare I'm 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.550
 conscious but good as it is 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.050
 for me finally here you can 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.820
 always I have it yourself there is no 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.050
 of worry if you do not know how to do it 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.250
 not very complicated you just have to 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.380
 change small folders etc 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.580
 finally good so suddenly I think that 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.050
 I have pretty much everything I hope when 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.640
 even that it will have made you happy 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.160

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.270
 and on this I tell you bevel the friends 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.630
