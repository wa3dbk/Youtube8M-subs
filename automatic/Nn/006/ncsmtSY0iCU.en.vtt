I was done by this guy from a bunch of

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.240 
I was done by this guy from a bunch of
other<00:01:23.970> xbox<00:01:24.420> one<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:24.990> he<00:01:25.770> really<00:01:25.890> wasn't<00:01:25.979> that

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
other xbox one but he really wasn't that

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.740 
other xbox one but he really wasn't that
anything<00:01:26.670> great<00:01:26.880> he's<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.090> very<00:01:27.360> very<00:01:27.479> good

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
anything great he's is very very good

Lynch<00:05:16.460> so<00:05:16.639> my<00:05:16.729> packs<00:05:16.969> really<00:05:17.389> weren't

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:17.629 
Lynch so my packs really weren't

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:19.059 
Lynch so my packs really weren't
anything<00:05:17.870> too<00:05:18.110> crazy<00:05:18.319> to<00:05:18.740> write<00:05:18.889> home<00:05:19.009> about

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:19.069 
anything too crazy to write home about

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.339 
anything too crazy to write home about
but<00:05:19.310> they<00:05:19.520> weren't<00:05:19.669> bad<00:05:19.909> so<00:05:20.330> I<00:05:20.539> think<00:05:20.900> I<00:05:21.139> might

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
but they weren't bad so I think I might

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.019
