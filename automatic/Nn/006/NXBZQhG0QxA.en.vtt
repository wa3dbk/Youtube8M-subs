00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
before you start braiding until you

before you start braiding until you
could<00:02:33.860> braid<00:02:34.100> in<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.520> direction<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:35.450> also

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
could braid in that direction I also

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.350 
could braid in that direction I also
wanted<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.740> show<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.070> that<00:02:37.490> for<00:02:37.850> some<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.210> my

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
braids I made hanging bantu knots just

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.150 
braids I made hanging bantu knots just
to<00:02:40.940> give<00:02:41.090> myself<00:02:41.240> a<00:02:41.570> curl<00:02:41.810> at<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.110> end<00:02:42.320> and<00:02:42.560> all

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
to give myself a curl at the end and all

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.070 
to give myself a curl at the end and all
I<00:02:43.190> did<00:02:43.340> was<00:02:43.640> twirl<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.450> hair<00:02:44.480> around<00:02:44.780> my

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
I did was twirl the hair around my

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.890 
I did was twirl the hair around my
finger<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.860> then<00:02:46.459> I<00:02:46.700> just<00:02:46.910> made<00:02:47.240> a<00:02:47.270> regular

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
finger and then I just made a regular

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.960 
finger and then I just made a regular
bantu<00:02:48.260> knot<00:02:48.470> by<00:02:48.620> making<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.100> small<00:02:49.430> loop<00:02:49.730> and

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
bantu knot by making a small loop and

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.360 
bantu knot by making a small loop and
then<00:02:50.150> wrapping<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.720> excess<00:02:51.260> hair<00:02:51.500> around

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
then wrapping the excess hair around

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.670 
then wrapping the excess hair around
itself<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.810> just<00:02:53.959> made<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.260> little<00:02:54.530> loop

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
itself and it just made this little loop

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.420 
itself and it just made this little loop
I<00:02:55.870> did<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.080> only<00:02:57.440> for<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.739> braids<00:02:58.010> where<00:02:58.310> the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
I did this only for the braids where the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.820 
I did this only for the braids where the
ends<00:02:58.790> weren't<00:02:59.120> completely<00:02:59.690> even<00:03:00.410> just<00:03:00.709> to

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
ends weren't completely even just to

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.290 
ends weren't completely even just to
make<00:03:01.010> sure<00:03:01.190> that<00:03:01.370> my<00:03:01.550> ends<00:03:01.820> would<00:03:02.000> remain

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
make sure that my ends would remain

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:09.550 
make sure that my ends would remain
smooth

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.530 

and<00:03:09.650> this<00:03:10.400> is<00:03:10.550> what<00:03:10.730> my<00:03:10.880> hair<00:03:11.090> looked<00:03:11.360> like

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
and this is what my hair looked like

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.960 
and this is what my hair looked like
when<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.780> was<00:03:11.870> finished<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.680> ended<00:03:13.010> up<00:03:13.100> with<00:03:13.400> 18

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
now if you're a person like myself that

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.360 
now if you're a person like myself that
does<00:04:50.240> not<00:04:50.420> care<00:04:50.750> about<00:04:50.780> definition<00:04:51.710> you<00:04:52.190> could

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
does not care about definition you could

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.430 
does not care about definition you could
separate<00:04:52.760> your<00:04:52.970> curls<00:04:53.300> however<00:04:53.780> you<00:04:54.200> like

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
which is exactly what I ended up doing

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.440 
which is exactly what I ended up doing
so<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.140> had<00:04:57.470> a<00:04:57.650> nice<00:04:57.920> mix<00:04:58.460> of<00:04:58.730> frizz<00:04:59.090> and

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
so I had a nice mix of frizz and

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.470 
so I had a nice mix of frizz and
definition<00:05:00.260> as<00:05:00.470> you<00:05:00.650> can<00:05:00.830> see<00:05:01.040> here<00:05:01.370> now<00:05:02.180> look

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
definition as you can see here now look

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.050 
definition as you can see here now look
there's<00:05:02.930> a<00:05:03.020> tremendous<00:05:03.860> difference<00:05:04.100> between

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
there's a tremendous difference between

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.990 
there's a tremendous difference between
when<00:05:05.210> I<00:05:05.240> first<00:05:05.630> unbraided<00:05:06.170> and<00:05:06.560> this<00:05:07.370> looks<00:05:07.760> up

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
when I first unbraided and this looks up

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.330 
when I first unbraided and this looks up
which<00:05:08.180> is<00:05:08.360> after<00:05:08.960> I<00:05:08.990> separate<00:05:09.650> it<00:05:09.830> now<00:05:10.070> while

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
which is after I separate it now while

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.850 
which is after I separate it now while
this<00:05:10.610> does<00:05:10.910> give<00:05:11.180> me<00:05:11.210> more<00:05:11.630> volume<00:05:11.900> it's<00:05:12.650> not

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
this does give me more volume it's not

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.430 
this does give me more volume it's not
nearly<00:05:13.340> as<00:05:13.580> much<00:05:13.940> fun

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
nearly as much fun

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.470 
nearly as much fun
