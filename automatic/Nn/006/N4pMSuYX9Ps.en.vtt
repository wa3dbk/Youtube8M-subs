I my non pivot foot my right
I<00:02:19.250> take<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.280> step<00:02:20.549> like<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.569> I've<00:02:22.530> lifted<00:02:22.890> my

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
I take a step like this I've lifted my

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.890 
I take a step like this I've lifted my

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
obviously in super slow motion so now my

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.839 
obviously in super slow motion so now my
right<00:02:28.019> foot<00:02:28.230> hits<00:02:28.409> the<00:02:28.500> ground<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.980> suppose<00:02:29.730> you

do I now travel never see it anybody
ever<00:04:39.990> done<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.230> raise<00:04:40.740> your<00:04:40.800> hands

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
ever done it raise your hands

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.800 
ever done it raise your hands
there<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.210> go<00:04:43.130> you<00:04:44.130> know<00:04:44.250> why<00:04:44.370> you<00:04:44.430> do<00:04:44.610> this

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
there you go you know why you do this

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.090 
there you go you know why you do this
because<00:04:45.810> your<00:04:46.170> body<00:04:46.470> weight<00:04:46.770> at<00:04:47.010> the

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
because your body weight at the

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.590 
because your body weight at the
beginning<00:04:47.610> is<00:04:47.700> too<00:04:47.850> far<00:04:48.060> forward

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600

jab<00:04:49.440> stepping<00:04:49.920> is<00:04:50.040> a<00:04:50.070> good<00:04:50.250> idea<00:04:50.550> because

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
jab stepping is a good idea because

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.690 
jab stepping is a good idea because
theoretically<00:04:51.870> he's<00:04:52.500> gonna<00:04:52.650> move<00:04:52.860> back<00:04:52.920> when

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
theoretically he's gonna move back when

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.170 
theoretically he's gonna move back when
I<00:04:53.730> jab<00:04:54.000> step<00:04:54.270> theoretically<00:04:55.100> but<00:04:56.100> even<00:04:56.970> if<00:04:57.060> you

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
I jab step theoretically but even if you

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.390 
I jab step theoretically but even if you
move<00:04:57.420> back<00:04:57.660> my<00:04:58.140> body<00:04:58.440> weights<00:04:58.710> now<00:04:58.920> so<00:04:59.160> far

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
move back my body weights now so far

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.740 
move back my body weights now so far
forward<00:04:59.640> that<00:04:59.850> when<00:05:00.060> I<00:05:00.090> want<00:05:00.420> to<00:05:00.540> switch

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
forward that when I want to switch

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.190 
forward that when I want to switch
directions<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.590> go<00:05:02.010> this<00:05:02.190> way<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.990> can<00:05:03.990> only

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
directions and go this way I can only

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.750 
directions and go this way I can only
really<00:05:04.500> pick<00:05:04.680> up<00:05:04.800> my<00:05:04.920> left<00:05:05.130> foot<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.460> prevent

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
really pick up my left foot to prevent

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.430 
really pick up my left foot to prevent
myself<00:05:05.880> from<00:05:06.180> falling<00:05:06.420> on<00:05:06.720> my<00:05:06.840> face<00:05:07.020> and

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
myself from falling on my face and

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.660 
myself from falling on my face and
breaking<00:05:08.010> my<00:05:08.130> nose

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
breaking my nose

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.110 
breaking my nose
so<00:05:09.630> as<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.650> fakes<00:05:10.920> go<00:05:11.130> higher<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:11.730> the<00:05:11.940> body

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
so as the fakes go higher and the body

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.930 
so as the fakes go higher and the body
weights<00:05:12.390> out<00:05:12.540> of<00:05:12.660> control<00:05:13.550> this<00:05:14.550> is<00:05:14.670> where<00:05:14.850> you

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
weights out of control this is where you

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.290 
weights out of control this is where you
get<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.210> travels<00:05:16.100> so<00:05:17.100> how<00:05:17.820> do<00:05:17.880> we<00:05:18.060> prevent

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
get the travels so how do we prevent

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.620 
get the travels so how do we prevent
traveling<00:05:18.750> what<00:05:19.650> do<00:05:19.710> we<00:05:19.830> do<00:05:19.950> not<00:05:20.160> to<00:05:20.310> travel

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
traveling what do we do not to travel

slow pace get your footwork down come
back<00:06:52.650> out<00:06:52.950> here<00:06:52.980> pass<00:06:53.400> the<00:06:53.580> ball<00:06:53.790> get<00:06:54.450> ready

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
back out here pass the ball get ready

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.890 
back out here pass the ball get ready
just<00:06:55.560> work<00:06:55.800> on<00:06:55.980> the<00:06:56.130> basic<00:06:56.550> components<00:06:57.060> just

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
just work on the basic components just

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.200 
just work on the basic components just
so<00:06:58.080> your<00:06:58.320> muscle<00:06:58.740> memory<00:06:58.860> and<00:06:59.310> your<00:06:59.850> memory

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.210 
so your muscle memory and your memory

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.870 
so your muscle memory and your memory
period<00:07:00.750> gets<00:07:01.470> this<00:07:01.740> into<00:07:02.160> your<00:07:02.310> brain<00:07:02.550> and

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
period gets this into your brain and

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.120 
period gets this into your brain and
then<00:07:03.540> as<00:07:03.660> you<00:07:03.780> get<00:07:03.960> older<00:07:04.290> get<00:07:04.500> more<00:07:04.680> talented

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
then as you get older get more talented

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.400 
then as you get older get more talented
get<00:07:05.430> stronger<00:07:05.820> you'll<00:07:06.540> be<00:07:06.720> able<00:07:06.840> to<00:07:07.020> do<00:07:07.140> it<00:07:07.260> at

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.410 
get stronger you'll be able to do it at

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.400 
get stronger you'll be able to do it at
a<00:07:07.470> faster<00:07:08.160> and<00:07:08.280> higher<00:07:08.460> level<00:07:08.960> this<00:07:09.960> may<00:07:10.350> be

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.410 
a faster and higher level this may be

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.890 
a faster and higher level this may be
the<00:07:10.800> single<00:07:11.100> hardest<00:07:11.670> thing<00:07:11.970> that<00:07:12.540> I<00:07:12.570> teach

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 
the single hardest thing that I teach

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.050 
the single hardest thing that I teach
teenage<00:07:13.320> basketball<00:07:13.740> players<00:07:13.950> and<00:07:14.760> some<00:07:14.970> of

teenage basketball players and some of

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.520 
teenage basketball players and some of

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.530 
you is saying no all of this is fake

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.470 
you is saying no all of this is fake
right<00:07:16.710> and<00:07:16.830> go<00:07:16.920> left<00:07:17.130> or<00:07:17.400> fake<00:07:18.060> left<00:07:18.240> and<00:07:18.420> go

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.780 
right and go left or fake left and go
right<00:07:18.660> but<00:07:19.530> if<00:07:19.620> you<00:07:19.710> think<00:07:19.890> of<00:07:20.040> the<00:07:20.160> forces<00:07:20.580> and

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:20.790 
right but if you think of the forces and

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.180 
right but if you think of the forces and
the<00:07:21.330> balance<00:07:21.750> and<00:07:21.960> having<00:07:22.620> to<00:07:22.680> move<00:07:22.800> your<00:07:23.040> feet

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.190 
the balance and having to move your feet

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.190 
the balance and having to move your feet
and<00:07:23.400> the<00:07:23.670> ball<00:07:23.850> and<00:07:24.180> getting<00:07:24.630> that<00:07:24.780> stuff<00:07:25.050> all

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.200 
and the ball and getting that stuff all

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.310 
and the ball and getting that stuff all
together<00:07:25.350> this<00:07:26.340> is<00:07:26.520> not<00:07:26.700> easy<00:07:26.910> at<00:07:27.090> all<00:07:27.320> so

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:28.320 
together this is not easy at all so

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.170 
together this is not easy at all so
don't<00:07:28.530> ever<00:07:28.680> say<00:07:28.980> to<00:07:29.010> yourself<00:07:29.160> Oh<00:07:29.610> today<00:07:30.030> I'll
