00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
have really kinky hair and it makes it a

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.839 
have really kinky hair and it makes it a
lot<00:03:36.730> easier<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:37.239> detangle<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.400> if<00:03:39.400> you're<00:03:39.639> like

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
lot easier to detangle so if you're like

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.780 
lot easier to detangle so if you're like
me<00:03:40.389> and<00:03:40.659> you<00:03:41.530> have<00:03:41.709> really<00:03:42.040> i<00:03:42.310> think<00:03:42.430> that's

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
me and you have really i think that's

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.699 
me and you have really i think that's
pretty<00:03:42.879> much<00:03:43.060> has<00:03:43.299> like<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.540> citrus<00:03:44.229> type<00:03:44.470> smell

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
pretty much has like a citrus type smell

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.500 
pretty much has like a citrus type smell
which<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.190> really<00:03:45.370> love<00:03:45.579> I<00:03:45.760> really<00:03:46.090> love<00:03:46.239> citrus

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
which I really love I really love citrus

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.509 
which I really love I really love citrus
so<00:03:47.199> I'm<00:03:47.260> probably<00:03:47.409> had<00:03:47.709> about<00:03:47.829> kind<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.310> bias

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
so I'm probably had about kind of bias

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.909 
so I'm probably had about kind of bias
on<00:03:48.819> that<00:03:49.000> part<00:03:49.239> but<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:50.109> really<00:03:50.470> has<00:03:50.709> this

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
on that part but it really has this

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.520 
on that part but it really has this
citrus<00:03:51.190> type<00:03:51.760> smell<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.389> smells<00:03:52.720> so<00:03:52.840> great<00:03:53.229> I
