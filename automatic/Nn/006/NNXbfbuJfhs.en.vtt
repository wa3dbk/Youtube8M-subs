00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:09.420
 hello this is siena fire 1.0 eight 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.910
 valves year 2002 2003 and presented a 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.059
 loss of oil but without presenting 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.260
 leakage at every oil change in 15 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.480
 thousand kilometers that I make the exchange 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.880
 according to the manufacturer's recommendation 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.420
 he suffered loss of more than one 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:39.770
 the first one of oil and then the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:39.770
 recommendations of the adg that probably 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.079
 replaced with a new part that 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.910
 presents a new flame a screen there 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.160
 the substitution will be made of this 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.989
 component expecting the leak to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.859
 has passed the recording to make the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.859
 part replacement 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:09.650
 now remove this upper casing 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.970
 to begin the replacement of this 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.270
 piece 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.560
 and here the piece already involved showing the 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:23.030
 nothing dry and not inside 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.770
 it's a lot of dross and a lot of dirt that she 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.940
 also receive every single cracking 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.470
 then showing the need to 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.470
 really be replaced 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.479
 so here we notice clearly the 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:47.520
 difference between a new part and 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:50.970
 call him and he will not get du foul of good and 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.830
 with the real need of 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.720
 I replaced it 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.680
 so here the piece was partially 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.680
 compensated 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.990
 the placement now with this new 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.990
 component 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.149
 So now we've fixed the play. 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.950
 we replaced the clamps because they were 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.580
 this march a little way 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.010
 different from the previous one but now 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.570
 people only need to fix this part to 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.610
 make those screws and done it is over 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.650
 Now we're going to turn and see if 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.470
 will actually decrease oil consumption 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.880
 and if there will be no leak in this 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.700
 old region above the engine 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.770
 Good. So, thank you, Alexandra. 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.750
 hi torque for clarifying my 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.240
 technical doubt where I claimed that my 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.910
 car lost some oil and thought 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.890
 it would be because're not present and 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.140
 thermostatic valve has no back 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.550
 Here it is then to pass that thing there. 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.530
 some engine change 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.650
 actually have engine changes that the 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.930
 He explained that sometimes not 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.090
 have to do with oil loss and my car 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.150
 also presented another fault in the 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.550
 coupled hose a mania where it comes from 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.920
 anti car air filter calls and 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.680
 that mania was cracked 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.709
 cracked and very dirty in the anti flame and with 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.200
 obliterating good and the passage and this 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.160
 favors rather a loss of oil 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.880
 Replacement Lubricant Taking Video 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.300
 for you 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.470

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.140
 It was really cool and I would also like to

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.450
 of being a dentist mechanic in niterÃ³i in 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.820
 Rio de Janeiro and I do not have this 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.769
