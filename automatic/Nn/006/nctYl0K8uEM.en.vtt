00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
I've noticed that a common color palette

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.240 
I've noticed that a common color palette
in<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.450> 60s<00:01:36.869> was<00:01:37.079> warm<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.680> muted<00:01:37.950> which<00:01:38.100> is

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
in the 60s was warm and muted which is

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.069 
in the 60s was warm and muted which is
why<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.400> went<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.000> brown<00:01:39.210> suede<00:01:39.479> skirt<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
why I went for the brown suede skirt and

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.530 
why I went for the brown suede skirt and
I<00:01:40.530> know<00:01:40.680> these<00:01:41.189> boots<00:01:41.430> look<00:01:41.640> intimidating<00:01:41.909> but

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.000 
I think it's casual edgy and definitely
not<00:04:42.150> sloppy<00:04:42.480> I<00:04:42.870> went<00:04:43.230> for<00:04:43.410> a<00:04:43.470> cool<00:04:43.710> layered

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
not sloppy I went for a cool layered

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.310 
not sloppy I went for a cool layered
look<00:04:44.310> with<00:04:44.580> this<00:04:44.760> extra<00:04:45.210> long<00:04:45.300> flannel<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:45.990> I

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
look with this extra long flannel and I

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.990 
look with this extra long flannel and I
find<00:04:46.560> that<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.740> really<00:04:46.770> tones<00:04:47.280> down<00:04:47.670> this

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.820 
find that it really tones down this
black<00:04:48.300> dress<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:48.900> makes<00:04:49.290> it<00:04:49.410> perfect<00:04:49.710> for
