 You guys but the day was busy and the video 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.160
 today is again about carla come to 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.900
 faith and this video is 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.550
 talking to you here about more 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.010
 news that the game will be bringing 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.990
 two novelties there is then as much 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.539
 interesting though they are not so 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.580
 let's say as striking as others 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.130
 that I already brought I covered for you as 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.320
 the news of the profit to clÃ©sio I caught in the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.090
 chic school thing about guns 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.100
 supply drop has and knows that the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.420
 plenty of new stuff , right? 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.910
 and yet we have some things 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.040
 It's meticulous to leave that suddenly pass 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.180
 unnoticed by you and that are by 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.379
 example two of the things he is 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.600
 covering here today 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.670
 today I will talk about the virtual lobby and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.370
 virtual fire regina are two news 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.469
 never appeared any other code and will 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.660
 be present at the advance wars party 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.350
 Let's start by talking about virtual 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.840
 lobby 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.420
 what is the virtual ovi basically is 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.880
 the new form of lobbying that the advent of 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.580
 coffee decided to adopt for that year then 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.619
 is the lobbies decod to the goal always 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.299
 they were all very similar not always 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.159
 have on the left side the list of 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.600
 players in the issue of lobby players 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.250
 who are in the lobby on the right side 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.590
 is usually another type of information 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.119
 is the then vice versa suddenly the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.650
 players are on the right side on the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.229
 left has other information 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.150
 How do you get back on the next map? 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.640
 I do not know is there is also information from 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.710
 other players sometimes have it is what 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.840
 suddenly the guy in the pocket for example the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.030
 people have the option to see the character 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.829
 here of everyone who was in the room 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.229
 by the way he is personalized and 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.880
 everything else and the advent of the following 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.100
 more or less for that goal line of 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.750
 customization as you know the level 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.430
 debtor's personalization will be 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.360
 too loud I already talked about it in video 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.100
 for you 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.450
 we will have many things to 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.729
 customize charlie's character 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.310
 very different and this is being very 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.159
 focused on this virtual lobby citing 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.899
 background there is already some images it is 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.180
 basically this is how the 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.759
 advance wars lobby supposedly 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.890
 so it will then be the image 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.179
 and is always a soldier. 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.009
 obviously when you enter the album 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.350
 will always be showing his soldier and 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.990
 you can swap sideways and see 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.610
 the soldiers who are 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.410
 in the room also the other players like 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.480
 they were personalized and you can 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.800
 go into more details and see which 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.660
 items he is suddenly using you 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.280
 liked that cause of that helmet 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.380
 that he 's wearing things like you 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.600
 you can see what it is is believe 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.710
 It was also for you to see, it 's how you do it. 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.870
 unlock in case you do not have 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.460
 still locked and everything and you 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.220
 can see that on the left side of the screen 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.140
 stay there is the lobby information I am 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.460
 the next map and everything beyond the 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.750
 people in the lobby 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.540
 obviously must also have a way 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.280
 you see is the cradle of the person nor the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.680
 steppes and everything else 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.480
 including what they are talking about 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.640
 people will get back the record fight 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.500
 the agent in the backoffice a well detailed 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.610
 and everything else 12 bodies also presented 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.680
 a record breaking 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.120
 so I think this kind of information 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.770
 It will still be visible but you can 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.390
 realize that the winner's lobby is fair 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.940
 who are calling it a virtual lobby 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.310
 changed really really now you can 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.900
 see there in detail what you are 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.510
 facing you to say that he is using 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.610
 but do not forget this customization this 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.160
 cosmetic shift and the character teaches 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.930
 gameplay in itself but anyway is 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.520
 interesting they added a 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.500
 Strange thing about the spine I think they 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.690
 already tried to do that with goals but soon 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.340
 It is said that not everyone still called 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.540
 for this part of customization of 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.890
 clothes and everything else 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.960
 I think there is no winner vacation will be 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.520
 heavier I think we are 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.810
 doing for example in several games for 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.990
 free to play there that are very successful 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.520
 with whiskey for example in the case of the UOL 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.050
 staff spends money with promises 15 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.090
 leaving the character in a costume 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.060
 different thing like opponent 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.200
 Faith seems to have taken some of this and will 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.590
 try to leave the professionalization 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.790
 quite striking and quite varied 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.500
 quite vast 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.840
 ok let's talk now about the virtual 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.490
 firewind is not a new version of the 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.940
 firewind unfortunately is not a 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.400
 remastering is 2.0 range family is 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.100
 simply a way for you to test 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.110
 your guns in the then is I found a lot 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.880
 interesting novelty but are less than 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.860
 background is basically you 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.290
 clicking a button you enter this 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.840
 cold virtual network and in this field of fire 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.400
 virtual nee and you can test class that 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.109
 You just mount the gun that you 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.820
 just set the most impressive 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.410
 of everything is that it has no screen 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.180
 away snapshot you rode on your 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.280
 class is pushing a button and I think it 's the 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.910
 crux square'm not sure that the 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.980
 button that 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.810
 You press you already enter the virtual 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.700
 fially randi automatically the question of 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.220
 two seconds there and you can start 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.200
 to shoot test your gun see how it got 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.120
 I even remembered how everything went. 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.080
 right click the button you already vote 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.210
 first class 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.620
 You can do this both in yours. 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.080
 Club athlete or when creating the 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.550
 its class as well as among the lobbies 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.810
 among the lobbies you will be able 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.510
 between the long the di grassi between the 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.740
 during the nines between a 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.570
 another, but it is also possible to 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.670
 that you do these tests you can 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.890
 always modify your classes right 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.960
 during breaks and go there yourself 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.310
 you can use the engine fire range then 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.930
 I found a very interesting novelty. 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.910
 especially for those who are more novice 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.920
 In the series, you do not understand. 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.810
 great that this up to time does as it is 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.310
 It works palmira I think it goes 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.140
 to be a very interesting novelty who 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.030
 knows this will decrease the number of miles 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.890
 bad used by novice players 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.120
 because it's something that makes me angry not 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.530
 I know you're not something that makes me angry 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.120
 is that sometimes we're playing 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.160
 Obviously so usually have some 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.930
 novices and then you're stepping over you 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.810
 pick up the ground and see that gun he 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.390
 Strange chord that she looks at is, I do not know. 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.830
 all with an incredible that does not match 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.670
 nothing with the gun than the guy was 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.380
 using 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.450
 This is usually done by a lot of people. 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.400
 It's starting in the game, it's normal, it's not 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.840
 nothing too much but it is something that sometimes 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.030
 Annoys you a little 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.350
 and suddenly with the virtual firewind this 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.060
 type of player will have this chance to 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.600
 test and see how you're going to be friends 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.790
 before using nÃ© then called on 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.040
 novelty and is one of the new 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.330
 implementations of earth's adverse 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.190
 So this is what this video is supposed to show. 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.380
