 There are usually revered that can itgetgo date in the next two dwaetgo safflower, etc. 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.420
 That I have to be careful to limit this little carol, so if the wheat is not so 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.610
 Pushing out forces yireonde 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:01.890
 I can turn off the roots, and then I will be silently responsible 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.170
 Another must when a pair's press 0 doegeodeunyo need to map this way the roots 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.960
 I have to listen. 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.720
 Biting when a simple 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:16.340
 If you are under chungmu , this is what happens when you stop 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.899
 If the day inside the axis becomes 4 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:25.069
 Ah, so this shape could push out is detected so 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:28.189
 So when you keep your best, 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:32.450
 This kind of society is also tangible 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:35.209
 Now called the jjangjjang a job to do. Now can we do that using a liquid here 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.789
 It will be drilled and clicked 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:41.359
 It's an ambition , but if it's work, 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:47.149
 Well, then, 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:48.979
 One point to sleep sitting in an easy fold hands except interviewed everyone by doing so so 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.590
 Because you can create shapes 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:58.549
 Look before date keepers are extremely elastic why is because later 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.929
 After watching him out so it can be understood teji 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:07.939
 When I go out I came off this faction so here subakdo 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:13.540
 It is confirmed that the whole is not alive. 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:16.120
 I like me to show me another rea second coming age, this is me 2 kkakkungyi 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.799
 Then it goes down like this 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:25.810
 So when butyeoteul thus manne that now goes from here. 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:27.670
 Here, for example, if the amount of sun becomes much different , 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.970
 Clogged 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:36.159
 I feel a little bad, I do not do networks have 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:40.770
 4 So inde g2 scene 102 is inserted so the number of good talk 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:44.700
 Inserting characters If yo Stepping here four lined 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:50.250
 Oh, I can not tell anymore what You were leading the Highlands this way 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:53.550
 Park, the officer is not feeling well even if he does this once in a while . 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.850
 Well, you have to wear clues on the other side. 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:03.210
 4 I'll be there next 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:05.580
 At this time, if you stop it, you can drag it and hold it tightly. 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:11.460
 The joint is bang 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:15.600
 I mean, the power is very good when you stop. So in this genre, 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:19.860
 In terms of qualities, when it happens in an electronic Mac, 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:23.460
 I do not know what college are you math so it came 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:28.380
 If you go after this again, 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:31.170
 Do that after following the correct get here so often beaten just sprinkle 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:36.510
 Still strong, but it's not strong 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:40.590
 Culture is a very highs and shake stand these scenes if he just broke 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:44.250
 Just when I can not even here, so if the full film 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.390
 I do not want to hit it like that . 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:53.310
 I can not go beyond that . 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:58.800
 The haejugo Nago understand now reaching out to give the appearance that pushes 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:02.819
 This shape is also in the shape of a string . 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.230
 This is what I like to do with the feeling that I like snowflake . 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.730
 In this way 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:13.860
 If you stop it, put it on it. 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.390
 It took a lot of luck. 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.930
 Yo 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:25.290
 If you get 2 pairs, it means you do not want to. 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:30.840
 So this is not the case here. 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:35.130
 If you stick it, this is the strongest. Come on. Come on . But the swan 's okay. 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.680
 We will not break the amount of the end of the day so that by this second element 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:43.160
 This exchange, in this way , 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.160
 When you catch anything, not including salvage turtles 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:53.230
 Of course, the whole day and check out what I feel today is not the whiteness donations 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:57.340
 So there is no crystallization stick 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:05:01.750
 Flip the tops will be disciples and siege. 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:05.200
 Well, you can not just sit here like this. 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.950
 Always gotta be right, so far so 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.280
 When it is slow, it lays words 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:15.460
 If you do not get it next time, it's like this. 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:20.920
 He can not do that, 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.640
 Oh, the one-sided scores of organizations have you bouncing a little, the weight of the end of verse 7 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.060
 Beep 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:28.450
 I always write down my way 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:32.650
 Indeed, when the power of this 18 minutes jeossi 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.510
 Today's shapes are derived from a lot of them. 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.910
 I hope you remember. 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.910
 Let's review what we have learned so far.
