00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.640 
actually a chain replacement this is

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.579 
actually a chain replacement this is
probably<00:00:15.910> not<00:00:16.090> the<00:00:16.209> proper<00:00:16.689> way<00:00:16.869> of<00:00:16.900> doing<00:00:17.079> it

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:17.589 
probably not the proper way of doing it

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.189

with this bottom hand I sat there in a
role<00:01:27.850> to<00:01:27.880> sprocket<00:01:28.540> until<00:01:28.870> the<00:01:28.990> chain<00:01:29.229> came

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.210 
around to the backside and brought it up
to<00:01:37.000> about<00:01:37.210> right<00:01:37.270> here<00:01:37.750> which<00:01:38.350> you<00:01:38.530> can<00:01:38.650> see<00:01:38.860> is

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
to about right here which you can see is

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.969 
to about right here which you can see is
a<00:01:39.280> new<00:01:39.580> one<00:01:39.760> and<00:01:39.970> then<00:01:40.810> I<00:01:40.840> basically<00:01:41.140> linked<00:01:41.860> it

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
a new one and then I basically linked it

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.270 
a new one and then I basically linked it
in<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.430> then<00:01:42.760> pressed<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.680> quarter<00:01:44.680> pier<00:01:44.890> or

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
in and then pressed the quarter pier or

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.000 
in and then pressed the quarter pier or
the<00:01:46.000> piece<00:01:46.360> back<00:01:46.600> in<00:01:46.900> with<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.530> plate<00:01:47.770> and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
the piece back in with the plate and

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.399 
the piece back in with the plate and
then<00:01:48.430> the<00:01:48.610> locking<00:01:49.090> pin<00:01:49.240> but<00:01:49.869> make<00:01:50.049> sure<00:01:50.080> that

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
then the locking pin but make sure that

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.649 
then the locking pin but make sure that
your<00:01:50.560> locking<00:01:50.950> pin<00:01:51.159> is<00:01:51.430> facing<00:01:51.909> towards<00:01:52.570> the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
your locking pin is facing towards the

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.660 
your locking pin is facing towards the
back<00:01:52.810> end<00:01:53.080> you<00:01:53.170> don't<00:01:53.409> want<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:53.619> face<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:54.130> this

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
back end you don't want it face and this

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.590 
back end you don't want it face and this
way<00:01:54.880> where<00:01:55.119> snaps<00:01:55.450> on<00:01:55.720> okay<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:57.450> that's<00:01:58.450> the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
way where snaps on okay so that's the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.350 
way where snaps on okay so that's the
way<00:01:58.750> it<00:01:58.869> looks<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.549> know<00:02:00.549> this<00:02:00.760> is<00:02:00.880> probably<00:02:01.210> not

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
way it looks I know this is probably not

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.270 
way it looks I know this is probably not
the<00:02:01.420> best<00:02:01.659> video<00:02:01.840> but<00:02:02.380> it'll<00:02:02.770> work<00:02:02.920> for<00:02:03.130> right

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
the best video but it'll work for right

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.100 
the best video but it'll work for right
now<00:02:04.619> consider<00:02:05.619> and<00:02:06.299> basically<00:02:07.299> had<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.659> extend

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
now consider and basically had to extend

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.360 
now consider and basically had to extend
my<00:02:08.259> tire<00:02:08.440> out<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.910> a<00:02:10.030> little<00:02:10.300> bit<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.780> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
my tire out just a little bit to the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.559 
my tire out just a little bit to the
second-to-last<00:02:12.370> tooth<00:02:12.910> this<00:02:13.300> one

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
second-to-last tooth this one

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.089 
second-to-last tooth this one
a little<00:02:13.900> off<00:02:14.049> because<00:02:14.349> this<00:02:14.620> piece<00:02:14.890> right

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
a little off because this piece right

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.280 
a little off because this piece right
here<00:02:15.459> actually<00:02:15.939> kind<00:02:16.599> of<00:02:16.659> spun<00:02:16.989> on<00:02:17.109> me<00:02:17.260> a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
here actually kind of spun on me a

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.410 
here actually kind of spun on me a
little<00:02:17.560> bit<00:02:17.709> which<00:02:18.040> as<00:02:18.730> long<00:02:18.939> as<00:02:19.060> it's<00:02:19.209> locked

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
little bit which as long as it's locked

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.059 
little bit which as long as it's locked
in<00:02:19.629> chain<00:02:20.019> look<00:02:20.200> straight<00:02:20.499> tire<00:02:20.829> look

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
in chain look straight tire look

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.739 
in chain look straight tire look
straight<00:02:21.340> that's<00:02:21.700> all<00:02:21.819> that<00:02:21.939> matters<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.209> me

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:24.749 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:27.569 

that's<00:02:25.749> pretty<00:02:26.439> much<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.889> the<00:02:27.129> chain<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.489> I

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
that's pretty much it the chain that I

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.959 
that's pretty much it the chain that I
got<00:02:27.760> was<00:02:28.060> an<00:02:28.719> actual<00:02:29.079> oring<00:02:29.590> chain<00:02:29.920> my<00:02:30.790> thing

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:30.969 
got was an actual oring chain my thing

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.660 
got was an actual oring chain my thing
was<00:02:31.090> like<00:02:31.349> 9,000<00:02:32.349> tensile<00:02:32.739> strength<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.250> little

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
was like 9,000 tensile strength a little

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.610 
was like 9,000 tensile strength a little
over<00:02:33.849> 9,000<00:02:34.510> almost<00:02:34.750> 10,000<00:02:35.319> tensile

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
over 9,000 almost 10,000 tensile

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.699 
over 9,000 almost 10,000 tensile
strength<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.430> also<00:02:37.150> picked<00:02:37.510> up<00:02:37.689> the<00:02:37.900> lowering

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
strength I also picked up the lowering

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.849 
strength I also picked up the lowering
links<00:02:39.099> to<00:02:39.519> actually<00:02:40.260> drop<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.439> bike<00:02:41.620> down

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
links to actually drop the bike down

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.599 
links to actually drop the bike down
here<00:02:42.310> let<00:02:42.489> me<00:02:42.549> turn<00:02:42.760> onto<00:02:42.969> the<00:02:43.180> other<00:02:43.329> side

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
here let me turn onto the other side

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.179 
here let me turn onto the other side
basically<00:02:45.609> drop<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.180> bike<00:02:46.359> down<00:02:46.950> even<00:02:47.950> more

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 
basically drop the bike down even more

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.420 
basically drop the bike down even more
because<00:02:48.459> when<00:02:48.819> I<00:02:48.849> was<00:02:49.030> sit<00:02:49.269> on<00:02:49.450> it

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
because when I was sit on it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.429 
because when I was sit on it
my<00:02:51.430> feet<00:02:51.639> are<00:02:51.760> planted<00:02:51.969> but<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.780> have<00:02:53.049> problems

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
my feet are planted but I have problems

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.729 
my feet are planted but I have problems
trying<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.709> back<00:02:53.949> up<00:02:54.719> I<00:02:55.719> actually<00:02:56.290> got<00:02:56.590> this

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
trying to back up I actually got this

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.539 
trying to back up I actually got this
out<00:02:56.919> of<00:02:56.949> Perry<00:02:57.250> Georgia<00:02:57.549> and<00:02:57.969> I<00:02:58.780> got<00:02:59.109> it<00:02:59.230> for

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
out of Perry Georgia and I got it for

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.080 
out of Perry Georgia and I got it for
$2,000<00:03:00.549> which<00:03:01.329> isn't<00:03:01.719> really<00:03:01.900> bad<00:03:03.090> the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
$2,000 which isn't really bad the

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.000 
$2,000 which isn't really bad the
previous<00:03:04.599> owner<00:03:04.840> had<00:03:05.079> cut<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.409> exhaust<00:03:05.680> off

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
previous owner had cut the exhaust off

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.459 
previous owner had cut the exhaust off
of<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.489> and<00:03:06.639> you<00:03:06.699> can<00:03:07.659> tell<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:07.840> he<00:03:08.109> cut<00:03:08.349> the

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:08.469 
of it and you can tell that he cut the

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:09.689 
of it and you can tell that he cut the
exhaust<00:03:08.769> on<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.159> and<00:03:09.250> that's<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.459> way<00:03:09.579> he

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:09.699 
exhaust on it and that's the way he

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.240 
exhaust on it and that's the way he
wanted<00:03:10.000> because<00:03:10.629> the<00:03:11.079> exhaust<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.769> existing

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
wanted because the exhaust the existing

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.009 
wanted because the exhaust the existing
exhaust<00:03:12.669> was<00:03:13.150> cut<00:03:13.480> at<00:03:14.169> a<00:03:14.230> perfect<00:03:14.680> 45<00:03:15.449> so<00:03:16.449> the

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
exhaust was cut at a perfect 45 so the

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.619 
exhaust was cut at a perfect 45 so the
kid<00:03:17.230> who<00:03:17.409> had<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:17.859> before<00:03:18.430> me<00:03:18.699> Saturday<00:03:19.479> I<00:03:19.509> went

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
kid who had it before me Saturday I went

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.999 
kid who had it before me Saturday I went
to<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.810> junkyard<00:03:20.019> found<00:03:20.949> a<00:03:21.989> another<00:03:23.009> muffler

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:24.009 
to a junkyard found a another muffler

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:26.399 
to a junkyard found a another muffler
with<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.519> exhaust<00:03:24.849> pipe<00:03:25.120> piece<00:03:25.419> on<00:03:25.629> there<00:03:25.900> I'm

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
with the exhaust pipe piece on there I'm

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.170 
with the exhaust pipe piece on there I'm
probably<00:03:26.829> going<00:03:27.189> to<00:03:27.250> change<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.609> lot<00:03:27.729> of<00:03:27.909> out

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
probably going to change a lot of out

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.849 
probably going to change a lot of out
I'm<00:03:28.419> a<00:03:28.569> welder<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:28.870> fabricator<00:03:29.379> by<00:03:29.560> trade<00:03:29.829> so

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
I'm a welder and fabricator by trade so

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.640 
I'm a welder and fabricator by trade so
I<00:03:30.310> can<00:03:30.579> sit<00:03:30.819> there<00:03:30.909> and<00:03:30.970> take<00:03:31.150> care<00:03:31.329> of<00:03:31.449> that

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
I can sit there and take care of that

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.429 
I can sit there and take care of that
this<00:03:32.650> bikes<00:03:32.889> got<00:03:36.870> 22,000<00:03:37.870> miles<00:03:38.019> on<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.319> and

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 
this bikes got 22,000 miles on it and

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:39.839 
this bikes got 22,000 miles on it and
you<00:03:38.769> can't<00:03:38.979> really<00:03:39.129> see<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.400> because<00:03:39.579> the

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
you can't really see it because the

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.129 
you can't really see it because the
sun's<00:03:40.150> hitting<00:03:40.359> it<00:03:40.509> there<00:03:40.659> you<00:03:40.780> go

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
sun's hitting it there you go

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.809 
sun's hitting it there you go
well<00:03:41.949> over<00:03:42.129> 22,000<00:03:42.909> miles<00:03:43.060> I've<00:03:43.449> put<00:03:44.819> 111

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
well over 22,000 miles I've put 111

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.270 
well over 22,000 miles I've put 111
miles<00:03:46.000> on<00:03:46.299> it<00:03:46.329> so<00:03:46.840> that's<00:03:47.650> pretty<00:03:47.889> much<00:03:47.979> how<00:03:48.129> I

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
miles on it so that's pretty much how I

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.509 
miles on it so that's pretty much how I
change<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.180> chain<00:03:49.930> on<00:03:50.139> this<00:03:50.259> bike<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:51.280> was

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
change the chain on this bike it was

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.249 
change the chain on this bike it was
pretty<00:03:51.759> simple<00:03:52.060> kind<00:03:52.629> of<00:03:52.689> aggravating<00:03:53.199> a

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:53.259 
pretty simple kind of aggravating a

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:57.270 
pretty simple kind of aggravating a
little<00:03:53.500> bit<00:03:53.650> but<00:03:53.949> not<00:03:54.280> too<00:03:54.459> bad<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:56.069> and<00:03:57.069> that's

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
little bit but not too bad so and that's

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.640 
little bit but not too bad so and that's
it<00:03:57.489> when<00:03:58.329> I<00:03:58.359> do<00:03:58.479> the<00:03:58.689> lowering<00:03:58.959> links<00:03:59.290> I'll<00:03:59.469> sit

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
it when I do the lowering links I'll sit

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.490 
it when I do the lowering links I'll sit
there<00:03:59.739> and<00:03:59.829> I'll<00:03:59.949> post<00:04:00.129> a<00:04:00.250> video<00:04:00.370> on<00:04:00.729> it<00:04:00.969> and

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
there and I'll post a video on it and
