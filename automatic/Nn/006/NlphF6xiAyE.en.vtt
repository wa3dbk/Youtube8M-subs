wool<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.500> it's<00:03:59.500> by<00:03:59.710> NYX<00:04:00.010> nitpicks<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.240> what<00:04:01.330> I

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
wool and it's by NYX nitpicks and what I

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.030 
wool and it's by NYX nitpicks and what I
did<00:04:01.600> was<00:04:01.630> I<00:04:01.990> just<00:04:02.230> went<00:04:02.440> online<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:02.770> I<00:04:03.010> looked

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
did was I just went online and I looked

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.640 
did was I just went online and I looked
to<00:04:03.430> see<00:04:03.670> if<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:03.970> can<00:04:04.150> find<00:04:04.390> a<00:04:04.720> color<00:04:05.380> that

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
to see if I can find a color that

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.710 
to see if I can find a color that
closely<00:04:06.010> close<00:04:06.820> you<00:04:07.120> know<00:04:07.240> that<00:04:07.420> I<00:04:07.510> could

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
closely close you know that I could

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.470 
closely close you know that I could
maybe<00:04:08.010> match<00:04:09.010> up<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.520> it<00:04:09.700> because<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.150> what<00:04:10.450> I

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
maybe match up to it because the what I

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.100 
maybe match up to it because the what I
was<00:04:10.750> using<00:04:10.960> was<00:04:11.200> world<00:04:11.530> to<00:04:11.800> and<00:04:12.430> I<00:04:12.490> bought<00:04:12.700> for

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.729 

schemes<00:04:17.110> of<00:04:17.320> that<00:04:17.730> but<00:04:18.730> they<00:04:19.210> were<00:04:19.270> closed<00:04:19.739> you

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
schemes of that but they were closed you

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.340 
schemes of that but they were closed you
know<00:04:20.859> but<00:04:21.790> they<00:04:21.970> weren't<00:04:22.180> exact<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:22.960> can

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
know but they weren't exact so I can

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.870 
know but they weren't exact so I can
make<00:04:23.530> something<00:04:23.830> out<00:04:24.130> of<00:04:24.160> this<00:04:24.460> it<00:04:24.700> doesn't

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
make something out of this it doesn't

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.210
