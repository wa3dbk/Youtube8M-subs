sit next to someone who's transphobic
for<00:02:31.140> six<00:02:31.350> hours<00:02:31.470> because<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.250> could<00:02:32.430> be

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
for six hours because that could be

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.810 
for six hours because that could be
really<00:02:32.910> awkward<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.470> it's<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.370> gotta<00:02:35.670> be

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
really awkward so it's you gotta be

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.320 
really awkward so it's you gotta be
careful<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:38.130> gets<00:02:38.280> easier<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:39.120> come

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
careful of that it gets easier to come

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.090 
careful of that it gets easier to come
out<00:02:39.480> over<00:02:39.750> time<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.440> more<00:02:40.590> times<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.920> do<00:02:41.070> it

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
out over time the more times you do it

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.580 
out over time the more times you do it
the<00:02:41.310> easier<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.670> gets<00:02:41.930> definitely<00:02:42.930> because

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
the easier it gets definitely because

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.380 
the easier it gets definitely because
you<00:02:43.770> get<00:02:44.070> practice<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.730> know<00:02:44.850> what<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.120> say

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390

the<00:02:54.450> person<00:02:54.980> that<00:02:56.180> doesn't<00:02:57.180> know<00:02:57.300> anything

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
the person that doesn't know anything

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.390 
the person that doesn't know anything
about<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.810> understand<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.800> little<00:02:59.070> bit<00:02:59.190> better

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
about it understand a little bit better

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.070 
about it understand a little bit better
so<00:02:59.670> then<00:02:59.820> when<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.180> next<00:03:00.330> person<00:03:00.510> comes<00:03:00.930> out

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
so then when the next person comes out

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.280 
so then when the next person comes out
then<00:03:01.350> it'll<00:03:02.160> be<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.280> little<00:03:02.520> bit<00:03:02.640> easier<00:03:03.090> but<00:03:04.080> so

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
then it'll be a little bit easier but so

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.170 
then it'll be a little bit easier but so
one<00:03:04.650> other<00:03:04.890> experience<00:03:05.520> coming<00:03:06.000> out

then they came out so we like both came
out<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.050> then<00:03:34.170> like<00:03:34.800> five<00:03:35.010> minutes<00:03:35.220> later<00:03:35.519> we

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
out and then like five minutes later we

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.550 
out and then like five minutes later we
like<00:03:36.060> both<00:03:36.330> discovered<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:37.050> we<00:03:37.170> both<00:03:37.320> went

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
like both discovered that we both went

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.040 
like both discovered that we both went
to<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.739> same<00:03:38.060> surgeon<00:03:39.060> for<00:03:39.300> top<00:03:39.480> surgeries

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
to the same surgeon for top surgeries

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.930 
to the same surgeon for top surgeries
we're<00:03:40.290> comparing<00:03:40.800> scars<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.459> everything<00:03:41.790> and

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
we're comparing scars and everything and

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.699 
we're comparing scars and everything and
our<00:03:42.180> surgeries<00:03:42.540> were<00:03:42.690> like<00:03:42.840> six<00:03:43.140> years<00:03:43.200> apart

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
our surgeries were like six years apart

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.240 
our surgeries were like six years apart
so<00:03:44.519> it<00:03:44.880> was<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.090> cool<00:03:45.650> comparison<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.830> see<00:03:47.160> the

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
so it was a cool comparison to see the

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.560 
so it was a cool comparison to see the
differences<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.790> everything<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.420> was

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
differences and everything so that was

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.660 
differences and everything so that was
cool<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.959> think<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.380> best<00:03:49.620> way<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.860> come<00:03:50.160> out<00:03:50.370> is

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
cool I think the best way to come out is

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.330 
cool I think the best way to come out is
to<00:03:50.880> do<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.269> face-to-face<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:52.470> if<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.100> can't

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
to do it face-to-face and if you can't

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.190 
to do it face-to-face and if you can't
do<00:03:53.550> it<00:03:53.580> face-to-face<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.570> might<00:03:54.810> be<00:03:54.959> nice<00:03:55.140> to

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
do it face-to-face it might be nice to

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.680 
do it face-to-face it might be nice to
make<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:55.950> letter<00:03:56.790> or<00:03:57.120> maybe<00:03:57.330> you<00:03:57.450> could<00:03:57.570> even

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
make a letter or maybe you could even

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.780 
make a letter or maybe you could even
record<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.350> video<00:03:58.680> for<00:03:59.250> your<00:03:59.340> parents<00:03:59.519> your

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
record a video for your parents your

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.280 
record a video for your parents your
friends<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.239> watch<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.690> think<00:04:00.930> that's<00:04:01.050> a<00:04:01.140> good

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
friends to watch I think that's a good

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.479 
friends to watch I think that's a good
way<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.650> think<00:04:01.680> face<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.340> face<00:04:02.519> is<00:04:02.700> good<00:04:02.940> because

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
way I think face to face is good because

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.370 
way I think face to face is good because
then<00:04:05.489> your<00:04:05.820> friends<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:06.660> family<00:04:06.959> could<00:04:07.140> see

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
then your friends and family could see

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.310 
then your friends and family could see
your<00:04:07.560> emotions<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.580> they<00:04:09.120> could<00:04:09.330> understand

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
your emotions and they could understand

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.900 
your emotions and they could understand
a<00:04:10.590> little<00:04:10.830> bit<00:04:10.980> better<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.460> understand<00:04:11.850> that

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
a little bit better and understand that

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.940 
a little bit better and understand that
it's<00:04:12.060> real<00:04:12.330> and<00:04:12.569> it's<00:04:12.630> not<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:12.900> phase<00:04:13.230> I<00:04:13.590> mean<00:04:13.860> I

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
it's real and it's not a phase I mean I

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.190 
it's real and it's not a phase I mean I
feel<00:04:14.100> like<00:04:14.160> I<00:04:14.430> came<00:04:14.700> out<00:04:14.850> in

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
feel like I came out in

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.530 
feel like I came out in
in<00:04:16.290> unconventional<00:04:17.040> way<00:04:17.670> if<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.060> just<00:04:18.240> going<00:04:18.450> on

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
in unconventional way if I just going on

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.000 
in unconventional way if I just going on
TV<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.110> like<00:04:19.230> telling<00:04:19.530> my<00:04:19.650> extended<00:04:19.950> family

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
TV and like telling my extended family

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.800 
TV and like telling my extended family
to<00:04:20.340> watch<00:04:20.550> and<00:04:20.850> they<00:04:20.940> watched<00:04:21.300> and<00:04:21.720> they're

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
to watch and they watched and they're

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.220 
to watch and they watched and they're
like<00:04:21.990> okay<00:04:22.500> well<00:04:23.040> that's<00:04:23.130> weird<00:04:23.370> um<00:04:23.960> so<00:04:24.960> it

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
like okay well that's weird um so it

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.330 
like okay well that's weird um so it
might<00:04:25.380> have<00:04:25.500> been<00:04:25.560> easier<00:04:25.860> if<00:04:25.890> I<00:04:26.010> just<00:04:26.040> came

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
might have been easier if I just came

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.450 
might have been easier if I just came
out<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.520> them<00:04:26.760> in<00:04:27.000> person<00:04:28.040> then<00:04:29.040> again<00:04:29.190> it

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
out to them in person then again it

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.280 
out to them in person then again it
would<00:04:29.580> be<00:04:29.610> hard<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:29.970> sit<00:04:30.210> every<00:04:30.570> single<00:04:30.870> person

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
would be hard to sit every single person

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.460 
would be hard to sit every single person
down<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.250> come<00:04:32.520> out<00:04:32.640> to<00:04:32.790> them<00:04:32.940> individually

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
down and come out to them individually

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.470 
down and come out to them individually
so<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:34.890> could<00:04:35.100> be<00:04:35.250> good<00:04:35.640> to<00:04:35.820> do<00:04:35.940> like<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.120> family

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
so it could be good to do like a family

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.570 
so it could be good to do like a family
dinner<00:04:36.660> or<00:04:36.840> something<00:04:37.020> like<00:04:37.260> that<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.710> it's

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
dinner or something like that and it's

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.920 
dinner or something like that and it's
always<00:04:38.730> best<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.120> just<00:04:39.270> be<00:04:39.450> honest<00:04:39.780> be

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
always best to just be honest be

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.900 
always best to just be honest be
completely<00:04:40.500> one<00:04:40.770> hundred<00:04:40.920> percent<00:04:41.160> honest

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
completely one hundred percent honest
