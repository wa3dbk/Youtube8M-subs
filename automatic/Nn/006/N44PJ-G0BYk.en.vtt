I'm<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.480> little<00:03:18.840> concerned<00:03:19.020> that<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.220> a

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
I'm a little concerned that this is a

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.940 
I'm a little concerned that this is a
poor<00:03:20.700> title<00:03:21.090> for<00:03:21.420> competitive<00:03:22.080> play<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.590> think

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
poor title for competitive play I think

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.220 
poor title for competitive play I think
it's<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.280> great<00:03:23.370> game<00:03:23.640> I<00:03:23.820> enjoy<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.090> lot<00:03:24.270> however

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
it's a great game I enjoy a lot however

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.520 
it's a great game I enjoy a lot however
they<00:03:25.650> made<00:03:25.830> it<00:03:25.950> very<00:03:26.160> realistic<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:27.260> in<00:03:28.260> this

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
they made it very realistic and in this

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.350 
they made it very realistic and in this
case<00:03:28.800> it's<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.190> negative<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.850> gameplay<00:03:30.090> is

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
case it's a negative the gameplay is

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.750 
case it's a negative the gameplay is
extremely<00:03:31.170> slow<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.740> it's<00:03:32.220> only<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.460> negative

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
extremely slow and it's only a negative

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.480 
extremely slow and it's only a negative
for<00:03:32.880> competitive<00:03:33.270> let<00:03:33.420> me<00:03:33.600> clarify<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.490> but

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
for competitive let me clarify that but

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.370 
for competitive let me clarify that but
the<00:03:35.700> gameplay<00:03:35.910> is<00:03:36.150> really<00:03:36.210> slow<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.960> there's

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
the gameplay is really slow and there's

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.720 
the gameplay is really slow and there's
a<00:03:37.410> lot<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.530> kind<00:03:37.770> of<00:03:37.830> random<00:03:38.220> factors<00:03:38.580> which

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
a lot of kind of random factors which

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.070 
a lot of kind of random factors which
happen<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.030> her<00:03:39.180> life<00:03:39.360> whether<00:03:39.570> it's<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.900> bad

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
happen to her life whether it's a bad

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.090 
first touch a deflection your keeper
makes<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.810> mistake<00:03:42.930> these<00:03:43.290> things<00:03:43.530> happen<00:03:43.830> but

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100
