00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 well it's the world these faces gb and 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.210
 bah listens and we find ourselves for a 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.290
 little tutorial for how to get on 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.660
 the terminal plane on mw2 but that 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.130
 also works on 22 v3 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.490
 so we'll start so we have to get 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.939
 put here a little towards the door of 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.220
 the plane 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.050
 so you see the white there it takes 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.009
 what's left of it, you have to see it 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.770
 when you go to jump and there you are 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.170
 above finally it's really very simple 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.360
 from here on then here it starts 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.540
 with a little bit harder your cursor 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.329
 from the bottom up actually the dirty activates which 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.520
 allows you to shoot in the judgment and well you 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.000
 go the slider of the ball small strokes of the 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.620
 down he must not look at the wine and not 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.129
 not look at the busy of the plane which 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.489
 is white and he must look rather at the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.390
 carpet and should be as much as possible towards 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.290
 the toboggan so that's after you have 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.240
 so jumped we go back and in 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.150
 same time to the left to go 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.689
 to make the door to then go up on 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.490
 the door 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.170
 so I succeeded then you go 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.600
 understand a little bit of momentum for 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.830
 then jump to the plane or take a 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.590
 little bit of momentum going up b port so he 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.600
 must not try to fall and then 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.369
 you go to sport finally me I 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.470
 look at the sky to climb a little more 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.320
 easily but you will sprint 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.670
 jump at the same time so here I am 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.850
 I miss you take a little momentum 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.259
 and in heaven so here I am on 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.979
 the plane so that's so it's quite done 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.410
 so if you want to stay where I so 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.690
 here 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.460
 and then for the trickster those who 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.070
 really want to take authors 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.750
 dazzling and well they can go 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.730
 yonder 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.890
 so you just have to sprint to the 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:15.330
 reactor is then jumped to here and 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:23.030
 then jumped to there so I'm going 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:23.030
 try no 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:32.790
 good by cons I'm not very good at 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:36.150
 get on the reactors I get there 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.330
 a few times I got there all to 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.330
 time 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.220
 at worst I will cut the moment I 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.810
 will cut the moment a little bit boring 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.810
 of the video ie here 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:14.530
 yeah I really did not have so let's go 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.190
 so squarely on 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.260
 you will understand to go up there 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.160
 but so you really have to leave 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.770
 to the reactor 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.310
 then have to jump like that and watch 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:31.630
 to there but hey we'll try again 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.140
 will keep the white or jump take ah 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.239
 yes to the fact it works with the sniper 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.470
 your sniper slider with but that's it 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.020
 market 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.550
 the will on the door it does not work 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.010
 than with the sniper slider because it 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.080
 is bigger then the slider ben 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.630
 I was driving kimbo because we are 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.140
 lighter with to ride you 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:59.830
 sprint and you jump so hear 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:06.360
 then there we come here I arrive 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:09.790
 still not at 6 so here it is good 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.560
 and so that's it so you see you have 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.260
 an overview of the map you can 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.810
 see and scale and come here to see 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.919
 there you have all the outside for 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.680
 watch you have here the hallway of the 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.770
 middle and so that's after you can 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.160
 make small trick shots 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:33.250
 So that's so it was a little 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.650
 tutorial for how to get on the plane and 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.419
 so here we are at the 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.570
 next for a new video at ciao 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.570
 bye
