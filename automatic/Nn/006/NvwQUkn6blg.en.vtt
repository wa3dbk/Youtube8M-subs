what<00:00:06.600> we've<00:00:06.750> got<00:00:06.780> here<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.260> white<00:00:07.500> pine<00:00:07.800> tree

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
what we've got here is a white pine tree

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.459 
what we've got here is a white pine tree
pretty<00:00:09.330> unique<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.020> easy<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.350> identify

pretty unique and easy to identify

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.650 
pretty unique and easy to identify
because<00:00:11.010> we<00:00:11.370> have<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.870> world<00:00:12.870> WH<00:00:13.860> o<00:00:14.039> RL<00:00:14.730> limbs

to their lowest denominator you'll find

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.040 
to their lowest denominator you'll find

vitamins A and C or importance
particularly<00:00:43.290> C<00:00:43.740> because<00:00:44.190> when<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.700> urinate

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
particularly C because when we urinate

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.730 
particularly C because when we urinate
us<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.300> water<00:00:45.510> soluble<00:00:45.780> vitamin<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.530> need

us a water soluble vitamin we need

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.610 
us a water soluble vitamin we need
constant<00:00:47.490> intake<00:00:47.970> of<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.320> but<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> real

constant intake of that but the real

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.230 
constant intake of that but the real
treasure<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:50.220> this<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.670> even<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.150> the

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.240 
treasure with this is even in the

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.240 
treasure with this is even in the
wintertime<00:00:51.510> when<00:00:52.320> everything<00:00:52.680> else<00:00:52.830> is<00:00:52.980> dried

wintertime when everything else is dried

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.450 
wintertime when everything else is dried
up<00:00:53.490> a<00:00:53.700> child<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.420> identify<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.990> and<00:00:55.380> so<00:00:56.340> we

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
up a child can identify this and so we

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.660 
up a child can identify this and so we
have<00:00:56.610> our<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.880> and<00:00:57.060> C<00:00:57.380> out<00:00:58.380> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.650> needles<00:00:59.010> but

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
have our a and C out of the needles but

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.450 
have our a and C out of the needles but
there's<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.940> real<00:01:00.120> treasure<00:01:00.420> trove<00:01:00.810> of

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
there's a real treasure trove of

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.140 
there's a real treasure trove of
vitamins<00:01:02.720> inside<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:03.990> inner<00:01:04.140> bark<00:01:05.000> so<00:01:06.000> what

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
vitamins inside the inner bark so what

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.740 
vitamins inside the inner bark so what
we<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.570> we'll<00:01:06.750> score<00:01:07.110> an<00:01:07.259> area<00:01:08.630> whatever<00:01:09.630> it

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
we do is we'll score an area whatever it

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.420 
we do is we'll score an area whatever it
is<00:01:09.870> that<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.260> wish<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.740> take<00:01:10.770> I'm<00:01:11.160> going<00:01:11.370> to

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
is that we wish to take I'm going to

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.810 
is that we wish to take I'm going to
take<00:01:12.420> something<00:01:13.070> resembling<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.400> strip<00:01:14.670> of

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
take something resembling a strip of

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.430 
take something resembling a strip of
bacon<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:16.160> just<00:01:17.160> that<00:01:17.340> area<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.720> then<00:01:19.140> using

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
bacon here just that area and then using

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.070 
bacon here just that area and then using
our<00:01:19.590> thumb<00:01:20.120> and<00:01:21.120> a<00:01:21.180> little<00:01:21.480> pressure<00:01:21.750> we're

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
our thumb and a little pressure we're

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.590 
our thumb and a little pressure we're
gonna<00:01:22.200> take<00:01:22.980> away<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.520> rough<00:01:23.820> outer<00:01:24.150> bark<00:01:26.600> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
gonna take away the rough outer bark and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.950 
gonna take away the rough outer bark and
it<00:01:27.810> should<00:01:27.990> reveal<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.560> white<00:01:29.690> inner<00:01:30.690> bark

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
it should reveal a white inner bark

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.200 
it should reveal a white inner bark
hence<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.770> name<00:01:31.920> white<00:01:32.190> pine<00:01:34.940> so<00:01:35.940> we're<00:01:36.180> just

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
hence the name white pine so we're just

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.110 
hence the name white pine so we're just
slowly<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.729> steadily<00:01:38.729> work<00:01:39.600> away<00:01:39.900> at<00:01:40.050> that

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
slowly and steadily work away at that

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.250 
slowly and steadily work away at that
that's<00:01:42.120> what<00:01:42.300> we're<00:01:42.420> looking<00:01:42.659> for<00:01:42.900> if<00:01:43.080> it's

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
that's what we're looking for if it's

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.060 
that's what we're looking for if it's
green<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.830> need<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.159> take<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.370> little<00:01:44.610> more<00:01:44.820> off

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
green you need to take a little more off

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.260 
green you need to take a little more off
because<00:01:47.070> you're<00:01:47.220> not<00:01:47.340> quite<00:01:47.610> there<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.150> then

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
because you're not quite there and then

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.910 
because you're not quite there and then
underneath<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.229> actually<00:01:49.530> starts<00:01:49.830> to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
underneath this it actually starts to

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.980 
underneath this it actually starts to
look<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.130> wood<00:01:50.580> again<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.210> that's<00:01:51.840> not

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
look like wood again and that's not

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.850 
look like wood again and that's not
desirable<00:01:52.530> or<00:01:52.920> palatable<00:01:54.290> this<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.500> be<00:01:55.620> done

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
desirable or palatable this can be done

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.560 
desirable or palatable this can be done
in<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.490> dead<00:01:56.760> middle<00:01:56.940> of<00:01:57.150> winter<00:01:57.330> when

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
in the dead middle of winter when

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.060 
in the dead middle of winter when
everything<00:01:58.080> else<00:01:58.229> has<00:01:58.380> dried<00:01:58.650> up<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.979> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
everything else has dried up and a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.920 
everything else has dried up and a
person<00:01:59.430> doesn't<00:01:59.640> know<00:01:59.880> much<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.840> they're

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
person doesn't know much and they're

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.330 
person doesn't know much and they're
lost<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.440> woods<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.860> they<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.100> need

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
lost in the woods and they just need

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.149 
lost in the woods and they just need
some<00:02:02.659> caloric<00:02:03.659> intake<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.320> keep<00:02:04.530> their<00:02:04.770> body

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
some caloric intake to keep their body

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.670 
some caloric intake to keep their body
and<00:02:05.400> brain<00:02:05.640> functioning<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> great

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and brain functioning this is a great

the tree all the way around that would
kill<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.269> tree<00:02:12.540> it's<00:02:13.409> my<00:02:13.650> understanding<00:02:13.739> to

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
kill this tree it's my understanding to

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.429 
kill this tree it's my understanding to
say<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.969> segment's<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.510> between<00:02:15.900> represent

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
say the segment's in between represent

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.130 
say the segment's in between represent
roughly<00:02:16.739> five<00:02:16.980> years<00:02:17.249> of<00:02:17.400> growth

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
roughly five years of growth

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.730 
roughly five years of growth
so<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.820> if<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.060> look<00:02:20.240> here<00:02:20.540> these<00:02:21.230> are<00:02:21.410> areas

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
so and if you look here these are areas

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.180 
so and if you look here these are areas
where<00:02:21.890> I've<00:02:22.070> harvested<00:02:22.340> before<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:24.230> they're

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
where I've harvested before and they're

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.640 
where I've harvested before and they're
healing<00:02:25.430> because<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.270> know<00:02:26.330> how<00:02:26.600> to<00:02:26.660> do<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.050> in

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
healing because I know how to do it in

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.160 
healing because I know how to do it in
this<00:02:28.160> fashion<00:02:28.460> so<00:02:29.360> be<00:02:29.510> sure<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.960> just

this fashion so be sure that you just
take<00:02:30.350> that<00:02:30.530> budget<00:02:30.710> now<00:02:31.840> if<00:02:32.840> I've<00:02:32.990> done<00:02:33.140> my

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
take that budget now if I've done my

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.010 
take that budget now if I've done my
work<00:02:33.320> right<00:02:33.970> I'll<00:02:34.970> get<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.210> started<00:02:35.540> on<00:02:35.840> one

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
work right I'll get it started on one

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.190 
work right I'll get it started on one
side<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.270> should<00:02:38.300> just<00:02:38.600> peel<00:02:38.960> right<00:02:38.990> off

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
side and it should just peel right off

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.220 
side and it should just peel right off
of<00:02:39.380> there<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:41.180> see<00:02:41.450> beneath<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.960> it

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.390 
of there and you see beneath that it
starts<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.590> look<00:02:42.740> like<00:02:42.800> wood<00:02:43.190> again<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:46.220> this
