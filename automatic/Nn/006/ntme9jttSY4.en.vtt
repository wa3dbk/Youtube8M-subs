00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.449
 hi girls I hope you go 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.920
 well I find you today for 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.720
 a fashion tips video and today 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.550
 we will talk about the total look jean 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.620
 many of you have asked 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.269
 questions about how to make a total 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.190
 jeans look without making fashion faux pas 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.070
 it's pretty complicated we know 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.390
 never if we can mix different 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.250
 colors of jeans where it is absolutely necessary 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.510
 stay in the same colors we do not know 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.490
 not if we can mix different 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.779
 materials and so that's it I will answer 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.240
 to all these questions giving you 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.769
 a single trick a very simple trick 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.050
 very fast to make you a total 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.610
 look without fear of doing too much 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.170
 knowing that jean matter is when 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.969
 even thick enough we are afraid that the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.800
 holding too heavy it makes too much 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.450
 imposing we will I hope this trick 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.879
 to be reconciled with the totally 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.100
 origins and I show you that very small 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.719
 so we knew it's very simple for 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.129
 to make a total look jean you just 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.230
 to take the jeans that you have 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.199
 the habit of wearing and associating with 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.910
 water of clothes that have the appearance of 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.350
 jeans but who are not so they 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.600
 are much more fluid materials 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.670
 much lighter and who will avoid 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.920
 to make you look too heavy 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.780
 so take these matters stayed in 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.729
 the same tones as your starting jeans 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.560
 so if your jeans are clear go 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.180
 rather in clear matters I'm going 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.860
 show you all that in action with my 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.960
 outfit 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.500
 so for this total login I started 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.409
 by the base the guess so I chose 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.390
 jeans from zara which costs 49 euros 90 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.680
 and who is right now in store so 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.570
 I had already worn in several 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.210
 saint jean videos that I like a lot 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.189
 because he's short and the jeans race 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.000
 is really the must have for the season 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.100
 spring summer 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.380
 you will see many often 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.509
 found faded took preference taste 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.829
 faded clear enough it's very pretty with 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.460
 a little fluid bone 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:47.080
 in short, I close it by 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:50.050
 so it's in starting jeans but very 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.729
 comfortable very pretty so what I 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.500
 hold of these jeans simply the 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.840
 your tone clear enough and now I'm going 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.250
 put a euro that stays in the same 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.619
 time that looks like him jeans but who 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.440
 is not to go with the tone 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.869
 jeans clear I took this high it's 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.330
 a robert chilin that costs 9 euros 90 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.670
 so you see it's really a 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.500
 material that can look like jeans 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.739
 any case a matter that remains in the 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.450
 same light tones as starting broggini 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.730
 so that's it's really coordinated and 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.650
 yet the material is very fluid and 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.230
 is really super convenient for the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.269
 spring it allows a little bit 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.489
 lightened the outfit to do less this look 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.380
 too big jeans and at the same time 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.739
 it really gives the visual aspect of 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.810
 sinn 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:37.030
 to add a more chic side to the 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:40.630
 I wear a blazer always the same 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.570
 so who really has this jean aspect and 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.400
 yet that was wrong so that's it 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.600
 once again you really got out 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.790
 we are always at the same time as 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.280
 pixie here you see the laser is 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.750
 really coordinated to the jeans one is 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.680
 really in the same tones and 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.689
 visually 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.489
 the impression that I have a total jean look 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.079
 while that is not the case at all 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.549
 the only thing that is in jeans and my 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:06.370
 soft pants is a Nazaz blazer 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.560
 zara that I paid 39 euros 90 but 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.640
 I bought in Barcelona so I think 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.349
 that it is a little bit more expensive I do not 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.909
 not sure if in stores in France 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.900
 in any case it should not delay so 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.700
 it may be a little bit more expensive 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.170
 right here 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.430
 but here it is really the blazer very 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.109
 very pretty I think it's really 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.400
 a must have of the season it's really going 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.889
 with everything with a little white pants 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.510
 with jeans or do it wanted to do 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.700
 a total jean look it's really 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.310
 the ideal and I find really very very 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.709
 chic can give a chic side to the 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.569
 held in total object it allows to give 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.519
 also a much lighter side to the 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.689
 held with much more materials 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.280
 fluid and much more classy 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.049
 this is at the level of the accessories of 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.599
 just a little golden cuff 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.669
 who comes from primark rings 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:49.329
 also from primark at 4 euros me 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:51.969
 seems to be just to break 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.260
 a little bit the light blue tale side 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.730
 and remind a little bit of walleye 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.239
 accessories I simply added a 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.379
 small navy blue belt 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.090
 this is a reminder 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.790
 shoes these are boots the 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.590
 strada that I bought in an athlete to 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.669
 29 euros 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.709
 I really like the color they are 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:11.040
 very comfortable and you have this 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.989
 golden zipper 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.359
 or who again a good reminder 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.109
 belt and gilded accessories that 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:20.820
 jenny with the games accessories everything 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.830
 just this little primark pouch 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.880
 which will remain in the same tones as my 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.880
 shoes and my belt 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.510
