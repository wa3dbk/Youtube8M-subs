00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.570
 participated and that comes from as the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.610
 name says team black sheep that 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.520
 a group of pv flyers doing the missions 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.110

 can you take a look sometimes 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.140
 also really controversial things but 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.020
 one thing is for sure after all pretty cool 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.120
 fpv head and one of them is here 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.100
 this team black sheep discovery pro 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.100
 we now in my new series 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.899
 Assemble and fly around 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.870
 become 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.790
 this is possible thanks to the company fpv - multi 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.649
 comes the point that I come to this 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.270
 Thank you very much 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.759
 would like for the support for the 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.560
 support we already have with the 550 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.659
 series helped and have also here 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.700
 again willingly under the arms 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.610
 him all my very sincere thanks to 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.860
 you super thing the places as I said 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.990
 here for disposal and allow 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.580
 us that we are more accurate 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.830
 look at the team black sheep 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.750
 discovery pro today's first movie like 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.760
 always do an unboxing and I show 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.080
 what has sent me something here 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.979
 everything is in it and shows you 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.979
 bit the components 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.050
 So we open the package once so 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.300
 looks in here quite well indeed 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.420
 interesting ok then let's start 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.850
 with the unpacking the most obvious 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.220
 here certainly the nasa in the flight 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.350
 control aversion two to the betting 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.720
 Here is a very proven fly 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.300
 controller so certainly only good choice 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.350
 then we have team black sheep here 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.090
 Ballet Premium Copter Sca Let's do it 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:12.650
 Come here once 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:15.790
 cut well taped okay so so 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.730
 the whole thing looks like four esc es 30 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.320
 ampere collecting kay is on it looks 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.800
 very neat from everything 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:29.450
 So that's ours are our first 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:33.680
 very big box team stay discovery 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.860
 pro fpv gebel quadrocopter ok also the 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:42.640
 cut it all well taped here he 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:46.519
 probably so here is a lot of stuff in it 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.989
 I have to land that individually 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.540
 Let's have a look again 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.640
 separately what is all in here is me 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.459
 keep going and have something else 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:01.850
 then we have seven discovery pro here 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:06.220
 80 800 900 v engine four pieces all clear 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.220
 So the engines are also pure 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.709
 so they look like we are then more accurately 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.579
 We will get to know the box 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.510
 assemble 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:23.470
 but what else a fpv camera team black 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:26.170
 sheep 69 fpv camera open 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.680
 OK 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.610
 controller board here and here 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.040
 We then really fat with the camera 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.440
 a body behind on a pure fwv 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.599
 camera you can very happy things 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.270
 join also configure beautiful 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:47.709
 thing but as I said exactly then 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:49.660
 later we have something like that 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.480
 Well that's clear, of course we 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.769
 need the arms for the here are 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.930
 all in black this time 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.470
 four pieces in total 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:08.110
 then we still have propellers and indeed 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:12.580
 gray props 10 05 ok four piece what is 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:20.380
 still in it team black sheep greenhorn 25 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:21.750
 with 5.8 ghz a f tv station and two 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.110
 Share in here 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.630
 he kisstel and yes that is a kind 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.370
 Angle for that is if you see then 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.190
 if you build it all together and 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.979
 here are the rings in there too 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.979
 there we have to look what that is when 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.120
 that then assembled 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.190
 so now we look again purely in peace 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.070
 what was in the big box in there 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.200
 but once on and there we have as 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.979
 first here team stands ready that are 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:54.370
 So have holders for a battery then 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:56.979
 we here discovery per gimbel that you 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.250
 parts for the gimbel yes so damper 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:01.180
 rubbers in different colors yellow red 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.910
 Red Green 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.580
 what are they for when you see then 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.140
 we have here gimbel update that seems 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.680
 somewhere a special bracket after 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.930
 to be 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.680
 for the gamble then we have one 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.160
 small box is not on it 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.160
 what's in there 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:25.180
 well those are brushless motors for the 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:28.020
 gimbel so probably give everything 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.529
 wants to be what we have here too 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.169
 look 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:35.729
 which is something it times 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:42.479
 Cut the knife we look times 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:46.959
 Take a look at what's in there 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:51.479
 I see a lot of cables here video 

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:53.769
 output cable here yet 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:56.739
 mounts parts yes so it seems 

00:05:53.769 --> 00:06:00.519
 everything in the picture to be part of everything 

00:05:56.739 --> 00:06:03.789
 for the gimbel of it is still one 

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:05.589
 a bit of a girl so then we have 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:09.189
 screw two packages here 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:09.669
 then screw it down here 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:16.599
 underneath 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:18.879
 from a the are cable servo cables and 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:24.549
 then we will probably come here 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:29.199
 most important is the but two pieces 

00:06:24.549 --> 00:06:31.719
 are that I'll get out of this once 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:33.789
 the bottom of the sports is very very much 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:36.339
 easy and every amount of electronics that 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:40.839
 she's here for you , that's it 

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:43.899
 on top of it, transport lives okay and 

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:46.449
 then we have it in here then that is 

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:50.499
 top probably also here 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:52.779
 really something on it for the gimbel fwv 

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:55.839
 gamble is on it and every amount 

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:59.799
 We have connections here otherwise 

00:06:55.839 --> 00:07:02.319
 what was not there that was it okay yes so 

00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:04.269
 like you see a lot of work here 

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:05.799
 we have everything in store for us 

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:08.469
 is assembled but I think so 

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:09.879
 will also be a really nice fwv copter 

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:11.229
 when he is done 

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:13.779
 Finally, I want to completely 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:15.429
 short pv - multiple then really completely 

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:18.099
 very nice and nice of you that you 

00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:20.079
