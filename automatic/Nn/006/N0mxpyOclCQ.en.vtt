00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 welcome to another video friends today jay 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.549
 pokemon lice and good today 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.340
 I bring you another information video of 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.380
 pokemon not exactly blond pokemon 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.840
 meg and alpha sapphire but that of pokemon in 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.240
 general and as you know or for those who 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.550
 well do not you know today was brought to 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.439
 what would be the nintendo dire in the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.930
 which tried announced the next that 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.600
 they were going to release for next 2015 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.760
 consoles very interesting and inclusive 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.609
 revealed a really short trailer but 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.830
 however it is still a trailer 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.500
 friends of the pokemon that so to speak 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.780
 barely revealed in a completely 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.210
 official nintendo which I leave for 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.980
 which the notes I will comment on 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.469
 continuation first of all we'll talk 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.170
 about the new Pokémon game the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.840
 game if I 'm not mistaken it's called pokemon 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.390
 show is a game quite similar to what 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.670
 that it would be pokemon battle 36 and which I 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.530
 I played even after some videos here 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.690
 the channel is a game similar to the cnd and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.910
 kroes so to speak but nevertheless 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.100
 with a quite special theme for 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.510
 what would be pokemon and in this new 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.860
 game the pokemon battle trosel 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.590
 it really has some variations 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.560
 quite interesting because here 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.300
 is to arm a team to win 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.090
 levels in with each pokemon that you're 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.620
 using you can mega evolve to the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.750
 pokemon for example in bringing us 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.700
 shows a mega k in gascan and is 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.770
 quite interesting really is not the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.110
 great game of pokémon and much less 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.610
 we could even call it that would be 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.100
 the level of a spin-off call yourself a 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.360
 Pokemon reinier a mysterious world but 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.340
 however for a fun time 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.990
 this game can be pretty 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.360
 interesting so I'm going to give you a 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.970
 opportunity because the best of all is 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.010
 that the game is completely free 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.870
 It is not yet but once it leaves 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.850
 is going to be uploaded in the iv shop and I imagine 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.860
 that everyone's so that this 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.180
 game is completely free and all the 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.160
 can play it for those who do not 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.140
 they could buy the pokemon beats another 6 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.060
 that if I'm not mistaken it cost around 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.850
 of 12 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.549
 five euros or something like that if you do not 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.500
 I'm wrong this game on the contrary 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.140
 It's completely free and there are things 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.729
 well they are not completely new but 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.009
 the odd thing if it's new so 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.929
 the game being free and bringing new 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.870
 things can be quite interesting 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.940
 because it 's free is the best of all 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.769
 friends but good let's go to the next 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.330
 note here is that they revealed the new 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.280
 trailer or rather the first trailer 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.110
 that we have from hoop to a trailer 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.060
 Pretty short where they show us who 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.580
 for they tell us that it is a pokemon 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.830
 only ghost psychic type pokemon 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.819
 they show us hoop attacking a couple of 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.709
 pokemon and it would be absolutely everything 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.260
 that they can offer us in the trailer of 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.180
 this occupies not even talk a little 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.250
 of what would be his paintball which already 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.170
 we know but nevertheless 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.239
 it's still pretty good that at last 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.610
 internal begins to give clues or begins 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.340
 to give small things about this 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.380
 pokemon which is practically known 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.569
 nothing friends and finally and in what 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.150
 personal the most interesting note is that 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.970
 the date of departure was revealed what 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.110
 is going to be the new tree 10 friends this 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.060
 console that can be 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.220
 interesting was announced enough 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.860
 games still none specific of 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.870
 pokemon for the console but maybe to 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.700
 the best the next game the next 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.470
 generation inclusive the seventh 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.690
 generation friends leave directly 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.340
 for this console that really 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.090
 interesting if I'm not wrong I was 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.830
 around 200 euros or something 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.140
 the style 200 dollars I'm not quite 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.410
 sure for the moment I do not think about it 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.870
 buy until you see what is going to come out 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.180
 some game especially for pokemon or 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.280
 failing which the game has good 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.380
 that the console better said has 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.480
 capturing because they still have not 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.880
 put the captor in Japan that happens 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.040
 Japanese are taking a long time 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.890
 but well, it's also pretty 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.709
 interesting because this one is completely 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.420
 customizable as it comes in the form of 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.330
 monster hunter is greater is more 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.820
 we would also talk about several pokemon 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.340
 that has very interesting those of blond 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.989
 may and sapphire alpha and finally I think that 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.000
 If I'm not mistaken, the covers are 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.770
 completely customizable because it 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.569
 you can change them so that's how much 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.540
 less interesting 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.769
 and if there are exclusive pokemon games 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.049
 which is what interests me the most 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.690
 nintendo the safest thing is that if I do 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.759
 with the console waiting for soon 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.410
 we can know what they can put 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.850
 capturing but I think it would be 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.830
 all for the information video of the day 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.240
 today three pretty interesting notes 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.889
 I hope you liked it if you 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.139
 like do not forget to destroy that button 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.520
 I like to share this video thanks 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.500

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.500
