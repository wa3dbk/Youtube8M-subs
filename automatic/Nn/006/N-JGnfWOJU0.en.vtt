00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 say why today the investigative 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.680
 the group arrived again today 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.570
 Continues honestly and action on inspection 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.519
 the scene of the accident is expected to arrive 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.130
 representative interstate from 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.090
 of the committee itself so that with his 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.710
 participation to make further inspection 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.449
 the result of the inspection of the barrel spirit taken 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.449
 decision to introduce 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.240
 aircraft residues mean for 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.859
 more detailed research that is on 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.380
 the moment setting place 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.300
 the incident is not broken in order to mean 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.660
 mun most technical inspection 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.790
 debris 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.890
 to make it clear what was done before 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.570
 that is, what's the difference 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.850
 you will do what inspection what 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.710
 did before the inspection continues with 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.289
 increase in various specialists 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.000
 originally extracted remains mean 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.440
 found at the scene with 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.410
 involving forensic medics 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.379
 that is, carry made the binding 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.750
 aircraft residues relative to terrain 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.970
 and relative parts of each other then 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.100
 there was a diagram of the scene 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.200
 the initial data was set 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.360
 which is subsequently allowed picture 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.780
 happened to serve that is 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.250
 regarding 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.470
 now you will work more with 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.890
 by plane themselves are not hungry for him 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.340
 part say here is the detail I would like 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.020
 specify 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.980
 is it all on the surface or is it his 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.530
 part somewhere in the swamp partially 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.150
 that is, the visible visible part of it on 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.800
 surface partially visible he 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.020
 really drowned in a swamp 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.660
 that is, the soil is mated quite possibly that 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.520
 feeding action from the impact speed by 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.700
 the influence of weather conditions, he simply 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.120
 I could go out partly under the water below the ground but 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.180
 it's not me a little deep because 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.790
 Apparently here are many commentators writing to us 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.980
 that he doesn't understand why he doesn't seem to be 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.900
 holistically it seemed to have turned him 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.610
 there was some kind of explosion or what we 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.580
 Now we will not say that it is necessary 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.070
 examination 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.920
 I initially take the plane for examination 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.410
 we will spend these creatures because something 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.240
 I will say maybe explosives mean 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.520
 or fire technical dependence on 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.650
 results are looking at travel can 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.950
 be all together how much you still 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:24.200
 plan to stay with us for two or three days 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.730
 this week can not yet say 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.620
 introduce yourself what is your name completely and 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.270
 position first deputy 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.250
 head of the Ural investigative 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.990
 transport management 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.230
 lieutenant colonel of justice spiders thank you 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.230
