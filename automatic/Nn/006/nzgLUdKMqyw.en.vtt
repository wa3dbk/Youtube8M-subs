like the EMP because I think you need

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.960 
like the EMP because I think you need
too<00:02:56.379> much<00:02:56.560> bullets<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.220> kill<00:02:57.250> someone<00:02:57.610> and

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
too much bullets to kill someone and

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.449 
too much bullets to kill someone and
it's<00:02:58.150> not<00:02:58.390> that<00:02:58.599> accurate<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:02.040> they're<00:03:03.040> just

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
it's not that accurate and they're just

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.250 
it's not that accurate and they're just
like<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:03.940> empty<00:03:04.180> our<00:03:04.299> insights<00:03:04.690> on<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.900> camera
