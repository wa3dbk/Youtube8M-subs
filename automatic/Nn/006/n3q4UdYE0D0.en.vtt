and<00:00:03.419> then<00:00:03.570> we'll<00:00:03.689> get<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:03.929> firstnet

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
and then we'll get to the firstnet

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.390 
and then we'll get to the firstnet
hopefully<00:00:05.220> we'll<00:00:05.310> have<00:00:05.400> fishing<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:05.970> better

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:20.010 

this<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.580> fish<00:00:11.790> sandwich<00:00:13.940> fisheries

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.160 

pull<00:00:21.020> out<00:00:21.199> my<00:00:21.320> data<00:00:21.529> grab<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:21.860> net<00:00:22.010> then<00:00:22.250> we'll

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
pull out my data grab the net then we'll

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.749 
pull out my data grab the net then we'll
untie<00:00:24.170> it<00:00:24.230> since<00:00:24.650> we're<00:00:24.770> gonna<00:00:24.890> pull<00:00:25.550> it<00:00:25.640> in

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
untie it since we're gonna pull it in

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:32.100 
untie it since we're gonna pull it in
today

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.890 

this<00:00:32.740> is<00:00:32.920> a<00:00:32.950> 250-foot<00:00:33.700> net<00:00:34.030> it's<00:00:34.420> got<00:00:34.600> various

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
this is a 250-foot net it's got various

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.740 
this is a 250-foot net it's got various
sizes<00:00:35.410> different<00:00:35.890> inch<00:00:36.790> barb<00:00:37.150> mesh<00:00:37.330> we<00:00:37.510> start

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
sizes different inch barb mesh we start

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.020 
sizes different inch barb mesh we start
out<00:00:37.870> one<00:00:38.080> inch<00:00:38.260> and<00:00:38.440> then<00:00:38.500> it<00:00:38.650> goes<00:00:38.770> out<00:00:38.950> to<00:00:39.030> one

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
out one inch and then it goes out to one

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.520 
out one inch and then it goes out to one
and<00:00:40.150> a<00:00:40.180> half<00:00:40.330> to<00:00:40.630> two<00:00:40.870> and<00:00:40.900> a<00:00:40.990> half<00:00:41.110> and<00:00:41.290> three

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
and a half to two and a half and three

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.620 
and a half to two and a half and three
so<00:00:41.800> and<00:00:42.040> we<00:00:42.580> alternate<00:00:42.970> whether<00:00:43.240> we<00:00:43.360> put<00:00:43.510> the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
so and we alternate whether we put the

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.720 
so and we alternate whether we put the
small<00:00:43.900> small<00:00:44.500> mesh<00:00:44.680> toward<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:44.980> bank<00:00:45.130> or<00:00:45.580> the

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
small small mesh toward the bank or the

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.890 
small small mesh toward the bank or the
big<00:00:45.850> mesh<00:00:46.030> toward<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:46.330> bank<00:00:46.450> so<00:00:46.600> I<00:00:46.660> really

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
big mesh toward the bank so I really

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.090 
big mesh toward the bank so I really
were<00:00:46.990> wanting<00:00:47.200> to<00:00:47.260> get<00:00:47.350> kind<00:00:47.620> of<00:00:47.650> a<00:00:47.800> snapshot

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
were wanting to get kind of a snapshot

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.680 
were wanting to get kind of a snapshot
of<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.489> population<00:00:49.030> it's<00:00:49.210> interesting<00:00:49.420> to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
of the population it's interesting to

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.020 
of the population it's interesting to
see<00:00:49.870> how<00:00:50.050> your<00:00:50.230> nets<00:00:50.500> are<00:00:50.850> graduated<00:00:51.850> in<00:00:51.940> two

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
see how your nets are graduated in two

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.910 
see how your nets are graduated in two
different<00:00:52.360> sizes<00:00:52.630> to<00:00:52.989> catch<00:00:53.170> those<00:00:53.350> different

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
different sizes to catch those different

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.440 
different sizes to catch those different
size<00:00:54.040> fish<00:00:54.309> right<00:00:54.610> and<00:00:54.760> that's<00:00:54.879> that's<00:00:55.150> kind

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
size fish right and that's that's kind

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.729 
size fish right and that's that's kind
of<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.570> idea<00:00:55.629> we<00:00:56.020> have<00:00:56.050> these<00:00:56.500> are<00:00:56.590> called

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
of the idea we have these are called

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.200 
of the idea we have these are called
experimental<00:00:57.220> Nets<00:00:57.400> so<00:00:57.610> they<00:00:57.700> have<00:00:57.850> varying

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
experimental Nets so they have varying

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.510 
experimental Nets so they have varying
mesh<00:00:58.420> sizes<00:00:58.690> as<00:00:58.989> you<00:00:59.020> go<00:00:59.200> out<00:00:59.379> and<00:00:59.620> typically

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
mesh sizes as you go out and typically

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.400 
mesh sizes as you go out and typically
the<00:01:00.670> larger<00:01:00.970> mesh<00:01:01.120> sizes<00:01:01.330> catch<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.140> larger

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
the larger mesh sizes catch the larger

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.350 
the larger mesh sizes catch the larger
fish

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.060 

why<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.960> taking<00:01:10.320> these<00:01:10.410> fish<00:01:10.620> out<00:01:10.800> to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
why are you taking these fish out to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.500 
why are you taking these fish out to
take<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> look<00:01:11.520> at<00:01:11.640> them<00:01:11.760> today<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.120> value<00:01:12.420> of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
take a look at them today the value of

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.270 
take a look at them today the value of
this<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.440> this<00:01:13.590> every<00:01:13.860> year<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.190> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
this is and we do this every year in the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.260 
this is and we do this every year in the
fall<00:01:15.140> early<00:01:16.140> winter<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
fall early winter and it's just to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.930 
fall early winter and it's just to
survey<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.260> population<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.760> lot

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
survey the population and we get a lot

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.210 
survey the population and we get a lot
of<00:01:21.060> information<00:01:21.660> from<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.410> netting<00:01:25.070> we<00:01:26.070> also

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
of information from this netting we also

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.500 
of information from this netting we also
look<00:01:26.460> at<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> body<00:01:26.790> condition<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.330> them<00:01:27.450> to

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
look at the body condition of them to

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.290 
look at the body condition of them to
see<00:01:27.660> how<00:01:27.810> healthy<00:01:28.050> they<00:01:28.290> are<00:01:28.760> we<00:01:29.760> get<00:01:29.940> a<00:01:29.970> size

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
see how healthy they are we get a size

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.300 
see how healthy they are we get a size

the problems we've had in recent years

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.520 
the problems we've had in recent years
as<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> growth<00:01:36.119> has<00:01:36.300> slowed<00:01:36.600> down<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:37.200> the

been stressed in the late summer now

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.370 
been stressed in the late summer now
when<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.030> talk<00:01:45.149> about<00:01:45.210> stress<00:01:45.840> rate<00:01:46.110> and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
when you talk about stress rate and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.290 
when you talk about stress rate and
obviously<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.210> fluctuation<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.240> the

lake we couldn't help but it had to be
worked<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.310> didn't<00:01:50.550> do<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> fish<00:01:51.060> a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
worked on but it didn't do the fish a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.820 
worked on but it didn't do the fish a
whole<00:01:51.300> lot<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> good<00:01:51.780> stress<00:01:52.320> leads<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
whole lot of good stress leads to a

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.040 
whole lot of good stress leads to a
variety<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.190> problems<00:01:53.750> first<00:01:54.750> thing<00:01:54.930> we

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
variety of problems first thing we

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.389 
variety of problems first thing we
noticed<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> body<00:01:55.800> condition<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
noticed is the body condition of the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.400 
noticed is the body condition of the
fish<00:01:56.610> deteriorates<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:58.020> get<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> lot<00:01:58.320> of

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
fish deteriorates you get a lot of

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.260 
fish deteriorates you get a lot of
skinny<00:01:58.649> fish<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.280> then<00:01:59.940> they're<00:02:00.119> more

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
skinny fish and then they're more

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.580 
skinny fish and then they're more
susceptible<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.840> disease<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.229> more

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
susceptible to disease and more

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.100 
susceptible to disease and more
susceptible<00:02:01.830> to<00:02:02.039> parasites<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:04.020> know

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
susceptible to parasites and so you know

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.320 
susceptible to parasites and so you know
the<00:02:04.229> last<00:02:04.410> say<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.009> 2010<00:02:05.640> we<00:02:05.759> had<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.910> fish<00:02:06.119> kill

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
the last say in 2010 we had a fish kill

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330 
the last say in 2010 we had a fish kill
that<00:02:06.660> was<00:02:06.780> due<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.020> low<00:02:07.170> oxygen<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.920> cool

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
that was due to low oxygen and in cool

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.550 
that was due to low oxygen and in cool
water<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.570> the<00:02:09.840> habitat<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
water so the the habitat that the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.380 
water so the the habitat that the
stripers<00:02:10.950> life<00:02:11.130> kind<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.400> got<00:02:11.550> squeezed<00:02:11.940> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
stripers life kind of got squeezed and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.789 
stripers life kind of got squeezed and
so<00:02:12.959> they<00:02:13.049> either<00:02:13.110> had<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.440> get<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.680> lot

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
so they either had to get in a lot

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.289 
so they either had to get in a lot
warmer<00:02:14.130> water<00:02:14.310> than<00:02:14.549> they<00:02:14.640> would<00:02:14.760> like<00:02:14.790> or

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
warmer water than they would like or

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.699 
warmer water than they would like or
they<00:02:15.570> had<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.750> their<00:02:16.200> if<00:02:16.290> they<00:02:16.320> stayed<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.590> the

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
they had to their if they stayed in the

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.110 
they had to their if they stayed in the
cool<00:02:16.860> water<00:02:17.070> they<00:02:17.190> ran<00:02:17.340> out<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.489> oxygen<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.000> it

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
cool water they ran out of oxygen so it

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.509 
cool water they ran out of oxygen so it
was<00:02:18.209> kind<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.510> catch-22<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.769> under<00:02:20.370> those

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
was kind of a catch-22 and under those

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.250 
was kind of a catch-22 and under those
conditions<00:02:20.580> they<00:02:21.269> became<00:02:21.510> very<00:02:21.720> stressed<00:02:22.110> and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
conditions they became very stressed and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.229 
conditions they became very stressed and
some<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.560> them<00:02:22.680> died<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.760> now<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.000> think

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
some of them died and and now we think

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.910 
some of them died and and now we think
we're<00:02:24.450> over<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.720> hump<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.680> gonna<00:02:25.769> be

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
we're over that hump and it's gonna be

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.289 
we're over that hump and it's gonna be
better<00:02:26.040> but<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.430> like<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.730> check<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.120> growth

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
better but we like to check the growth

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.990 
better but we like to check the growth
rate<00:02:27.510> on<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.750> fish<00:02:27.959> each<00:02:28.590> year<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.400> see<00:02:29.580> if<00:02:29.610> we

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
rate on the fish each year to see if we

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000 
rate on the fish each year to see if we
need<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.209> change<00:02:30.450> anything<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:30.959> is<00:02:31.170> probably

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
need to change anything this is probably

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.830 
need to change anything this is probably
a<00:02:32.100> what<00:02:32.459> we<00:02:32.580> call<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> younger<00:02:33.150> year<00:02:33.299> fish<00:02:33.540> it's

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
a what we call a younger year fish it's

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.990 
a what we call a younger year fish it's
a<00:02:33.930> fish<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.260> was<00:02:34.320> stocked<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:35.280> spring<00:02:35.670> at

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
a fish that was stocked this spring at

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000 
a fish that was stocked this spring at
about<00:02:36.209> two<00:02:36.390> inches<00:02:36.600> long<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.140> it's<00:02:37.769> probably

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
about two inches long and it's probably

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.340 
about two inches long and it's probably
10<00:02:38.430> inches<00:02:38.730> now<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.209> they<00:02:39.329> really<00:02:39.870> grow<00:02:40.019> fast

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
10 inches now so they really grow fast

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.920 
10 inches now so they really grow fast
and<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.549> can<00:02:41.670> see<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.269> know<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.630> looks

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
and you can see it's you know it looks

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.080 
and you can see it's you know it looks
looks<00:02:43.290> really<00:02:43.500> good<00:02:43.620> it's<00:02:43.890> sleek<00:02:44.100> it's<00:02:44.280> pretty

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
looks really good it's sleek it's pretty

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.509 
looks really good it's sleek it's pretty
pretty<00:02:45.540> hefty<00:02:45.900> fish<00:02:46.110> for<00:02:46.290> its<00:02:46.410> size<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:47.370> this

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
pretty hefty fish for its size so this

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.229 
pretty hefty fish for its size so this
would<00:02:47.670> be<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.820> 2013<00:02:48.860> your<00:02:49.860> class<00:02:50.100> fish<00:02:50.400> now<00:02:51.060> this

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
would be a 2013 your class fish now this

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.970 
would be a 2013 your class fish now this
one<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.510> probably<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:52.200> year<00:02:52.500> older

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
one is probably a year older

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.580 
one is probably a year older
he's<00:02:53.220> probably<00:02:53.430> got<00:02:53.700> stocked<00:02:54.030> fish<00:02:54.299> in<00:02:54.590> 2012

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
he's probably got stocked fish in 2012

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.930 
he's probably got stocked fish in 2012
and<00:02:55.920> it's<00:02:56.579> probably<00:02:56.880> 16<00:02:57.630> inches<00:02:57.870> long<00:02:58.110> or<00:02:58.350> so

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
and it's probably 16 inches long or so

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.250 
and it's probably 16 inches long or so
so<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.329> from<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.780> first<00:03:00.989> year<00:03:01.140> the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
so that so from the first year the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.509 
so that so from the first year the
second<00:03:01.560> year<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.709> should<00:03:02.010> see<00:03:02.190> about<00:03:02.370> this

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
second year you should see about this

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.220 
second year you should see about this
much<00:03:02.670> difference<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.480> then<00:03:03.870> you've<00:03:04.019> probably

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
much difference and then you've probably

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.210 
much difference and then you've probably
got<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:06.290> 2011<00:03:07.290> year<00:03:07.410> class<00:03:07.680> food<00:03:07.950> that's

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
got a 2011 year class food that's

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.190 
got a 2011 year class food that's
amazing<00:03:08.820> how<00:03:09.000> fast<00:03:09.239> a<00:03:09.480> girl<00:03:09.750> obvious<00:03:10.049> there's

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
amazing how fast a girl obvious there's

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.020 
amazing how fast a girl obvious there's
a<00:03:10.230> lot<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.470> food<00:03:10.620> here<00:03:10.829> right<00:03:11.370> under<00:03:11.760> ideal

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
a lot of food here right under ideal

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.370 
a lot of food here right under ideal
conditions<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.690> know<00:03:12.780> they<00:03:12.930> can<00:03:13.079> grow<00:03:13.200> very

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
conditions you know they can grow very

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.490 
conditions you know they can grow very
fast

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500

obviously not from here we've stocked
them<00:03:24.390> since<00:03:24.599> I<00:03:24.989> think<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.260> late<00:03:25.349> 60s<00:03:25.950> early

standardized<00:04:19.250> dating<00:04:19.760> locations<00:04:20.269> so<00:04:20.420> we<00:04:20.510> do

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
standardized dating locations so we do

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.810 
standardized dating locations so we do
the<00:04:20.720> same<00:04:20.750> time<00:04:21.620> of<00:04:21.739> year<00:04:21.890> same<00:04:22.190> net<00:04:22.370> locations

the same time of year same net locations

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.700 
the same time of year same net locations
each<00:04:22.940> year<00:04:23.240> which<00:04:23.900> is<00:04:23.930> really<00:04:24.260> valuable<00:04:24.500> for

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
each year which is really valuable for

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.500 
each year which is really valuable for
looking<00:04:25.070> at<00:04:25.160> trend<00:04:25.400> data<00:04:25.610> we<00:04:25.910> have<00:04:26.030> five<00:04:26.240> Nets

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
looking at trend data we have five Nets

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.570 
looking at trend data we have five Nets
out<00:04:26.630> here<00:04:26.930> have<00:04:27.680> five<00:04:27.890> minutes<00:04:28.070> another<00:04:28.340> part

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
out here have five minutes another part

out here have five minutes another part
of<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.700> lake<00:04:28.850> and<00:04:29.120> we'll<00:04:29.540> run<00:04:30.020> those<00:04:30.170> usually

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
of the lake and we'll run those usually

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.100 
of the lake and we'll run those usually
two<00:04:30.620> days<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.820> know<00:04:31.910> catch<00:04:32.120> 150<00:04:32.750> to<00:04:32.810> 200

fish something like that that'll be

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.280 
fish something like that that'll be
enough<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.700> see<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.240> size<00:04:35.420> distribution<00:04:35.630> size

you know a full lake this coming year
that<00:05:09.809> should<00:05:09.990> help<00:05:10.110> on<00:05:10.289> the<00:05:10.349> water<00:05:10.529> quality<00:05:10.680> we

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
that should help on the water quality we

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.399 
that should help on the water quality we
shouldn't<00:05:11.759> have<00:05:11.849> that<00:05:11.999> the<00:05:12.629> the<00:05:12.839> squeezed

shouldn't have that the the squeezed
oxygen<00:05:13.860> conditions<00:05:14.039> in<00:05:14.460> late<00:05:14.610> summer<00:05:14.849> we

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
oxygen conditions in late summer we

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.829 
oxygen conditions in late summer we
expect<00:05:15.869> the<00:05:16.259> striped<00:05:16.559> bass<00:05:16.740> will<00:05:16.949> continue<00:05:17.369> to

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:17.839 
expect the striped bass will continue to

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:21.019 
expect the striped bass will continue to
grow<00:05:18.839> well<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.740> think<00:05:20.219> we're<00:05:20.369> like<00:05:20.639> I<00:05:20.699> say<00:05:20.849> we're

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:21.029 
grow well I think we're like I say we're

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.119 
grow well I think we're like I say we're
kind<00:05:21.419> of<00:05:21.449> past<00:05:21.719> the<00:05:21.839> critical<00:05:22.289> time<00:05:22.439> now<00:05:22.830> and

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:23.129 
kind of past the critical time now and

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.459 
kind of past the critical time now and
so<00:05:23.520> we<00:05:24.449> should<00:05:24.629> look<00:05:24.779> things<00:05:25.259> should<00:05:25.439> look

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
so we should look things should look

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:31.100 
so we should look things should look
better<00:05:25.800> from<00:05:25.949> here<00:05:26.099> on<00:05:26.159> out<00:05:29.899> what<00:05:30.899> would<00:05:31.020> you

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
better from here on out what would you

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.480 
better from here on out what would you
say<00:05:31.319> about<00:05:31.349> the<00:05:31.680> health<00:05:31.919> and<00:05:32.249> the<00:05:32.279> well-being

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
say about the health and the well-being

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.909 
say about the health and the well-being
of<00:05:32.819> that<00:05:32.969> fish<00:05:33.240> what<00:05:33.539> length<00:05:33.839> is<00:05:34.080> it<00:05:34.319> and<00:05:34.649> and

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
of that fish what length is it and and

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.290 
of that fish what length is it and and
how<00:05:35.069> old<00:05:35.279> do<00:05:35.430> you<00:05:35.490> think<00:05:35.580> that<00:05:35.819> fish<00:05:36.089> is

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
how old do you think that fish is

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.459 
how old do you think that fish is
ballpark<00:05:36.779> okay

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
ballpark okay

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.049 
ballpark okay
generally<00:05:38.129> this<00:05:38.219> fish<00:05:38.460> is<00:05:38.610> in<00:05:38.729> pretty<00:05:38.909> good

00:05:39.049 --> 00:05:39.059 
generally this fish is in pretty good

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:41.059 
generally this fish is in pretty good
body<00:05:39.479> condition<00:05:39.719> the<00:05:40.499> last<00:05:40.680> couple<00:05:41.009> years

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:41.069 
body condition the last couple years

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:42.589 
body condition the last couple years
we've<00:05:41.339> seen<00:05:41.460> them<00:05:41.610> a<00:05:41.639> lot<00:05:41.819> skinnier<00:05:42.270> that<00:05:42.509> were

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
we've seen them a lot skinnier that were

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.920 
we've seen them a lot skinnier that were
this<00:05:42.779> long<00:05:42.990> so<00:05:43.740> this<00:05:44.009> looks<00:05:44.249> pretty<00:05:44.430> good<00:05:44.930> it's

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
this long so this looks pretty good it's

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.230 
this long so this looks pretty good it's
probably<00:05:46.139> a<00:05:46.379> twenty<00:05:46.830> five<00:05:47.279> or<00:05:47.639> six<00:05:47.849> inch<00:05:48.029> fish

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
probably a twenty five or six inch fish

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.059 
probably a twenty five or six inch fish
maybe<00:05:48.539> twenty-four<00:05:49.499> twenty-five<00:05:52.069> it's

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:53.069 
maybe twenty-four twenty-five it's

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.719 
maybe twenty-four twenty-five it's
probably<00:05:53.580> a<00:05:53.610> four<00:05:53.999> year<00:05:54.569> old<00:05:54.719> fish<00:05:55.580> four<00:05:56.580> and<00:05:56.669> a

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
probably a four year old fish four and a

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.999 
probably a four year old fish four and a
half<00:05:56.759> five<00:05:57.029> used<00:05:57.360> to<00:05:57.589> before<00:05:58.589> the<00:05:58.680> lake<00:05:58.830> was

00:05:58.999 --> 00:05:59.009 
half five used to before the lake was

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:00.649 
half five used to before the lake was
drawn<00:05:59.279> down<00:05:59.490> we<00:05:59.699> could<00:05:59.849> get<00:05:59.969> them<00:06:00.089> up<00:06:00.180> to<00:06:00.270> 24

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
drawn down we could get them up to 24

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.839 
drawn down we could get them up to 24
inches<00:06:00.899> in<00:06:01.050> three<00:06:01.259> years<00:06:01.469> last<00:06:02.399> few<00:06:02.610> years

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
inches in three years last few years

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.249 
inches in three years last few years
it's<00:06:03.059> taken<00:06:03.360> at<00:06:03.449> least<00:06:03.599> a<00:06:03.689> year<00:06:03.870> longer<00:06:04.080> than

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 
it's taken at least a year longer than

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.589 
it's taken at least a year longer than
that<00:06:04.559> so<00:06:04.889> we're<00:06:05.550> kind<00:06:05.729> of<00:06:05.789> transitioning<00:06:06.419> from

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
that so we're kind of transitioning from

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.239 
that so we're kind of transitioning from
that<00:06:06.779> so<00:06:07.050> this<00:06:07.169> is<00:06:07.289> probably<00:06:07.589> a<00:06:07.649> four<00:06:07.889> maybe

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:08.249 
that so this is probably a four maybe

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:10.189 
that so this is probably a four maybe
five<00:06:08.520> year<00:06:08.729> old<00:06:08.849> fish<00:06:09.029> now<00:06:09.539> I<00:06:09.599> heard<00:06:09.809> a<00:06:09.930> lot<00:06:10.139> of

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
five year old fish now I heard a lot of

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.079 
five year old fish now I heard a lot of
folks<00:06:10.740> that<00:06:10.979> were<00:06:11.069> having<00:06:11.249> a<00:06:11.339> lot<00:06:11.490> of<00:06:11.550> fun<00:06:11.849> down

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:12.089 
folks that were having a lot of fun down

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:14.899 
folks that were having a lot of fun down
here<00:06:12.149> this<00:06:12.449> year<00:06:12.779> on<00:06:12.990> catch<00:06:13.740> them<00:06:13.919> on<00:06:14.009> top<00:06:14.219> and

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:14.909 
here this year on catch them on top and

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.449 
here this year on catch them on top and
the<00:06:15.029> jumps<00:06:15.360> right<00:06:16.169> from<00:06:16.830> what<00:06:16.949> I<00:06:16.979> understand

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:17.459 
the jumps right from what I understand

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:19.969 
the jumps right from what I understand
the<00:06:17.729> jump<00:06:18.330> fishings<00:06:18.629> been<00:06:18.749> good<00:06:18.990> and<00:06:19.199> and

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
the jump fishings been good and and

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.439 
the jump fishings been good and and
really<00:06:20.189> as<00:06:20.339> far<00:06:20.459> as<00:06:20.610> numbers<00:06:20.939> of<00:06:21.059> stripers

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
really as far as numbers of stripers

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:22.879 
really as far as numbers of stripers
goes<00:06:21.599> we've<00:06:21.809> got<00:06:21.839> plenty<00:06:22.139> of<00:06:22.229> stripers<00:06:22.680> that

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
goes we've got plenty of stripers that

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:23.600 
goes we've got plenty of stripers that
you<00:06:22.949> know<00:06:23.039> they're<00:06:23.159> a<00:06:23.189> little<00:06:23.219> bit<00:06:23.430> on<00:06:23.519> the

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
you know they're a little bit on the

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.689 
you know they're a little bit on the
small<00:06:23.849> side<00:06:23.879> but<00:06:24.509> part<00:06:25.349> of<00:06:25.379> that's<00:06:25.469> because

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:25.699 
small side but part of that's because

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:28.249 
small side but part of that's because
they<00:06:26.699> they've<00:06:27.240> grown<00:06:27.539> poorly<00:06:27.930> in<00:06:28.019> the<00:06:28.080> last

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 
they they've grown poorly in the last

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:29.329 
they they've grown poorly in the last
couple<00:06:28.439> of<00:06:28.559> years<00:06:28.620> because<00:06:28.860> of<00:06:29.099> the<00:06:29.159> water

00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:29.339 
couple of years because of the water

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:31.249 
couple of years because of the water
quality<00:06:29.490> issues<00:06:30.029> we<00:06:30.659> think<00:06:30.899> now<00:06:31.019> that<00:06:31.199> the

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
quality issues we think now that the

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:32.509 
quality issues we think now that the
water<00:06:31.439> quality<00:06:31.559> is<00:06:31.830> going<00:06:31.949> to<00:06:32.009> be<00:06:32.099> better<00:06:32.279> with

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:32.519 
water quality is going to be better with

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:34.850 
water quality is going to be better with
the<00:06:32.610> full<00:06:32.939> lake<00:06:33.180> that<00:06:33.539> growth<00:06:34.349> will<00:06:34.499> increase

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
the full lake that growth will increase

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.559 
the full lake that growth will increase
and<00:06:34.979> whilst<00:06:35.219> it's<00:06:35.459> even<00:06:35.789> bigger<00:06:35.879> fish<00:06:36.209> in<00:06:36.509> the

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:36.569 
and whilst it's even bigger fish in the

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:38.449 
and whilst it's even bigger fish in the
future<00:06:36.689> prediction<00:06:37.529> is<00:06:37.649> five<00:06:37.860> ten<00:06:38.129> years<00:06:38.370> from

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:38.459 
future prediction is five ten years from

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:40.579 
future prediction is five ten years from
now<00:06:38.550> but<00:06:38.789> I<00:06:38.849> do<00:06:38.909> think<00:06:39.149> we'll<00:06:39.360> see<00:06:39.569> an<00:06:39.959> increase

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:40.589 
now but I do think we'll see an increase

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:43.429 
now but I do think we'll see an increase
in<00:06:40.830> the<00:06:41.430> size<00:06:41.610> of<00:06:41.819> the<00:06:41.909> fish<00:06:42.149> you<00:06:42.990> know<00:06:43.289> right

00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:43.439 
in the size of the fish you know right

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:46.009 
in the size of the fish you know right
now<00:06:43.589> we've<00:06:43.769> got<00:06:43.919> a<00:06:43.949> big<00:06:44.370> year<00:06:44.519> class<00:06:44.789> it's<00:06:45.180> 24

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:46.019 
now we've got a big year class it's 24

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:48.949 
now we've got a big year class it's 24
25<00:06:46.439> inches<00:06:46.769> long<00:06:47.539> hopefully<00:06:48.539> we<00:06:48.659> can<00:06:48.779> push

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:48.959 
25 inches long hopefully we can push

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:52.279 
25 inches long hopefully we can push
that<00:06:49.080> on<00:06:49.259> out<00:06:49.649> to<00:06:49.889> the<00:06:50.039> 30<00:06:50.339> 32<00:06:50.849> 33<00:06:51.180> inch<00:06:51.479> fish

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
that on out to the 30 32 33 inch fish

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:54.619 
that on out to the 30 32 33 inch fish
it's<00:06:52.620> looking<00:06:52.919> better<00:06:53.069> and<00:06:53.490> and<00:06:54.330> the<00:06:54.449> body

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:54.629 
it's looking better and and the body

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:56.179 
it's looking better and and the body
condition<00:06:55.019> the<00:06:55.110> fish<00:06:55.259> look<00:06:55.469> better<00:06:55.649> so<00:06:55.949> I

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:56.189 
condition the fish look better so I
