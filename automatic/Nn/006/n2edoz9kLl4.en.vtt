00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
health and really the starting point to

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.850 
health and really the starting point to
understand<00:00:18.000> how<00:00:18.180> your<00:00:18.360> body<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.660> working<00:00:18.990> as

understand how your body is working as
far<00:00:20.010> as<00:00:20.160> I'm<00:00:20.279> concerned<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.850> much<00:00:21.270> more

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
far as I'm concerned this is much more

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.509 
far as I'm concerned this is much more
important<00:00:22.050> than<00:00:22.349> cholesterol<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.220> I'm

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
important than cholesterol and I'm

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.579 
important than cholesterol and I'm
afraid<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.849> many<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.630> are<00:00:24.869> living<00:00:25.560> with

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:25.589 
afraid that many of you are living with

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.429 
afraid that many of you are living with
a<00:00:25.710> false<00:00:26.009> sense<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.460> security<00:00:27.169> based<00:00:28.169> on<00:00:28.380> your

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
a false sense of security based on your

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.919 
a false sense of security based on your
cholesterol<00:00:28.830> number<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.939> fact<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.419> many

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
cholesterol number the fact is many

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.510 
cholesterol number the fact is many
people<00:00:31.320> die<00:00:31.470> every<00:00:31.890> day<00:00:31.919> with<00:00:32.369> low

people die every day with low

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.670 
people die every day with low
cholesterol<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.390> clean<00:00:33.630> arteries<00:00:34.079> there's

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
cholesterol and clean arteries there's

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.470 
cholesterol and clean arteries there's
something<00:00:35.070> else<00:00:35.250> that's<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.970> here<00:00:36.360> and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
something else that's going on here and

vitamin therapy and treating disease but
later<00:00:46.320> he<00:00:46.440> realized<00:00:47.039> getting<00:00:47.760> nutrients<00:00:48.180> in

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
later he realized getting nutrients in

later he realized getting nutrients in
your<00:00:48.449> stomach<00:00:48.750> wasn't<00:00:49.170> enough<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.370> fact

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
flow and your your blood flow really is

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.479 
flow and your your blood flow really is
your<00:01:00.870> nutrition<00:01:01.320> freeway<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.429> just

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
your nutrition freeway it's not just

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.240 
your nutrition freeway it's not just
delivering<00:01:03.179> oxygen<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:04.260> all<00:01:04.440> the<00:01:04.769> nutrients

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
delivering oxygen but all the nutrients

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.150 
delivering oxygen but all the nutrients
that<00:01:05.400> support<00:01:06.240> life<00:01:06.420> itself<00:01:06.870> so<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.860> father

blood flow or lowers your blood flow is

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.030 
blood flow or lowers your blood flow is
also<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.320> lower<00:01:13.530> your<00:01:13.710> body's

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
also going to lower your body's

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.250 
also going to lower your body's
nutrition<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.790> your<00:01:15.120> body's<00:01:15.420> ability<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:16.050> use

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
nutrition and your body's ability to use

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.830 
nutrition and your body's ability to use
the<00:01:16.470> nutrients<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.280> put<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:18.810> we

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the nutrients that you put in it so we

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.020 
the nutrients that you put in it so we
started<00:01:19.290> checking<00:01:19.530> as<00:01:19.770> patients<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.730> major

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
started checking as patients for major

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.660 
started checking as patients for major
clotting<00:01:21.840> risk<00:01:22.170> factors<00:01:22.650> again<00:01:23.370> when<00:01:23.550> your

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
clotting risk factors again when your

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.850 
clotting risk factors again when your

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
blood is clotting your blood flow is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.620 
blood is clotting your blood flow is
lowered<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.820> started<00:01:27.150> checking<00:01:27.420> for

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
lowered so we started checking for

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.100 
lowered so we started checking for
things<00:01:27.870> like<00:01:27.990> homeless<00:01:28.650> cysteine<00:01:29.040> fibrinogen

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110

small<00:01:33.660> dense<00:01:33.930> LDL<00:01:34.730> what<00:01:35.730> we<00:01:35.850> found<00:01:36.120> is<00:01:36.420> that

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
small dense LDL what we found is that

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.450 
small dense LDL what we found is that
our<00:01:36.690> sickest<00:01:37.140> patients<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.160> most

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
our sickest patients have the most

our sickest patients have the most
compromised<00:01:39.150> blood<00:01:39.480> flow<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.020> those

compromised blood flow and those

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.790 
compromised blood flow and those
oftentimes<00:01:41.640> those<00:01:42.240> with<00:01:42.570> multiple<00:01:43.380> clotting

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
oftentimes those with multiple clotting

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.310 
oftentimes those with multiple clotting
factors<00:01:44.250> were<00:01:44.580> disabled<00:01:45.240> for<00:01:45.810> these<00:01:45.930> people

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
factors were disabled for these people

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.930

they<00:01:46.440> get<00:01:46.620> sick<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.100> they<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.550> a<00:01:47.640> very
