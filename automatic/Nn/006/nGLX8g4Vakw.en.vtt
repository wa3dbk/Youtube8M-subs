00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.790
 to make the game 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.210
 today I will use part of the belly're 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.240
 but at home you will understanding 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:24.660
 to interrupt a soap in fishmongers that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.160
 the part of the tail is like that from 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.140
 of the new animals you saw that I 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.370
 was by far the most 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.380
 high right 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.940
 This is the fattest part of the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.150
 from one side the part that has the most 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.770
 fiber because she has more fiber she holds 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.300
 but she has less chance of breaking 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.129
 So this is the coolest part for you. 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.180
 make this game call what I'm going to do 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.630
 now is how to do this our game 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.780
 so I'm going to get the belly part 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.320
 that in case she is going to have on average six 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.399
 long fingers 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.410
 I'm going to take it out, baby. 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.340
 salmon a belly its biggest asset but 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.050
 is tall 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.710
 you can see that she has almost one 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.810
 deviation from height to facilitate the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.110
 People, I'll open it in the middle. 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.780
 belly okay then I'll get a knife in 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.530
 half always slipping the knife in his son 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.630
 her 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.060
 broke my fish I'll split it in half 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.799
 It's for him to be very quiet. 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.170
 I got that ethnicity out of 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.570
 to wrap easy rice 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.820
 I got it, I'm going to take my knife, I'm going 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.520
 take an aunt off a finger long 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.180
 more or less complement an excuse 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.350
 width 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.970
 Here is my knife here and I 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.729
 I need to say but I had 100 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.640
 length by a width but always 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.410
 remembering that the thin okay if she has 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.390
 thick and will not be able to roll in 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.119
 back after rice 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.490
 as I will do is our game the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.950
 here in the game must have 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.659
 an average of nine grams or more 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.130
 or less of that size 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.310
 this is practically a marbles 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.200
 same support here at my desk I will give 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.930
 a pass on it that it becomes a 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.280
 straight base below a straight line basis over 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.540
 with footprint had fish and I will wrap 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.570
 my ball of rice 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.640
 The one that says that the base I'm going to 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.810
 relax it now this base here is 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.880
 it's also relative you can make a 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.280
 base can make a base with 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.500
 White fish 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.020
 otherwise you can connect for today it's just 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.690
 a mayonnaise beat or you can 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.300
 picking up meat mixed with mayonnaise and 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.470
 Shrimp anything you've got 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.270
 some or mayonnaise or any other 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.950
 thing that has an alloy in that one 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:55.730
 Stuff is over here I'll go 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.860
 leave our base is booked here I will 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.950
 pick a chive 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.650
 It's always cool that you respect our game. 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.010
 on top with something or sauce 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.519
 on the sand or the chives or throw a 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.590
 orchard and the hierarchy of toast is always 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:16.010
 decorated a favorite thing in the case 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.980
 here today I'm going to use spring onion 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.830
 A washed dinner is missing a piece of it. 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.459
 It was important for us to temper. 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.459
 over 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.560
 if you can leave chives 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.650
 round is not so much nicer 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.280
 So if the knife has good improvement 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.280
 created 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.689
 already a little reserved here for people 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.930
 the decor and now I'm going to hit a 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.060
 A little salmon for us to let her 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.500
 back over these parts already to 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.239
 usually you can not make a 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.790
 sushi can not make a sashimi 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.379
 nice cool or use the 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.200
 creativity and make another type of 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.540
 rolled or beat makes the ceviche or the 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.239
 lemon to do various things 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.239
 okay I'll get it 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.700
 It's a slice of mix here in the middle. 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.949
 I want to make her feel better and better. 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.560
 even kill because like our little ones 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:31.570
 with a piece of big salmon is fine 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:34.479
 done then come back well I'll make it go 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.520
 show a little mayonnaise just one 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.080
 little who does not like mayonnaise or 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.449
 who does not like to mix a fish with 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.120
 something you use depends on the 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.490
 part that you use it is plus one 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.600
 course is greasier belly she joins 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.210
 best on sale 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.400
 then it has a legal consistency to 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.500
 tempting to propose filling here then 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.020
 It would not mix anything, it depends on the 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.729
 fish because it appears with atom with 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.590
 sure must have something because the 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.620
 actor will not turn a paste with salmon 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.770
 A little mayonnaise is only here. 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.979
 to give a temper 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.800
 I'll take a reasonable amount of 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:15.160
 filling 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.220
 I'll put on top of our game outta 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.350
 finish this chive that is now 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.880
 very downcast but very fierce 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.980
 Okay, I'll put it in a little bit later 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.540
 because I know she's late but if she 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.540
 I'd have more if it were for those 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.520
 small but the weakest can 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.360
 put a lot that is hotter 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.350
 I'm going to put up here just decorating 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.350
 our game is ready
