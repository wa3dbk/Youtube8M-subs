00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.409
 already in the nation stage to present another coming artist will have to return 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:06.819
 to the road in detail but the music and this guy is considered a 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:07.689
 passionate 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.569
 imagine that this is not the new trova pablo milanés silvio rodríguez 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:14.569
 We expected to present to joaquin rodríguez any third 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.650
 both the new talent to discover 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.669
 some participants 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.699
 60 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.720
 by ap panama - government of eeeuu de santiago and tonight was presented with 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.720
 Much love the video of the song 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
 Roberto Medina 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.540
 p 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.540
 I have already read it should be expanded in 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.760
 the average age 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.389
 when he looks 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.439
 the powers of the state 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.349
 food 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.579
 the line 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.299
 Germany 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.410
 It is difficult to choose if you will sing it will dance magnet 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.569
 went in like that keeps on causing it a bit backwards 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:49.749
 unfortunately the moment I was freezing 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:51.749
 the repression 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:56.309
 so I hope that now you can make a very good decision and we go the lic 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:59.309
 so that these things do not happen again 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:04.369
 any work 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.079
 good choreography and 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.549
 they must equip the dance corps and everything else 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.609
 Now that I felt very happy on stage, it's important 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:13.959
 percent 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.959
 throughout all the programming next summer one thing with another 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.859
 joaquin I think that the theater can enter any 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:21.999
 europe pressde 

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:23.460
 at what time should it be 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.740
 bauer that many public moment to body burned 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.300
 quiet because obviously that is going to remove part the representative need 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.440
 for the hour that marks the sewer tongue twister all that 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.720
 It's a matter of learning little by little that little detail 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.159
 entertaining 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:43.370
 it was fun 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.490
 but think that for two to take away use of another three minutes 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.670
 during a show it is impossible to hold pace in progress 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.880
 your companions it is imperative that you learn to control a little if it is not 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.850
 too much for broken or did not give time to create emotions 101 these new ones of 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:02.430
 motions 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.749
 it is practical and 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:07.059
 and if pa'lante because it has tints of fun and entertaining three parts 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:10.419
 what is expected is this 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:11.289
 they are sold out
