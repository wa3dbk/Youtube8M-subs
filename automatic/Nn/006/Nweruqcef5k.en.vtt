00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
but horsepower that it makes all right

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:57.780 
but horsepower that it makes all right
ready<00:01:34.410> when<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> are

7900<00:01:58.790> 80<00:01:58.970> horsepower<00:01:59.120> for<00:01:59.750> because<00:01:59.990> the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
7900 80 horsepower for because the

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.020 
7900 80 horsepower for because the
purposes<00:02:00.620> this<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.070> third<00:02:01.310> pass<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:01.850> it<00:02:01.940> is

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
purposes this is the third pass so it is

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.100 
purposes this is the third pass so it is
a<00:02:02.060> hot<00:02:02.300> pass<00:02:02.540> this<00:02:03.140> is

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
a hot pass this is

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.550 
a hot pass this is
is<00:02:04.320> going<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.620> get<00:02:04.800> so<00:02:05.040> we're<00:02:05.190> making<00:02:05.310> 180

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
is going to get so we're making 180

thirty<00:02:28.560> more<00:02:29.520> pounds<00:02:30.210> of

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.830 

falls<00:02:35.310> off<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.820> can<00:02:35.970> see<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.450> goes<00:02:36.540> down

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
falls off you can see that it goes down

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.880 
falls off you can see that it goes down
we<00:02:37.440> maintained

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.780 
we maintained
Tork<00:02:39.160> line<00:02:39.430> straight<00:02:39.790> across<00:02:39.820> all<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.510> way

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.430 

that's<00:02:43.000> quite<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.390> bit<00:02:43.629> so<00:02:44.110> we're

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
that's quite a bit so we're

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.920 
that's quite a bit so we're
3,000<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.280> 3,500<00:02:46.580> or

almost 4-thousand you could see that

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.860 
almost 4-thousand you could see that
we're<00:02:51.890> peaking<00:02:52.069> a<00:02:52.340> lot<00:02:52.489> or<00:02:52.640> earlier<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.450> we're
