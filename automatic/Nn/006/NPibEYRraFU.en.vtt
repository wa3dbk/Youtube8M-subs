00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.849
 I find you today with the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.380
 fishing potato and banana in this 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.809
 wonderful weekend ahead 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.789
 extraordinary since yes I'm going to 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.210
 paris games week and yes it gave me the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.730
 peach 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.840
 we will test the new modern warfare 3 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.330
 a few weeks before its release 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.160
 frankly I'm impatient and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.599
 looking forward to meeting some of 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.279
 So you're going to leave right away I 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.900
 will close my Bible she will leave the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.050
 south on the clip of the day that is going to 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.510
 scroll down on call of duty 4 with rio 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.579
 cause who plays the dragunov so a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.190
 very little used very little seen in the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.320
 call of duty 4 also rare clips 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.329
 in hardcore qg on the other hand but the clip 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.450
 remains as much appreciable it is 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.030
 party with lio cause to the dragunov on 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.739
 call of duty 4 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.120
 he will arrive at the level in my opinion duration 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.520
 spawn and a half there he makes us a 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.289
 first collateral followed by a third 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.809
 picks up fourth pick up is the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.899
 fifth quick scope for a straight 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.479
 fidh to dragunov here is a little code 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.860
 4 more with a weapon that I have 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.710
 I've never seen or seen very much about 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.650
 clips of the day so gg to him is finally 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.780
 hallelujah oh yes you heard me 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.450
 finally I received one that he made worthy of 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.340
 this name which can be a period so at 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.080
 the place of snipers of course 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.970
 since that's what I asked yesterday 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.960
 we left on black ops on the map 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.759
 continued with hard hard gamer 08 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.659
 you'll see so he'll start 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.860
 with the famas but he will quickly let go 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.290
 we are on this myth look it goes 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.540
 arrive at the respawn level and a half at 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.799
 famas he's going to chain so one whole 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.479
 first in and schott 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.189

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:50.610
 injured and here it goes 2 3 4 5 and 6 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.180

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.630

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.789
 these same a second from elsewhere who 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.770

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.440
 which has been attributed to the famas so puts a 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.370
