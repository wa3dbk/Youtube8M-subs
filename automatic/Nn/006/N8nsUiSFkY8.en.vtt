00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.090
 once we access linkedin we will see 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.630
 in a quick way the options that 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.000
 we have and a little bit your application or a 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.800
 possible application to teaching 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.500
 On the one hand comment that we are here 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.890
 around here we have direct links in the 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.660
 top if we go to start 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.970
 we appear on the main page where 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.550
 we will see all the updates and 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.129
 important information related to 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.649
 the contacts we have as their 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.899
 status updates for example or 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.450
 also related to groups or 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.070
 companies that we follow below 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.290
 we have a link to go to profile and 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.020
 also with a series of options in 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.590
 this we will see what our profile would be 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.140
 and we can edit it from here 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.150
 here you can see that there are the links 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.580
 since from the activity that we have gone 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.290
 having therefore a little information that 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.270
 I told you before the trajectory 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.670
 academic or professional 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.729
 experience that we have projects that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.960
 those who participate or have participated 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.970
 even the projects themselves 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.560
 we can associate with other contacts that 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.530
 let's have for example companions 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.360
 coworkers what I was saying 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.640
 the skills and knowledge from here 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.369
 because in lhasa we can put the world of 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.710
 keywords for all these 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.930
 knowledge that we have then good 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.610
 more or less this would be the information 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.710
 of the profile can be completed 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.300
 quite and the more complete the more 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.250
 information will be obtained from us 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.950
 then we have the contact area in the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.050
 which we can access the contacts 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.960
 that are part of our go that 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.869
 we have and in through this area of 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.300
 filtered we can go and search 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.899
 specifically with contacts 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.020
 even through labels we can 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.240
 access different profiles 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.520
 of contacts these are the ones that we 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.109
 we have chosen when when we have 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.189
 Friendship request or we wide of 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.990
 friendship 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.729
 we also have the group zone is 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.060
 we will see it in the end, which is the most 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.580
 we can apply to teaching 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.040
 the jobs that from here you can from 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.370
 look for work or even offer 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.890
 or announce employment offers a mailbox and 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.079
 that we have an internal mail area and 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.959
 we can accept invitations from here 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.659
 or already write messages or see them and the 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.340
 area of companies that would come to be the 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:30.579
 equivalent of the facebook pages 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.290
 well here with companies finally 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.680
 we have a search area 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.599
 searches that we can filter by 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.700
 people or jobs 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.519
 We can search for specific companies and 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.670
 putting keywords for example and 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.519
 well then we will be completing 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.220
 our our profile and above all 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.049
 increasing the number of contacts or 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.870
 companies that this is going to help us 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:59.500
 have more visibility even find 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.090
 more more job offers or already as 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.410
 I discussed different contacts before 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.700
 the linkedin is based mostly on 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.769
 status updates just like 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.569
 facebook where here we can 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.690
 share an update 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.660
 I'm looking for a job or I'm inside 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.780
 I'm in a project and I want to know 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.790
 whatever alternative then all 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.480
 our updates can see them 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.640
 all our our contacts 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.360
 we'll finally see section 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.190
 groups the groups as well as with 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.540
 facebook then we can use them and 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.690
 we can apply them to teaching 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.599
 although linkedin has no purpose 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.180
 educational if it's true that you can what 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.730
 we can take advantage of them and take advantage of them 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.920
 tools that we have to create us 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.540
 our own virtual community then 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.819
 for example in a subject such as 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.129
 we did in the case of a mod 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.049
 previous in myriad x free software 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:01.790
 open knowledge in which the 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.980
 virtual community a parallel community 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.430
 to what was the course itself we created it 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.739
 the linkedin taking advantage of the advantages of 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.540
 the groups with the groups what are we going to 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.310
 can do is that all users 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.900
 that are part of this group the 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.889
 which depending on the configuration 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.419
 of the group will automatically be able to 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.150
 be part of it simply 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.520
 signing up or they will have to go through a 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.350
 admission admission process is to say the 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.150
 own administrator or creator of the group 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:34.039
 which will be admitted or not within 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.710
 this group also comment that in the 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:40.789
 case of users who have not been long 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.620
 in linkedin or have we say have 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.949
 few contacts, because sometimes it is 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.780
 mandatory that the coordinator himself 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.789
 although the group is open and 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.389
 anyone can join have to 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:55.789
 admit him in approving admission the 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.729
 application for admission and as commented 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:01.160
 before the two groups are based mostly 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:04.160
 in updates or as they are called 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.370
 here debates which any person 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.190
 of the group can start a debate 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.320
 and because of him, because interacting inside 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.810
 of the debates we have an area that 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.660
 it comes to be like a title or a headline 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.100
 with 200 some 200 characters maximum and 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.910
 and then an area to add more 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.320
 details 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.229
 that is to say already all the information 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.300
 over the headline or just add a 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.910
 link link to an article or a 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.440
 news that we find interesting 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.440
 also we can if we have associated with 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.770
 our twitter account if we click on 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.470
 we select the check 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:42.530
 automatically it will appear in our 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.539
 twitter a tweet with this with this 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.340
 debate then on the other hand also 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.050
 we can create probes ie 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.270
 surveys where we will pose a 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.610
 question and we can put different 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.350
 answers in this way to the students 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.930
 We can raise any question 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.300
 or even doubts questions we want 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.919
 For example, an exam date 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.080
 then put different alternatives 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.169
 then the operation what he said 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.690
 users or students will be contributing 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.310
 here contained because for example they are 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.230
 You can send an exercise 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.480
 in which what they have to do is 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.600
 look for a news or a link 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.090
 interesting about some subject 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.030
 of the course in particular then the 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:26.660
 students will go adding those 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:29.390
 debates or in this case they would be links and 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.580
 the rest of the classmates will see them and their 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.340
 Once they can interact with them from 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.950
 who will be able to interact 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.960
 when we pass over the mouse of 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.600
 of the debate we can what options we have 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.530
 Well, we can recommend it, we can 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.560
 comment 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.360
 in such a way that we get good if we 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.860
 it seems interesting or if we have seen that 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.910
 we say that it has nothing to do with the 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.200
 whatever theme we can follow this 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.720
 this debate in such a way that we 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.750
 notifications arrive notifying us and 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.050
 Well , that's what I was saying before 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.050
 share the link 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:07.570
 erase even in this case this what 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.310
 could I do as administrator and 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.710
 good a series of options if we want 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.750
 enter in concrete what would be the 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:18.520
 debate to see more associated information 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:20.979
 and more organized, so let's see more 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.050
 link and here we see then the the 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:24.940
 options that we had before and in addition 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.350
 we can see the interaction he has had 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.110
 because in this case a user has 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.780
 recommended the recommend as it comes to 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:34.849
 be a little 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:36.740
 on facebook I like facebook 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:38.270
 and well and here you can see that we can 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.789
 add in the comments 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:43.029
 and again again tweet the and if 

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:43.029
 we want
