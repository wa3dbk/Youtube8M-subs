hello<00:00:00.960> my<00:00:01.199> name<00:00:01.410> is<00:00:01.439> Connor<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:02.220> am<00:00:02.550> going<00:00:02.790> to

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hello my name is Connor I am going to

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.519 
hello my name is Connor I am going to
explain<00:00:03.330> you<00:00:03.480> how<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.659> change<00:00:03.929> swings<00:00:04.290> on<00:00:04.500> a

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
explain you how to change swings on a

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.579 
explain you how to change swings on a
classical<00:00:05.040> guitar<00:00:05.370> I<00:00:05.660> start<00:00:06.660> from<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.350> lowest

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
classical guitar I start from the lowest

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.209 
classical guitar I start from the lowest
swing<00:00:08.220> which<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:09.000> am<00:00:09.179> putting<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.440> hole<00:00:10.769> from

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
swing which I am putting in a hole from

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.180 
swing which I am putting in a hole from
the<00:00:11.280> saddle<00:00:11.730> part<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.630> bridge<00:00:12.920> the<00:00:13.920> waist

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
the saddle part of the bridge the waist

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.500 
the saddle part of the bridge the waist
part<00:00:14.610> will<00:00:15.120> be<00:00:15.299> around<00:00:15.660> 2<00:00:16.170> inches<00:00:16.440> long<00:00:17.070> and

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
part will be around 2 inches long and

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.279 
part will be around 2 inches long and
then<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.779> make<00:00:19.590> one<00:00:20.039> wrap<00:00:20.750> under<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.990> main

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
then I make one wrap under the main

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.609 
then I make one wrap under the main
string<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.279> then<00:00:24.210> I'm<00:00:24.359> putting<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.900> end<00:00:25.199> in

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
string and then I'm putting the end in

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.820 
string and then I'm putting the end in
the<00:00:25.830> loop<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.430> created<00:00:27.109> but<00:00:28.109> what<00:00:28.710> is

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
the loop I have created but what is

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.120 
the loop I have created but what is
importance<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.510> this<00:00:30.510> string<00:00:31.019> crosses<00:00:31.800> on

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
importance that this string crosses on

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.850 
importance that this string crosses on
the<00:00:32.460> vertical<00:00:33.030> part<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.960> bridge<00:00:34.320> right

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
the vertical part of the bridge right

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.790 
the vertical part of the bridge right
there<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:36.030> then<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.719> swing<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.260> going<00:00:37.350> to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
there so then this swing is going to

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.150 
there so then this swing is going to
stay<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.579> tune<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.390> course<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.379> need<00:00:40.620> one<00:00:40.980> or

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
stay in tune of course you need one or

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.940 
stay in tune of course you need one or
two<00:00:41.399> days<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> swing<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.420> stabilize<00:00:43.050> but

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
two days for the swing to stabilize but

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.350 
two days for the swing to stabilize but
this<00:00:44.820> will<00:00:45.059> prevent<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.750> string<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.230> slip<00:00:46.530> and

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
this will prevent the string to slip and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.680 
this will prevent the string to slip and
then<00:00:48.360> I'm<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.430> pull<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.879> main<00:00:51.090> string

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
then I'm going to pull the main string

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.569 
then I'm going to pull the main string
like<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:53.719> that's<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.710> same<00:00:56.010> procedure

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
like that that's it the same procedure

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.819 
like that that's it the same procedure
for<00:00:56.730> e<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.770> D<00:00:59.579> string<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.260> then<00:01:01.260> for<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
for e a and D string and then for the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.560 
for e a and D string and then for the
clear<00:01:02.250> nylon<00:01:02.760> strings<00:01:03.239> G<00:01:04.110> B<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.189> E<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
clear nylon strings G B and E it's a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.460 
clear nylon strings G B and E it's a
little<00:01:06.810> bit<00:01:06.960> different<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.000> start<00:01:09.689> with<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
little bit different so I start with the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.630 
little bit different so I start with the
highest<00:01:11.070> East<00:01:11.670> Wing<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.650> begins<00:01:13.979> exactly

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
highest East Wing so it begins exactly

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.560 
highest East Wing so it begins exactly
the<00:01:15.390> same<00:01:15.720> way<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.400> lowest<00:01:17.820> E<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the same way like with the lowest E and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.870 
the same way like with the lowest E and
then<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.560> may<00:01:19.740> go<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:20.570> under<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.780> main<00:01:22.020> string

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
then I may go up under the main string

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.950 
then I may go up under the main string
then<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.909> put<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:25.200> end<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.130> string<00:01:26.960> into

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
then I put the end of the string into

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:37.399 
then I put the end of the string into
the<00:01:28.080> loop<00:01:28.640> once<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:34.220> then<00:01:35.220> again<00:01:35.689> a<00:01:36.689> second

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
the loop once and then again a second

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.580 
the loop once and then again a second
time<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.329> even<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.810> third<00:01:40.079> time<00:01:42.200> but<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:43.409> is

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
time and even the third time but what is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.210 
time and even the third time but what is
very<00:01:43.970> important<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.600> two<00:01:45.780> last<00:01:46.079> crossing<00:01:46.799> of

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
very important the two last crossing of

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.020 
very important the two last crossing of
strings<00:01:47.790> happens<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.200> vertical<00:01:49.850> palate<00:01:50.850> of

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
strings happens on a vertical palate of

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.429 
strings happens on a vertical palate of
a<00:01:51.149> bitch<00:01:51.360> right<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:52.880> then<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.090> am<00:01:54.119> going<00:01:55.110> to

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
a bitch right here then I am going to

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:02.300 
a bitch right here then I am going to
pull<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.490> string<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.450> see<00:01:58.880> that's<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:01.070> so<00:02:02.070> now

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
pull the string you see that's it so now

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.730 
pull the string you see that's it so now
what<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.700> happening<00:02:02.729> by<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.420> often<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.320> that

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
what is happening by it often is that

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.520 
what is happening by it often is that
this<00:02:05.340> little<00:02:06.149> end<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.020> string<00:02:07.320> is

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
this little end of the string is

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.999 
this little end of the string is
touching<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.340> soundboard<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.470> when<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.500> play

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
touching the soundboard and when I play

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.180 
touching the soundboard and when I play
this<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.970> making<00:02:12.330> a

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
this is making a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.710 
this is making a
kind<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.580> pallasite<00:02:14.450> noise<00:02:16.240> so<00:02:17.240> I'm<00:02:17.390> going<00:02:17.630> to

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
kind of pallasite noise so I'm going to

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:27.310 
kind of pallasite noise so I'm going to
cut<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.050> with<00:02:18.850> this<00:02:19.930> small<00:02:20.930> nail<00:02:21.500> cutter<00:02:26.320> okay

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
cut it with this small nail cutter okay

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.580 
cut it with this small nail cutter okay
let's<00:02:27.740> go<00:02:27.920> now<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.310> headstock<00:02:29.230> I'm<00:02:30.230> going

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
let's go now to the headstock I'm going

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.880 
let's go now to the headstock I'm going
to<00:02:31.070> put<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:32.000> swing<00:02:32.330> through<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.990> little<00:02:33.530> hole

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
to put the swing through a little hole

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.360 
to put the swing through a little hole
in<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.340> tuning<00:02:34.910> column<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.440> lowest<00:02:36.650> swing

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
in the tuning column so the lowest swing

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.640 
in the tuning column so the lowest swing
is<00:02:38.270> going<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.780> first<00:02:39.520> tuning<00:02:40.520> roller<00:02:41.650> just

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
is going to the first tuning roller just

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.450 
is going to the first tuning roller just
after<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.670> nut<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.300> it's<00:02:44.930> on<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.680> upper<00:02:46.100> part

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
after the nut and it's on the upper part

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.240 
after the nut and it's on the upper part
of<00:02:46.640> getting<00:02:46.850> little<00:02:47.300> if<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:47.570> are<00:02:47.860> right<00:02:48.860> hand

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
of getting little if you are right hand

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.580 
of getting little if you are right hand
player<00:02:49.960> so<00:02:50.960> I<00:02:50.990> I<00:02:52.150> put<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.330> once<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:54.110> then<00:02:54.560> I
