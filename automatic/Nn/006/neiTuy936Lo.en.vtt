simple<00:00:49.780> board<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.260> I<00:00:50.320> decided<00:00:50.710> to<00:00:51.010> just<00:00:51.399> use

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
simple board and I decided to just use

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.840 
simple board and I decided to just use
my<00:00:51.790> miter<00:00:52.059> saw<00:00:52.390> for<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:52.750> cut<00:00:52.960> on<00:00:53.079> that<00:00:53.290> and<00:00:53.850> you

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
my miter saw for the cut on that and you

my miter saw for the cut on that and you
know<00:00:54.940> I<00:00:54.969> took<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:55.360> over<00:00:55.510> to<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:56.260> router

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.970 
know I took that over to the router
table<00:00:56.920> and<00:00:57.399> just<00:00:57.640> did<00:00:57.790> a<00:00:57.820> simple<00:00:58.120> chamfer

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
table and just did a simple chamfer

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.259 
table and just did a simple chamfer
around<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.190> little<00:01:00.790> sides<00:01:01.059> of<00:01:01.300> it<00:01:01.680> next<00:01:02.680> up<00:01:02.890> I

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
you line things up a little bit easier

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:31.310 
you line things up a little bit easier
when<00:01:23.109> you're<00:01:23.289> making<00:01:23.829> your<00:01:24.069> cuts

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.890 

next<00:01:31.950> up<00:01:32.130> by

next up by

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.470 
next up by
head<00:01:32.990> over<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:33.380> drill<00:01:33.590> press<00:01:33.620> and<00:01:34.520> I<00:01:35.030> used

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
head over to the drill press and I used

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.140 
head over to the drill press and I used
a<00:01:35.630> two<00:01:36.080> inch<00:01:36.380> Forstner<00:01:36.920> bit<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.490> drill<00:01:38.060> the

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
a two inch Forstner bit to drill the

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.660 
a two inch Forstner bit to drill the
hole<00:01:38.330> that<00:01:38.510> I<00:01:38.570> need<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:38.870> for<00:01:39.050> my<00:01:39.110> magnet<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.610> I

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
hole that I need it for my magnet and I

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.740 
hole that I need it for my magnet and I
probably<00:01:40.850> could<00:01:41.210> have<00:01:41.270> got<00:01:41.390> away<00:01:41.480> with<00:01:41.600> a

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
probably could have got away with a

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
probably could have got away with a
smaller<00:01:42.140> size<00:01:42.880> magnet<00:01:44.050> maybe<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.110> one<00:01:45.380> inch<00:01:45.590> or

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
smaller size magnet maybe a one inch or

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.890 
smaller size magnet maybe a one inch or
one<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:46.160> a<00:01:46.220> half<00:01:46.370> inch<00:01:46.640> but<00:01:47.450> since<00:01:47.690> this<00:01:47.810> is

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
one and a half inch but since this is

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.060 
one and a half inch but since this is
really<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.230> first<00:01:48.410> time<00:01:48.530> I've<00:01:48.620> ever<00:01:48.710> used

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
really the first time I've ever used

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.740 
really the first time I've ever used
anything<00:01:49.340> like<00:01:49.490> this<00:01:49.880> I<00:01:50.000> kind<00:01:50.420> of<00:01:50.450> wanted<00:01:50.720> to

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
anything like this I kind of wanted to

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.580 
anything like this I kind of wanted to
go<00:01:50.930> big<00:01:51.400> so<00:01:52.400> you<00:01:53.270> know<00:01:53.360> I<00:01:53.420> drilled<00:01:53.990> about<00:01:54.080> a

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
go big so you know I drilled about a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.460 
go big so you know I drilled about a
half<00:01:54.860> an<00:01:54.980> inch<00:01:55.100> in<00:01:55.400> and<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:57.170> worked<00:01:57.350> pretty

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
half an inch in and it worked pretty

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.440 
half an inch in and it worked pretty
well

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.510 

so<00:02:03.320> after<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.560> finished<00:02:03.950> with<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.190> drill<00:02:04.400> press

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
so after I finished with the drill press

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.480 
so after I finished with the drill press
I<00:02:04.760> moved<00:02:05.000> on<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.479> sanding<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:07.010> whole<00:02:07.159> board

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
I moved on to sanding the whole board

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.059 
I moved on to sanding the whole board
front<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:08.000> back<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.869> then<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.140> decided<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.830> use

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
front and back and then I decided to use

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.550 
front and back and then I decided to use
a<00:02:10.300> golden<00:02:11.300> oak<00:02:11.510> finish<00:02:12.760> it's<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.030> min<00:02:14.240> wax

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
a golden oak finish it's just a min wax

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.880 
a golden oak finish it's just a min wax
finish<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.930> steam<00:02:18.140> L<00:02:18.350> looks<00:02:18.590> really

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
finish and the steam L looks really

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.550 
finish and the steam L looks really
great<00:02:19.100> it's<00:02:19.520> an<00:02:19.610> oak<00:02:19.790> board<00:02:20.320> so<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.440> oak

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
great it's an oak board so the oak

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.250 
great it's an oak board so the oak
finish<00:02:21.770> on<00:02:22.130> it<00:02:22.330> really<00:02:23.330> just<00:02:23.570> uh<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:24.200> just

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
finish on it really just uh it just

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.980 
finish on it really just uh it just
makes<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:24.860> look<00:02:25.130> kind<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:25.910> classic<00:02:26.060> like

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
makes it look kind of that classic like

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.350 
makes it look kind of that classic like
classic<00:02:27.470> look<00:02:27.680> but<00:02:27.920> uh<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:28.760> like<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:29.270> mean

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
classic look but uh but I like it I mean

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.360 
classic look but uh but I like it I mean
I<00:02:29.420> think<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.750> turned<00:02:29.930> out<00:02:30.020> really<00:02:30.080> well<00:02:30.370> and

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
I think it turned out really well and

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.760 
I think it turned out really well and
after<00:02:31.489> I<00:02:31.670> finished<00:02:32.000> staining<00:02:32.720> then<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.900> did<00:02:33.319> go

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
after I finished staining then I did go

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.320 
after I finished staining then I did go
back<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.160> put<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.510> glossy<00:02:36.760> sealer<00:02:37.760> on<00:02:37.880> top<00:02:38.120> of

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
back and put a glossy sealer on top of

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.870 
back and put a glossy sealer on top of
it<00:02:38.480> just<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:39.230> protect<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.250> think<00:02:40.640> I

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
it just to protect it and I think I

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.490 
it just to protect it and I think I
actually<00:02:41.000> did<00:02:41.300> two<00:02:41.540> coats<00:02:41.570> of<00:02:42.019> that<00:02:42.080> as<00:02:42.350> I

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
actually did two coats of that as I

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:51.809 
actually did two coats of that as I
recall

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.259 

so<00:02:52.819> after<00:02:53.299> everything<00:02:53.599> finished<00:02:54.319> drying<00:02:54.650> I

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
so after everything finished drying I

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.119 
so after everything finished drying I
inserted<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.959> magnet<00:02:57.349> that<00:02:57.469> I<00:02:57.590> had<00:02:57.739> for

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
inserted the the magnet that I had for

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.339 
inserted the the magnet that I had for
it<00:02:58.159> it<00:02:58.909> was<00:02:59.030> really<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.269> perfect<00:02:59.450> fitted<00:03:00.140> it

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
it it was really a perfect fitted it

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.520 
it it was really a perfect fitted it
worked<00:03:00.650> just<00:03:00.950> great<00:03:01.099> and<00:03:01.840> later<00:03:02.840> I<00:03:02.930> did<00:03:03.049> to

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
worked just great and later I did to

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.860 
worked just great and later I did to
some<00:03:04.069> epoxy<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.760> help<00:03:05.090> hold<00:03:05.329> that<00:03:05.480> in<00:03:05.659> there

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
some epoxy to help hold that in there

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.330 
some epoxy to help hold that in there
although<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.650> don't<00:03:06.739> really<00:03:07.010> know<00:03:07.129> that<00:03:07.159> I

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
although I don't really know that I

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.030 
although I don't really know that I
needed<00:03:07.609> to<00:03:07.819> do<00:03:07.939> that<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.510> then<00:03:09.349> the<00:03:09.560> last

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
needed to do that and then the last

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.460 
needed to do that and then the last
piece<00:03:10.310> really<00:03:10.609> is<00:03:10.700> just<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:11.120> attach<00:03:11.629> the<00:03:12.049> the

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
piece really is just to attach the the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.000 
piece really is just to attach the the
bottle<00:03:12.709> opener<00:03:12.980> itself<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:15.590> know<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:15.739> did

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
bottle opener itself and you know I did

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.280 
bottle opener itself and you know I did
pre-drill<00:03:16.640> holes<00:03:16.670> for<00:03:17.329> that<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:17.989> don't<00:03:18.139> see

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
pre-drill holes for that you don't see

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.399 
pre-drill holes for that you don't see
it<00:03:18.379> in<00:03:18.439> the<00:03:18.530> video<00:03:18.829> but<00:03:19.750> again<00:03:20.750> it's<00:03:21.139> pretty

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
it in the video but again it's pretty

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:31.599 
it in the video but again it's pretty
straightforward<00:03:29.799> so<00:03:30.799> that's<00:03:30.980> pretty<00:03:31.159> much<00:03:31.250> it

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
straightforward so that's pretty much it

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.490 
straightforward so that's pretty much it
that's<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.569> bottle<00:03:32.840> opener<00:03:33.139> with<00:03:33.319> the

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
that's the the bottle opener with the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.399 
that's the the bottle opener with the
magnetic<00:03:34.069> catch<00:03:34.489> at<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.909> bottom<00:03:35.209> it's<00:03:35.989> a<00:03:36.169> it's

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
magnetic catch at the bottom it's a it's

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.199 
magnetic catch at the bottom it's a it's
a<00:03:36.500> pretty<00:03:36.650> straightforward<00:03:37.069> fun<00:03:37.879> easy

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
a pretty straightforward fun easy

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.509 
a pretty straightforward fun easy
project<00:03:38.329> to<00:03:38.840> do<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.290> as<00:03:39.950> always<00:03:40.129> you<00:03:40.370> can
