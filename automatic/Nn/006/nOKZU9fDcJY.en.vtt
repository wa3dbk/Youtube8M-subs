we've got some issues with and they like
it<00:00:08.069> sounds<00:00:08.700> like<00:00:08.849> it's<00:00:08.970> kind<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.240> fly<00:00:09.540> apart<00:00:09.929> on

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139

us<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.500> got<00:00:11.370> low<00:00:11.910> amp<00:00:12.179> probe<00:00:12.480> here<00:00:12.780> setup<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.469> get

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
us I got low amp probe here setup I get

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.740 
us I got low amp probe here setup I get
our<00:00:13.860> hush<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.429> amp<00:00:14.730> probe<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.179> got<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.450> over<00:00:15.570> on

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
our hush the amp probe I got it over on

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.890 
our hush the amp probe I got it over on
the<00:00:16.070> 400<00:00:17.070> amp<00:00:17.580> setting<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.240> got<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.570> around<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
the 400 amp setting I got it around the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.859 
the 400 amp setting I got it around the
main<00:00:19.050> battery<00:00:19.470> cable<00:00:19.859> going<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.310> starter

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
main battery cable going to the starter

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.300 
main battery cable going to the starter
got<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.050> various<00:00:22.320> set<00:00:22.590> up<00:00:22.710> here

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
got the various set up here

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.080 
got the various set up here
let's<00:00:23.880> see<00:00:24.289> run<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.970> 500<00:00:27.019> millivolt<00:00:28.019> scale<00:00:28.529> so

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
let's see run a 500 millivolt scale so

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.849 
let's see run a 500 millivolt scale so
amps<00:00:30.090> will<00:00:30.390> convert<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.869> millivolts<00:00:31.650> when<00:00:31.830> I

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
amps will convert to millivolts when I

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.560 
amps will convert to millivolts when I
crank<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.369> thing<00:00:32.430> over<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.030> we'll<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.329> here

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
crank this thing over and we'll see here

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.299 
crank this thing over and we'll see here
that<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.290> really<00:00:34.530> don't<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.860> compression

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
that we really don't have a compression

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.250 
that we really don't have a compression
problem<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.149> got<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:38.329> starter<00:00:39.329> wire<00:00:39.960> here

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
problem I got a starter wire here

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.350 
problem I got a starter wire here
disconnected<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.129> got<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> test<00:00:41.700> lead<00:00:42.000> here

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
disconnected and I got a test lead here

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.750 
disconnected and I got a test lead here
going<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> positive<00:00:43.860> battery<00:00:44.040> cable<00:00:44.250> so

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
going to the positive battery cable so

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.910 
going to the positive battery cable so
we'll<00:00:44.879> crank<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.329> thing<00:00:45.600> over<00:00:51.379> and<00:00:52.379> sounds

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
we'll crank this thing over and sounds

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.000 
we'll crank this thing over and sounds
pretty<00:00:53.190> good<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.520> we'll<00:00:53.640> look<00:00:53.820> over<00:00:54.030> here

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
pretty good and we'll look over here

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:05.329 
pretty good and we'll look over here
better<00:00:59.539> see<00:01:00.539> what<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.840> got<00:01:01.020> here

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.060 

find<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.179> there<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.929> things<00:01:07.679> look<00:01:07.890> pretty

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
find it there it is things look pretty

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.580 
find it there it is things look pretty
steady<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.759> we<00:01:08.850> got<00:01:09.079> reason<00:01:10.079> to<00:01:10.109> believe<00:01:10.229> we

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
steady so we got reason to believe we

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.160 
steady so we got reason to believe we
got<00:01:10.740> even<00:01:11.219> compression<00:01:11.789> across<00:01:12.780> all<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
got even compression across all the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.289 
got even compression across all the
cylinders<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.920> got<00:01:14.009> nice<00:01:14.189> even<00:01:14.579> wave<00:01:14.969> form

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
cylinders we got nice even wave form

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.200 
cylinders we got nice even wave form
there<00:01:15.569> and<00:01:16.530> we'll<00:01:16.649> go<00:01:16.770> back<00:01:16.950> here<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.369> plug

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
there and we'll go back here and plug

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:28.130 
there and we'll go back here and plug
our<00:01:18.649> starter<00:01:19.649> back<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:26.420> okay<00:01:27.420> I'm<00:01:27.750> sorry<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
our starter back in okay I'm sorry the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.429 
our starter back in okay I'm sorry the
cables<00:01:28.590> plug<00:01:29.069> back<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.549> there<00:01:30.259> it'll<00:01:31.259> go

cables plug back in there it'll go
around<00:01:31.560> here<00:01:32.959> they'll<00:01:33.959> start<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
around here they'll start it up and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:45.249 
around here they'll start it up and
we'll<00:01:35.039> see<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.280> how<00:01:35.640> bad<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.450> thing<00:01:36.689> sounds

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259

that's<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.439> we'll<00:01:46.649> start<00:01:48.560> like<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.739> the<00:01:49.829> key

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
that's it we'll start like of the key

00:01:50.069 --> 00:02:36.070 
that's it we'll start like of the key
ones

tell<00:02:41.940> we<00:02:42.180> got<00:02:42.209> definite<00:02:42.930> injector<00:02:43.740> problems

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
tell we got definite injector problems

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.280 
tell we got definite injector problems
when<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.610> got<00:02:44.760> even<00:02:45.450> compression<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.230> you

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
when you got even compression and you

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.150 
when you got even compression and you
got<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> knock<00:02:46.740> like<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.250> you're<00:02:47.880> probably

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
got a knock like that you're probably

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.550 
got a knock like that you're probably
dumping<00:02:50.160> all<00:02:50.310> kinds<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.760> fuel<00:02:51.030> into<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.600> into

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
dumping all kinds of fuel into the into

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.720 
dumping all kinds of fuel into the into
the<00:02:52.620> cylinder<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.280> already<00:02:53.400> did<00:02:53.670> a

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
the cylinder and I already did a

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.210 
the cylinder and I already did a
compression<00:02:54.239> check<00:02:54.690> or<00:02:55.319> cylinder<00:02:55.860> balance

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
compression check or cylinder balance

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.120 
compression check or cylinder balance
check<00:02:56.520> sorry<00:02:57.350> not<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.500> was<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.830> year<00:02:58.980> we'll

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
check sorry not it was the year we'll

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.250 
check sorry not it was the year we'll
check<00:02:59.310> the<00:03:00.590> worksheet<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.750> we<00:03:03.750> see<00:03:03.959> we<00:03:04.110> got

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
check the worksheet and we see we got

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.449 
check the worksheet and we see we got
some<00:03:04.319> cold<00:03:04.800> stone<00:03:05.130> here<00:03:06.739> and<00:03:07.739> there<00:03:08.160> we<00:03:08.250> have

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
some cold stone here and there we have

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.790 
some cold stone here and there we have
it<00:03:08.640> done<00:03:08.850> what<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.300> see<00:03:09.450> are<00:03:09.570> not<00:03:09.900> on<00:03:10.230> the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
it done what you see are not on the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.880 
it done what you see are not on the
bottom<00:03:11.450> it<00:03:12.450> says<00:03:12.510> cylinder<00:03:13.290> three<00:03:13.620> and

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
bottom it says cylinder three and

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.020 
bottom it says cylinder three and
cylinder<00:03:14.519> six<00:03:14.760> contribution<00:03:15.660> balanced<00:03:16.140> fault

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
cylinder six contribution balanced fault

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.509 
cylinder six contribution balanced fault
so<00:03:18.030> we'll<00:03:18.269> start<00:03:18.540> here<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.920> we'll<00:03:20.130> start<00:03:20.310> by

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
so we'll start here and we'll start by

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.199 
so we'll start here and we'll start by
pulling<00:03:20.880> three<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.420> six<00:03:21.690> injectors<00:03:22.319> and

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
pulling three and six injectors and

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.460 
pulling three and six injectors and
that's<00:03:24.209> about<00:03:24.390> all<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.660> can<00:03:24.780> really<00:03:24.959> do<00:03:25.200> here

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
that's about all you can really do here

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.350 
that's about all you can really do here
our<00:03:25.590> oil<00:03:25.950> pressures<00:03:26.459> good<00:03:26.670> our<00:03:26.819> fuel<00:03:27.060> pressure

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
our oil pressures good our fuel pressure

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.570 
our oil pressures good our fuel pressure
is<00:03:27.660> good<00:03:28.190> so<00:03:29.190> we'll<00:03:29.430> we'll<00:03:30.060> start<00:03:30.360> by<00:03:30.510> pulling

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
is good so we'll we'll start by pulling

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.979 
is good so we'll we'll start by pulling
number<00:03:32.580> three<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:32.910> number<00:03:33.120> six<00:03:33.450> injector

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
number three and number six injector

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.960 
number three and number six injector
first<00:03:34.319> and<00:03:34.709> we'll<00:03:35.010> see<00:03:35.220> what<00:03:35.370> we<00:03:35.489> find

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
first and we'll see what we find

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.170 
first and we'll see what we find
okay<00:03:36.450> that's<00:03:36.720> about<00:03:36.989> it
