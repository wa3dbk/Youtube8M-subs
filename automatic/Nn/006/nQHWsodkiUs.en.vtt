00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
this is notebook software which we'll be

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.109 
this is notebook software which we'll be
looking<00:00:56.260> at<00:00:56.530> in<00:00:56.739> detail<00:00:57.040> during<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.699> session

write their ideas and their concepts

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.190 
write their ideas and their concepts
just<00:01:13.990> straight<00:01:14.590> onto<00:01:14.829> the<00:01:14.979> board<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:17.020> as

just straight onto the board and it's as
a<00:01:17.229> media<00:01:17.710> is<00:01:17.859> literally<00:01:18.250> just<00:01:18.430> picking<00:01:18.759> up<00:01:18.820> the

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
a media is literally just picking up the

a media is literally just picking up the
pen<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:21.070> writing<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:23.140> don't<00:01:23.259> have<00:01:23.409> to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
pen and and writing you don't have to

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.200 
pen and and writing you don't have to
switch<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.950> ink<00:01:24.130> on<00:01:24.310> you<00:01:24.729> don't<00:01:24.850> have<00:01:24.939> to<00:01:25.119> hit

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
switch the ink on you don't have to hit

an<00:01:25.359> icon<00:01:25.840> it<00:01:25.990> just<00:01:26.170> happens<00:01:26.619> and<00:01:26.859> it's<00:01:26.979> there

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
an icon it just happens and it's there

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.950 
an icon it just happens and it's there
and<00:01:27.250> it's<00:01:27.939> immediate<00:01:28.509> so<00:01:29.500> if<00:01:30.189> you<00:01:30.909> had<00:01:31.600> a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
and it's immediate so if you had a

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.230 
and it's immediate so if you had a
requirement<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:32.950> use<00:01:33.219> something<00:01:33.520> like<00:01:33.729> in<00:01:34.119> the

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
requirement to use something like in the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.359 
requirement to use something like in the
old<00:01:34.390> world<00:01:34.659> would<00:01:34.960> have<00:01:35.020> been<00:01:35.079> a<00:01:35.200> dry<00:01:35.499> erase

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
old world would have been a dry erase

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.999 
old world would have been a dry erase
board<00:01:36.759> or<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:36.939> flip<00:01:37.149> chart<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:38.560> can<00:01:38.679> do<00:01:38.799> just

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
board or a flip chart you can do just

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.730 
board or a flip chart you can do just
the<00:01:39.039> same<00:01:39.280> thing<00:01:39.549> with<00:01:40.179> a<00:01:40.210> smart<00:01:40.539> board<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:41.710> of

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
the same thing with a smart board one of

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.679 
the same thing with a smart board one of
the<00:01:41.829> advantages<00:01:42.219> on<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.399> smart<00:01:42.729> board<00:01:42.820> over

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
the advantages on a smart board over

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.989 
the advantages on a smart board over
let's<00:01:43.929> say<00:01:44.109> flip<00:01:44.350> chart<00:01:44.679> is<00:01:44.859> that<00:01:45.520> with<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:45.759> flip

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:45.999 
let's say flip chart is that with a flip

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:47.219 
let's say flip chart is that with a flip
chart<00:01:46.270> which<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.420> written<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:46.840> on<00:01:46.929> the<00:01:46.990> flip

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
chart which is written it on the flip

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.469 
chart which is written it on the flip
chart<00:01:47.530> you've<00:01:47.799> got<00:01:48.130> kind<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:48.640> two<00:01:48.819> choices<00:01:49.119> I

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
chart you've got kind of two choices I

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.220 
chart you've got kind of two choices I
think<00:01:50.039> disagree<00:01:51.039> me

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
think disagree me

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.580 
think disagree me
you<00:01:53.040> could<00:01:53.190> look<00:01:53.340> at<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:54.330> you<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.140> flick<00:01:55.440> it

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
you could look at it or you can flick it

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.850 
you could look at it or you can flick it
over<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:57.630> can't<00:01:57.840> move<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.260> once<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
over you can't move it once it's on the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.710 
over you can't move it once it's on the
flip<00:01:59.040> chart<00:01:59.220> if<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.430> write<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.120> word<00:02:00.360> there

is<00:02:08.160> what<00:02:08.340> they<00:02:08.430> call<00:02:08.580> object<00:02:08.970> based<00:02:09.180> when<00:02:09.450> you

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
is what they call object based when you

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.940 
is what they call object based when you
create<00:02:09.840> something<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.410> smarten<00:02:10.830> wood

here you can drag that to and from the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.110 
here you can drag that to and from the
center<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.460> make<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:33.150> larger<00:02:33.630> or<00:02:33.810> smaller

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
so if we were having a bit of an ideas

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.560 
so if we were having a bit of an ideas
session<00:04:55.310> we've<00:04:55.460> got<00:04:55.580> some<00:04:55.760> ideas<00:04:55.820> up<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:56.510> I

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
session we've got some ideas up and I

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.330 
session we've got some ideas up and I
then<00:04:56.900> decided<00:04:57.350> I<00:04:57.410> wanted<00:04:57.680> to<00:04:57.740> share<00:04:58.040> it<00:04:58.220> with

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340

then decided I wanted to share it with
the<00:04:58.430> rest<00:04:58.580> of<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.850> group<00:04:59.060> I'd<00:04:59.780> probably<00:05:00.050> just

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
the rest of the group I'd probably just

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.510

export<00:06:11.160> you<00:06:11.310> probably<00:06:11.639> save<00:06:11.940> it<00:06:12.120> as<00:06:12.210> a

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240
