00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
but um yeah this song this was really

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.000 
but um yeah this song this was really
cool<00:04:42.630> game<00:04:42.840> playing<00:04:43.139> and<00:04:43.350> I<00:04:43.440> just<00:04:43.710> started

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
cool game playing and I just started

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.640 
cool game playing and I just started
learning<00:04:44.190> how<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.520> work<00:04:44.700> these<00:04:44.910> spawns<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.660> so

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
learning how to work these spawns and so

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.750 
learning how to work these spawns and so
basically<00:04:46.979> like<00:04:47.639> you<00:04:47.850> want<00:04:48.030> to<00:04:48.120> go<00:04:48.300> for<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.760> I

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
basically like you want to go for the I

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.610 
basically like you want to go for the I
think<00:04:51.150> it's<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.300> alpha<00:04:51.870> spawn<00:04:52.139> you<00:04:52.410> want<00:04:52.560> to

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
think it's the alpha spawn you want to

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.770 
think it's the alpha spawn you want to
push<00:04:52.770> them<00:04:52.889> back<00:04:53.010> to<00:04:53.220> that<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.639> then<00:04:54.090> like<00:04:54.479> one

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
push them back to that and then like one

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.719 
push them back to that and then like one
everyone<00:04:55.169> holds<00:04:55.560> mid<00:04:55.740> map<00:04:55.950> and<00:04:56.280> then<00:04:56.490> one

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
everyone holds mid map and then one

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.760 
everyone holds mid map and then one
person<00:04:57.210> runs<00:04:57.540> around<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.930> spawn<00:04:58.229> back<00:04:58.530> and

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
person runs around the spawn back and

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.040 
person runs around the spawn back and
forth<00:04:59.010> and<00:04:59.280> I'll<00:05:00.180> show<00:05:00.419> you<00:05:00.479> in<00:05:00.600> a<00:05:00.690> minute<00:05:00.810> when

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.940 
i get back over to that side of the map
but<00:05:02.820> basically<00:05:03.030> you<00:05:03.479> go<00:05:03.690> from<00:05:04.080> one<00:05:04.650> side<00:05:04.919> to

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
but basically you go from one side to

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.129 
but basically you go from one side to
the<00:05:05.160> other<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:05.700> kill<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.000> guy<00:05:06.270> or<00:05:06.450> two<00:05:06.479> and<00:05:07.020> he

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
the other you kill a guy or two and he

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.400 
the other you kill a guy or two and he
spawns<00:05:07.440> directly<00:05:08.220> a<00:05:08.810> diagonal<00:05:09.810> on<00:05:09.960> that<00:05:10.139> side

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
spawns directly a diagonal on that side

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.260 
spawns directly a diagonal on that side
of<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.620> map<00:05:10.800> so<00:05:11.100> if<00:05:11.250> you<00:05:11.370> kill<00:05:11.610> him<00:05:11.850> you<00:05:12.150> know

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
of the map so if you kill him you know

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.760 
of the map so if you kill him you know
going<00:05:12.540> into<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:12.960> garage<00:05:13.139> where<00:05:13.620> it<00:05:13.680> goes

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
going into the garage where it goes

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.500 
going into the garage where it goes
underground<00:05:14.220> on<00:05:15.090> um<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:16.729> alpha<00:05:17.729> spawn<00:05:18.030> then

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
underground on um the alpha spawn then

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.010 
underground on um the alpha spawn then
he<00:05:18.840> will<00:05:18.990> flip<00:05:19.350> to<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:20.370> open<00:05:21.180> area<00:05:21.539> with<00:05:21.810> like

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
he will flip to the open area with like

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.620 
he will flip to the open area with like
the<00:05:22.169> silos<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.860> trailers<00:05:23.370> stacked<00:05:23.669> up<00:05:24.000> so

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
the silos the trailers stacked up so
