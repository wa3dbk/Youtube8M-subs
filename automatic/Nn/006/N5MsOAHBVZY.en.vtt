Zach<00:00:40.920> he<00:00:41.129> was<00:00:41.280> like<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> most<00:00:41.760> easygoing

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
Zach he was like the most easygoing

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.709 
Zach he was like the most easygoing
stress-free<00:00:43.800> partner<00:00:44.399> um<00:00:44.730> he<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:45.600> almost

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
stress-free partner um he was almost

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.660 
stress-free partner um he was almost
like<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.170> maybe<00:00:46.379> he<00:00:46.739> was<00:00:46.860> too<00:00:47.070> calm<00:00:47.340> if

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
like to maybe he was too calm if

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.850
