00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
your right triangle now the trick with

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.929 
your right triangle now the trick with
snowflakes<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:16.159> you<00:01:17.159> want<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.430> keep<00:01:17.580> them<00:01:17.729> as

snowflakes is you want to keep them as
lazy<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.450> possible<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.200> keep<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.070> paper<00:01:20.280> that

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
lazy as possible and keep the paper that

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.719 
lazy as possible and keep the paper that
you<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.880> left<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:22.070> similar<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.189> thickness<00:01:23.549> as

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you have left is similar in thickness as

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.270 
you have left is similar in thickness as
possible<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:25.049> doesn't<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.380> matter<00:01:25.590> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
possible and it doesn't really matter I

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.800 
possible and it doesn't really matter I
like<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.790> start<00:01:26.939> at<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.090> top<00:01:27.299> some<00:01:27.570> people

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
like to start at the top some people

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.210 
like to start at the top some people
start<00:01:28.020> at<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.110> bottom<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.799> think<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.040> top

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
start at the bottom that I think the top

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.859 
start at the bottom that I think the top
sees<00:01:29.400> here<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.909> let's<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.360> start<00:01:30.540> at<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.659> top

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
sees here so let's just start at the top

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.140 
sees here so let's just start at the top
and<00:01:31.250> just<00:01:32.250> cut<00:01:33.210> away<00:01:33.479> whatever<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.500> want<00:01:35.150> and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
and just cut away whatever you want and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.420 
and just cut away whatever you want and
so<00:01:36.930> I've<00:01:37.020> got<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.710> then<00:01:37.740> I'm<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
so I've got that and then I'm going to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.520 
so I've got that and then I'm going to
start<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.759> one<00:01:39.030> side<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.720> I'm<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.350> going<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
start on one side and I'm just going to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.550 
start on one side and I'm just going to
cut<00:01:40.950> next<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.450> I'm<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.899> going<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.140> cut

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
cut next to it and I'm just going to cut

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.730 
cut next to it and I'm just going to cut
up<00:01:43.740> some<00:01:44.250> random<00:01:44.700> shape<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.930> careful<00:01:46.350> not<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
up some random shape be careful not to

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.539 
up some random shape be careful not to
cut<00:01:47.390> all<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.840> way<00:01:48.960> over<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.799> other<00:01:50.250> side

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
cut all the way over to the other side

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.639 
cut all the way over to the other side
because<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.689> would<00:01:51.869> mean<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.380> you've

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
because that would mean that you've

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.190 
because that would mean that you've
chopped<00:01:52.979> off<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.159> topic<00:01:53.460> your<00:01:53.700> stuff<00:01:53.880> like

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
chopped off the topic your stuff like

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.010 
chopped off the topic your stuff like
all<00:01:55.200> right

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.100 

I've<00:01:59.020> got<00:01:59.200> that<00:01:59.440> and<00:01:59.790> yeah<00:02:00.790> I've<00:02:01.060> got<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:01.420> cut

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
I've got that and yeah I've got that cut

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.510 
I've got that and yeah I've got that cut
out<00:02:02.550> so<00:02:03.550> I'm<00:02:04.240> going<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.510> just<00:02:05.220> flip<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.340> over

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
out so I'm going to just flip it over

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.390 
out so I'm going to just flip it over
and<00:02:06.910> cut<00:02:07.540> from<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.080> other<00:02:08.260> side<00:02:08.530> kind<00:02:09.369> of

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 
and cut from the other side kind of

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:20.220 
and cut from the other side kind of
leaving<00:02:09.730> borders<00:02:10.410> all<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:12.040> same<00:02:12.460> thickness

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.979 

cut<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.069> out<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:22.300> I<00:02:22.420> think<00:02:22.510> I'm<00:02:22.750> going<00:02:22.900> to

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
cut that out and I think I'm going to

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.039 
cut that out and I think I'm going to
cut<00:02:23.170> out<00:02:23.349> another<00:02:24.299> little<00:02:25.299> section<00:02:25.720> on<00:02:25.840> this

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
cut out another little section on this

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:35.130 
cut out another little section on this
side<00:02:30.659> go<00:02:31.659> down<00:02:31.840> like<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:33.480> okay<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:34.780> this<00:02:34.989> is

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
side go down like that okay so this is

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.800 
side go down like that okay so this is
what<00:02:35.290> I'm<00:02:35.379> looking<00:02:35.680> like<00:02:35.890> now<00:02:36.269> so<00:02:37.269> let's<00:02:37.480> flip

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
what I'm looking like now so let's flip

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.320 
what I'm looking like now so let's flip
it<00:02:37.959> over<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.650> want<00:02:39.519> to<00:02:39.610> match<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:40.060> shapes

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
it over and you want to match the shapes

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.339 
it over and you want to match the shapes
that<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.660> already<00:02:40.989> have<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:42.480> see<00:02:43.480> how<00:02:43.959> I've

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
that you already have and see how I've

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.550 
that you already have and see how I've
got<00:02:44.610> kind<00:02:45.610> of<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:46.629> circle<00:02:47.049> section<00:02:47.410> right

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
got kind of the circle section right

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.210 
got kind of the circle section right
there<00:02:47.620> I'm<00:02:48.370> going<00:02:48.579> to<00:02:48.700> just<00:02:49.180> cut<00:02:49.659> out<00:02:49.840> that

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
there I'm going to just cut out that

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.720 
there I'm going to just cut out that
since<00:02:51.220> that's<00:02:51.549> kind<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.120> already<00:02:52.269> there<00:02:52.540> and

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
since that's kind of already there and

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.979 
since that's kind of already there and
that<00:02:54.730> will<00:02:54.849> help<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.150> keep<00:02:55.329> all<00:02:55.510> your<00:02:55.569> borders

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
like and just keep flipping it over be

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.839 
like and just keep flipping it over be
careful<00:03:11.590> not<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.859> cut<00:03:12.069> all<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.700> way<00:03:12.819> through

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
careful not to cut all the way through

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:20.130 
careful not to cut all the way through
to<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:17.079> other<00:03:17.200> side<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.730> just<00:03:19.030> cut<00:03:19.660> up<00:03:19.780> chunks

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
to the other side and just cut up chunks

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.229 
to the other side and just cut up chunks
you<00:03:20.470> can<00:03:20.620> cut<00:03:20.859> out<00:03:21.010> square<00:03:21.340> times<00:03:21.609> you<00:03:21.849> can<00:03:22.060> cut

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
you can cut out square times you can cut

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.559 
you can cut out square times you can cut
out<00:03:22.420> straight<00:03:22.780> jocks<00:03:23.079> or<00:03:24.989> curved<00:03:25.989> channels

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
out straight jocks or curved channels

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.120 
out straight jocks or curved channels
what<00:03:29.489> it's<00:03:30.489> hard<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.849> mess<00:03:31.090> up<00:03:31.329> a<00:03:31.829> snowflake<00:03:32.829> as

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
what it's hard to mess up a snowflake as

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.580 
what it's hard to mess up a snowflake as
long<00:03:33.340> as<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.639> would<00:03:34.079> don't<00:03:35.079> cut<00:03:35.319> all<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.530> way

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
long as you would don't cut all the way

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.129 
long as you would don't cut all the way
through<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.859> the<00:03:35.950> other<00:03:36.040> side<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.930> keep

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
through to the other side and you keep

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.309 
through to the other side and you keep
all<00:03:38.380> of<00:03:38.440> your<00:03:38.620> borders<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:40.269> same<00:03:40.450> with<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.810> the

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
all of your borders the same with it the

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.379 
all of your borders the same with it the
same<00:03:41.530> width<00:03:41.739> now<00:03:42.430> when<00:03:42.579> you<00:03:42.700> get<00:03:42.849> down<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.120> the

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
same width now when you get down to the

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.500 
same width now when you get down to the
very<00:03:43.569> end<00:03:43.870> sometimes<00:03:44.410> it's<00:03:44.590> hard<00:03:44.889> to<00:03:45.209> cut<00:03:46.209> into

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
very end sometimes it's hard to cut into

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.599 
very end sometimes it's hard to cut into
it<00:03:46.599> when<00:03:46.720> it's<00:03:46.840> folded<00:03:47.019> in<00:03:47.260> all<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:47.470> way<00:03:47.590> so<00:03:48.280> I

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
it when it's folded in all the way so I

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:57.230 
it when it's folded in all the way so I
like<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.299> unfold<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:52.889> then<00:03:54.630> cut<00:03:55.630> it

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
like to unfold it and then cut it

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.290 
like to unfold it and then cut it
so<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.990> can<00:03:58.200> fold<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:58.530> like<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.310> then<00:04:00.180> I'm

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
so it can fold it like that and then I'm

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.180 
so it can fold it like that and then I'm
just<00:04:00.360> going<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.750> cut<00:04:01.020> it<00:04:01.110> out<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:04.040> little<00:04:05.040> bit

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
just going to cut it out a little bit

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.700 
just going to cut it out a little bit
like<00:04:05.460> that<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.690> maybe<00:04:07.170> not<00:04:07.740> shut<00:04:07.920> off<00:04:09.260> so<00:04:10.260> well

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
like that and maybe not shut off so well

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.200 
like that and maybe not shut off so well
unfold<00:04:11.040> this<00:04:11.220> thing<00:04:11.490> and<00:04:11.640> see<00:04:11.700> what<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.060> looks

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210
