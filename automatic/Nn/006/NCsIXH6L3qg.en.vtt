00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello my name is logan and yes 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 many people I think should be a the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.360
 few tips and tricks for the easy 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.200
 in german so please here 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.679
 background you see two sniper 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.839
 gameplays on dog days so both are 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.980
 actually relatively reasonable 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.480
 certain points 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.109
 So basically I think 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.850
 very nice so far and yes so I say 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.279
 not long now just starter 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.990
 directly from the sentence I go 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.320
 the standard visier because I personally 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.780
 best think it's the most accurate 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.340
 and somehow it's standard like her 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.550
 in my opinion always one of the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:44.190
 best then I play that because then 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.690
 what the range increases I do not know 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.160
 just like that in German means white 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.829
 not possible in English it means stop 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.780
 is if you default on a left 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.890
 Crawls because we reach for you 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.410
 personally tend to be pretty 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.570
 helpful because the sniper is not always 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.850
 with a shot kilt and you so the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.559
 chance has a little too much of this 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.670
 to decrease 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.909
 I would definitely recommend 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.610
 to play that way and then use it 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.960
 i by jboss is that's actually 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.950
 it does not matter if he or empires tranter like that 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.380
 those things have to eat through protection 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.600
 shoot uses so i find im 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.570
 the same effect on the op 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.460
 is just more harm and has fulfilled 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.259
 more reach so it is actually 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.520
 completely irrelevant what you ended up with 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.710
 So yes, the first used to the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.799
 I would be able to set such abilities 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.630
 personally recommend intervention if 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.390
 one holds the advantage that one through 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.299
 can see walls when you're 30 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.920
 and that's pretty cool or me 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.570
 would play frontline if you because the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.680
 advantage that you had more to live 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.090
 is also not always completely for riding 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.320
 bad then so people even if 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.290
 Ballermann somehow not 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.970
 can shoot in time if 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.720
 then experience just a kick you have it ja 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.890
 in principle 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.930
 Bad stands one could also neighbor 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.070
 especially if you recognize it because then you 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.690
 with not every day as synonymous 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.130
 Radar is marked and find that 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.580
 Personally, I'm also pretty handy 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.470
 content you play defensive I have 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.720
 Simply put, I combine all three 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.870
 So videos is getting too hard now 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.000
 I would even go schopen with hertz copen 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.040
 that thermals like you recommend in the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.990
 moment I think that's too gray so 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.760
 you have your opponent in gray and 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.230
 generally everything in gray that is one 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.570
 a bit more to gray everything but it is 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.709
 definitely not bad one in the long run 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.410
 distance plays for you personally and 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.520
 then if you just play on reach 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.490
 then I would basically hold 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.620
 somehow recommend themselves behind boxes 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.360
 to hide or somehow it so 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.730
 to set up that you can not immediately on 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.490
 the first glance is visible that the 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.980
 opponents not the direct chance has a 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.780
 to meet but stop that to 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.160
 example, the head rausguckt or so are 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.720
 Hecking is actually too 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.580
 pretty handy yes so missing then 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.140
 To watch carefully should always take care 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.300
 you the right sensibility 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.430
 hiring is not easy 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.590
 his own his own 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.600
 to find the best sensibility 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.820
 I personally play fair three quarters 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.019
 the sensitivity for you personally am 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.730
 Best if you still hold the 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.810
 you do not have to control 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.299
 it's kind of full of games 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.549
 a bit annoying where it is 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.930
 so get used to it now if you too 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.370
 normal used since you have to now 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.640
 just do not put it up that's not 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.560
 really inevitable and important 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.970
 Hartz groups can also be just like that 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.670
 react quickly and then stop that 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.180
 opponent grows so directly no that is 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.110
 actually quite good if you can 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.330
 then I'll jump in now 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.040
 aggressive game so war is Schopen 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.350
 yes much more difficult than somehow 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.630
 Schopen the adversaries too hard and so on 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.690
 quick scoping difficult today here 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.470
 it's a bit of a bit different 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.750
 things are concerned then you have just that 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.230
 problem that 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.210
 the sniper will reload these 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.620
 animations where you just can not get away 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:14.240
 from the screen and there's just that 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:19.070
 possibility that as you know is talking 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.750
 yes, it is not even though it is said 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.120
 essential that you while the sniper 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.850
 still some strange seeburg 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.440
 makes running just pushes but me 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.210
 believe it is actually known that he 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.580
 holds aim shoot fast 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.840
 to each other and then stop running and after 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.670
 with a little practice you have it too 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.370
 someday the rhythm and then would have 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:41.120
 that actually works fine too 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.560
 I just see you see a got back 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.919
 nine gameplay but I think it changes 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.140
 not taken so fast so well 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.820
 back to war stop here 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.740
 Sometimes I even prefer one 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.150
 silencer because you also tried 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.280
 somehow if you are christa 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.870
 clips is also somehow quiet 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.190
 so that not all holding opponents immediately 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.800
 to avenge him because it is really hard here 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.880
 just let it grow and that's it 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.220
 a little sad because war schopen 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.440
 really has to stop the middle of the screens 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.669
 somehow develop a feeling for it and so 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.200
 I meet with problems opponents 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:17.169
 personally tracks copy very elaborate 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:20.479
 is that what it means is almost your china 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.590
 achieved but her you so you will meet 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.750
 Do not be right on the enemy 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.950
 on it and while the goal movement goes 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.120
 her the whole story another 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.560
 So, for example, that's enough 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.260
 a little bit to the right is like 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.050
 they just cool you but improve 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.640
 actually the whole game too 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.390
 essential and yes, especially for snipers 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.680
 Club side times quite popular it stops 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.750
 sachs also gives people the 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.460
 war costs stop directly without anything 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.330
 with dirt scoping it stop 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.100
 a matter of taste 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.750
 I personally prefer dirt schopen 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:52.220
 I still felt like that then secondary 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.800
 if I'm also pretty good 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.110
 important I personally like to use 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.230
 the ubs because it just mean 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.660
 favorite city machines have gone all the way 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.510
 Game is one could also be the shock 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.160
 take or the mini that comes just 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.910
 always on your own on your own 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.470
 preferences to 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.680
 so we are the ubs themselves makes them 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.390
 decided with jake ps with friends 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.010
 I believe now very high with the 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.450
 schumacher but easy opponents 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.630
 can lay and that is actually quite 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.630
 kind 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.200
 yes so the weapon I can on everyone 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.180
 case recommend and I have to visier 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.860
 because it is more so on the 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.270
 hip 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.500
 there you could still play but 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.300
 I do not like them there personally 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.390
 clearly the ubs I do 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.040
 personally go with the ubs for people 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.960
 they like to run fast then 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.760
 I want to recommend then dievini 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.680
 or just the shock but the show 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.630
 cation low for that to be 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:48.060
 actually a little rancid is not 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:50.010
 more so grenades also depends heavily on 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.560
 the situation or we do it 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.630
 So if you want to call more so 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.150
 dietrich gravel since the cyber 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:00.090
 clips and so on would play then 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.840
 I rather recommend the map too 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.370
 take or 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.670
 the flash card is what you do 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:07.980
 wanted and for hartz body for example 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.690
 would the fire grenade or later 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.400
 could have been very good recommender as soon as the 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.080
 just defensive play and it does not stop there 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.130
 are interested any gameplays 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.420
 To bring smoke grenade can also be quite 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.760
 you just have to be helpful 

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.210
 pay attention also because then will 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.810
 it shit a bit though 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.400
 basically the smoke is heard 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:31.890
 actually quite funny was a knowledge- 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:36.750
 and red yes what I would not recommend 

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:38.280
 the sticky is like the grenade 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.170
 I just do not like this game 

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.910
 cool because the first idea is the 

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.290
 explodes so uncontrollably and that 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.040
 sorry that's pretty shitty if you 

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.710
 then suddenly 

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.050
 but in sports then a grenade hangs 

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.750
 and then blow yourself up 

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:54.180
 it's just not that tingling 

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.680
 yes that was all first I too 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.240
 say but have any questions then
