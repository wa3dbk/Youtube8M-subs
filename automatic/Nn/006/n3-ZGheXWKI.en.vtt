see<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.869> finished<00:00:25.140> product<00:00:25.730> which<00:00:26.730> we're<00:00:26.880> not

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
see the finished product which we're not

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.839 
see the finished product which we're not
there<00:00:27.119> yet<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:28.140> we're<00:00:28.710> getting<00:00:28.800> close<00:00:29.160> we're

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
getting there I get the feeling that

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.000 
getting there I get the feeling that
this<00:00:40.710> was<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> B<00:00:41.250> model<00:00:42.320> because<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.890> are

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
this was the B model because we are

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.270 
this was the B model because we are
getting<00:00:44.309> real<00:00:44.700> close<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.329> finishing<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.930> and

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
getting real close to finishing it and

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.060 
getting real close to finishing it and
look<00:00:47.280> at<00:00:47.370> all<00:00:47.460> these<00:00:47.579> pieces<00:00:47.789> left<00:00:48.800> way<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> see

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
look at all these pieces left way to see

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.439 
look at all these pieces left way to see
them<00:00:50.129> all<00:00:52.190> yeah<00:00:53.219> yes<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.730> can

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.119 

there's<00:00:57.449> still<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.870> bunch<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.320> pieces<00:00:58.469> left<00:00:58.829> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
there's still a bunch of pieces left and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.200 
there's still a bunch of pieces left and
world's<00:01:00.120> done<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:01.489> hear<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> trash<00:01:02.850> chopper

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
world's done I hear the trash chopper

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.570 
world's done I hear the trash chopper
which<00:01:03.480> I'm<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.899> next<00:01:04.140> has<00:01:07.580> almost

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
which I'm going to do next has almost

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.770 
which I'm going to do next has almost
the<00:01:09.860> exact<00:01:10.860> same<00:01:11.040> amount<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.570> extra<00:01:12.570> pieces

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the exact same amount of extra pieces

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.120 
the exact same amount of extra pieces
left<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.740> uses<00:01:15.320> if<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.409> use<00:01:16.560> those<00:01:16.710> 400

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
left so it uses if you use those 400

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.429 
left so it uses if you use those 400
pieces<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.880> model<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.570> uses<00:01:18.930> 400<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
pieces in the a model it uses 400 and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.190 
pieces in the a model it uses 400 and
the<00:01:19.500> B<00:01:19.619> model<00:01:21.560> that<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.939> efficiency<00:01:24.049> unless<00:01:25.049> I

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the B model that is efficiency unless I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.950 
the B model that is efficiency unless I
just<00:01:25.229> randomly<00:01:25.799> throw<00:01:25.920> pieces<00:01:26.960> everywhere

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
just randomly throw pieces everywhere

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.899 
just randomly throw pieces everywhere
and<00:01:28.799> then<00:01:29.100> that's<00:01:29.280> cheating

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
and then that's cheating

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.749 
and then that's cheating
if<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.659> don't<00:01:30.810> cheat<00:01:34.040> that's<00:01:35.040> not<00:01:35.220> cheating<00:01:35.430> I

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
if you don't cheat that's not cheating I

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.690 
if you don't cheat that's not cheating I
do<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.270> all<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.420> time

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
do that all the time

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.910 
do that all the time
well<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> model<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.479> put<00:01:39.659> together

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
well I have a model that I put together

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.830 
well I have a model that I put together
