 ineba neurology is a branch of the 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.579
 biology that has been born in recent years 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.219
 very strongly and as a necessity already 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.660
 that many neurological patients 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.379
 present symptoms and 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.060
 complications of the urinary system that 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.500
 represent important deteriorations in the 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.270
 quality of life these patients when 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.390
 quality questionnaires are made 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.789
 life you see the impact so important that 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.280
 has the urinary system and the 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.470
 sexuality in the lives of these patients 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.420
 the ball can contact us for a 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.689
 demotivation due to lack of sexual desire 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.340
 or also being the desire for 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.109
 Erection disorders 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.479
 for disorders in ejaculation 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.280
 neurological diseases can affect 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.649
 sexuality not only for a 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.420
 physical problem but in many cases by 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.479
 the emotional charge they produce 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.469
 really the psychological impact of 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.860
 diagnosis of a disease 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:47.259
 neurological on the patient and on the 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.850
 eventual couple and the means in which the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.189
 patient lives will be very important 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.840
 us in the anamnesis what we do 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.700
 is to talk about the sexual history of 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.170
 patient and the patient before the report 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.939
 of the diagnosis of neurological form 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.849
 has a sexual history 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.950
 the couple got divorced or they have a 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:05.079
 previous sexual life we ​​shall 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.470
 evaluate it and on top of that good for 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.989
 Of course, like any medical act, we will go to 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.239
 the neurological patient itself to others 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.530
 concomitant diseases medications 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.410
 I'm taking or I can be 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.540
 affecting your sex life and between 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.519
 main organic causes that can 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.200
 produce ED 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.290
 find diabetes hypertension 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.269
 arterial cardiovascular disease or 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.640
 the elevated cholesterol and in the case 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.900
 of neurological patients if 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.880
 we try to work on that 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.560
 self-esteem trying to get them back 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.810
 to the sex life they had before 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.400
 tried to demystify because 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.200
 generally the myths are that the 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.210
 external patients neurological patients 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.760
 or for some patients with 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.650
 disabilities are a sexed or that 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.320
 it is not important that the important thing is 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.540
 another thing and really are patients that 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.090
 they have feelings that need love 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.370
 that they have wishes that they have 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.310
 fantasies and therefore it is important 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.800
 to recover then the dysfunction today 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.570
 Erectile is treatable at any age yet 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.370
 in patients with diseases 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.040
 neurological of course that the 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.170
 pharmacological treatment today is great 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.990
 fundamentally helps the derivatives 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.390
 we started the servers of the 5 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.730
 phosphodiesterase leads sildenafil 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.060
 vardenafil and tadalafil which is the 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.700
 known that I have come to help us 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.350
 very much especially the patients with 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.550
 erectile dysfunction of neurological origin 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.290
 they cover young boys who have a 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.330
 difficulty to lengthen them to achieve 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.730
 erection due to high hand 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.350
 logical euro and that really has a 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.010
 very good response 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.650
 the end of nafin multiple sclerosis 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.260
 parkinson's disease epilepsy 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.730
 and the cerebrovascular attacks 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.580
 frequent cause dysfunctions 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.740
 but more and more men 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.440
 are encouraged to ask for help to have a 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.900
 full sexual life the important thing is that 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.480
 we are going to have to confront the patient 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.150
 with your current diagnosis with your 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.090
 expectations with your wishes and 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.680
 fundamentally with recovering those 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.680
 desire to return to the sexual life
