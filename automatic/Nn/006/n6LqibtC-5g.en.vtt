operating<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.200> shotgun<00:00:04.740> mic<00:00:04.890> on<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.130> boom<00:00:05.370> pole

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
operating the shotgun mic on a boom pole

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.030 
operating the shotgun mic on a boom pole
is<00:00:05.850> also<00:00:06.330> very<00:00:06.569> challenging<00:00:07.140> not<00:00:07.559> only

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
is also very challenging not only

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.560 
is also very challenging not only
because<00:00:08.340> it<00:00:08.460> requires<00:00:08.790> holding<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.360> pole

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
because it requires holding the pole

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.360 
because it requires holding the pole
over<00:00:09.809> your<00:00:10.080> head<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:10.500> extended<00:00:10.980> periods<00:00:11.309> of

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
over your head for extended periods of

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.940 
over your head for extended periods of
time<00:00:11.429> while<00:00:11.940> keeping<00:00:12.540> absolutely<00:00:13.110> still<00:00:13.410> but

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
time while keeping absolutely still but

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.589 
time while keeping absolutely still but
also<00:00:14.160> because<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.700> requires<00:00:15.059> intense

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
also because it requires intense

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.440 
also because it requires intense
concentration<00:00:15.749> and<00:00:16.650> focus<00:00:17.370> on<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.880> scene<00:00:18.150> now

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
concentration and focus on the scene now

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.720 
concentration and focus on the scene now
while<00:00:19.260> it's<00:00:19.410> true<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.859> shotgun<00:00:20.160> mic<00:00:20.490> can

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
while it's true that a shotgun mic can

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.519 
while it's true that a shotgun mic can
record<00:00:21.090> sounds<00:00:21.420> from<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.630> distance<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
record sounds from a distance the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.109 
record sounds from a distance the
quality<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.099> the<00:00:23.189> sound<00:00:23.400> does<00:00:23.760> diminish

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
quality of the sound does diminish

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.240 
quality of the sound does diminish
significantly<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.410> farther<00:00:25.769> away<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.070> are

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
significantly the farther away you are

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.669 
significantly the farther away you are
so<00:00:27.000> your<00:00:27.150> first<00:00:27.420> goal<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.810> still<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.140> get<00:00:28.470> that

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:28.679 
so your first goal is still to get that

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.710 
so your first goal is still to get that
mic<00:00:28.859> as<00:00:29.039> close<00:00:29.339> as<00:00:29.519> possible<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.269> subjects

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
mic as close as possible to the subjects

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.810 
mic as close as possible to the subjects
mouth<00:00:30.960> you'll<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.830> able<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.160> get<00:00:32.310> a<00:00:32.340> lot<00:00:32.550> closer

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
mouth you'll be able to get a lot closer

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.760 
mouth you'll be able to get a lot closer
during<00:00:33.060> close-ups<00:00:33.690> then<00:00:33.900> during<00:00:34.050> wide<00:00:34.380> shots

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
during close-ups then during wide shots

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.920 
during close-ups then during wide shots
and<00:00:35.010> that's<00:00:35.100> okay<00:00:35.610> your<00:00:36.180> editors<00:00:36.600> likely

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and that's okay your editors likely

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.690 
and that's okay your editors likely
aware<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.410> fact<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.280> she's<00:00:38.490> going<00:00:38.640> to

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
aware of that fact and so she's going to

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.220 
aware of that fact and so she's going to
try<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.060> use<00:00:39.150> the<00:00:39.330> audio<00:00:39.480> from<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.810> close-ups

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
try and use the audio from the close-ups

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.410 
try and use the audio from the close-ups
whenever<00:00:40.530> possible<00:00:40.800> however<00:00:41.640> within<00:00:42.060> a<00:00:42.180> give

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
whenever possible however within a give

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.090 
whenever possible however within a give
and<00:00:42.540> take<00:00:42.630> it's<00:00:43.200> important<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.920> keep

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and take it's important that you keep

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.040 
and take it's important that you keep
the<00:00:44.280> mic<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.490> constant<00:00:45.240> distance<00:00:45.660> from<00:00:45.900> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the mic a constant distance from the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.320 
the mic a constant distance from the
subject<00:00:46.310> otherwise<00:00:47.310> the<00:00:47.550> sound<00:00:47.790> quality<00:00:48.300> and

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
subject otherwise the sound quality and

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.150 
subject otherwise the sound quality and
the<00:00:48.450> volume<00:00:48.900> are<00:00:49.080> gonna<00:00:49.380> vary<00:00:49.770> over<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the volume are gonna vary over the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.270 
the volume are gonna vary over the
course<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> shot<00:00:50.940> which<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.750> undesirable

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
course of the shot which is undesirable

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.890 
course of the shot which is undesirable
also<00:00:53.280> remember<00:00:53.790> that<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.090> mic<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.480> highly

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
also remember that the mic is highly

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.110 
also remember that the mic is highly
directional<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.950> need<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.280> point<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.640> tip<00:00:56.940> of

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
directional you need to point the tip of

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.060 
directional you need to point the tip of
the<00:00:57.240> mic<00:00:57.480> towards<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.200> mouth<00:00:58.470> of<00:00:58.770> whoever

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the mic towards the mouth of whoever

it's such great news and this is really
where<00:01:32.939> things<00:01:33.119> get<00:01:33.299> tricky<00:01:33.359> because<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.289> most

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:34.499 
where things get tricky because in most

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:36.139 
where things get tricky because in most
scenes<00:01:34.799> more<00:01:35.100> than<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.429> person<00:01:35.819> is<00:01:35.939> talking

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
scenes more than one person is talking

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.029 
scenes more than one person is talking
which<00:01:36.810> means<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.289> to<00:01:37.319> move<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.890> mic

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
which means you have to move the mic

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.950 
which means you have to move the mic
from<00:01:38.219> one<00:01:38.429> person<00:01:38.789> or<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.909> other<00:01:38.999> during<00:01:39.659> the

during<00:04:12.629> the<00:04:12.900> scene<00:04:13.139> you<00:04:13.620> can<00:04:13.799> use<00:04:13.979> that<00:04:14.189> line

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
during the scene you can use that line

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.339 
during the scene you can use that line
as<00:04:14.819> a<00:04:14.849> guide<00:04:14.939> for<00:04:15.150> where<00:04:15.659> your<00:04:15.810> mic<00:04:16.019> should<00:04:16.259> be
