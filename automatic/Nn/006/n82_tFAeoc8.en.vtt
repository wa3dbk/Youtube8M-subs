good<00:01:56.020> sign<00:01:56.319> if<00:01:56.560> you<00:01:56.679> remember<00:01:57.129> when<00:01:57.280> Vista<00:01:57.819> was

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599

that's<00:02:05.770> a<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.220> good<00:02:06.670> sign<00:02:06.970> that<00:02:07.319> windows<00:02:08.319> seven

question is is it vista just with a

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.360 
question is is it vista just with a
different<00:04:56.410> some<00:04:57.410> tweaks<00:04:57.650> here<00:04:57.860> and<00:04:57.920> there<00:04:58.040> i

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
different some tweaks here and there i

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.190 
different some tweaks here and there i
don't<00:04:58.910> think<00:04:59.120> so<00:04:59.210> i<00:04:59.360> think<00:04:59.540> there's<00:04:59.900> going<00:05:00.110> to

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
don't think so i think there's going to

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
don't think so i think there's going to
be<00:05:00.260> some<00:05:01.060> some<00:05:02.290> substantial<00:05:03.290> changes<00:05:03.950> in

let's get microsoft a chance to get the

public<00:05:23.930> beta<00:05:24.110> i<00:05:24.290> think<00:05:24.620> that's<00:05:24.860> going<00:05:25.070> to<00:05:25.130> be

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
public beta i think that's going to be

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.460 
public beta i think that's going to be
in<00:05:25.910> my<00:05:26.120> opinion<00:05:26.420> the<00:05:26.690> best<00:05:26.870> time<00:05:27.200> to<00:05:27.410> start

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
in my opinion the best time to start

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.130 
in my opinion the best time to start
really<00:05:27.920> comparing<00:05:28.610> windows<00:05:29.360> 7<00:05:29.810> de<00:05:29.900> vista

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
really comparing windows 7 de vista

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.500 
really comparing windows 7 de vista
right<00:05:30.770> now<00:05:30.950> i<00:05:31.010> think<00:05:31.130> that<00:05:31.610> this<00:05:31.790> is<00:05:32.090> kind<00:05:32.420> of

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
right now i think that this is kind of

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.470 
right now i think that this is kind of
an<00:05:32.660> unfair<00:05:33.490> scenario<00:05:34.490> bak<00:05:34.700> i<00:05:34.970> don't<00:05:35.210> know<00:05:35.270> i

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
an unfair scenario bak i don't know i

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.560 
an unfair scenario bak i don't know i
could<00:05:35.810> be<00:05:35.930> wrong<00:05:35.960> I<00:05:36.380> could<00:05:37.010> be<00:05:37.100> wrong<00:05:37.130> it<00:05:37.880> may

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
could be wrong I could be wrong it may

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.050 
could be wrong I could be wrong it may
very<00:05:38.600> well<00:05:39.080> be<00:05:39.440> as<00:05:39.650> big<00:05:39.920> a<00:05:39.950> turkey<00:05:40.460> as<00:05:40.580> vistas

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
very well be as big a turkey as vistas
