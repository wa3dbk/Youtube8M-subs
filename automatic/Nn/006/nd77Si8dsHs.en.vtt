00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.560 
sort of a pungent musky taste which is
weird<00:02:59.250> and<00:03:00.250> then<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.400> eases<00:03:00.910> back<00:03:01.180> into<00:03:01.450> the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
weird and then it eases back into the

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.740 
weird and then it eases back into the
creamsicle<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.230> think<00:03:02.709> what<00:03:02.800> it<00:03:02.890> is<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:04.540> the

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
creamsicle I think what it is the the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.000 
creamsicle I think what it is the the
marshmallows<00:03:05.320> harbor<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.100> taste<00:03:06.340> no<00:03:07.830> no<00:03:08.830> no

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
marshmallows harbor the taste no no no

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.350 
marshmallows harbor the taste no no no
the<00:03:09.130> sternum<00:03:09.430> pieces<00:03:09.730> have<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.940> taste<00:03:10.150> in

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
the sternum pieces have the taste in

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.820 
the sternum pieces have the taste in
them<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.600> marshmallows<00:03:11.050> kind<00:03:11.230> of<00:03:11.290> accent<00:03:11.709> it

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
them the marshmallows kind of accent it

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.040 
them the marshmallows kind of accent it
a<00:03:11.920> little<00:03:12.040> bit<00:03:12.250> but<00:03:13.120> depending<00:03:13.540> on<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.720> mix<00:03:13.900> of

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
a little bit but depending on the mix of

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.979 
a little bit but depending on the mix of
marshmallow<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.709> cereal<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.250> end<00:03:15.459> up<00:03:15.580> with

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
marshmallow and cereal you end up with

orange baked goods are daring I mean I

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.030 
orange baked goods are daring I mean I
mean<00:05:25.450> they're<00:05:25.600> not<00:05:25.720> daring<00:05:26.170> flavor-wise<00:05:26.590> but

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
mean they're not daring flavor-wise but

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.730 
mean they're not daring flavor-wise but
their<00:05:27.160> daring<00:05:27.520> from<00:05:27.730> a<00:05:28.170> attempt<00:05:29.170> standpoint

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
their daring from a attempt standpoint

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.920 
their daring from a attempt standpoint
to<00:05:30.100> get<00:05:30.250> them<00:05:30.340> really<00:05:30.610> right<00:05:30.970> you<00:05:31.180> have<00:05:31.330> to<00:05:31.510> hit

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
to get them really right you have to hit

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.040

some<00:05:32.230> notes<00:05:32.260> in<00:05:32.980> just<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.060> right<00:05:34.120> places<00:05:34.450> and
