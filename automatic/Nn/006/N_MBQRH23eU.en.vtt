00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
really cool idea it's basically a

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.320 
really cool idea it's basically a
variation<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.560> half<00:00:25.740> time<00:00:25.949> shuffle<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.670> you

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
variation of a half time shuffle as you

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.910 
variation of a half time shuffle as you
guys<00:00:27.480> know<00:00:27.539> when<00:00:27.840> playing<00:00:27.990> halftime<00:00:28.439> shuffles

guys know when playing halftime shuffles
eighth<00:00:29.130> note<00:00:29.580> triplets<00:00:30.029> become<00:00:30.330> sixteenth

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
eighth note triplets become sixteenth

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.930 
eighth note triplets become sixteenth
note<00:00:31.019> triplets<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:32.130> what<00:00:32.250> I'll<00:00:32.340> do<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.550> take<00:00:32.910> a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
note triplets so what I'll do is take a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.389 
note triplets so what I'll do is take a
sixteenth<00:00:33.420> note<00:00:33.630> triplet<00:00:33.989> pattern<00:00:34.380> which<00:00:35.250> is

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
sixteenth note triplet pattern which is

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.729 
sixteenth note triplet pattern which is
basically<00:00:35.820> playing<00:00:36.690> right<00:00:37.050> left<00:00:37.380> left<00:00:37.469> right

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
basically playing right left left right

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.799 
basically playing right left left right
left<00:00:37.890> left<00:00:38.219> right<00:00:38.460> left<00:00:38.610> left<00:00:38.940> continuously

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
left left right left left continuously

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:54.650 
left left right left left continuously
in<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.410> way<00:00:53.000> okay<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.059> that's<00:00:54.390> fairly

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
in this way okay so that's fairly

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.479 
in this way okay so that's fairly
well-known<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.350> played<00:00:55.500> by<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> lot<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.039> dramas

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
well-known and played by a lot of dramas

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.119 
well-known and played by a lot of dramas
now<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> whole<00:00:57.750> idea<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.800> you

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
now the whole idea of this is that you

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.369 
now the whole idea of this is that you
start<00:00:59.520> playing<00:00:59.760> different<00:01:00.359> based<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.960> buttons

start playing different based on buttons

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.680 
start playing different based on buttons
on<00:01:01.590> top<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.160> without<00:01:03.000> changing<00:01:03.570> with

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
on top of that without changing with

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.690 
on top of that without changing with
your<00:01:03.809> hands<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.170> playing<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:05.339> what<00:01:05.430> I'll<00:01:05.580> do

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
you do this first of all using the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.280 
you do this first of all using the
counting<00:01:10.770> 1<00:01:11.159> triplet<00:01:11.640> 2<00:01:11.760> triplet<00:01:11.970> 3<00:01:12.510> triplet<00:01:12.810> 4

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
counting 1 triplet 2 triplet 3 triplet 4

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.080 
counting 1 triplet 2 triplet 3 triplet 4
triplet<00:01:13.560> we're<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.670> play<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.820> bass

drum on beats one two three and four
sounds<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.680> one

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.220 

then<00:01:33.550> we<00:01:33.670> play<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:33.880> bass<00:01:34.090> one<00:01:34.300> on<00:01:34.390> every<00:01:34.540> tree

then we play the bass one on every tree

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:51.180 
then we play the bass one on every tree
so<00:01:35.860> one<00:01:36.670> two<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:50.140> then<00:01:50.440> we<00:01:50.530> better<00:01:50.710> based<00:01:50.980> on

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
so one two and then we better based on

so one two and then we better based on
every<00:01:51.610> play<00:01:52.180> so<00:01:52.660> one<00:01:53.470> a<00:02:08.490> good<00:02:09.490> exercise<00:02:09.760> is<00:02:10.240> to

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
every play so one a good exercise is to

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.060 
every play so one a good exercise is to
switch<00:02:10.660> straight<00:02:11.020> from<00:02:11.260> one<00:02:11.440> way<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.680> another
