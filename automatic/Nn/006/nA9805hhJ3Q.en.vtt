to do is choose any map I'm playing on
Stratis<00:00:12.860> and<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:14.190> want<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.490> double<00:00:14.820> click<00:00:15.619> and

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
Stratis and you want to double click and

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.400 
Stratis and you want to double click and
go<00:00:17.010> up<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.029> I'll<00:00:18.180> go<00:00:18.359> blue<00:00:18.600> for<00:00:18.869> for<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.140> one

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
go up and I'll go blue for for this one

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.250 
go up and I'll go blue for for this one
it's<00:00:19.710> important<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:21.320> go<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:23.630> man<00:00:24.630> or

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
it's important that you go to man or

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.029 
it's important that you go to man or
just<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.340> go<00:00:26.490> as<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> UAV<00:00:27.300> operator

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
just you have to go as a UAV operator

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.160 
just you have to go as a UAV operator
that's<00:00:29.039> important

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
that's important

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:38.420 
that's important
and<00:00:31.170> then<00:00:31.380> I'll<00:00:31.470> spawn<00:00:31.769> him<00:00:33.200> what<00:00:37.219> okay

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
and then I'll spawn him what okay

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.860 
and then I'll spawn him what okay
he's<00:00:38.820> my<00:00:39.000> player<00:00:39.270> there<00:00:39.510> we<00:00:39.600> go<00:00:41.210> okay<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.510> now

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
he's my player there we go okay and now

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.279 
he's my player there we go okay and now
will<00:00:43.050> spawn<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> UAV<00:00:43.770> just<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.260> I'll<00:00:46.260> make

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
will spawn a UAV just here and I'll make

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.350 
will spawn a UAV just here and I'll make
it<00:00:46.590> blue<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.250> well<00:00:47.489> that's<00:00:47.850> important

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
it blue for as well that's important

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.360 
it blue for as well that's important
doesn't<00:00:48.840> work<00:00:49.079> if<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.440> go<00:00:49.559> empty<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.129> need<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
doesn't work if you go empty you need to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.439 
doesn't work if you go empty you need to
choose<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:51.090> blue<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:52.140> one<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:53.180> we've<00:00:54.180> got<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
choose a blue for one so we've got the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.180 
choose a blue for one so we've got the
gray<00:00:54.660> Hawk<00:00:57.469> alright<00:01:00.559> I'll<00:01:01.559> spin<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.010> around

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
gray Hawk alright I'll spin this around

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.320 
gray Hawk alright I'll spin this around
though<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:03.030> facing<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.629> other<00:01:03.719> way

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
though so it's facing the other way

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.760 
though so it's facing the other way
alright<00:01:06.330> there<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.510> go<00:01:06.750> now<00:01:07.260> preview<00:01:09.770> yeah

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
alright there we go now preview yeah

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.289 
alright there we go now preview yeah
it's<00:01:10.920> good<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.280> spawn<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> end<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
it's good to spawn it on the end of the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.830 
it's good to spawn it on the end of the
runway<00:01:12.479> here<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.080> then<00:01:13.260> because<00:01:14.100> they

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
runway here so then because they

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.149 
runway here so then because they
automatically<00:01:15.840> taxi<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> runway<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.009> take

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
automatically taxi to a runway and take

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.950 
automatically taxi to a runway and take
off<00:01:17.369> if<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.970> right<00:01:18.090> here<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.780> will<00:01:18.869> be

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
off if you do it right here that will be

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.960 
off if you do it right here that will be
the<00:01:19.049> quickest<00:01:19.350> way<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.590> doing<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.820> want

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the quickest way of doing it so you want

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.649 
the quickest way of doing it so you want
to<00:01:21.030> run<00:01:21.119> up<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.250> go<00:01:23.250> connect<00:01:24.150> terminal

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
to run up to it and go connect terminal

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.020 
to run up to it and go connect terminal
terminal<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.470> UAV<00:01:26.869> go<00:01:27.869> wherever<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.290> want

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
terminal to UAV go wherever you want

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.760 
terminal to UAV go wherever you want
let's<00:01:30.030> go<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:31.970> take<00:01:32.970> will<00:01:33.930> go<00:01:34.049> open<00:01:34.409> UAV

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
let's go to here take will go open UAV

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.609 
let's go to here take will go open UAV
terminal<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.610> now<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.689> see<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:37.470> you've

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
terminal and now we can see here you've

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.039 
terminal and now we can see here you've
got<00:01:37.770> camera<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.790> got<00:01:39.150> detailed<00:01:39.570> speed

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
got camera and it's got detailed speed

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.630 
got camera and it's got detailed speed
altitude<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.340> position<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.710> now<00:01:44.460> we'll

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
altitude and the position and now we'll

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.330 
altitude and the position and now we'll
give<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.090> some<00:01:45.470> instructions<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.040> left

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
give it some instructions so if I left

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.170 
give it some instructions so if I left
click<00:01:47.689> let's<00:01:48.689> say<00:01:48.930> over<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.200> at<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:50.509> GM<00:01:51.509> arena

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
click let's say over here at a GM arena

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.230 
click let's say over here at a GM arena
it's<00:01:54.180> starting<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.780> now<00:01:55.189> if<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.399> right<00:01:56.640> click<00:01:56.670> I

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
it's starting up now if I right click I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.179 
it's starting up now if I right click I
can<00:01:57.450> tell<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.810> what<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.049> want<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.409> do<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.070> I'll

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
can tell it what I want it to do so I'll

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.630 
can tell it what I want it to do so I'll
do<00:02:01.219> hold<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:04.110> I'll<00:02:04.290> do<00:02:04.500> never<00:02:04.740> fire<00:02:05.100> and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
do hold and I'll do never fire and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.240 
do hold and I'll do never fire and
altitude<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:06.960> low<00:02:07.140> profile<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:07.920> now<00:02:08.069> it's

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
altitude can be low profile so now it's

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.729 
altitude can be low profile so now it's
automatically<00:02:08.670> going<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.000> go<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.270> take<00:02:09.450> off

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
automatically going to go and take off

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.860 
automatically going to go and take off
that's<00:02:10.739> where<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.190> see

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.540 

she's<00:02:15.870> off<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:19.310> she'll<00:02:20.310> follow<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:20.850> path<00:02:21.120> so

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
she's off and she'll follow that path so

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.130 
she's off and she'll follow that path so
this<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:23.730> all<00:02:23.910> automated<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:24.870> tell<00:02:24.990> like

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
this is all automated you just tell like

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.290 
this is all automated you just tell like
what<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.350> do<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.710> it'll<00:02:25.890> go<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.130> do<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.310> if<00:02:27.090> it

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
what to do and it'll go and do it if it

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.750 
what to do and it'll go and do it if it
can<00:02:27.570> find<00:02:28.080> targets<00:02:28.680> like<00:02:28.830> vehicles<00:02:29.190> the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
can find targets like vehicles the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.240 
can find targets like vehicles the
designator<00:02:30.300> will<00:02:30.570> spot<00:02:30.900> them<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.290> fire<00:02:32.010> up

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
designator will spot them and fire up

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.380 
designator will spot them and fire up
them<00:02:32.400> if<00:02:32.490> you<00:02:32.580> tell<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.860> here's<00:02:35.700> to

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
them if you tell it to and here's to

camera showing you where it is and I can

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.840 
camera showing you where it is and I can
go<00:02:38.700> take<00:02:39.209> control<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.950> now<00:02:41.100> I'm<00:02:41.250> flying<00:02:41.580> it

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
go take control and now I'm flying it

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:55.160 
go take control and now I'm flying it
and<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:46.050> can<00:02:46.230> fly<00:02:46.440> this<00:02:46.500> or<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.950> want<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.940> yeah

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.550 

it<00:02:56.170> only<00:02:56.290> comes<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.800> six<00:02:57.660> missiles<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:59.170> then

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
it only comes the six missiles and then

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.460 
it only comes the six missiles and then
you've<00:02:59.710> just<00:02:59.740> got<00:03:00.040> tons<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.550> flares<00:03:01.290> G<00:03:02.290> to

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
you've just got tons of flares G to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.890 
you've just got tons of flares G to
deploy<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:02.890> flares<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.580> left-click<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.570> fire

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
deploy the flares and left-click to fire

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.470 
deploy the flares and left-click to fire
the<00:03:05.020> missiles<00:03:05.380> you<00:03:05.740> can<00:03:06.460> then<00:03:06.640> go<00:03:06.850> on<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:09.480> other

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
the missiles you can then go on to other

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.140 
the missiles you can then go on to other
turret<00:03:10.870> controls<00:03:11.370> which<00:03:12.370> is<00:03:12.580> more<00:03:12.790> like<00:03:13.120> a

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
turret controls which is more like a

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.620 
turret controls which is more like a
spotting<00:03:13.660> thing<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:14.080> will<00:03:14.170> give<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.380> a<00:03:14.440> range

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
spotting thing it will give you a range

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.660 
spotting thing it will give you a range
and<00:03:16.630> now<00:03:16.870> because<00:03:17.410> I've<00:03:17.680> taken<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.280> turret

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
and now because I've taken to the turret

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.700 
and now because I've taken to the turret
the<00:03:18.820> autopilot<00:03:19.300> has<00:03:19.600> taken<00:03:20.020> over<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.410> is<00:03:20.500> now

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
the autopilot has taken over and is now

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.020 
the autopilot has taken over and is now
flying<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.250> course<00:03:21.520> that<00:03:22.030> I<00:03:22.060> gave<00:03:22.390> it<00:03:22.570> I<00:03:24.030> can

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
flying the course that I gave it I can

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.420 
flying the course that I gave it I can
go<00:03:25.150> release<00:03:25.600> UAV<00:03:26.230> controls<00:03:26.710> and<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.190> will<00:03:27.310> go

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
go release UAV controls and it will go

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.140 
go release UAV controls and it will go
back<00:03:27.640> here<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.390> continue<00:03:29.370> circling<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.730> area

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
back here and continue circling the area

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.360 
back here and continue circling the area
where<00:03:31.330> I<00:03:31.360> told<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:31.810> go<00:03:32.880> see<00:03:33.880> right<00:03:34.120> here<00:03:35.370> and

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
where I told it to go see right here and

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.010 
where I told it to go see right here and
then<00:03:36.520> if<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:36.760> want<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.060> get<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.270> to<00:03:37.420> land<00:03:38.160> I'll<00:03:39.160> go

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
then if I want to get it to land I'll go

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.020 
then if I want to get it to land I'll go
take<00:03:41.020> controls<00:03:42.330> Landing<00:03:43.330> autopilot<00:03:43.810> and

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
take controls Landing autopilot and

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.250 
take controls Landing autopilot and
it'll<00:03:46.030> bring<00:03:46.210> it<00:03:46.330> down<00:03:46.540> I'm<00:03:46.870> not<00:03:46.990> doing

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
it'll bring it down I'm not doing

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.600 
it'll bring it down I'm not doing
anything<00:03:47.440> now<00:03:47.740> bring<00:03:48.250> it<00:03:48.340> down<00:03:48.370> itself<00:03:50.610> it

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
anything now bring it down itself it

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.370 
anything now bring it down itself it
doesn't<00:03:52.060> look<00:03:52.210> so<00:03:52.390> good<00:03:52.600> but<00:03:52.960> I<00:03:52.990> think<00:03:53.260> it's

doesn't look so good but I think it's

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.820 
doesn't look so good but I think it's
alright<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:53.890> knows<00:03:54.040> what<00:03:54.220> it's<00:03:54.370> doing<00:03:55.830> and

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
alright it knows what it's doing and
