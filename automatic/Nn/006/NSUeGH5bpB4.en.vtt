00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
this book together it's a lot like the

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.379 
this book together it's a lot like the
journey<00:00:06.600> book<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:07.550> hybrid<00:00:08.550> kit<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:08.970> we<00:00:09.120> did

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
journey book and hybrid kit that we did

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.919 
journey book and hybrid kit that we did
a<00:00:09.719> couple<00:00:10.290> weeks<00:00:10.559> ago<00:00:10.710> um<00:00:11.330> but<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.389> little<00:00:12.809> bit

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
a couple weeks ago um but a little bit

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.230 
a couple weeks ago um but a little bit
trickier<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:13.950> here<00:00:14.280> are<00:00:14.490> your<00:00:14.639> covers<00:00:15.059> you're

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
trickier so here are your covers you're

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.519 
trickier so here are your covers you're
going<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.420> cut<00:00:15.540> all<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.839> stuff<00:00:16.109> out<00:00:16.289> and

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
going to cut all this stuff out and

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.960 
going to cut all this stuff out and
these<00:00:16.890> two<00:00:17.130> extra<00:00:17.430> pieces<00:00:17.609> you're<00:00:17.940> really

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
these two extra pieces you're really

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.210 
these two extra pieces you're really
only<00:00:18.240> going<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.570> use<00:00:18.600> one<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.039> to

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
only going to use one and that is to

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.599 
only going to use one and that is to
connect<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:21.000> cover<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.380> cover<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.580> that

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
connect this cover to this cover so that

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.040 
connect this cover to this cover so that
you<00:00:23.820> have<00:00:24.000> something<00:00:24.420> like<00:00:25.220> this<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.490> the

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
you have something like this on the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.179 
you have something like this on the
binding<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.260> it's<00:00:28.410> kind<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.680> going<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.920> act<00:00:29.039> as

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
binding so it's kind of going to act as

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.630 
binding so it's kind of going to act as
your<00:00:29.310> binding<00:00:29.929> and<00:00:31.099> so<00:00:32.099> that's<00:00:32.219> really<00:00:32.399> easy

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
your binding and so that's really easy

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.400 
your binding and so that's really easy
just<00:00:33.000> glue<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.239> together<00:00:33.420> basically<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
just glue it together basically and

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.780 
just glue it together basically and
you're<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.280> cut<00:00:35.399> out<00:00:35.489> all<00:00:35.520> your

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
you're going to cut out all your

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.110 
you're going to cut out all your
envelope<00:00:36.120> templates<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.630> look<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:36.899> this

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
envelope templates that look like this

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.100 
envelope templates that look like this
and<00:00:39.120> what<00:00:39.420> you're<00:00:39.540> going<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.719> do<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.020> this

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
and what you're going to do that this

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.600 
and what you're going to do that this
time<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.620> you're<00:00:40.770> going<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> make<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.309> your

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
time is you're going to make all of your

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.750 
time is you're going to make all of your
folds<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:43.190> I'm<00:00:44.190> not<00:00:44.579> using<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:45.379> bone<00:00:46.379> fold<00:00:46.760> like

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
folds and I'm not using a bone fold like

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.139 
folds and I'm not using a bone fold like
a<00:00:47.879> normally<00:00:48.360> would<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:49.590> probably<00:00:50.309> should<00:00:53.149> and

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
a normally would it probably should and

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.979 
a normally would it probably should and
I<00:00:54.210> pulled<00:00:54.899> over<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.460> wings<00:00:56.989> with

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989

I pulled over the little wings with
flaps<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.680> everyone<00:00:58.980> Ellen<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.780> those<00:01:00.989> are

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
of the holes the other through the other

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.400 
of the holes the other through the other
hole<00:02:58.650> oops<00:03:00.510> ok<00:03:01.510> pretend<00:03:01.630> that<00:03:02.110> didn't<00:03:02.380> happen

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
hole oops ok pretend that didn't happen

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.640 
hole oops ok pretend that didn't happen
just<00:03:02.950> now<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.780> we'll<00:03:04.989> still<00:03:05.260> pretend<00:03:05.560> that

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
just now so we'll still pretend that

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.400 
just now so we'll still pretend that
that's<00:03:05.739> a<00:03:05.920> whole<00:03:06.810> all<00:03:07.810> right<00:03:07.959> and<00:03:08.170> actually

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
that's a whole all right and actually

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.259 
that's a whole all right and actually
that's<00:03:08.530> not<00:03:08.680> going<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:09.010> be<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.190> big<00:03:09.370> deal<00:03:09.400> so

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
that's not going to be a big deal so

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.410 
that's not going to be a big deal so
once<00:03:10.480> you've<00:03:10.660> done<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:10.900> then<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.910> can<00:03:12.940> glue

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
once you've done that then you can glue

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.560 
once you've done that then you can glue
your<00:03:13.569> envelope<00:03:13.989> together<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:16.209> I'm<00:03:16.269> gonna<00:03:16.390> grab
