00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.820
 enjoying rest but already put to 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.450
 start by knocking again at the beginning of 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.790
 year 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.590
 I am trained in theology and in 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.660
 When I'm with God, can I go back to 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.740
 swimming is a sport that I love either 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.350
 repeating power has half the intention 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.770
 who is aware of it then so 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.740
 opened my media arrives in china 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.320
 I like if the union will make a 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.450
 New prosthesis false prescription with me on the day 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.490
 by day I'm more practical easy to enter 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.490
 in contact with the two girls with gel 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.640
 but even so that in the week the dow 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.600
 friends on the floor stressed 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.730
 We told you something has 60 in the 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.040
 head in the place of receiving the others 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.040
 especially in each snack 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.480
 hi i am vivianne bridges help me 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.480
 a stone is her food 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.840
 ae 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.100
 Everything here was done thinking of you and 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.890
 in your routine you become a passion that 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.200
 That's why I brought the blue to your 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.690
 kitchen to be able to mean some 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.790
 thing from your day to day we worked 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.190
 with adhesive fabric that is super easy to 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.840
 apply and it is waterproof so 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.630
 the one who gives that basic sword 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.940
 Program cooking water falls and think 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.370
 easy to apply and easy to remove 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.440
 when you want to switch suddenly by 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.400
 bring another color put another 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.400
 Stamping in this kitchen 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.050
 the refrigerator the stove presence of the consul 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.330
 very nice presence this refrigerator has 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.710
 an interesting function that is a drawer 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.870
 from orta 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.330
 you put vegetables in there and 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.550
 last much longer than 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.560
 the normal the curtinha 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.770
 we brought a nice thing that is a 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.510
 acquabox fabric that can fall into the water that 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.030
 It is also waterproof. 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.910
 the sink curtain problem and the 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.370
 window is a thinner fabric to enter 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.260
 clarity translate into appearing then 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.130
 more light here in the kitchen and gets bigger 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.049
 also 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.370
 We worked with Cuba is one thing. 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.520
 I really like working 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.860
 because if you and 10 in the kitchen are 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.770
 want other cabinets in the future if 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.720
 have a larger family need more 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.520
 space to store things and can 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.070
 use this exclusive of seats in the 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.230
 frame in the room and so it is very versatile 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.640
 It lasts a lot and I think a lot. 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.740
 interesting 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.810
 now it's easier to take because you have 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.850
 a hand pump is cool you do not 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.310
 need to invert the gallon because you 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.230
 lives alone is much easier to 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.330
 lamp is a fun thing because the 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.550
 people used a can make jelly goes 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.160
 be able to make the torque so that 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.120
 warm us one LED lamp that is 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.300
 very cool because you spend a thousand 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.889
 the energy also lasts much much longer 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.080
 the kitchen dÃ©bora I tried to work 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.580
 with solutions - permanent first 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.410
 she said the hell to build 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.600
 This kitchen and I was not going to get here. 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.460
 break pulls new bag 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.199
 so I worked a lot with fabric 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.030
 waterproof adhesive to power 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.520
 transform a little bring a little 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.290
 color light for this space 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.210
 but at the same time she can take it away 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:26.250
 sooner or later she does not like 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.250
 more or when it started 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.130
 I really liked the decor and good 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.860
 so the face 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:39.700
 the refrigerator really surprised me was 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.790
 so a present I pulled a lot of everything 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.510
 not changed my personality is the 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.510
 my face
