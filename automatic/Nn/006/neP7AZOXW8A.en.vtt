00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.460
 one of the most common complaints of 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.910
 people who buy headphones with 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.360
 bluetooth is that they can not hear the 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.939
 signal from your radio fm by headphones 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.070
 which what is not true is possible 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.900
 listen to the signal with the headphones on 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.960
 the phones are and there is an application 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.939
 with which we do it very easily in 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.820
 phones of another brand like this one that is 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.350
 an airplane phone that is made going down 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.480
 a simple application from the store 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.930
 google play that is called vete mont 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.750
 then these are the headphones 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.160
 bluetooth are sony brand 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.650
 The first thing we should do is 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.140
 make sure you can make the connection 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.610
 normal that the phone recognizes the 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.430
 headphones that you believe in a connection 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.200
 Bluetooth is already recognized 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.640
 handset with the phone and all that what 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.120
 first thing we're going to do and there's no more 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.490
 problem and the second thing we're going to do 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:02.120
 is to go to the google play store 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.680
 and download a small application 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.410
 what is called be the moon 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.120
 here I have it installed then it is 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.430
 just to show you what it's called and 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.200
 like the one in search 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.480
 we return to the screen of 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.300
 start and then let's proceed to 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.880
 open the radio application like all 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.130
 we know to be able to use the radius of 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.710
 phone that we should have connected 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.300
 some conventional hearing aids that are 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.360
 those that are going to serve us 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.300
 antenna then here we open the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.020
 radio application 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.880
 the application starts and here it is 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.260
 started and the sound is coming out 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.260
 the conventional headphones 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.460
 the sound is coming out for those 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.710
 headphones then we do not need them 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.740
 that comes out of that we need it to come out 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.110
 for the bluetooth headphones is there 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.210
 where the application starts playing 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.350
 we download everything we have to 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.750
 do is here with the radio ringing 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.870
 let's find the application vete mont 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.840
 we open it at the moment that I put 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.480
 at that moment it is to this little program what 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.520
 what it does is send the radio signal to 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.150
 the bluetooth headphones as we are going to 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.150
 see what happens 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.480
 the hearing aids are already playing here 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.710
 the radio signal let's realize 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.710
 let's bring them closer to the microphone 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.150
 if we realize that they are already sounding 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.150
 the bluetooth headphones 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.500
 already has the rivadavia radio signal that 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.230
 it's a lie we're going to reopen the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.750
 radio 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.069
 here we open the radio and we are going to change 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.069
 of broadcasters 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.180
 Y 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.000
 then we must have something important 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.420
 of knowing is that we have to have 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.860
 always connected headphones 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.019
 conventional no longer going to sound 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.849
 for the headphones but necessary 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.970
 have them connected because they are the ones 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.769
 we will receive the air signal and 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.780
 ready here the two are already connected 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.510
 the bluetooth headphones these 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.489
 headphones have controls to give you 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.010
 only functional in anthony in this case 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.140
 in this case we want to change the station 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.849
 lower or increase volume not on the rise 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.290
 volume if the headphones are used 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.540
 change my hours have to do it 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.359
 from your phone as from 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.099
 origins serves us but as we see the 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.260
 hearing aids are playing the radio 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.970
 then if possible and already this 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.940
 denies all the people who say 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.540
 that you can not, how can we give 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.209
 also counts on xperia phones 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.250
 of sony is much, much easier, there is a 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.900
 small application that is called th road 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.489
 which is already installed in the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.290
 phone only is that the 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.000
 let's deploy and tell him to 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.220
 we want the sound in the headphones 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.390
 when the radio is playing and that's 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.910
 much easier 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.430
 no sound quality is lost here in 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.660
 these phones the bad of the 20th is not 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.940
 that if sound quality is lost 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.520
 because as its name indicates the sound 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.410
 of the opening day while with the 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.230
 phones are and we have the signal of 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.630
 radio in your ministry is very good 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.280
 that's all I hope it has served 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.950
 of help for people who want 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.790
 listen to your signal radio network for your 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.790
 Bluetooth headphones
