about<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.409> probably<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> hair<00:01:23.479> uh<00:01:24.479> but

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780

you can't like make it have like that to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.679 
you can't like make it have like that to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
there is right now I guess for this so

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.120 
there is right now I guess for this so
yeah<00:01:35.670> um<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.409> him<00:01:37.650> with<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> blue

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
yeah um this is with him with the blue

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.510

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
jacket on this is closer to the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.539 
jacket on this is closer to the
beginning<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.479> guess<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.100> isn't<00:01:44.280> like

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
beginning I guess and this isn't like

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.789 
beginning I guess and this isn't like
from<00:01:45.090> beginning<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.630> end<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.229> see<00:01:46.560> for

there's<00:04:28.949> not<00:04:29.099> much<00:04:29.280> of<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.430> difference<00:04:29.729> to<00:04:29.849> this

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
there's not much of a difference to this

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.649 
there's not much of a difference to this
one<00:04:30.210> um<00:04:31.020> but<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:31.740> know<00:04:31.770> if<00:04:32.099> you<00:04:32.340> prefer<00:04:32.849> talks
