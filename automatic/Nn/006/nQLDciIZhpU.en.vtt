00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 and the moment of one of the awards 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.750
 more difficult than the year more than anything else 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.570
 because it is less tied to objective factors 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.160
 and more to partially evaluations 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.889
 subjective as we are talking about 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.480
 This year's fiction of games with one 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.279
 There have been exceptional history 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.119
 many many more than there are 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.070
 expected 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.720
 so much that some independent titles in 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.310
 particular they have staked everything on 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.140
 narrative then the challenge was 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.199
 very hard until the end we see a little 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.060
 who won 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.949
 rightly we start with some cloth 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.930
 of the basic star was one of the titles 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.809
 best of the year from the point of view 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.829
 narrative the title of naughty dog ​​is 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.940
 outstanding and the developers 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.010
 Americans have shown one more 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.350
 time of being incredible masters 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.910
 in the rhythm of the narrative but above all 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.920
 have succeeded in contextualizing the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.020
 violence in the history of video games one 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.329
 what very few works first are 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.520
 come out and do nothing with this one 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.739
 effectiveness the game has an impact 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.329
 incredible to extraordinary scenes 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.280
 and above all one of the best beginnings 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.170
 facts in history is also one of the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.300
 finals better structured in history 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.670
 really brilliant in every element 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.110
 narrative 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.790
 immediately afterwards arousing the parables that it is 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.799
 entered into many categories given his 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.110
 incredible peculiarity from a game 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.460
 strange strange metanarrative that goes 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.960
 approved to be understood we have it 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.640
 said over and over again why it is 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.290
 incredibly particular 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.340
 a unique experience for boys and then 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.490
 deserves to stay in this too 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.860
 category you pass another independent 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.540
 gone home a game that is only narrative 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.640
 pretty much kids a bit like it was 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.180
 to the moon but with a first view 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.549
 person and a setting a narrative 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.950
 mental that plays a lot with i 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.909
 preconceptions of gamers 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.270
 telling a simple story but 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.640
 extremely exciting and well written 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.960
 with really excellent moments 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.689
 really a game we couldn't 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.659
 leave out from this series of 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.310
 nomination impossible to forget 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.439
 bioshock endless big surprise 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.490
 of the year a fps but it succeeds to 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.189
 tell an incredible story 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.490
 even better than the first title of the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.710
 bioshock series in my opinion 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.780
 the setting is incredible i 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.970
 characters are well characterized the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.890
 history is full of twists and turns 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.700
 absolutely exceptional so not 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.270
 we could absolutely omit it 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.760
 remaining in the field of games 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.500
 mainly narrative beyond one 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.630
 strange fusion of cinema and video game 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.569
 it seems to be by the good david cage 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.819
 blonde uses interpretation 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.620
 exceptional of the actors involved for 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.269
 tell a complex story ed 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.160
 fascinating is a game very much 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.900
 particular that like all the works of 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.630
 cage wo n't like everyone but 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.830
 undoubtedly deserves to be named 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.650
 among the games with the best fiction 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.870
 because it is absolutely focused on 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.870
 history is very well studied 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.920
 we close with one of the surprises of 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.269
 this year brothers the love songs in 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.459
 brothers there are no real ones 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.230
 dialogues the plot is told in a way 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.060
 very delicate but still a lot 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.920
 deep is a striking story 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.130
 in a setting it's a game 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.830
 that they remember for poetry and anyway 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.519
 wonder exceptional titles like ico 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.269
 shadow of the colossus really is 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.250
 magnificent what they came out to do 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.540
 starbreeze developers and have 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.180
 surprised everyone because they passed 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.400
 from fairly caciaroni shooters to 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.290
 a game of incredible finesse and 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.940
 incredible delicacy so not 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.510
 we could absolutely do that too 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.360
 leave it off the list 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.520
 the winner is the basic auction 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.020
 boys might seem predictable 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.760
 choice but in reality it was much more 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.830
 difficult than you can think of 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.970
 beautiful stories this year in the usa 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.430
 that there have been 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.760
 a tide, however, that of the basic auction 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.600
 we think the pace is better 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.640
 exceptional work done by the minutes 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.390
 drugs is incredible their mastery 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.710
 comes out of every pore of this video game is 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.330
 absolutely amazing professors who 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.280
 do with this title have succeeded in 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.959
 completely change the perspective 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.300
 that players have zombie game 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.820
 it's a game that's a punch in the stomach 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.290
 it is an exciting game that you 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.170
 clearly recommend trying 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.690
 because in words it is difficult to explain 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.580
 according to us deserves the award without 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.580
 shadow of a doubt to the next
