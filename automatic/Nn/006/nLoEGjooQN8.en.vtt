00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.899
 nice everyone guys and welcome 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.120
 welcome to this new release today 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.980
 we are here on the community channel of 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.320
 fifa plaza io because obviously still 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.660
 don't recognize they know spike so bye 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.849
 to all, good Monday especially because 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.039
 as we all know Monday is never a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.900
 great day but me with this review 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.699
 I'll try to take it better here 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.460
 let's see the statistics immediately 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.070
 in game we have a speed 83 a 87 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.760
 collects a 70 of passage 1 84 re of 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.859
 books in a 48 defense and finally a 89 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.809
 of physical boys of physical 89 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.780
 exceptional statistic but we will have way of 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.050
 talk about it 15 games 23 goals also made 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.540
 here on average enough bonanni 1.5 or so 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.289
 goal per game but I would say not to lose 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.969
 more time and start now therefore now 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.980
 you will know well that he started his own 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.070
 moprho today is definitely definitely 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.199
 fundamental the physical 89 statistic in 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.719
 card to which I add my usual three 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.359
 subcategories that we find in game 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.789
 we have a resistance of a 99 of 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.439
 strive bar strange call it how 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.650
 want 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.689
 86 of physical aggression therefore 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.090
 exceptional I think it's the pro 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.520
 best and features based on 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.170
 this player absolutely second 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.210
 prodi today is the shot we find the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.750
 statistic we can see all the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.850
 87 in paper to which we add a 91 of 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.820
 power shooting boys 91 to be able facts 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.369
 true statistic in game a 89 shooting at 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.990
 flight and two statistics that I do not 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.659
 absolutely expecting a 70 of 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.130
 so longshot 70 of shooting per lap 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.840
 according to me there is a moment here 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.310
 dwell on this aspect because 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.500
 we have these two statistics in the game 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.390
 really low I won't tell you that 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.159
 condition your pulls around and not 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.439
 certainly absolutely but me 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.259
 personally I found myself better at 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.270
 use it within the area and arrive 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.399
 also to the third valiant today third boys 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.860
 pro that speed a statistic 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.590
 in paper to which I add the 84 of 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.869
 Agility is a 89 speed not shooting 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.390
 I'll call you acceleration because then 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.280
 you will see what he thinks anyway speed 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.920
 really good speed especially 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.350
 click when it starts to take not 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.790
 stops more 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.170
 and we also reach the third last one 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.170
 just to the accuracy of the shots of 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.420
 heads the 94 boys 94 the statesmen who 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.180
 mine but needless to say that it is the head 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.670
 really really strong we come to 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.560
 penultimate today the positioning 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.000
 91 statistics in game even here not 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.850
 I don't even know to tell you that it is always at 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.260
 right time in the right place 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.160
 always being at the right time at 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.670
 right place we come to 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.680
 final completion last prodi today 92 of 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.630
 In-game statistic makes very little mistake 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.850
 in front of the opponent's goal 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.410
 I found isolation guys 2 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.210
 against the first acceleration of the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.270
 second and the equilibrium with statistics in 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.830
 game respectively of 81 75 then 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.660
 it's about the acceleration it caused me 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.030
 really several problems not me 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.000
 I waited for it because it absolutely worked 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.490
 to pick up speed and to gear up and 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.840
 it concerns the same balance as 75 of 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.700
 in game statistic and a lot 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.910
 difficulties for this name the fried 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.680
 such put the dribbling between the pros and 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.210
 Even today we have arrived 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.620
 come to the end of these reviews you can 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.959
 see the pro from a meeting side 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.040
 on the other as the usual final grade to the 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.090
 octo bot player 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.550
 greider compared to the version 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.440
 precedent always of eight really a 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.959
