00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
saw a major job in Chinese equities but

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.590 
saw a major job in Chinese equities but
we<00:00:19.859> didn't<00:00:20.130> see<00:00:20.279> Chinese<00:00:20.730> buyers<00:00:20.970> flocked<00:00:21.420> to

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
we didn't see Chinese buyers flocked to

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.090 
we didn't see Chinese buyers flocked to
gold<00:00:21.810> instead<00:00:22.230> they<00:00:22.590> saw<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.830> as<00:00:22.980> an

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
gold instead they saw it as an

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.269 
gold instead they saw it as an
opportunity<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.850> buy<00:00:24.029> more<00:00:24.390> stocks<00:00:24.980> why<00:00:25.980> did

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
opportunity to buy more stocks why did

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.700 
opportunity to buy more stocks why did
gold<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.699> silver<00:00:26.939> take<00:00:27.119> such<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> fall<00:00:27.689> well<00:00:28.410> I

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
gold and silver take such a fall well I

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.800 
gold and silver take such a fall well I
think<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.279> gold<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.699> silver<00:00:30.150> tend<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.539> rally

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
think the gold and silver tend to rally

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.170 
think the gold and silver tend to rally
when<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.289> main<00:00:31.650> concern<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.189> inflation

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
when the main concern is inflation

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.780 
when the main concern is inflation
they're<00:00:34.170> really<00:00:34.290> mainly<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.860> hedge<00:00:35.160> against<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
they're really mainly a hedge against a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.900 
they're really mainly a hedge against a
declining<00:00:36.540> value<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:37.170> paper<00:00:37.500> currency<00:00:38.280> that's

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
declining value of paper currency that's

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.490 
declining value of paper currency that's
not<00:00:39.090> really<00:00:39.660> what<00:00:39.750> we're<00:00:39.930> looking<00:00:39.960> at<00:00:40.350> in

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
not really what we're looking at in

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.170 
not really what we're looking at in
China<00:00:40.770> what<00:00:41.010> we're<00:00:41.129> said<00:00:41.399> seeing<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.969> that

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
China what we're said seeing is that

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.389 
China what we're said seeing is that
china<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.110> very<00:00:43.140> significant<00:00:44.100> economic

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
china is in a very significant economic

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.520 
china is in a very significant economic
slowdown<00:00:45.239> they<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.539> very<00:00:45.780> high<00:00:45.840> levels<00:00:46.410> of

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
slowdown they have very high levels of

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.240 
slowdown they have very high levels of
private<00:00:46.950> sector<00:00:47.340> debt<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.879> they<00:00:48.570> also<00:00:48.780> have

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
private sector debt and they also have

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.549 
private sector debt and they also have
very<00:00:50.250> overvalued<00:00:51.090> currency<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.809> renminbi<00:00:51.989> is

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
very overvalued currency the renminbi is

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.560 
very overvalued currency the renminbi is
just<00:00:53.129> too<00:00:53.370> strong<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.090> hurting<00:00:54.449> their

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
just too strong and it's hurting their

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.540 
just too strong and it's hurting their
exports<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.739> that's<00:00:55.890> actually<00:00:56.070> creating

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
exports and so that's actually creating

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.310 
exports and so that's actually creating
the<00:00:56.640> opposite<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.329> inflation<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.050> actually

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the opposite of inflation it's actually

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.799 
the opposite of inflation it's actually
putting<00:00:58.500> downward<00:00:58.920> pressure<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.640> prices

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
putting downward pressure on prices

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.240 
putting downward pressure on prices
that's<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:01.140> reason<00:01:01.320> why<00:01:01.530> gold<00:01:01.920> didn't

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
that's one reason why gold didn't

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.570 
that's one reason why gold didn't
rebound<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.600> China<00:01:04.170> news<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:04.830> another

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
rebound on the China news but another

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.050 
rebound on the China news but another
issue<00:01:05.850> though<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:07.610> gold<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.820> very

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
issue though is that gold is a very

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.200 
issue though is that gold is a very
volatile<00:01:09.659> asset<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.950> has<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.400> know<00:01:11.460> fifteen

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
volatile asset it has you know fifteen

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.330 
volatile asset it has you know fifteen
twenty<00:01:12.689> percent<00:01:13.140> twenty-five<00:01:14.070> percent

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
twenty percent twenty-five percent

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.090 
twenty percent twenty-five percent
annualized<00:01:15.210> standard<00:01:15.720> deviation<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.009> if

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
annualized standard deviation and so if

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.859 
annualized standard deviation and so if
you're<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.280> Chinese<00:01:17.850> investor<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.570> you're<00:01:18.720> not

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
you're a Chinese investor and you're not

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.899 
you're a Chinese investor and you're not
concerned<00:01:19.320> mainly<00:01:19.650> about<00:01:20.040> inflation<00:01:20.729> but

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
concerned mainly about inflation but

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.149 
concerned mainly about inflation but
rather<00:01:21.060> about<00:01:21.270> deflation<00:01:21.869> or<00:01:22.350> maybe<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
rather about deflation or maybe the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.580 
rather about deflation or maybe the
renminbi<00:01:23.420> weakening<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.960> would<00:01:25.140> make<00:01:25.320> more

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
renminbi weakening it would make more

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.230 
renminbi weakening it would make more
sense<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:26.130> put<00:01:26.280> your<00:01:26.460> money<00:01:26.640> into<00:01:26.850> u.s.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
sense to put your money into u.s.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.260 
sense to put your money into u.s.
dollars<00:01:27.720> or<00:01:28.020> into<00:01:28.770> government<00:01:28.950> bonds<00:01:29.670> now

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
dollars or into government bonds now

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.359 
dollars or into government bonds now
Eric<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:31.079> had<00:01:31.259> an<00:01:31.350> interesting<00:01:31.799> study<00:01:32.040> called

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
Eric you had an interesting study called

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.700 
Eric you had an interesting study called
the<00:01:32.759> push-pull<00:01:33.479> dynamics<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.170> gold<00:01:34.470> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the push-pull dynamics of gold and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.830 
the push-pull dynamics of gold and
silver<00:01:35.210> where<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.360> mentioned<00:01:36.570> that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
silver where you mentioned that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.440 
silver where you mentioned that
investors<00:01:37.530> seem<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.250> focused<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
investors seem to be so focused on the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.789 
investors seem to be so focused on the
u.s.<00:01:39.750> rate<00:01:39.990> hikes<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.380> maybe<00:01:40.590> there's

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
u.s. rate hikes but maybe there's

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.109 
u.s. rate hikes but maybe there's
something<00:01:40.950> else<00:01:41.130> at<00:01:41.310> play<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:41.880> should

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
something else at play that they should

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.359 
something else at play that they should
be<00:01:42.270> paying<00:01:42.570> attention<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.990> right<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.920> do<00:01:44.100> think

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
be paying attention to right we do think

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.010 
be paying attention to right we do think
that<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.610> u.s.<00:01:44.850> rate<00:01:45.119> hikes<00:01:45.390> are<00:01:45.600> somewhat

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that the u.s. rate hikes are somewhat

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.170 
that the u.s. rate hikes are somewhat
important<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.829> gold<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.340> silver<00:01:47.729> have

happen again today Eric let's look at
something<00:02:52.850> else<00:02:53.120> on<00:02:53.270> our<00:02:53.300> radar<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.990> gold

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
something else on our radar the gold

something else on our radar the gold
silver<00:02:54.830> ratio<00:02:55.250> it's<00:02:55.490> near<00:02:55.850> its<00:02:56.000> peak<00:02:56.270> it's

silver ratio it's near its peak it's

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.830 
silver ratio it's near its peak it's
closely<00:02:57.170> correlated<00:02:57.680> with<00:02:57.830> global<00:02:58.370> GDP<00:02:58.910> so<00:02:59.510> do

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
closely correlated with global GDP so do

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.170 
closely correlated with global GDP so do
you<00:02:59.930> think<00:02:59.990> this<00:03:00.320> could<00:03:00.590> signal<00:03:01.520> a<00:03:01.640> stagnant

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
you think this could signal a stagnant

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.690 
you think this could signal a stagnant
global<00:03:02.750> growth<00:03:02.990> right<00:03:03.410> now<00:03:03.590> well<00:03:04.220> growth<00:03:04.460> is

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
global growth right now well growth is

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.700 
global growth right now well growth is
certainly<00:03:05.090> stagnating<00:03:05.870> in<00:03:05.960> certain<00:03:06.440> regions

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
certainly stagnating in certain regions

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.380 
certainly stagnating in certain regions
of<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.130> world<00:03:07.220> I<00:03:07.760> think<00:03:07.940> what<00:03:08.240> we're<00:03:08.360> seeing

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
of the world I think what we're seeing

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.210 
of the world I think what we're seeing
is<00:03:08.750> that<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:09.050> much<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.620> world<00:03:09.860> economy

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
is that so much that the world economy

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.490 
is that so much that the world economy
itself<00:03:10.850> is<00:03:11.120> not<00:03:11.300> doing<00:03:11.690> well<00:03:11.720> but<00:03:12.050> rather<00:03:12.290> that

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
itself is not doing well but rather that

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.320 
itself is not doing well but rather that
we're<00:03:12.650> seeing<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:12.980> rebalancing<00:03:13.940> of<00:03:14.060> world

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
we're seeing a rebalancing of world

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.170 
we're seeing a rebalancing of world
growth<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.920> leaders<00:03:16.370> in<00:03:16.400> growth<00:03:16.820> over<00:03:17.120> the

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
growth so the leaders in growth over the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.690 
growth so the leaders in growth over the
last<00:03:17.390> 15<00:03:17.990> years<00:03:18.170> worthy<00:03:18.680> emerging<00:03:19.220> markets

big oil producers are also suffering

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.330 
big oil producers are also suffering

most of their growth is coming from

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.810 
most of their growth is coming from
financial<00:03:42.140> services<00:03:42.740> the<00:03:43.190> very<00:03:43.400> stagnant

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
consumers of gold and silver probably

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.000 
consumers of gold and silver probably
could<00:03:59.540> reduce<00:03:59.870> their<00:04:00.110> consumption<00:04:00.590> and

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
could reduce their consumption and

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.160 
could reduce their consumption and
silver<00:04:01.459> itself<00:04:01.850> differs<00:04:02.570> from<00:04:02.660> gold<00:04:02.959> in<00:04:03.110> the

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
next few years we could see gold prices

next few years we could see gold prices
take<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.620> very<00:04:28.949> significant<00:04:29.639> drop<00:04:29.939> maybe<00:04:30.629> below

an ounce before we start seeing that

mining supply coming off the market
additionally<00:04:39.810> wouldn't<00:04:40.169> surprise<00:04:40.650> me<00:04:40.680> if

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
additionally wouldn't surprise me if

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.129 
additionally wouldn't surprise me if
over<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.460> next<00:04:41.789> few<00:04:41.939> years<00:04:41.999> if<00:04:42.360> we<00:04:42.479> saw<00:04:42.659> silver

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
over the next few years if we saw silver

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.619 
over the next few years if we saw silver
go<00:04:43.319> down<00:04:43.590> maybe<00:04:44.219> as<00:04:44.430> far<00:04:44.460> as<00:04:44.759> ten<00:04:45.029> dollars<00:04:45.419> per

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
go down maybe as far as ten dollars per

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.300 
go down maybe as far as ten dollars per
ounce<00:04:45.810> which<00:04:46.319> I<00:04:46.469> know<00:04:46.529> sounds<00:04:46.620> like<00:04:46.919> a<00:04:47.009> big

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
ounce which I know sounds like a big

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.390 
ounce which I know sounds like a big
drop<00:04:47.580> from<00:04:47.819> its<00:04:47.939> current<00:04:48.150> level<00:04:48.449> at<00:04:48.719> 1560<00:04:49.710> but

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
drop from its current level at 1560 but

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.100 
drop from its current level at 1560 but
you<00:04:50.969> have<00:04:51.090> to<00:04:51.240> remember<00:04:51.479> that<00:04:51.659> silver<00:04:52.050> is

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
you have to remember that silver is

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.959 
you have to remember that silver is
extremely<00:04:52.650> volatile<00:04:53.159> and<00:04:53.370> just<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.610> few<00:04:53.789> years

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
extremely volatile and just a few years

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.659 
extremely volatile and just a few years
ago<00:04:54.210> is<00:04:54.389> it<00:04:54.419> 45<00:04:55.050> dollars<00:04:55.529> an<00:04:55.710> ounce<00:04:55.860> so<00:04:56.460> if<00:04:56.580> you

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
ago is it 45 dollars an ounce so if you

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.700 
ago is it 45 dollars an ounce so if you
can<00:04:56.819> drop<00:04:56.969> thirty<00:04:57.360> dollars<00:04:57.749> an<00:04:57.930> ounce<00:04:58.080> what's

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
can drop thirty dollars an ounce what's

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.920 
can drop thirty dollars an ounce what's
another<00:04:58.949> five<00:04:59.340> alright<00:05:00.330> thanks<00:05:00.539> so<00:05:00.629> much<00:05:00.750> for
