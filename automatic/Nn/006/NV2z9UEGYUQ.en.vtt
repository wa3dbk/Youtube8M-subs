minikit<00:01:55.929> detector<00:01:56.679> I<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:58.149> happen<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.479> know

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
minikit detector I just happen to know

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.620 
minikit detector I just happen to know
because<00:01:58.810> I'm<00:01:58.990> keeping<00:01:59.350> track<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.679> it<00:02:00.359> so<00:02:01.359> that

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
was the minikit detector red brick and

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.419 
was the minikit detector red brick and
that<00:02:04.990> is<00:02:05.140> how<00:02:05.289> you<00:02:05.349> get<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:05.799> that<00:02:06.009> is<00:02:06.130> where<00:02:06.310> you
