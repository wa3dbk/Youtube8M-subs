00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
excited to get one of these into maybe

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.899 
excited to get one of these into maybe
do<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> little<00:01:46.680> bit<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:46.979> packet<00:01:47.310> sniffing<00:01:47.700> maybe

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
do a little bit of packet sniffing maybe
