00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.430 

okay<00:00:04.770> so<00:00:04.830> we<00:00:05.279> have<00:00:05.549> our<00:00:05.940> little<00:00:06.420> paper<00:00:06.990> strip

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
okay so we have our little paper strip

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.290 
okay so we have our little paper strip
here<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:07.859> this<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.099> about<00:00:08.370> one<00:00:09.090> centimeter

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
here and this is about one centimeter

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.440 
here and this is about one centimeter
wide<00:00:09.809> by<00:00:10.080> 25<00:00:10.800> across<00:00:11.059> the<00:00:12.059> length<00:00:12.210> doesn't

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
wide by 25 across the length doesn't

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.629 
wide by 25 across the length doesn't
matter<00:00:12.719> too<00:00:13.049> much<00:00:13.080> as<00:00:14.040> long<00:00:14.160> as<00:00:14.250> it's<00:00:14.370> not<00:00:14.460> too

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
matter too much as long as it's not too

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.369 
matter too much as long as it's not too
short<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.179> width<00:00:15.450> obviously<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.260> going

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
short and the width obviously is going

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.439 
short and the width obviously is going
to<00:00:16.470> determine<00:00:16.770> how<00:00:17.100> big<00:00:17.369> your<00:00:17.640> star<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.000> at<00:00:18.359> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
to determine how big your star is at the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.540 
to determine how big your star is at the
end<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.869> find<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.560> one<00:00:19.710> centimeter<00:00:20.340> works

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
end I find that one centimeter works

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.250 
end I find that one centimeter works
quite<00:00:21.270> nicely<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.080> what<00:00:22.230> I

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
quite nicely this and this is what I

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.439 
quite nicely this and this is what I
stick<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:22.680> mainly<00:00:23.220> what<00:00:24.060> I'm<00:00:24.119> going<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.330> do

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
stick with mainly what I'm going to do

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.200 
stick with mainly what I'm going to do
first<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:25.170> bring<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.130> around<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> top<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
first is bring it around to the top and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.300 
first is bring it around to the top and
just<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.109> twist<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.590> round<00:00:28.740> like<00:00:29.070> this

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
just going to twist it round like this

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.550 
just going to twist it round like this
so<00:00:30.210> I've<00:00:30.359> got<00:00:30.539> like<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> little<00:00:30.990> kind<00:00:31.439> of

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
so I've got like a little kind of

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.959 
so I've got like a little kind of
charity<00:00:31.859> awareness<00:00:32.369> sort<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.640> comes<00:00:32.850> through

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
charity awareness sort of comes through

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.870 
charity awareness sort of comes through
been<00:00:33.239> going<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.010> with<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.250> little<00:00:35.670> piece

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
been going on and with this little piece

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.630 
been going on and with this little piece
here<00:00:35.910> I'm<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.719> twist<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.230> round<00:00:37.520> so<00:00:38.520> it's

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
here I'm going to twist it round so it's

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.760 
here I'm going to twist it round so it's
going<00:00:38.790> through<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.180> loop<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.600> pull<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:40.379> this

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
going through the loop and pull on this

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.950 
going through the loop and pull on this
tail<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.050> will<00:00:43.110> get<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> nice<00:00:44.960> flatten

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
tail here so we will get a nice flatten

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.880 
tail here so we will get a nice flatten
it<00:00:46.079> down<00:00:46.280> that<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:49.219> flat<00:00:50.219> knot<00:00:50.489> okay<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.890> I'm

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
it down that is flat knot okay and I'm

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.330 
it down that is flat knot okay and I'm
just<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:54.410> fold<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.559> over<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.070> I've<00:00:56.190> got

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
just going to fold this over so I've got

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.389 
just going to fold this over so I've got
like<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> Pentagon<00:00:57.350> with<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.559> little<00:00:58.829> tail<00:00:59.129> on

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
like a Pentagon with a little tail on

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.910 
like a Pentagon with a little tail on
the<00:00:59.550> end<00:00:59.809> so<00:01:00.809> what<00:01:01.260> I'm<00:01:01.350> going<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> do<00:01:01.710> is

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the end so what I'm going to do is

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.979 
the end so what I'm going to do is
following<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:03.059> sides<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.750> are<00:01:03.840> already

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
following the sides that are already

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.960 
following the sides that are already
established<00:01:04.320> I'm<00:01:05.040> going<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> take<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.670> tail

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
established I'm going to take this tail

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.310 
established I'm going to take this tail
and<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.299> keep<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.470> folding<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.280> round<00:01:09.320> and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
and just keep on folding it round and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.320 
and just keep on folding it round and
what<00:01:10.470> you'll<00:01:10.619> find<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:12.030> kind<00:01:12.240> of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
what you'll find is it kind of

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.570 
what you'll find is it kind of
automatically<00:01:13.110> will<00:01:13.409> go<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.740> an<00:01:14.280> opposite

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
automatically will go to an opposite

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.999 
automatically will go to an opposite
side<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.930> follow<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.409> angles<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.890> are

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
side if you follow the angles that are

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.850 
side if you follow the angles that are
already<00:01:17.159> there<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.960> don't<00:01:19.200> need<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.740> worry

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
already there so you don't need to worry

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.170 
already there so you don't need to worry
about<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:22.250> okay<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.490> go<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.850> end<00:01:24.000> now

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
about that okay so I go to the end now

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.510 
about that okay so I go to the end now
tack<00:01:24.930> about<00:01:25.049> anymore<00:01:25.470> can't<00:01:25.950> fold<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.340> anymore

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
tack about anymore can't fold it anymore

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.270 
tack about anymore can't fold it anymore
so<00:01:26.820> I'm<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.119> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.420> place<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.280> underneath

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
so I'm just going to place it underneath

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.190 
so I'm just going to place it underneath
this<00:01:29.549> little<00:01:29.909> flap<00:01:30.420> here<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.049> already

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200

this little flap here that we already
made<00:01:32.030> then<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.420> our<00:01:33.869> little<00:01:34.110> Pentagon

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
made then we have our little Pentagon

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.910 
made then we have our little Pentagon
now<00:01:36.090> one<00:01:36.329> more<00:01:36.479> thing<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:36.810> need<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> do<00:01:37.259> to

make our little star we're almost there
is<00:01:39.869> pinch<00:01:40.530> all<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.950> corners<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.810> here<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:42.899> go

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
is pinch all the corners so here we go

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:51.350 
is pinch all the corners so here we go
one<00:01:43.439> two<00:01:46.640> three<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.200> four<00:01:50.149> check<00:01:51.149> both<00:01:51.299> sides

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
quickly so you can see kind of when

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.999 
quickly so you can see kind of when
you've<00:02:08.250> had<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.429> bit<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.640> practice

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009
