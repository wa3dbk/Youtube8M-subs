00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:40.840
 I've been remembering the moments that I gave you 

00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:47.105
 how many did you give me and why am I here 

00:03:49.486 --> 00:03:55.378
 sitting on the floor thinking that I love you 

00:03:55.384 --> 00:04:04.944
 that I loved you so much, and that your love is necessary 

00:04:05.985 --> 00:04:13.533
 Let me cry I want to get it out of my chest 

00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:22.027
 with my cry I put out this fire that burns inside 

00:04:22.424 --> 00:04:29.703
 Let me cry I want to say goodbye in silence 

00:04:29.712 --> 00:04:38.112
 make my mind reason that for this there is no remedy 

00:04:53.494 --> 00:05:00.067
 They were such beautiful encounters, loving each other without fear 

00:05:00.072 --> 00:05:08.386
 you are the night and I your dream, you my my storyteller 

00:05:09.765 --> 00:05:15.742
 I'll forget you, I swear, I'm sorry 

00:05:15.794 --> 00:05:24.620
 your love hurts me and this you can not fix 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.842
 But love like mine will not find out there 

00:05:32.848 --> 00:05:41.012
 because this love bet even for me 

00:05:41.592 --> 00:05:49.092
 Let me cry I want to get it out of my chest 

00:05:49.495 --> 00:05:57.396
 with my cry I put out this fire that burns inside 

00:05:57.765 --> 00:06:05.089
 let me cry I want to say goodbye in silence 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:13.480
 make my mind reason that for this there is no remedy 

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:20.721
 Let me cry I want to get it out of my chest 

00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:28.801
 with my cry I put out this fire that burns inside 

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:36.135
 let me cry I want to say goodbye in silence 

00:06:36.143 --> 00:06:44.578
 make my mind reason that for this there is no remedy 

00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:50.496
 let me cry aa-aar 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.323
 let me cry aa-aar
