00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.330
 so welcome again 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.210
 a test of the new blog 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.340
 In this clip we watch movies 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.600
 for once that 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.790
 test and that we work the skies 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.740
 just with your finger on and then 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.529
 Let's take a look at the second part 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.070
 volume to that is here now the 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.580
 Lupe has as I said a two asl 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.470
 warehouse 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.349
 Of course that's exactly what test is 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.570
 describe what that is exactly or what 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.770
 that distinguishes and that is a very 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.150
 Good location is you can simply because 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.140
 Just test it here 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.350
 the fan leaves a bit to 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.540
 Swallow as you can see it has to happen again 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.519
 anything else can be found 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.199
 and that works very smoothly and 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.960
 easy I have now for comparison 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.059
 I have my older noiseblocker 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.680
 had grabbed a multi frame only 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.280
 eat camp but not in the second 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.030
 version in the first version 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.969
 Here you can see that one 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.180
 a little more force has to spend that 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.040
 Turning it on at all stops the whole thing 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.800
 a bit so here you can see 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.450
 because I like the camp very much 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.539
 was improved at the lynx in the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.009
 compared to the older series the the 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.390
 of course, the volume of the 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.860
 whole optimization at mio 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.770
 that is not optimized for the camp 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.360
 but just want to frame the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.860
 fan-wing itself and so the 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.209
 you have as in the previous video already 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.550
 looked at and you have read it 

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:30.429
 if in the next part of the video look 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.000
 it still the volume and then see 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.000
 we'll be alike 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.000
 In this video we will now look at the 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:42.030
 loudness we test here the b 12 2 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.950
 it runs with 1300 megahertz of people 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.630
 is also here at this speed and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.190
 here you can now the volume 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.610
 Just do it for a moment if you guys what 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.610
 hears 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.680
 as you surely know, one leads right 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.900
 little helps maybe a light air 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.310
 noise what comes from the air flow 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.050
 but so quiet if you are not right 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.050
 sitting with your ears next to the cooler 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.310
 second would take nothing of it 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.110
 The fan is also on the floor 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.700
 speaks there can resonate 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.800
 usually come down to the cooler 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.780
 or hangs on the housing corresponds to this 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.900
 small resonance hammered first swing 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.280
 heard then also disappear 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.960
 otherwise these are the quiet ones so far 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.150
 fan with 1300 megahertz i here 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.560
 So he had noiseblocker 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.030
 all the work is done here 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.070
 technical improvement have become so 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.730
 more than paid 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.620
 but so we have such a small one 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.540
 have a strong comparison 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.160
 normal fan we close out 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.490
 the black silent pro two types up 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.490
 equal 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.340
 here as addressed the black 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.130
 silent pro 2 is expected to be up and running 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.270
 1400 revolutions per minute there would 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.270
 Let's just have a quick look 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.950
 now he heard is a bit louder 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.660
 than him if you can hear a clear 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.069
 fans now rush in comparison to 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.319
 him, of course it would still very 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.730
 quietly 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.709
 Here then also just shows the 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.150
 new rotor form again from the clubs of 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.450
 so-called loop engine like me already 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.440
 Mentioned 5000 times safely in mine 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.180
 videos film clips clips anyway that 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.120
 It would be the volume and the camps 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.940
 the single fan i hope this one 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.900
 small club has fallen again 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.280
 visit me on facebook if you 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.720
 I like my stuff 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.459
 always about new fans and comments 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.530
 to my pictures clips and what synonymous 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.300
 I always wish you that 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.500
 continue to have fun on a canal 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.450
 my facebook page with mine 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.560
 Tests and see you in the next 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.560
 test again until then
