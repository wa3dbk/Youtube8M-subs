00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.449
 in this video we will look at what 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.250
 an sshd can mean for your game 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.480
 experience and how you can replace it 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.639
 with the internal hard drive that 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.580
 included with the ps4 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.110
 first of all what is an sshd and ssh this 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.900
 combination of a conventional hard 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.100
 disk that combination with a piece of ssd 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.439
 which means he either the best 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.090
 worlds and both the low price 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.560
 can bid per good and also need there 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.359
 read and write speeds dave of one 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.529
 full ssd 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.260
 why would you put it in your playstation 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.330
 therefore want that part of the SSD 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.740
 because on that hard drive is like a 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.719
 significant difference in the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.670
 loading times of both the specific yourself 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.440
 as the games you install and 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.899
 so he just gets gaming experience 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.790
 is a lot better, it is 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.780
 easy to replace that thing than 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.010
 super easy 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.149
 since issues and ensured 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.010
 has that very easy with the hard 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.989
 disk can be here in no time 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.980
 of it and then I will show you this way 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.690
 of course already have one in advance 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.579
 number of games installed and played 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.379
 so that at the end of this video can 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.670
 see where the difference lies between the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.219
 conventional PC hard drive 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.600
 river and the sshd individual 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.100
 are going to build 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.379
 what do you need for that new one 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.180
 sshd build here playstation 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.340
 first of all you have a small one of course 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.439
 Phillips screwdriver you need 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.880
 of course the essenza the one needed to the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.290
 price is to worry about who does nothing 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.240
 necessary because you can easily do that too 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.920
 clicks that I show and you have 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.939
 need a piece of at least 1 give 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.619
 value 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.600
 fresh install update get up from my 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.830
 sony website since a new one 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.170
 booth must do the moment you get one 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.759
 your hard drives your ps4 you build then 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.840
 let's get started now 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.220
 of course before we have to start 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.400
 of course all cables from place 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.540
 national and as I said is whole 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.820
 easy to open 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.820
 through this part of the p you set with 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.290
 slide the piano paint back and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.750
 just lift the entire flaps up 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.100
 do as you can see here you can at 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.770
 your hard drive 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.329
 and it sits here and it sits in principle 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.560
 but attached to the body with a screw 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.560
 so just let it go 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.090
 and then you can just feel whole 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.910
 easy to hold out 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.530
 This is basically the hard drive 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.640
 is of course still attached to the b 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.640
 we also have to loosen that 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.470
 if you remove all 4 screws you are 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.150
 Freddy picked up the hard drive just 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.530
 at a time get out 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.960
 pay attention to where the connections are 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.750
 just another of course in one go 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.840
 you can simply slide in the inside 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.460
 and then align the score with exactly 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:41.420
 the b so that you also get more easily 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:43.160
 can do back if that push is in it 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.120
 we just put it on the same one again 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:51.220
 way back in the ps4 we close the 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.220
 door screw that we have taken out 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:02.810
 more in and that is basically the whole 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.520
 physical replacement of the hard drive 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.739
 I just said it's on that stick 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.750
 a fashion store update must also be included 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.700
 please note that the stick is suitable 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.650
 with ps4 and then I don't have it so much 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.930
 about compatibility 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.900
 but the opening of the ps4 is reasonable 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.730
 small so a really big tim drive is already 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.200
 that do not fit physically 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.459
 so therefore note that starting this 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.459
 otherwise you could not continue 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.000
 I'll just close and then 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.989
 we can go to the installation process 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.700
 access 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.739
 letter A on that software that is on the stick 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.290
 is on a formatted stick 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.100
 the god or 32 ohm recognizes the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.100
 playstation not 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.090
 of course you can also do all data savegames 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.890
 just back up your old hard drive 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.239
 on a stick via the settings menu such that 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.730
 just on your new hard drive 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.590
 continue with your savegames and files 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.030
 what you have to do when you get your new one 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.280
 you put in the sticker that you put 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.050
 put him how to turn the power button seven 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.280
 hold seconds so that the place 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.280
 is a start-up in safe mode 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.080
 if you see him here the safeboot and 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:20.810
 control must be connected 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:22.730
 with the usb cable and in that safe mode 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.830
 me now we have the bottom option 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.970
 ps4 initialize the system software 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.970
 reinstall 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.610
 are you can see now is space again 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.539
 fully initialized and ready again 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.130
 for use 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.509
 and it was very easy to get your hard 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.680
 drive to build in 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.750
 then let's take a look at what kind of 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.759
 effect that ssh has had on the 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.199
 loading times of both the ps4 and the 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.440
 games we advance 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.440
 tested 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.020
 and 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.219
 Hey 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.630
 as you can see, it has sshd 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.550
 so a very big impact on the loading time 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.389
 of the games and I price per 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.710
 gigabyte 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.979
 still much more attractive then 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.530
 The entire SSD is also the HDD switch 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.780
 in the ps4 to that sshd in load times 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.210
 much larger than from the sshd to one 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.069
 full ssd well you said more now 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.199
 information about who wants to have sshd 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:01.539
 or would you purchase it directly in my 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:04.319
 go to hardeschijfstore.nl point b or 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.319
 visit one of our stores
