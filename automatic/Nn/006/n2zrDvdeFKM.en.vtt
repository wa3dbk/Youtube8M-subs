00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.890 

and<00:01:59.390> to<00:02:00.490> reverse<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.790> so<00:02:02.240> if<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.660> have<00:02:02.810> it

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
opened and you want to close it you do

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.300 
opened and you want to close it you do
exactly<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.660> same<00:02:05.690> thing<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:07.010> back<00:02:07.130> your

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.850 
exactly the same thing to the back your
hand<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.960> get<00:02:09.080> back<00:02:09.260> move<00:02:10.070> back<00:02:10.280> out

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
hand and get back move back out

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.400 
hand and get back move back out
so<00:02:12.860> yeah<00:02:13.550> this<00:02:13.820> should<00:02:14.630> be<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:15.020> first<00:02:15.230> move

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
so yeah this should be the first move

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.520 
so yeah this should be the first move
you<00:02:15.530> learn<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:16.270> it's<00:02:17.270> really<00:02:17.810> helpful<00:02:18.230> on<00:02:18.380> the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
you learn and it's really helpful on the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.180

way<00:02:18.710> of<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.100> Bell<00:02:19.280> song<00:02:19.990> so<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.800> second<00:02:22.070> move

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
way of the Bell song so the second move

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:30.180 
way of the Bell song so the second move
that<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.430> will<00:02:22.520> be<00:02:22.610> learning<00:02:22.820> is<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:23.780> move

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
it's just so that you can put in reverse

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
again drop spin and the catch so that's

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.350 
again drop spin and the catch so that's
how<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:27.680> do<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:28.480> reverse<00:03:29.480> grip

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
thumb it's back here just spin it so

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.370 
thumb it's back here just spin it so
spin<00:05:01.890> it<00:05:02.750> with<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:03.930> and<00:05:04.910> then<00:05:05.910> you<00:05:06.270> just

finish it off by doing a full motion of

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:16.490 
finish it off by doing a full motion of
this<00:05:11.330> catching<00:05:12.330> it<00:05:13.430> there<00:05:14.930> so<00:05:15.930> once<00:05:16.140> again<00:05:16.229> the

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
this catching it there so once again the
