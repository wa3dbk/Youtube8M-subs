00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
the rollers in and yet it should be just

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.640 
the rollers in and yet it should be just
kind<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.670> slick<00:02:17.120> down<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:17.840> should<00:02:17.870> be<00:02:18.110> straight

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
kind of slick down it should be straight

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.620 
kind of slick down it should be straight
like<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.980> but<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.730> can<00:02:19.910> still<00:02:20.150> see<00:02:20.390> all<00:02:20.510> the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
like that but you can still see all the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.390 
like that but you can still see all the
kinks<00:02:21.080> in<00:02:21.260> my<00:02:21.350> hair<00:02:23.620> but<00:02:24.620> then<00:02:24.739> again<00:02:24.769> maybe<00:02:25.190> I

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
kinks in my hair but then again maybe I

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.130 
kinks in my hair but then again maybe I
put<00:02:25.640> too<00:02:25.670> much<00:02:25.910> hair<00:02:26.209> in<00:02:26.329> the<00:02:26.420> rollers<00:02:26.810> that's

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
put too much hair in the rollers that's

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.500 
put too much hair in the rollers that's
why<00:02:27.410> I<00:02:27.440> didn't<00:02:27.860> come<00:02:28.010> out<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.519> way<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.090> want<00:02:29.360> it

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
why I didn't come out the way I want it

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.449

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
to like in some places it came out a bit

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.240 
to like in some places it came out a bit
straighter<00:02:32.170> can<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.260> see<00:02:33.470> okay<00:02:33.799> like<00:02:34.010> here
