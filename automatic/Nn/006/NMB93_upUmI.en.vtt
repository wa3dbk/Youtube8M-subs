ceramic except for the bottom where
there's<00:00:39.300> copper<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.469> really<00:00:40.680> want<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> get

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
there's copper if you really want to get

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.040 
there's copper if you really want to get
the<00:00:41.039> best<00:00:41.129> use<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.480> you're<00:00:42.899> going<00:00:42.989> to

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the best use out of this you're going to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.270 
the best use out of this you're going to
want<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.230> lap<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.440> copper<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> bottom

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
want to lap the copper on the bottom

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.500 
want to lap the copper on the bottom
just<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.489> make<00:00:44.579> sure<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:44.730> not<00:00:44.909> oxidizing<00:00:45.480> or

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
just to make sure it's not oxidizing or

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.549 
just to make sure it's not oxidizing or
anything<00:00:45.749> like<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.870> but<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> copper<00:00:46.469> is

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
anything like that but the copper is

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.410 
anything like that but the copper is
still<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.920> be<00:00:47.010> much<00:00:47.190> better<00:00:47.370> than<00:00:48.210> just

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
still going to be much better than just

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.419 
still going to be much better than just
aluminum<00:00:48.839> for<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.109> bottom<00:00:49.379> it'll<00:00:49.980> help<00:00:50.309> you

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
aluminum for the bottom it'll help you

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.160 
aluminum for the bottom it'll help you
dissipate<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.969> heat<00:00:51.179> now<00:00:51.719> let's<00:00:51.960> talk<00:00:52.109> about

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
dissipate that heat now let's talk about

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.779 
dissipate that heat now let's talk about
the<00:00:52.530> stealth<00:00:52.949> technology<00:00:53.190> that's<00:00:53.579> their<00:00:53.699> low

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the stealth technology that's their low

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.090 
the stealth technology that's their low
heat<00:00:53.969> signature<00:00:54.329> ceramic<00:00:54.719> coating<00:00:55.019> and<00:00:55.469> what

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
heat signature ceramic coating and what

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.590 
heat signature ceramic coating and what
they're<00:00:56.249> saying<00:00:56.429> is<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.760> allows<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.359> to

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
they're saying is that it allows you to

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.750 
they're saying is that it allows you to
more<00:00:58.499> efficiently<00:00:58.679> dissipate<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.309> heat<00:00:59.429> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
more efficiently dissipate the heat and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.340 
more efficiently dissipate the heat and
it<00:01:00.149> also<00:01:00.239> stays<00:01:00.569> pretty<00:01:00.719> cool<00:01:00.929> to<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> touch<00:01:01.109> I

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
it also stays pretty cool to the touch I

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.750 
it also stays pretty cool to the touch I
notice<00:01:01.589> while<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> was<00:01:01.920> turned<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.249> i'm<00:01:02.550> an

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
notice while it was turned on i'm an

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.100 
notice while it was turned on i'm an
idiot<00:01:02.850> i<00:01:03.120> always<00:01:03.300> put<00:01:03.449> my<00:01:03.569> hands<00:01:03.839> on<00:01:03.899> things

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
idiot i always put my hands on things

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.750 
idiot i always put my hands on things
while<00:01:04.229> they're<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.440> like<00:01:04.680> hey<00:01:04.830> let's<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.309> but

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
while they're on like hey let's see but

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.740 
while they're on like hey let's see but
you<00:01:05.850> could<00:01:05.970> put<00:01:06.090> your<00:01:06.180> hands<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.659> it

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
you could put your hands on and it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.090 
you could put your hands on and it
didn't<00:01:06.960> feel<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.229> warm<00:01:07.440> at<00:01:07.560> all<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.010> was

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
didn't feel that warm at all so it was

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.200 
didn't feel that warm at all so it was
dissipating<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> heat<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.970> wasn't

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
dissipating the heat but it wasn't

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.789 
dissipating the heat but it wasn't
retaining<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.690> heat<00:01:09.870> and<00:01:10.020> that's<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.650> nice

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
retaining the heat and that's a nice

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.560 
retaining the heat and that's a nice
thing<00:01:11.010> that'll<00:01:11.280> allow<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.150> dissipate

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
thing that'll allow you to dissipate

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.050 
thing that'll allow you to dissipate
heat<00:01:12.780> more<00:01:13.049> quickly<00:01:13.430> first<00:01:14.430> off<00:01:14.580> let's<00:01:15.000> go

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
heat more quickly first off let's go

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.880 
heat more quickly first off let's go
through<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.540> specs<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.170> unit<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
through the specs on this unit the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.940 
through the specs on this unit the
dimensions<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:18.030> millimeters<00:01:18.270> 120<00:01:19.050> x<00:01:19.440> 120

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
dimensions are in millimeters 120 x 120

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.940 
dimensions are in millimeters 120 x 120
x<00:01:20.250> 25<00:01:20.760> now<00:01:21.300> this<00:01:21.480> fan<00:01:21.780> speed<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.260> 1,000<00:01:22.890> to

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
x 25 now this fan speed is 1,000 to

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.540 
x 25 now this fan speed is 1,000 to
2,200<00:01:23.580> RPM<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:25.070> one<00:01:26.070> thing<00:01:26.190> i<00:01:26.250> want<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> note

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
2,200 RPM and one thing i want to note

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.650 
2,200 RPM and one thing i want to note
about<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.790> fan<00:01:26.910> is<00:01:27.030> there's<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.270> really<00:01:27.420> cool

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
about the fan is there's a really cool

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.120 
about the fan is there's a really cool
LED<00:01:28.140> thing<00:01:28.350> that's<00:01:28.500> going<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:28.770> i<00:01:28.830> usually

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
LED thing that's going on i usually

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
LED thing that's going on i usually
don't<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.370> leds<00:01:29.730> but<00:01:29.910> this<00:01:30.000> one<00:01:30.120> looks

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
don't like leds but this one looks

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.430 
don't like leds but this one looks
pretty<00:01:30.300> cool<00:01:30.540> there's<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:30.870> a<00:01:30.900> pattern<00:01:31.290> and

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
pretty cool there's like a pattern and

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.470 
pretty cool there's like a pattern and
so<00:01:32.310> when<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.550> it<00:01:32.670> turn<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.850> spending<00:01:33.420> you

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
so when you have it turn on spending you

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.700 
so when you have it turn on spending you
can<00:01:33.630> see<00:01:33.720> there<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.140> pattern<00:01:34.440> is<00:01:34.530> pretty

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
can see there the pattern is pretty

had we test the temperature with this

of<00:01:53.940> the<00:01:54.000> fan<00:01:54.180> just<00:01:55.050> so<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.230> can<00:01:55.350> test<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650

than some of the others they've been

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.690 
than some of the others they've been
taking<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.409> so<00:02:10.679> if<00:02:11.159> you're<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.519> way

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
taking it so if you're going this way

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.250 
taking it so if you're going this way
you<00:02:11.760> probably<00:02:12.209> want<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.510> use<00:02:12.720> some<00:02:12.930> fancy

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
you probably want to use some fancy

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.690 
you probably want to use some fancy
thermal<00:02:13.560> paste<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:13.950> that's<00:02:14.069> how<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.250> tested<00:02:14.640> it

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
thermal paste and that's how I tested it

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.130 
thermal paste and that's how I tested it
we<00:02:14.849> use<00:02:14.970> technique<00:02:15.300> thermal<00:02:15.599> paste<00:02:15.780> we<00:02:15.930> do<00:02:16.019> not

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
we use technique thermal paste we do not

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.360 
we use technique thermal paste we do not
use<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.440> stock<00:02:16.620> kernel<00:02:16.769> paste<00:02:17.069> even<00:02:17.280> though

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
use the stock kernel paste even though

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.339 
use the stock kernel paste even though
it<00:02:17.459> looks<00:02:17.489> different<00:02:18.150> than<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.629> thermal

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
it looks different than the thermal

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.840 
it looks different than the thermal
paste<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.620> comes<00:02:19.769> with<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.920> Gaia<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.490> some<00:02:20.790> of

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
paste it comes with the Gaia and some of

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.340 
paste it comes with the Gaia and some of
the<00:02:20.910> other<00:02:21.060> xigmatek<00:02:21.450> units<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:21.930> more<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.290> a

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
the other xigmatek units it's more of a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.020 
the other xigmatek units it's more of a
silver<00:02:22.650> color<00:02:22.860> instead<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.640> white<00:02:23.819> color

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
silver color instead of the white color

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.670 
silver color instead of the white color
so<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.540> might<00:02:24.720> be<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.900> bit<00:02:25.170> better<00:02:25.380> but

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
so it might be a bit better but

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.429 
so it might be a bit better but
even<00:02:25.890> then<00:02:26.810> tested<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.900> with<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.109> good<00:02:28.230> stuff

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
even then tested it with the good stuff

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.199 
even then tested it with the good stuff
but<00:02:28.739> Annique<00:02:28.980> tested<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.519> with<00:02:29.640> an<00:02:29.760> intel<00:02:30.030> i5

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
but Annique tested this with an intel i5

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.599 
but Annique tested this with an intel i5
3570k<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.739> we<00:02:31.799> tested<00:02:32.099> it<00:02:32.159> at<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.400> stock

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
3570k and we tested it at the stock

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.789 
3570k and we tested it at the stock
clock<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.120> then<00:02:33.719> we<00:02:33.870> ramped<00:02:34.200> up<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.409> heat<00:02:34.590> by

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
clock and then we ramped up the heat by

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.009 
clock and then we ramped up the heat by
overclocking<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.519> 4.5<00:02:36.030> gigahertz<00:02:36.329> and<00:02:36.810> we

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
overclocking it to 4.5 gigahertz and we

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.630 
overclocking it to 4.5 gigahertz and we
tested<00:02:37.439> it<00:02:37.560> at<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.280> see<00:02:38.310> how<00:02:38.549> it

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
tested it at that to see how it

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.520 
tested it at that to see how it
dissipates<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.180> extra<00:02:39.659> heat<00:02:39.840> we<00:02:40.260> did<00:02:40.409> these

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
dissipates the extra heat we did these

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.220 
dissipates the extra heat we did these
tests<00:02:40.829> with<00:02:41.069> one<00:02:41.250> fan<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.730> with<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> second<00:02:43.019> fan

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
tests with one fan and with a second fan

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.289 
tests with one fan and with a second fan
so<00:02:43.709> here<00:02:43.920> are<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.069> results<00:02:44.310> The<00:02:45.030> Dark<00:02:45.239> Knight

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299

still 27 degrees and the H 130 degrees
so<00:03:10.560> i<00:03:10.769> guess<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.579> h1<00:03:11.849> hundreds<00:03:12.120> fans<00:03:12.299> weren't

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
so i guess the h1 hundreds fans weren't

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.030 
so i guess the h1 hundreds fans weren't

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
ramping up that much didn't really need

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.860

talk about duel fans because that's

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.229 
talk about duel fans because that's
where<00:03:32.310> you<00:03:32.400> really<00:03:32.430> get<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:32.729> performance<00:03:32.970> it

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.460 
where you really get the performance it

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
does add a little bit of noise but not

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.009

actually running a little bit cooler and
that's<00:03:59.430> gonna<00:03:59.790> make<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.120> lot<00:04:00.329> of<00:04:00.359> people<00:04:00.599> angry

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.510 
one I'm going to be using on all my test
benches<00:04:46.780> for<00:04:46.960> now<00:04:47.080> on<00:04:47.260> or<00:04:47.650> until<00:04:48.130> I<00:04:48.160> get<00:04:48.370> you

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
benches for now on or until I get you

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.280 
benches for now on or until I get you
know<00:04:48.610> some<00:04:48.790> ridiculous<00:04:49.660> water<00:04:49.870> cooling<00:04:50.169> kit

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
know some ridiculous water cooling kit

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.080 
know some ridiculous water cooling kit
but<00:04:50.470> this<00:04:51.370> is<00:04:51.460> going<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:51.639> go<00:04:51.729> on<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:51.910> test

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
but this is going to go on the test

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.219 
but this is going to go on the test
bench<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:52.479> we're<00:04:52.630> going<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:52.810> be<00:04:52.870> using<00:04:52.900> this

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
bench and we're going to be using this

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.689 
bench and we're going to be using this
thing<00:04:53.290> because<00:04:53.880> it's<00:04:54.880> decent<00:04:55.570> performance<00:04:56.699> so

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
thing because it's decent performance so

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.580 
thing because it's decent performance so
I'd<00:04:57.910> only<00:04:57.940> have<00:04:58.180> much<00:04:58.350> negative<00:04:59.350> to<00:04:59.440> say<00:04:59.560> about

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
I'd only have much negative to say about

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.490 
I'd only have much negative to say about
the<00:04:59.860> build<00:05:00.010> quality<00:05:00.100> was<00:05:00.580> top-notch<00:05:01.030> defense

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
the build quality was top-notch defense

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.439 
the build quality was top-notch defense
felt<00:05:02.500> I<00:05:02.740> guess<00:05:03.490> they<00:05:03.610> didn't<00:05:03.850> feel<00:05:03.970> as<00:05:04.150> good<00:05:04.300> as

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
felt I guess they didn't feel as good as

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.590 
felt I guess they didn't feel as good as
some<00:05:05.110> units<00:05:05.560> but<00:05:05.800> I<00:05:06.270> mean<00:05:07.270> it's<00:05:07.389> still<00:05:07.449> going

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
some units but I mean it's still going

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.909 
some units but I mean it's still going
to<00:05:07.660> last<00:05:07.780> several<00:05:07.990> years<00:05:08.199> I<00:05:08.320> like<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:08.710> rubber

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
to last several years I like the rubber

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:10.560 
to last several years I like the rubber
that<00:05:09.639> you're<00:05:09.820> going<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:10.000> be<00:05:10.090> using<00:05:10.150> to<00:05:10.389> mount

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
that you're going to be using to mount

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.590 
that you're going to be using to mount
these<00:05:10.690> with<00:05:10.960> that<00:05:11.229> makes<00:05:11.500> me<00:05:11.620> happy<00:05:12.240> it's<00:05:13.240> you

these with that makes me happy it's you

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.200 
these with that makes me happy it's you
know<00:05:13.690> low<00:05:13.870> noise<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:14.530> reduces<00:05:15.370> vibrations<00:05:15.940> so

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
know low noise and reduces vibrations so

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.850 
know low noise and reduces vibrations so
trying<00:05:16.900> to<00:05:16.990> think<00:05:17.139> of<00:05:17.229> something<00:05:17.350> I<00:05:17.530> do<00:05:17.590> not

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
trying to think of something I do not

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.800 
trying to think of something I do not
like<00:05:18.160> about<00:05:18.220> this<00:05:18.639> I<00:05:18.850> don't<00:05:19.630> know<00:05:19.690> if<00:05:19.750> you

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
like about this I don't know if you

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.100 
like about this I don't know if you
don't<00:05:19.960> like<00:05:20.050> LEDs<00:05:20.500> then<00:05:20.830> there's<00:05:21.280> that<00:05:22.110> you

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
don't like LEDs then there's that you

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.719 
don't like LEDs then there's that you
got<00:05:23.229> a<00:05:23.260> fluid<00:05:23.560> fluid<00:05:23.770> bearing<00:05:24.220> fan<00:05:24.520> that's

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
got a fluid fluid bearing fan that's

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.760 
got a fluid fluid bearing fan that's
decent<00:05:24.970> it's<00:05:25.660> just<00:05:25.870> a<00:05:25.930> decent<00:05:26.380> unit<00:05:26.500> for<00:05:26.740> a

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
decent it's just a decent unit for a

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:47.790 
decent it's just a decent unit for a
really<00:05:27.010> decent<00:05:27.160> price

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800
