00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 m 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.550
 you talked to communities today about the importance of 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.019
 perfect traceability and commodity prices in this case without sharing 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.829
 dayan radio frequencies 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.239
 a nuclear incident occurred in Japan with several is a small accent 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.400
 on vonn in japan following the goal the earthquakes and the tsunami of the 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.439
 march talk about a poll what measures the lfp can help precisely the 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.730
 Japanese 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.860
 the elderly German saint-catherine-de-hatley handle 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.860
 animations may contain radioactive elements 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.840
 ben rf idea technology so this is radio frequency identification 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.610
 is used to identify some complain about certain products to 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.520
 certain places in a context of traceability and thus of solutions of 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.360
 management for traceability 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.090
 it makes it possible to identify the products 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.700
 they pile up every place they were grown where where one 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.170
 see for example in an example of meat the meat was to treat her 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.630
 where else besides the treaty or with humor has been transformed to which 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.109
 place nantel and then permits to identify 

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:11.909
 information then had the solutions to manage at the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.880
 training so to know from mans 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.500
 we do not like the sala for example 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.760
 they were acquitted cellectis vaka place was in contact with which 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.850
 shame of affected products but mostly sent to the price and in the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.630
 tablets of large distributors that is produced to shoot what it takes 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.930
 to pull this case on the shelves we can just specify what removed 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.160
 if we take the five parties on vacation last year tells you that he's silly 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.330
 the deposits of the problems at the level of the cheese makers 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.729
 of Quebec who with distracting them with listeria what happened is 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.750
 that all formats gf cheeses from Quebec have been removed from the shelves 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.180
 that was it and it's a human impact all formats structure allows the 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.830
 tablets that's the major impact 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.230
 for the redon cheese and québec industry, which is 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.020
 even companies that did not get up to equihen who did 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.080
 bankruptcy and of course my back wheel for magistrates and many% north of 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.450
 wrong 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.530
 m 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.590
 readjust the blazon of Quebec cheese is a very good cheese 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.659
 here is it because it's at a crisis like that that winter all the cheeses 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.749
 are assigned to the cnc 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:13.229
 and for good reason during the crisis in Japan by the way a lot of TV James with 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:15.839
 the radioactivity in ten other dancers of the Germans really did 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:18.679
 sounded the salads some dairy products how can the Japanese 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.709
 actually know if it consumes products 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.299
 which at the same time the radioactivity 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.979
 this is their level of large distribution chains located at the level of the 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.620
 transformation chain that training must be happening% 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.750
 but in this level of technology we need clear training support only in 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.650
 the big ones even the department stores the distributions they are able 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.880
 to identify and remove them right away 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.260
 % but there is one of the theatrical solutions that happens allowed to big 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.210
 books alisation as the weight of the sausset of the initiative for the town hall 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.530
 jean to an extreme situation globally to set standards in 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.600
 traceability identification spot having seen my work through its 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.200
 chains could process the information at a low level and bring it back to high 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.589
 level so one day maybe there consumers have access to 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:05.099
 with direct traceability it is possible the army also has the demand for 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.789
 reason to be problematic in his wake I'm not sure and for 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.679
 sure it's a long-term job 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.879
 and in terms of precisely helping the isaf denied wanting 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:14.470
 dispel 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.560
 eat didier rous food 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.219
 outside the country 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.399
 to what extent do I attack traceability by MPs 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.119
 enjoy alagui canadian culture 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:28.589
 currently in its hell export the importing countries have 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:31.049
 very large size requirements 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.969
 at the level of dallas certifications et cetera what's going on and that 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.139
 the techno if you use the presents are not the men of japan in the 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.969
 meat% s they want to bring the beautiful book to dubai demanded that the tribute of 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.059
 the animal is identified or certify that such animal has been slaughtered to such 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.800
 age she is transformed she added 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.980
 so we use indeed fi relégables to identify the animal of the 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.180
 birth until its transformation 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.739
 and r so we are able to gain alerts and 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.699
 the international and all the countries follow suit and currently a 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:07.229
 jack in north america in presence on the united states and percent and the 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.959
 Quebec as such is considered a region in the 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.609
 world besides technology to use technologies for the 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.149
 most advanced facility 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:19.259
 so we are recognized we are known and we win we know badly to win our 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:23.860
 market is how to use that to facilitate the export especially to 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.250
 level admits to being in the preservation of cultures with the mates to the only 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:29.800
 Quebec tax altogether and children the federation if he is one of 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.889
 producers of quebec 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.729
 maple syrup producers in quebec want to use technology to 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.979
 make an identification years of falls from the producer to the transformer and 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.770
 if the processors continue teaser from this traceability to the product 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.410
 finished 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.199
 it may be one of the first in quebec or canada 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.820
 to use it percent a traceability of the farm ferment haro 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.220
 end consumer and I use that as the government looks a lot 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:55.400
 projects 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.180
 do not like what maple syrup is so much about when you lend to 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.090
 canada and that's going to open export level barriers so 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.800
 it could be that with his own trial 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.020
 dancyger summed up% to take peace will be the point on the traceability of 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.900
 to not be let them in the field of food know that it allows 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.180
 in fact he's products from the shelves his hand 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.100
 abbas for sale to consumers 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.120
 for example 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.260
 % and 6% and food tickets may contain the 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.319
 radioactivity 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.830
 the forest and the wires were gone from the identifiers that are more 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.440
 usable in traceability processes 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.430
 so for some parliaments level of its use yes the 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.560
 stories from the countries considered to make good traceability the German in 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.560
 agri-food processing and ensured security 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.680
