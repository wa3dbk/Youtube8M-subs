interest is to show their work not just

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.410 
interest is to show their work not just
for<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.650> MIT<00:01:58.950> community<00:01:59.280> to<00:02:00.000> see<00:02:00.210> what

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
for the MIT community to see what

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.880 
for the MIT community to see what
they're<00:02:00.540> doing<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.990> also<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.380> themselves

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890

because<00:02:22.939> I<00:02:23.150> didn't<00:02:23.450> think<00:02:23.659> that<00:02:24.290> many<00:02:24.530> people

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
because I didn't think that many people

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.440 
because I didn't think that many people
would<00:02:24.980> come<00:02:25.219> I<00:02:25.430> had<00:02:25.549> invited<00:02:25.760> some<00:02:26.060> friends
