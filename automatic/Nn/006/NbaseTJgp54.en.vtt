00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 well let's start is in this 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.550
 small verse 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.750
 Mr. phones which are the 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.430
 is the galaxy note 4 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.430
 salsa flagship 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.610
 and here we have the second motor 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.210
 generation but because of the peculiarity of 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.099
 that I have managed to put the version 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.270
 lollipop that they have put now makes 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.450
 bit 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:35.570
 by the way super curious 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:38.460
 on the phone but superbly 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.520
 awesome speed 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.390
 then let's make a small 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.390
 comparative speed 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.590
 well here we have open the same 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.739
 page we see that the pick to zoom is 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.470
 good on both phones obviously this 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.860
 phone is much cheaper 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.240
 in motogp but it's funny that I already have 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.670
 the latest version of the operating system 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.830
 android who already are releasing those 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.250
 right now only in canada and little else 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.480
 but we see that it is already on the way and here 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.580
 I do not have it has not come out and 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.659
 and who knows how long it will take to upload 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.929
 to update 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.450
 and then we will see how it goes when 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.520
 let's go to a link when not 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.200
 when we are taking action towards a 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.200
 page that we were loaded before 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.840
 two 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.579
 the truth is that it is quite telling 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.130
 because practically the motorola has 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.409
 jumped at the same time it 's clear that 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.560
 already after the issue of loading the page 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.460
 completely he does not beat you but he is 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.569
 amazing as a phone that is worth 6 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.899
 times less good is ponce 54 times 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.899
 less 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.970
 almost give you a user experience 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.630
 similar to a high - end phone 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.119
 now 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.890
 in the part of multitasking 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.069
 lets try 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.900
 and show a little bit what it is like 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.720
 unwinds on both phones despite 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.620
 that the motorola we have only one giga 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.800
 of ram and here in the lot we have 3 gigas 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.200
 of good ram obviously should come out 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.910
 losing the engine I have not tried it 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.830
 too much because this one has 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.830
 promised this morning and not 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.200
 it would be matter 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.210
 Let's see how the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.380
 small square would be for the multitasking of 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:51.750
 motorola and here it would be in the north 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.750
 1 2 3 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.510
 wrong 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.510
 let's try again 1 2 3 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.300
 it seems that they do not matter if we look at 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.050
 Although on the left we have 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.050
 typical 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.750
 4 points 4.4 here we have android 5 and 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.780
 see that here 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.140
 samsung almost like that copy the way that 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.140
 have 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:31.640
 in a very curious thing obviously me 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.960
 I see that in this case the animation is more 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.180
 resolved 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.580
 that this is native and this is one thing 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.730
 that your father has caused to simulate what 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.379
 that is not bad but 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.360
 I do not know, I'm not convinced 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.200
 nor in the heap list 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.200
 we're going to reward well 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.060
 it seems that the animation even have 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.530
 copied 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.530
 let's see we continue with multitasking 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.920
 we go 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.400
 and I 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.870
 and it's beginning to surprise me 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.630
 We are not going to go back to the 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.980
 website because as you remember the 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.910
 web page 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.560
 I do not have it closed 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.100
 it would be very good to remember the 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.100
 web page 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.830
 on the note you are going to remember 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:43.229
 but in the engine I also suspect that 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.550
 will not be able with the memory that 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.080
 have 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.080
 we go back to the web page 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.950
 here we have to recharge 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.750
 obviously this is not a thing either 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.760
 too surprising because in the 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.650
 field this has a gig of ram now I 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.300
 I turn to gemma he was going to a lot of 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.590
 they come I'm going to projector and it's going 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:10.380
 superbly I'm going to maps and also 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.170
 super fast for the new play music 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.580
 here it seems that it has been ruled out 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.979
 memory let's go 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.409
 back to the web page then look at the 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:25.919
 remembering I think that even the 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:25.919
 management is better than what we had in 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:32.410
 in kita 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.360
 but still it shows but you will not notice 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.930
 practically nothing compared to 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.820
 other phones that I already tell you the engine 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.449
 which I believe is one of the telephones 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:46.409
 more bombshell that they have stuck this year 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:49.379
 and the note is great 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:52.439
 say that the note is a phone that 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:54.809
 has everything has super super power 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:57.809
 incredible screen speed 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:06:00.059
 has lots of things but you have to 

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:03.330
 give merit to Motorola because this 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:05.729
 terminal is awesome then that 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.459
 more things could teach because I do not know if 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.139
 you have some idea or something that 

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:13.080
 you want me to teach the engine aside 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:17.669
 from the note or whatever it is, leave me a 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:21.089
 comment and if you want me to do some 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.409
 some analysis of something I have 

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:25.259
 in account is that I what I have now 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:27.449
 same is this I do not have a 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.729
 incredible budget as they have 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.800
 Some 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.569
 sponsorships or anything like that I what 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.920
 What I have is all I can teach 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:37.020
 so 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.060
 ask what you want and I will try 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.150
 answer you 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:44.090
 and do not forget to give them a like because 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.460
 that throws an important cable to see if 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:51.280
 I get the channel to rise a little 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.280
 it's very much appreciated and see you later
