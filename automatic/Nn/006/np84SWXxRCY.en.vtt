00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
community just present what works well

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.610 
community just present what works well
with<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> game<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.199> next<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.500> is

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
with the game so the next one is

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.529 
with the game so the next one is
different<00:00:56.280> levels<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.090> obviously<00:00:57.329> we've<00:00:57.449> had

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
different levels so obviously we've had

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.060 
different levels so obviously we've had
the<00:00:57.629> giant<00:00:57.960> level<00:00:58.170> 7<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.559> we've<00:00:58.649> had<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the giant level 7 and we've had the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.520 
the giant level 7 and we've had the
Bavarian<00:01:00.000> Archie<00:01:00.210> level<00:01:00.510> 7<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.320> also

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
Bavarian Archie level 7 but I also

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.619 
Bavarian Archie level 7 but I also
thinking<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.670> might<00:01:02.699> want<00:01:03.180> goblins

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
thinking that we might want goblins

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.890 
thinking that we might want goblins
level<00:01:03.899> 7<00:01:04.199> dragon<00:01:04.470> level<00:01:05.010> 5<00:01:05.240> dark<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.450> level<00:01:06.689> five

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and which level three and obviously we

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.960

state of town 11 I wanted bothered about
this<00:01:26.549> one<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:27.030> I'll<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.450> means<00:01:27.600> more

free<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> operate<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.590> i<00:01:28.799> think<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.460> v8

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
free to operate but i think this is a v8

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.819 
free to operate but i think this is a v8
and<00:01:30.420> inevitable<00:01:31.140> was<00:01:31.259> given<00:01:31.470> someone's<00:01:31.710> going

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
and inevitable was given someone's going

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.620 
and inevitable was given someone's going
to<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.070> happen<00:01:32.310> eventually<00:01:32.939> so

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
to have to happen eventually so

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.880 
to have to happen eventually so
hopefully<00:01:33.960> we'll<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.770> next

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890

just<00:03:17.960> not<00:03:18.290> like<00:03:18.530> extra<00:03:19.010> but<00:03:19.460> it's<00:03:19.610> not<00:03:19.790> a

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
just not like extra but it's not a

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.340 
just not like extra but it's not a
massively<00:03:20.330> in<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.570> game<00:03:20.750> yet<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.020> think<00:03:21.200> it's

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
massively in the game yet I think it's

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.650 
massively in the game yet I think it's
going<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.560> be<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.710> big<00:03:21.980> thing<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.030> think<00:03:23.450> if<00:03:23.540> we

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
going to be a big thing so I think if we

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.740 
going to be a big thing so I think if we
get<00:03:24.380> some<00:03:24.530> more<00:03:24.790> ways<00:03:25.790> going<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.150> XP<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.660> then

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
get some more ways going to XP and then

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.480 
get some more ways going to XP and then
some<00:03:26.960> more<00:03:27.080> clam<00:03:27.320> perks<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:28.100> should<00:03:28.340> be

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
some more clam perks that should be

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.840 
some more clam perks that should be
quite<00:03:29.210> good<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:30.380> next<00:03:30.620> one<00:03:30.740> is<00:03:30.770> heroes<00:03:31.460> in<00:03:31.640> war

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
quite good the next one is heroes in war

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.280 
quite good the next one is heroes in war
whilst<00:03:32.090> upgrading<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:32.750> now<00:03:32.840> this<00:03:32.900> is<00:03:33.020> a<00:03:33.080> big

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
whilst upgrading and now this is a big

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.990 
whilst upgrading and now this is a big
one<00:03:33.440> for<00:03:33.590> me<00:03:33.650> because<00:03:34.160> obviously<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.490> war<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.760> lot

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
one for me because obviously a war a lot

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.640 
one for me because obviously a war a lot
but<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.180> also<00:03:35.390> farm<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:35.870> lot<00:03:35.990> which<00:03:36.260> means<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.530> I

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
but I also farm a lot which means that I

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.890 
but I also farm a lot which means that I
have<00:03:36.740> a<00:03:37.190> lot<00:03:37.430> of<00:03:37.460> XP<00:03:37.910> a<00:03:38.060> lot<00:03:38.210> of<00:03:38.270> dark<00:03:38.420> excess<00:03:38.750> re

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
have a lot of XP a lot of dark excess re

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.250 
have a lot of XP a lot of dark excess re
to<00:03:39.530> spend<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.690> usually<00:03:41.690> just<00:03:41.720> sits<00:03:42.020> my

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
to spend and usually just sits my

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.170 
to spend and usually just sits my
storage<00:03:42.860> is<00:03:42.950> until<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.220> can<00:03:43.730> be<00:03:43.880> bothered<00:03:44.030> to

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
storage is until I can be bothered to

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.700 
storage is until I can be bothered to
take<00:03:44.300> a<00:03:44.360> week<00:03:44.630> off<00:03:44.780> wall<00:03:45.020> to<00:03:45.290> stop<00:03:45.500> greater

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
take a week off wall to stop greater

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.820 
take a week off wall to stop greater
hero<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:47.060> that's<00:03:47.270> a<00:03:47.330> very<00:03:47.360> fun<00:03:47.720> so<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:48.440> think<00:03:48.560> if

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
hero and that's a very fun so I think if

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.950 
hero and that's a very fun so I think if
we<00:03:48.980> were<00:03:49.130> able<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.490> upgrade<00:03:50.270> heroes<00:03:50.780> during

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
we were able to upgrade heroes during

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.580 
we were able to upgrade heroes during
wall<00:03:51.350> that<00:03:52.040> will<00:03:52.160> really<00:03:52.490> help<00:03:52.670> out<00:03:52.910> with<00:03:53.590> just

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
wall that will really help out with just

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.740 
wall that will really help out with just
kind<00:03:55.010> of<00:03:55.040> get<00:03:55.310> in<00:03:55.400> what<00:03:55.670> was<00:03:55.790> done<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.240> me

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
kind of get in what was done to me

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.750 
kind of get in what was done to me
bigger<00:03:56.990> clan<00:03:57.200> wars<00:03:57.440> more<00:03:57.980> XP<00:03:58.340> if<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.550> clan

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760

be certain uses a lot my hair is a bit

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.510 
be certain uses a lot my hair is a bit
pregnant<00:04:06.440> all<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.710> time<00:04:06.860> if<00:04:07.220> this<00:04:07.370> was<00:04:07.490> the

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
pregnant all the time if this was the

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.910 
pregnant all the time if this was the
case<00:04:07.610> and<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:08.810> mean<00:04:08.959> it's<00:04:09.080> just<00:04:09.110> to<00:04:09.709> go<00:04:09.830> out

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
case and I mean it's just to go out

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.440 
case and I mean it's just to go out
there<00:04:09.950> I<00:04:10.250> mean<00:04:10.580> super<00:04:10.820> sexy<00:04:11.180> while<00:04:11.330> they're

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
there I mean super sexy while they're

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.540 
there I mean super sexy while they're
not<00:04:11.540> putting<00:04:12.230> it<00:04:12.410> in<00:04:12.440> at<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.680> moment<00:04:12.890> but<00:04:13.340> I

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
not putting it in at the moment but I

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.400 
not putting it in at the moment but I
think<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:14.120> really<00:04:14.150> good<00:04:14.780> possibility<00:04:15.230> that<00:04:15.260> we

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
think it really good possibility that we

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.640 
think it really good possibility that we
should<00:04:15.590> have<00:04:15.830> in<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.100> future<00:04:16.220> so<00:04:17.209> it's

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
should have in the future so it's

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.810 
should have in the future so it's
certainly<00:04:18.650> something<00:04:18.830> which<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:19.250> really<00:04:19.609> want

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
certainly something which I really want

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.750 
certainly something which I really want
and<00:04:20.000> that's<00:04:20.810> probably<00:04:21.290> really<00:04:22.250> high<00:04:22.550> up<00:04:22.580> that

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
and that's probably really high up that

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.440 
and that's probably really high up that
list<00:04:23.060> on<00:04:23.240> why<00:04:23.450> really<00:04:23.750> want

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
list on why really want

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.470 
list on why really want
one<00:04:24.660> of<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.900> top<00:04:25.140> two<00:04:25.800> or<00:04:25.830> three<00:04:26.040> things<00:04:26.480> this

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
one of the top two or three things this

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.990 
one of the top two or three things this
one<00:04:27.660> is<00:04:27.870> stacking<00:04:28.380> suppose<00:04:28.650> obviously<00:04:29.490> you

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
one is stacking suppose obviously you

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.910 
one is stacking suppose obviously you
can<00:04:30.210> stack<00:04:30.570> stuff<00:04:31.110> in<00:04:31.260> your<00:04:31.350> barracks<00:04:31.590> when

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
can stack stuff in your barracks when

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.650 
can stack stuff in your barracks when
you<00:04:32.010> are<00:04:32.250> reading<00:04:32.490> you'd<00:04:32.790> have<00:04:32.880> a<00:04:32.910> composition

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
you are reading you'd have a composition

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.820 
you are reading you'd have a composition
or<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:34.020> trained<00:04:34.260> up<00:04:34.440> that<00:04:34.590> will<00:04:34.680> start

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
or it trained up that will start

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.050 
or it trained up that will start
training<00:04:35.190> whilst<00:04:35.370> you're<00:04:35.550> using<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:35.850> troops

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
training whilst you're using the troops

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.820 
training whilst you're using the troops
in<00:04:36.180> your<00:04:36.300> raid<00:04:36.450> but<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:37.050> can't<00:04:37.410> stack<00:04:37.680> up

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
in your raid but you can't stack up

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.410 
in your raid but you can't stack up
spells<00:04:38.130> which<00:04:38.700> I<00:04:38.850> mean<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.000> don't<00:04:39.180> really<00:04:39.210> see

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
spells which I mean I don't really see

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.090 
spells which I mean I don't really see
why<00:04:39.450> you<00:04:39.600> can't<00:04:39.870> so<00:04:40.410> I<00:04:40.440> think<00:04:40.590> we<00:04:40.920> should<00:04:40.950> be

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
why you can't so I think we should be

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.390 
why you can't so I think we should be
able<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.280> do<00:04:41.370> that<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:43.010> because<00:04:44.010> I<00:04:44.040> just<00:04:44.190> think

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
able to do that and because I just think

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.090 
able to do that and because I just think
it<00:04:44.520> will<00:04:44.640> improve<00:04:44.880> you<00:04:45.630> know<00:04:45.780> but<00:04:46.500> raiding

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
it will improve you know but raiding

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.510 
it will improve you know but raiding
things<00:04:47.490> like<00:04:47.580> that<00:04:47.670> we<00:04:48.240> should<00:04:48.540> help<00:04:48.960> with

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
possibility in the future so i think

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.090 
possibility in the future so i think
that<00:05:24.150> raised<00:05:24.360> me<00:05:24.390> that<00:05:25.050> is<00:05:25.800> going<00:05:25.980> to<00:05:26.040> be

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
that raised me that is going to be

that raised me that is going to be
looking<00:05:26.280> into<00:05:26.460> i<00:05:26.550> think<00:05:26.850> it's<00:05:26.970> good<00:05:27.090> idea

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
looking into i think it's good idea

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.540 
looking into i think it's good idea
because<00:05:27.720> it<00:05:27.960> could<00:05:28.140> kind<00:05:28.350> of<00:05:28.470> maybe<00:05:29.310> some

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
because it could kind of maybe some

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.310 
because it could kind of maybe some

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
the game which could be quite fun bit

more<00:05:34.260> competitive<00:05:34.710> aspects<00:05:35.040> i<00:05:35.100> suppose

more competitive aspects i suppose

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.780

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
because obviously the higher up trophy

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.940 
because obviously the higher up trophy
pushes<00:05:39.120> they<00:05:39.360> have<00:05:39.450> a<00:05:39.480> big<00:05:40.050> competitive<00:05:40.590> kind

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950
