00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.020
 very good to everyone today here as always 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.059
 with more peace fill 4 and today is Wednesday 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.510
 so I bring you another weapons review 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.490
 today I have the 971 aec a very weapon but 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.050
 very popular in butterfield 3 and a weapon 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.610
 which is quite popular also in bad 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.770
 feel 4 maybe not as much as it was 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.360
 before but it's still a weapon 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.100
 very strong and for me one of the best 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.020
 assault rifles of the game as well as 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.480
 also one of the best weapons in 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.190
 general let's say so as always I'm going 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.210
 to start with statistics and then 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.290
 I will move on to give my opinions 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.260
 personal 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.940
 my experience etcetera as I said the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.220
 statistics that we have here for 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.560
 start is a maximum damage of 25 damage 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.690
 minimum of 18 that starts to be reduced 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.059
 at 8 meters and reaches the minimum damage 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.730
 at 55 he has a firing rate 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.850
 of 900 bursts per minute which 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.079
 travel at 580 meters per second and 320 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.390
 meters per second if we have a 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.250
 muffler the magazine is 31 bullets 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.600
 maximum following now with the 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.670
 secondary statistics that are going to 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.380
 appear now on screen we have the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.660
 recharge speed when we have the 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.580
 completely empty charger is 3.6 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.500
 seconds and when we have even one 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.270
 bullet still in the charger is 2.3 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.100
 a recharge speed 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.200
 before long let's say especially if we 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.789
 we are without bullets in the charger that is 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.920
 something quite simple is something quite 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.509
 common rather the one that happens since 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.520
 we fired nine hundred bursts 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.740
 minute as we mentioned above and 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.829
 then we have the recoil up 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.469
 is 0.38 for the left is 0.15 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:37.219
 and for the right is 0.4 with a 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.840
 recoil of the first shot of 3.0 very 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.369
 well now that I get the statistics 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.110
 on the side we can go to everything that was 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.119
 in my personal experience with the weapon 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.369
 my tips and so on 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.750
 starting tests so many configurations 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.390
 with this weapon about everything they are 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.489
 front antlers and guns let's say or 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.590
 accessories in the barrel and I came to a 

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:56.270
 configuration that convinced me quite 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.369
 and it's the one that I'm using for now is the 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.579
 Mira Cobra as you can see here the look 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.259
 laser the muffler and the front 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.360
 angled if I'm not mistaken, it's called 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.130
 in Spanish, you can see it well, if not 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.539
 can play the video again and 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.459
 see it from the beginning or pause the 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.810
 video and see what accessories you have but 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.299
 this is basically a configuration 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.920
 that convinced me enough and it was good 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.959
 balanced between what is shot from 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.910
 the aim and control hip 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.490
 backward without affecting too much what 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.960
 is 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.090
 of the bullets the separation of the bullets 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.830
 when it fires because these 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.750
 accessories first the muffler me 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.270
 it seems that it is the best accessory in the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.790
 game for now and effectively the best 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.710
 accessory for what is barrels antlers 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.140
 front I tried quite a lot with the 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.060
 vertical or with it I do not know how it 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.770
 called ergonomics as they are called and 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.690
 After a while I saw that they did not serve me 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.670
 too much I felt that the first kick 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.070
 the recoil of the first bullet sorry 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.540
 I was very, very tall, so good 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.640
 I went to the statistics page 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.780
 I fixed after playing a while with him 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.910
 forward was angled until 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.920
 come the screen and I said yes 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.230
 effectively the recoil of the first 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.670
 bullet is very high so I thought that 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.710
 this one was the best until he could 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.620
 use maybe it does not finish me 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.600
 convince at all how could be the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.850
 vertical handle and how they were but i feel 3 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.710
 but of all there is the best 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.180
 what remains for me and especially as 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.830
 I like to play with this weapon as 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.270
 you can see it here in the video after 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.710
 good as I said the muffler the 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.060
 look laser obviously if they want 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.590
 use a flashlight may use 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.440
 but the truth is that I do not see him 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.970
 too much use may be that in 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.800
 the odd map or in some other 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.970
 situation as' operation lockers and 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.220
 probably 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.260
 Metro operation when it comes out second 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.180
 assault for pc but for now I 'm going to 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.040
 stay with the laser sight the look cobra 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.300
 as I said it is your selection of you 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.670
 the one they liked the most was using 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.830
 the coyote looks that we say people say 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.360
 which is the best is the one that least occupies in 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.890
 the screen but the truth is that the 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.320
 dot that I sometimes lose it 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.510
 completely so I decided to go back to the 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.850
 old cobra of bat filtres never me 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.320
 failed so why is not that according to 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.330
 as you like more there are some who use 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.160
 look at just graphics others that use the 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.320
 Look, she reflected, she looks also receives 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.300
 with the ecc in bad fil 3 and I was better 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.010
 It's just a matter of taste and 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.540
 get used to which ones are going 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.090
 better which one suits us more to us 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.920
 besides this how to use the gun and 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.660
 which is a weapon that takes a long time 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.280
 recharge has a lot of 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.260
 recoil and shoot very fast which 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.910
 increases the recoil itself since it 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.400
 multiply every time we shoot a 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.190
 cannonball is just managed to control 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.140
 first between let's say bursts of five 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.760
 bullets around maybe seven and you 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.130
 it was short distances a little more 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.870
 but always try to shoot bursts 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.510
 very followed and sometimes less and 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.250
 I've even shot in 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.840
 that this weapon has different modes of 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.940
 shot has semiautomatic 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.560
 automatic and by rafa is arrived 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.660
 shoot it in burst mode when they are 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.900
 stockings for long distances let's do 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.340
 about 60 70 meters something like that but about 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.380
 everything when I do not have the silencer 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.449
 when I have the muffler basically 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.669
 nor do I try how can you see me here I see 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.410
 some objectives that are in good 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.080
 coverages and a medium distance and 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.030
 directly step to shoot them so 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.530
 as I said you can use this weapon 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.080
 in quite a few ways it's a matter of 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.699
 get used to controlling that 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.040
 recoil that we can get to go 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.630
 hands very easily and as well as 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.910
 also get used to that this weapon does not 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.070
 it's pure advantages let's say they sacrifice 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.500
 lots of statistics to have a 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.000
 very good firing rate when the 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.740
 compares against other weapons in 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.240
 page statistics without pick 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.520
 puntocom where he got these 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.900
 statistics that I show you 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.479
 basically the weapon loses in a lot 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.030
 of aspects with only one advantage 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.440
 which is the 900 bursts per minute and for 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.539
 go closing the video I still have to tell you 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.919
 two things first try to use 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.539
 this weapon but you do not need to 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.729
 use the truth as I do not 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.800
 let's say this is not the best the best 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.630
 best combination of accessories 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.210
 who has the weapon and is required to 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.039
 everyone 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.660
 it's just how I got used to it and 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.550
 How do I like to use laws like 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.110
 me me you probably serves them 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.030
 will serve otherwise or they will use it 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.740
 in another way and the second thing is that if 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.970
 they have some weapon to recommend me for 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.410
 an upcoming episode can leave me 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.389
 down in the comments but as 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.380
 I always hope you liked us 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.380
 we see the next chau
