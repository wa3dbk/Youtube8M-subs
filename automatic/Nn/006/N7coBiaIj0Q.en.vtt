00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
watch arm and the pair because yours has

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.990 
watch arm and the pair because yours has
worn<00:00:40.410> out<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.860> all<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.730> do<00:00:41.850> is

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
worn out and all you have to do is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.340 
worn out and all you have to do is
replace<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.480> pin<00:00:42.719> because<00:00:42.899> what<00:00:43.079> happens

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
replace this pin because what happens

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.560 
replace this pin because what happens
over<00:00:43.469> time<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.980> from<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> friction<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.450> on

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
over time is from the friction and on

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.600 
over time is from the friction and on
the<00:00:45.690> wear<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.200> puts<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.530> dent<00:00:46.680> into<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.100> pin<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the wear it puts a dent into the pin and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.350 
the wear it puts a dent into the pin and
it<00:00:47.789> won't<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.059> able<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:49.039> UM<00:00:50.039> go<00:00:50.370> go<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.120> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
it won't be able to UM go go in and you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.850 
it won't be able to UM go go in and you
know<00:00:51.449> disengage<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> bike<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.620> will<00:00:52.739> be

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
know disengage the bike and it will be

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.400 
know disengage the bike and it will be
partly<00:00:53.300> engaged<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.510> disengaged<00:00:54.600> causing

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
partly engaged and disengaged causing

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.400 
partly engaged and disengaged causing
your<00:00:55.559> engine<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:57.480> know<00:00:57.600> trying<00:00:58.350> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
your engine to be you know trying to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.779 
your engine to be you know trying to
look<00:00:58.469> forward<00:00:58.859> because<00:00:59.340> that's<00:00:59.520> what<00:00:59.699> it's

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
look forward because that's what it's

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.959 
look forward because that's what it's
trying<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:01.559> these<00:01:02.370> are<00:01:02.520> two<00:01:02.730> problems

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
trying to do so these are two problems

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.830 
trying to do so these are two problems
call<00:01:03.719> charm<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.309> pin<00:01:05.659> get<00:01:06.659> those

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
call charm and the pin get those

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.929 
call charm and the pin get those
replaced<00:01:07.110> you'll<00:01:07.650> be<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.430> fine

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
replaced you'll be just fine

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.320 
replaced you'll be just fine
don't<00:01:09.270> go<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.869> buy<00:01:09.930> another<00:01:10.229> engine<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.330> did

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
don't go and buy another engine I did

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.270 
don't go and buy another engine I did
that<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.720> spend<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> lot<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.350> money<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:14.220> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that and I spend a lot of money on a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.499 
that and I spend a lot of money on a
skywalk<00:01:14.700> which<00:01:15.270> was<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> stupid<00:01:16.049> idea<00:01:17.299> but<00:01:18.299> um

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
skywalk which was a stupid idea but um

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.280 
skywalk which was a stupid idea but um
yeah

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
yeah

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.289 
yeah
don't<00:01:19.500> waste<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:19.770> time<00:01:19.830> get<00:01:20.759> into<00:01:20.970> engine

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
don't waste your time get into engine

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.030 
don't waste your time get into engine
because<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.080> most<00:01:22.320> likely<00:01:22.439> these<00:01:22.920> are

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
because it's most likely these are

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.160 
because it's most likely these are
common<00:01:23.369> problems<00:01:23.820> these<00:01:24.630> are<00:01:24.689> common<00:01:25.140> things

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
common problems these are common things

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.899 
common problems these are common things
that<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.650> wear<00:01:25.830> out<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.490> all<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.820> got

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
that can wear out on you and all you got

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.130 
that can wear out on you and all you got
to<00:01:26.939> do<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.210> replace<00:01:27.420> them<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.750> your<00:01:27.840> bike<00:01:27.960> will

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
to do is replace them and your bike will

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.530 
to do is replace them and your bike will
be<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.710> good<00:01:28.890> as<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:30.030> was<00:01:30.210> when<00:01:30.450> you

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
be just as good as it was when you

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.210 
be just as good as it was when you
bought<00:01:30.689> it

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
bought it

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.760 
bought it
so<00:01:32.220> that's<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> tip<00:01:33.180> keep<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.229> mind<00:01:34.470> hope

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
so that's the tip keep it in mind hope

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.450 
so that's the tip keep it in mind hope
it<00:01:34.950> helps<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.820> anything<00:01:36.240> else<00:01:36.530> could<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.680> you

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
it helps if anything else could be you

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.920 
it helps if anything else could be you
know<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.610> feeling<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> kind<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.600> problems

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
know a feeling of the kind of problems

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.780 
know a feeling of the kind of problems
it<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.680> be<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.369> something<00:01:41.460> more

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
it going to be this is something more

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.600 
it going to be this is something more
internal<00:01:42.619> but<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
internal but you know this is just a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.330 
internal but you know this is just a
video<00:01:44.759> for<00:01:45.210> people<00:01:45.540> who<00:01:45.630> find<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:45.960> they're

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
video for people who find that they're

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.550 
video for people who find that they're
like<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.790> wanting<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.840> know<00:01:48.869> look<00:01:49.229> forward

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
like is wanting to you know look forward

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.830 
like is wanting to you know look forward
and<00:01:49.710> when<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:49.950> disengaged<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.659> more

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and when it's disengaged and the more

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.050 
and when it's disengaged and the more
that<00:01:51.960> they<00:01:52.020> adjust<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:53.579> doesn't<00:01:53.939> really
