00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.210
 Hello everyone with you words. 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.650
 today we will play with such a shotgun 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.150
 just like that jester hans just want 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.580
 apologize for recording 4 rounds 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.189
 since i actually have the write button pressed 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.840
 but my ass told me that the record you 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.630
 does not go because I stupidly forgot to include 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.370
 fraps so here it is the first second i group 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.040
 It merged in the first round well, as if by the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.140
 is every time you start the game so as not to 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.450
 staring at the folding loading screen 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.239
 Well, I actually turned when he cho 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.780
 turn the screen first black well 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.140
 the flow when i spun dead so here 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.820
 clearly already dead so what about us 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.520
 It turns out 82 account total 31 and so now 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.719
 20th so fourgon and so here's a shotgun 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.240
 bought forever on sale then he 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.490
 became twelve hundred loans that is there 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.860
 there was a 20 percent discount in total worth 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.500
 thousand 600 credits fine i wanted 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.950
 long time ago buy this shotgun leg 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.450
 Basically he does not like some 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.360
 like to play with him in a cat 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.460
 then do what it was 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.030
 ok and java rf out we shoot through 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.579
 walls move through them so here 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.610
 well actually higher sale think well 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:43.700
 this is exactly a chance well and actually took 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.680
 of course he counts as a don therefore on 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.759
 carpet and on the cards without don snippet 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.360
 I'll play that of course there may be different 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.250
 nuances like gos macmillan but this 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.310
 I don't even want to discuss 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.829
 separate video and talk about mcnill 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.700
 We do not cover and the bank is very relevant 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.899
 theme 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.239
 and from this topic I burn a little and 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:13.440
 so we have already successfully merged as you can see two 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.450
 round yet do not try to shoot well 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.099
 now we have moved to the defense side i 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.800
 I think now it will be a little easier for us 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.720
 if all of us are now not in clomid kittens 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.340
 forward and there they will begin to merge into them on 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:30.450
 respa then we will think win 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.239
 round after round so went into saiga in 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:38.720
 guests are great saga 2 and and meet him 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:43.620
 raise so that newcomers resynu 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:48.290
 where we have so below asks the medic us on 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.290
 respa dachshund and 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.599
 great so somewhere else the startup code 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.500
 taken 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:03:05.700
 after launch returned yayayaya truth 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.160
 hell and the wall did not prevent grow back 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.440
 various wall stand a little bit why 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.470
 no need at all i'm already calmly choosing 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:18.450
 many fell i would kill everything well so u 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.140
 We are left with two dudes circus dice 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.739
 crown 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.849
 so this i'm wallowing and this dude could not 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:31.730
 understand what a-star inductor is not sitting 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.730
 so at us they run two on the spawn 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.370
 everything is fine that the sailor is waiting for the pro does not 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.070
 Correctly look a corpse an excellent minus 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.490
 the doctor stayed on the islands screen 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:48.980
 he is doing fine today 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.980
 so that 42 is dragged 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:04:01.800
 now it's time to pick us up 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.980
 Kine warmer as usual where so someone 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.280
 touched 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:13.650
 then someone is there 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.760
 we won't go there 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.570
 then someone shoots 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.570
 but it's great 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:30.630
 Wow . You did not notice the corpse at home 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:33.540
 lying to tupanul littering I ceto 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:38.160

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:40.860

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:47.520

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:19.490
