seen him a couple times on at least a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.380

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
few times on the ESPN friday night

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.160 
few times on the ESPN friday night
fights<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:38.210> it's<00:01:39.210> not<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.479> bad<00:01:39.659> here's<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
fights and it's not that bad here's a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.340 
fights and it's not that bad here's a
good<00:01:40.590> resume<00:01:41.299> well<00:01:42.299> not<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.509> good<00:01:42.750> resume<00:01:43.079> but

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
good resume well not a good resume but

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.370 
good resume well not a good resume but
good<00:01:43.590> record<00:01:43.950> 25<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.610> 5<00:01:44.869> 21<00:01:45.869> wins<00:01:46.079> coming<00:01:46.320> by

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
good record 25 and 5 21 wins coming by

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.800 
good record 25 and 5 21 wins coming by
way<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.560> knockout<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.119> think<00:01:48.479> I'll<00:01:48.689> be<00:01:48.720> a

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
way of knockout so I think I'll be a

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.420 
way of knockout so I think I'll be a
good<00:01:49.020> test<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.500> mean<00:01:49.950> there's<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.220> bunch<00:01:50.369> of

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
good test I mean there's a bunch of

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.690 
good test I mean there's a bunch of
other<00:01:50.640> fighters<00:01:51.000> out<00:01:51.090> there<00:01:51.149> as<00:01:51.420> well<00:01:51.659> but

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
other fighters out there as well but

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.039 
other fighters out there as well but
hopefully<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.119> someone<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.600> we<00:01:55.020> know

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
hopefully it's just someone that we know

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.039 
hopefully it's just someone that we know
that<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.340> step<00:01:56.579> up<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.909> competition<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
that it's a step up in competition not a
