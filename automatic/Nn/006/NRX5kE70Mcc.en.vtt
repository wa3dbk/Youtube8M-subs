00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
lay out the pattern pieces the proper

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.810 
lay out the pattern pieces the proper
way<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:43.040> let's<00:00:44.040> take<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> look<00:00:44.430> at<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> cutting

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
way so let's take a look at the cutting

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.940 
way so let's take a look at the cutting
layout<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.809> your<00:00:45.960> pattern<00:00:46.230> instructions<00:00:46.800> are

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
layout so your pattern instructions are

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.279 
layout so your pattern instructions are
going<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.250> tell<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.610> how<00:00:47.910> many<00:00:47.969> pieces<00:00:48.629> are<00:00:48.989> in

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
going to tell you how many pieces are in

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.470 
going to tell you how many pieces are in
the<00:00:49.620> pattern<00:00:49.829> altogether<00:00:50.460> if<00:00:50.700> you're<00:00:51.329> making

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
the pattern altogether if you're making

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.689 
the pattern altogether if you're making
a<00:00:51.719> basic<00:00:51.899> pattern<00:00:52.170> that's<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.829> pajama<00:00:53.219> pants

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
a basic pattern that's just pajama pants

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.910 
a basic pattern that's just pajama pants
it<00:00:53.879> may<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.570> maybe<00:00:55.079> two<00:00:55.350> pieces<00:00:55.530> or

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
it may just have maybe two pieces or

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.590 
it may just have maybe two pieces or
three<00:00:56.190> pieces<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:57.030> you're<00:00:57.149> making<00:00:57.270> something

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
three pieces if you're making something

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.750 
three pieces if you're making something
more<00:00:57.750> complex<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.620> pajama<00:00:58.980> pants<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.489> also

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
more complex like pajama pants that also

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.340 
more complex like pajama pants that also
have<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> robe<00:01:00.210> there's<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.109> lot

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
have a robe there's going to be a lot

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.799 
have a robe there's going to be a lot
more<00:01:01.379> pieces<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.370> figure<00:01:02.789> out<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:02.969> garment

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
more pieces so figure out what garment

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.870 
more pieces so figure out what garment
you're<00:01:03.870> making<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.439> then<00:01:04.769> look<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
you're making and then look up the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.460 
you're making and then look up the
number<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.450> pieces<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.900> are<00:01:06.990> used<00:01:07.170> for<00:01:07.409> that

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
number of pieces that are used for that

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.740 
number of pieces that are used for that
so<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.130> these<00:01:08.280> basic<00:01:08.610> pajama<00:01:09.180> pants

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
so for these basic pajama pants

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.520 
so for these basic pajama pants
we<00:01:10.140> need<00:01:10.320> pieces<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.280> two<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.360> three<00:01:13.260> if

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
we need pieces one two and three if

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.320 
we need pieces one two and three if
we're<00:01:13.740> making<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.310> tie<00:01:14.549> for<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:14.970> pajama

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
we're making the tie for the pajama

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.570 
we're making the tie for the pajama
pants<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.500> see<00:01:16.740> how<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.220> tells<00:01:17.430> us<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
pants and you can see how it tells us to

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.880 
pants and you can see how it tells us to
lay<00:01:17.820> them<00:01:18.000> out<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.299> fabric<00:01:18.720> says<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.710> put

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
lay them out on the fabric says to put

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.070 
lay them out on the fabric says to put
the<00:01:19.979> two<00:01:20.159> pieces<00:01:20.659> end-to-end

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
the two pieces end-to-end

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.399 
the two pieces end-to-end
along<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.920> lengthwise<00:01:23.750> stretch<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.990> fabric

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
along the lengthwise stretch of fabric

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.410 
along the lengthwise stretch of fabric
and<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.490> important<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:26.970> make<00:01:27.150> sure<00:01:27.299> that

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and it is important to make sure that

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.480 
and it is important to make sure that
you<00:01:27.509> follow<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.990> correct<00:01:28.259> orientation<00:01:28.530> for

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
you follow the correct orientation for

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.460 
you follow the correct orientation for
the<00:01:29.520> pattern<00:01:29.850> pieces<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.020> were<00:01:31.110> working

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the pattern pieces if we were working

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.929 
the pattern pieces if we were working
with<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> directional<00:01:32.250> fabric<00:01:32.729> say

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
with the directional fabric say

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.670 
with the directional fabric say
something<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.509> had<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.960> trees<00:01:34.380> with

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
something that had like trees with

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.710 
something that had like trees with
monkeys<00:01:35.070> swinging<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.640> them<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:36.390> want<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> make

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
monkeys swinging on them we want to make

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.969 
monkeys swinging on them we want to make
sure<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.200> trees<00:01:37.409> are<00:01:37.590> all<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> be

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
sure that the trees are all going to be

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.620 
sure that the trees are all going to be
right-side<00:01:38.460> up<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.939> pajama<00:01:39.270> pants

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
right-side up on the pajama pants

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.179 
right-side up on the pajama pants
because<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:39.960> don't<00:01:40.170> want<00:01:40.320> any<00:01:40.530> upside<00:01:40.950> down

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
because we don't want any upside down

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.850 
because we don't want any upside down
monkeys<00:01:41.610> with<00:01:42.420> directional<00:01:43.049> prints<00:01:43.590> it's

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
monkeys with directional prints it's

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.770 
monkeys with directional prints it's
also<00:01:44.100> important<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> make<00:01:44.939> sure<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.210> they're

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
also important to make sure that they're

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.749 
also important to make sure that they're
also<00:01:45.930> face<00:01:46.320> up<00:01:46.590> or<00:01:46.740> face<00:01:46.829> down<00:01:47.100> consistently

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
also face up or face down consistently

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.090 
also face up or face down consistently
so<00:01:48.630> typically<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.229> want<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.470> have<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.890> tissue

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
so typically you want to have the tissue

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.980 
so typically you want to have the tissue
pieces<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.119> see<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.509> print<00:01:51.750> on

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
pieces so that you can see the print on
