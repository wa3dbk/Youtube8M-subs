00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello that such friends today I bring you a 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.700
 new video review in which we buy 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.190
 the iphone 5 with the total of fifth 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.620
 good generation to the left we have 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.660
 the iphone 5 that incorporates a processor 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.869
 of 13 gigahertz and a gb of ram and the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.750
 right we have the ipod touch- 5 which is 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.480
 quite similar to iphone 4s since 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.480
 It has 800 megahertz and 512 megabytes of ram 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.250
 do not 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.550
 We will open the safari to check the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.609
 speed at which the 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.420
 pages we are going to look for the same word 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.420
 on both devices 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.170
 we have seen that the iphone5 charges 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.110
 slightly faster pages 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.820
 created the portal we will try to enter 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.340
 on the second page that we get for 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.150
 see which of the two devices opens 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.150
 before the page 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.840
 and we see that again the iPhone5 follows 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.840
 winning the game to the ipod touch 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.850
 Now we're going to try which of the two 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.410
 load before the app store page and 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.090
 we see that again the iphone is still 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.090
 being faster than the imported 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:47.760
 we left and now we will go to see which of the 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.280
 two chargers the itunes store page 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.260
 and we see that again the iTunes Store 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.950
 reload before on the iphone 5 that 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.950
 in the spot touch 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.500
 we go back out and open to check 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.170
 which of the two opens the camera before 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.140
 we see that the iphone5 is still more 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.470
 fast that the iphone 4s practically in 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.470
 all 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.620
 and in conclusion if what you are looking for is a 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.450
 great phone the iphone 5 is your best 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.480
 ally but if what you're looking for is a 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.670
 apple device like the iphone 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.550
 the best you can have is the ipod 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.860
 that 5 that for about two hundred euros what 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.770
 you can find and if you have an iphone 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.550
 4s or an iphone 4 the change to iphone 5 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:47.440
 it will not be very good after too 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.270
 good and this is all for today if 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.550
