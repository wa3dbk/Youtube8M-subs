00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.070
 teach some chives brought from 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.070
 england our friend look and cross 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.510
 they are a special collection for orchards 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.370
 urban 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.720
 they are simply of much more sizes 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.890
 reduced so that they adapt well to 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.369
 our planters this is a 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.470
 chive spring onion purple &amp; la 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.930
 we sow in the middle of 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.059
 in mid- February you see how it is 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.649
 this and the following you already know in abundance 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.170
 what is there to do that is 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.760
 I'll say no, I'm not going to explain 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.030
 a lot of videos of replicated from his 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.030
 cookie 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.180
 and as I told you, spring comes and 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.309
 we started to plant that we are going to plant 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.239
 today we are going to plant an aromatic plant 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.620
 like basil the basil a plant 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.470
 phenomenal is going to make a lot of stews 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.829
 perfect to make a text about everything 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.170
 also remember that it scares us away 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.430
 flies and over blankets insects 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.340
 beneficial for our garden we take 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.890
 the super magnificent recycled what 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.990
 we fill with a substrate rich in matter 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.450
 organic this substrate is made base 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.210
 peat perlite and lots of stuff 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.300
 organic in this case earthworm humus 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.950
 fill with our teaspoon the 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.020
 we left it over 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.890
 you just know that we take the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.890
 basil seed 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.950
 we start them well well well well 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.749
 distributed and you know that the following 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.780
 that will be put for a little bit the 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:46.260
 seed with traces of substrate 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.260
 Y 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.140
 a little bit just cover a little bit 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.590
 here we have a visitor a snail 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.390
 excellent snail for the springs 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.210
 here we have the seed sown 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.880
 basil let's water a little 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.830
 that's going to go the water flowers will go 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.420
 sucking the substrate at the end will 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.910
 be perfectly integrated into the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.040
 substrate and while cock agreed and 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.740
 cover good now in spring you know 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.210
 that this heats up fast and the 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.330
 basil will germinate very fast 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.250
 good to imagine you have passed 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.140
 ten ten days or so starts to 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.100
 germinate and within another fifteen days 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.100
 we have the basil yes 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.290
 you do not see it smells the amazing basil 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.720
 you can eat it well this does not work for 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.160
 now we are going to explain the repicado but 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.260
 It can also serve us with some 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.319
 scissors directly we can 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.590
 eat like this 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.200
 it can be a game my god this is this 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.730
 is incredible 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.459
 we have it so we 've already grown 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.040
 a couple of sheets the final ones the 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.680
 they cooked is a couple of leaves you know what 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.280
 we take out the veis 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.810
 and we are rescuing seedlings with a 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.630
 little bit of root well 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.630
 and now with this punch 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.170
 we make a little hole we put the root 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.440
 with the punch we help you a little bit and 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.270
