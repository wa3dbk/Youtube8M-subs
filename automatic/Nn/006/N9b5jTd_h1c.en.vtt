numerous manipulations and we decided

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880 
numerous manipulations and we decided
that<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:15.060> even<00:01:15.840> was<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.050> best<00:01:16.320> method<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.830> was

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
that we even was the best method it was

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.080 
that we even was the best method it was
also<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.280> quickest<00:01:17.640> because<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:17.970> read<00:01:18.060> a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
also the quickest because we read a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.050 
also the quickest because we read a
short<00:01:18.360> amount<00:01:18.690> of<00:01:18.840> time<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.800> yeah<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:20.850> we

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
short amount of time so yeah and then we

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.730 
short amount of time so yeah and then we
stripped<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> bottom<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.200> wanted<00:01:22.680> to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
stripped the bottom because we wanted to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.620 
stripped the bottom because we wanted to
soften<00:01:23.040> off<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> top<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.970> was<00:01:24.090> kind

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
soften off the top because it was kind

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.350
