00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:11.719
 hi the gamers and the gamer and 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.790
 welcome in the bottom of the make this 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.619
 week I continue on bayonetta again 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.060
 once series started on October 29, 2009 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.900
 I come back to the first episode 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.130
 bayonet 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.320
 as you probably know the 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.939
 playstation 3 version of the game is actually 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.340
 a port of the xbox 360 version 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.890
 done by a team committed to that 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.770
 except that it's a blow disaster 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.210
 platinum games has sworn never again 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.400
 take another team to make a 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.990
 portage Bahrain have still redone 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.220
 for porting the first episode on 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:45.290
 wii or the bench the pocket watch that 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.740
 possesses bayonetta has numbers 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.210
 1 4 1 1 1 2 1 9 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.600
 it's actually the date of his 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.750
 birthday on November 19, 1411 to 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.010
 the reverse of which she is 103 years old 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.380
 likewise for jeanne whose date 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.269
 birthday on January 6, 1400 12 on the 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.130
 game director revealed in a video 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.899
 or a hidden function of the game indeed 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.999
 if the heroine has a lollipop in a 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.069
 cut-scene you can choose the color 

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:17.509
 of this m6 by pressing the button 

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:20.270
 useless correspondent but fun let's go 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.979
 finally to bayonetta second of the name after 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.719
 the release of the first episode the team 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.950
 discusses possibilities of a suite 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.719
 or even a spin off 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.310
 but the director of the game did not think 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.049
 that it would be done thereafter 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.280
 changed its view that if the 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.719
 sales were satisfactory from a 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.670
 second opus would be considered 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.859
 unfortunately the sega game publisher 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.240
 decided to cancel many titles and 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.280
 to be limited to these big licenses 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.259
 equipment he had a few small 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.490
 worries with a loss of more than 7 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.139
 billion yen 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.090
 so in the 50 million euros 

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:49.549
 nintendo offers the team to produce 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.439
 the game from where the exclusivity on wiiu of this 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.029
 bayonnais to 2 should be aware that 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.499
 Nintendo did not intervene in the 

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:55.789
 development in any case not more than 

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:57.499
 submitting observations 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.399
 which has a lot more to the team of 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:02.840
 platinum games before starting the 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.310
 development the team gathered the 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.940
 reviews of players to see what they 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.920
 had more and those with 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.780
 in order to see where to go and what it 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.979
 had to correct for this reason they 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.720
 quite spent time improving 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.430
 the movements of the enemies in particular 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.390
 their reaction to the attacks 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.890
 of bayonetta and its position for 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.300
 sets of the game the inspirations come 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.100
 belgium and italy 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.540
 the team has also made themselves 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.460
 visited the Notre Dame Cathedral 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.650
 from Antwerp but not first served by the 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.150
 royal palace of brussels and one can 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.310
 see the impact it had on the game 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.290
 then they chained with Italy 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.800
 and florence my paving over a lot 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.140
 to the team 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.700
 finally they stopped at venice which 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.910
 seems obvious when we see some 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.830
 game environments 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.020
 the first teaser of bayonetta 2 is 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.880
 very similar to the trailer of bayonetta 1 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.900
 that was the will of the team to 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.580
 that fans recognize each other 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.510
 immediately in the universe tell themselves 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.070
 oh bayonetta back 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.980
 the hairstyle of the heroine changes for this 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.810
 episode the producer yusuke hashimoto has 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.610
 stated that the change was related to 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.230
 the bayonetta's personality indeed 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.280
 for him that's the kind of woman to 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.930
 change style often 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.180
 he also added that his style 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.020
 could still evolve further as 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.400
 and as episodes to continue 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.260
 on the style of the heroine marie 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.130
 shimazaki the character designer 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.690
 main 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.830
 meets with some difficulties for 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.340
 adapt to the new colors of 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.410
 heroin 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.370
 indeed like water is one of the themes 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.290
 main game 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.120
 the director of the game wanted his 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.430
 characteristic color goes from red 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.510
 to blue is when balancing 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.340
 colors that this poses a problem 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.930
 the game cover has been modified by 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.560
 nintendo without them consulting each other 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.989
 team 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.269
 this has upset the creator of the 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.220
 hideki kamiya series my changes are 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.530
 the feather addition of a full moon and 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.030
 no of a crescent and the 2 which is 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.010
 changed from yellow to red 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.630
 like even small changes 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.680
 that may seem trivial are 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.180
 sometimes badly taken by the creators 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.280
 during the intro scene you can see 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.959
 a giant screen broadcasting news if 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.000
 you listen you will hear a 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.410
 music in the background it's actually the 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.030
 music that is played at each end of 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.170
 mission in the game under crowd one on 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.950
 one listen 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.950
 mauritius maracas 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.230
 good I can you unlock the trunk 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.600
 know that he will be able to smell the treasures 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.980
 and you practice it will bring the base 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.750
 director of the game had put him in the 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.580
 list of possible collaborations with 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.020
 nintendo without really believing it 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.040
 trompe being a big symbol of 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.440
 the universe of nintendo 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.910
 not only did nintendo accept but 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.540
 they had no problem seeing it 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.140
 explode 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.400
 rather nice as we talk about 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.140
 collaborations between the team and 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.060
 nintendo you have to know that originally 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.500
 the team had put a t-shirt under the 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.330
 line suit for bayonetta 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.980
 but it's nintendo that asks this 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.880
 they are removed corresponding 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.980
 not to bayonetta's personality in 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.900
 all the games of platinum games the team 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.520
 fun to hide scarabs the 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.590
 lucane kite to be precise 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.540
 apparently those from bayonetta 2 to 8 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.310
 a few weeks to be found there are 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.220
 also obviously in the first 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.930
 episode 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.260
 water that seems to be a reference to yu 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.330
 oh oh 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.980
 indeed they use magic cards 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.720
 which is even a kind of pendant in 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.700
 inverted pyramid shape like the 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.290
 animated hero's over her hair 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.510
 whiteness and its tanned complexion are reminiscent of 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:23.710
 marrakech late one of the villains of the 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.570
 yoyo series offers the main enemy 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.700
 but I did not have the same design to 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.680
 the origin much more feminine and less 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.790
 angular then little by little the appearance 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.380
 the pyramid was originally the 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.479
 character of bayonetta had to get 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.850
 find in the sega crossover game 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.100
 sonic all stars racing transforms 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.470
 but the team and rodman has integrated the 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.660
 character because she did not respect the 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.310
 pegi ranking of the game bayonetta was 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.270
 therefore purely and simply withdrawn from 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:54.190
 game and that's it I'm done with bayonetta 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.479
 I recall this episode originally 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.280
 and the precedent was only to be one 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.289
 single episode but my computer 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.510
 and my connection decided otherwise 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.430
 on this well it's over then stay 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.789
 connected and continue to surf the 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.789
 internets
