 the earth today is the attention of the whole world 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.720
 chained to the Russian Urals which 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.120
 suffered from the fall of the giant

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.109
 which exploded in shock air 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.750
 wave knocked out windows in hundreds of buildings 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.820
 suffered more than 700 people and already through 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.189
 a few hours near the ground will fly 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.410
 another asteroid much larger 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.410
 sizes Irina Popova with details 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.829
 unplanned space show 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.840
 It looked exactly like Chelyabinsk almost 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.329
 half past nine in the morning people go to 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.860
 work studies on video recorders 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.140
 dozens of machines fixes not that 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.730
 appearing in the sky at a height of about 5 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.949
 kilometers appeared bright glowing 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.050
 the object of his flashes are accompanied 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.469
 roar and resemble gigantic breaks 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.469
 shells 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.700
 then run out inside that sat 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.229
 taking off too the explosion through the village circle 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.360
 as if driving crazy 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.830
 rattling windows lost cellular communication 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.990
 eyewitnesses talk about fiery rain 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.880
 who spilled debris from the sky 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.920
 cosmic body virtually covered 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.360
 Chelyabinsk city itself inhabited 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.289
 The points in the neighborhood suffered 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.259
 many buildings 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.610
 zinc plant warehouse is strongest 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.830
 broken window glass dropped 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.819
 more than 700 people three are now 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.819
 in critical condition 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.210
 witnessing the unique greatest 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.280
 phenomena have become residents not only the Urals but 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.679
 and eastern Siberia, northern and western 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.780
 Kazakhstan service through Aktobe took 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.610
 dozens of calls from frightened citizens 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.289
 they all saw a bright flash in the sky 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.119
 which someone took for a comet 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.690
 someone for a falling plane from or 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:03.369
 at all for the alien ship somewhere 8 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:07.799
 15 and saw green colors fiery 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:10.560
 some ball like that fell slowly on py 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.090
 this did not see this one 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.790
 scared thought what it is n catch 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.320
 school after the mass hysteria chistiki all 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.030
 decided to send the group to the zone 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.680
 intended fall at that time 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.049
 not yet installed object by 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.850
 approximate location of the fall of this object 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:32.760
 still nothing else I found on it 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.960
 search work continues 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.650
 no injuries 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.710
 and we connected with the flight center here at 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.470
 Tyumen region also confirmed that 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.380
 they are all aircraft in place and 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.570
 no drop was not no joke 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.940
 scared and the inhabitants of fiery bush 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.950
 the ball cutting the sky saw and they but not 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.870
 explosions not shock waves were not there a 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.150
 Here is Kazakhstani Nikita snowballs in full 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.950
 least felt the space attack in 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.550
 Chelyabinsk went to visit his father 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.530
 meeting now remember for a long time bright 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.140
 flash that is the central part of the city 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.830
 people telling that straight almost 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.730
 burned minutes after three through five 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.870
 dash 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:20.490
 Now this explosion series began let's say 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:24.540
 here is a dollar three minutes so powerful straight 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.540
 cotton fibers due to which 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.680
 feel the vibration of the houses 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.989
 at a speed of 20 kilometers per second 10 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.760
 tons and a meteorite burst into the atmosphere 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.890
 further a series of explosions thundered 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.510
 heavenly body 1 way skolki 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.970
 only two have been found so far. 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.709
 cosmic fragment these frames and there are 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.599
 the very place for the landed part 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.370
 fireball Chebarkulsky and 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.849
 Zlatoust district of Chelyabinsk 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.690
 areas 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.890
 there are still fire funnels and 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.140
 today on earth they will watch 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.940
 another guests from space with a giant 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.890
 diameter asteroid more powerful fell hundreds 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.019
 meters our planet exchange it and 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.329
 taught the size of the Chelyabinsk meteorite 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.370
 probably there were much fewer specialists 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.380
 Nasa still does not comment on why 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.569
 their devices did not notice the collapsed 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.220
 fireball irina popova alexander by
