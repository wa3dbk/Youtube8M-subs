one<00:05:32.270> that's<00:05:32.360> the<00:05:32.510> other<00:05:32.630> one<00:05:32.900> but<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.230> other

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
one that's the other one but the other

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.060 
one that's the other one but the other
one<00:05:33.620> is<00:05:33.650> like<00:05:34.370> a<00:05:34.430> longer<00:05:35.000> longer<00:05:35.860> gap<00:05:36.860> between

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
one is like a longer longer gap between

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.040 
one is like a longer longer gap between
them<00:05:38.230> well<00:05:39.230> guys<00:05:39.440> I'm<00:05:39.800> gonna<00:05:40.190> stop<00:05:40.490> it<00:05:40.610> here<00:05:40.820> um

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
like I said I see what he did that did

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.380 
like I said I see what he did that did
hear<00:05:44.450> the<00:05:44.890> idea<00:05:45.890> i<00:05:45.980> actually<00:05:46.730> love<00:05:47.030> i<00:05:47.060> think

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
hear the idea i actually love i think

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.230 
hear the idea i actually love i think
it's<00:05:47.480> a<00:05:47.540> good<00:05:47.660> idea<00:05:47.780> the<00:05:48.290> execution<00:05:48.920> though

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
it's a good idea the execution though

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.900 
it's a good idea the execution though
not<00:05:50.240> very<00:05:50.270> good<00:05:50.630> and<00:05:51.070> it<00:05:52.070> does<00:05:52.190> not<00:05:52.310> work<00:05:52.610> with

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
not very good and it does not work with

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.810 
not very good and it does not work with
a<00:05:53.210> i<00:05:53.860> fixed<00:05:54.860> coloring<00:05:55.340> thing<00:05:57.010> i<00:05:58.010> guess<00:05:58.370> like<00:05:58.580> a

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
a i fixed coloring thing i guess like a

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.970 
a i fixed coloring thing i guess like a
psycho<00:05:59.600> and<00:05:59.810> therefore<00:06:00.320> it's<00:06:00.470> all<00:06:00.560> the<00:06:00.650> colors

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
psycho and therefore it's all the colors

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.120 
psycho and therefore it's all the colors
but<00:06:01.880> as<00:06:02.150> i<00:06:02.480> said<00:06:02.510> i<00:06:02.930> haven't<00:06:03.560> seen<00:06:03.710> a<00:06:03.770> map<00:06:03.980> like

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
but as i said i haven't seen a map like

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.780 
but as i said i haven't seen a map like
this<00:06:04.190> i<00:06:04.580> think<00:06:04.640> it's<00:06:04.880> a<00:06:04.970> pretty<00:06:05.120> original<00:06:05.570> idea

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
this i think it's a pretty original idea

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.390 
this i think it's a pretty original idea
having<00:06:07.790> regular<00:06:08.360> colors<00:06:09.250> would<00:06:10.250> have

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
having regular colors would have

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.030 
having regular colors would have
actually<00:06:10.610> been<00:06:11.150> just<00:06:11.990> as<00:06:12.140> good<00:06:12.290> because<00:06:12.620> the

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040 
actually been just as good because the

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.160 
actually been just as good because the
idea<00:06:13.370> itself<00:06:13.700> is<00:06:13.850> original<00:06:14.300> still<00:06:14.810> it<00:06:15.050> would

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.170 
idea itself is original still it would

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.950 
idea itself is original still it would
not<00:06:15.320> it<00:06:15.440> would<00:06:15.650> not<00:06:15.830> have<00:06:15.980> worked<00:06:16.010> with<00:06:16.820> AI<00:06:17.000> but

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
not it would not have worked with AI but

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.750 
not it would not have worked with AI but
