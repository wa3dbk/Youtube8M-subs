00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.610 
thought it would be whenever I say an
opening<00:03:55.000> song<00:03:55.209> is<00:03:55.360> catchy<00:03:55.630> and<00:03:56.080> member<00:03:56.440> I

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
opening song is catchy and member I

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.949 
opening song is catchy and member I
immediately<00:03:57.580> forget<00:03:58.120> about<00:03:58.209> it<00:03:58.390> for<00:03:58.510> some<00:03:58.750> odd

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
immediately forget about it for some odd

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.260 
immediately forget about it for some odd
reason<00:03:58.989> but<00:03:59.860> this<00:04:00.010> opening<00:04:00.430> stands<00:04:00.850> out<00:04:01.150> in<00:04:01.239> my

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
reason but this opening stands out in my

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.720 
reason but this opening stands out in my
mind<00:04:01.540> maybe<00:04:02.530> it's<00:04:02.739> because<00:04:02.890> I<00:04:03.280> have<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.430> soft

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
mind maybe it's because I have a soft

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.470 
mind maybe it's because I have a soft
spot<00:04:03.880> for<00:04:04.300> soft<00:04:04.510> rock<00:04:04.840> but<00:04:05.440> I<00:04:05.709> don't<00:04:06.340> know<00:04:06.489> the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
spot for soft rock but I don't know the

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.470 
spot for soft rock but I don't know the
ending<00:04:07.780> song<00:04:08.050> is<00:04:08.350> superb<00:04:09.070> and<00:04:09.250> totally<00:04:10.030> mental

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
ending song is superb and totally mental

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.120 
ending song is superb and totally mental
and<00:04:10.660> has<00:04:10.959> stood<00:04:11.290> out<00:04:11.410> in<00:04:11.440> my<00:04:11.590> mind<00:04:11.680> for<00:04:12.070> the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
and has stood out in my mind for the

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.060 
and has stood out in my mind for the
past<00:04:12.489> week<00:04:13.090> so<00:04:13.810> that<00:04:14.110> has<00:04:14.410> got<00:04:14.770> me<00:04:14.980> an

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
past week so that has got me an

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.640 
past week so that has got me an
accomplishment<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:16.720> also<00:04:16.870> stands<00:04:17.350> out

accomplishment it also stands out

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.190 
accomplishment it also stands out
because<00:04:17.680> of<00:04:18.400> its<00:04:18.790> clever<00:04:19.120> use<00:04:19.359> of<00:04:19.390> using<00:04:20.049> its

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
because of its clever use of using its

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.830 
because of its clever use of using its
next<00:04:20.560> time<00:04:20.709> trailer<00:04:20.980> it's<00:04:21.880> something<00:04:22.210> I've

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
twisted person when I say this but I

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.100 
twisted person when I say this but I
think<00:05:12.790> we<00:05:13.120> actually<00:05:13.270> much<00:05:13.720> more<00:05:13.930> believable

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
think we actually much more believable

just a vague explanation another problem

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.750 
just a vague explanation another problem
is<00:05:32.120> to<00:05:32.360> pacing<00:05:32.900> I<00:05:33.050> find<00:05:33.890> it<00:05:34.040> inconsistent

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
is to pacing I find it inconsistent

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.910 
is to pacing I find it inconsistent
because<00:05:35.180> there<00:05:35.570> are<00:05:35.630> some<00:05:35.930> times<00:05:36.200> when<00:05:36.410> story

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
because there are some times when story

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.950 
because there are some times when story
is<00:05:37.070> slow<00:05:37.430> then<00:05:38.090> they<00:05:38.210> have<00:05:38.390> a<00:05:38.420> scene<00:05:38.780> that

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
is slow then they have a scene that

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.140 
is slow then they have a scene that
comes<00:05:39.200> with<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:40.160> out<00:05:40.370> nowhere<00:05:40.700> and

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
comes with the out nowhere and

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.720 
comes with the out nowhere and
after<00:05:42.020> that<00:05:42.140> it<00:05:42.350> bores<00:05:42.800> me<00:05:42.950> again<00:05:43.400> with<00:05:43.550> its

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
after that it bores me again with its

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.930 
after that it bores me again with its
slow<00:05:44.030> pacing<00:05:44.380> it<00:05:45.380> was<00:05:45.650> only<00:05:45.830> until<00:05:46.250> the<00:05:46.700> last

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
slow pacing it was only until the last

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.840 
slow pacing it was only until the last
couple<00:05:47.450> of<00:05:47.510> episodes<00:05:47.660> in<00:05:48.500> which<00:05:48.830> the<00:05:49.400> pacing
