hello<00:00:01.589> guys<00:00:01.800> I<00:00:02.220> have<00:00:02.610> here<00:00:02.820> my<00:00:03.030> board<00:00:03.389> we<00:00:03.570> know

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hello guys I have here my board we know

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.639 
hello guys I have here my board we know
connected<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.430> experimental<00:00:06.299> board<00:00:06.649> to

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
connected to the experimental board to

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.009 
connected to the experimental board to
the<00:00:09.170> seven-segment<00:00:10.170> LED<00:00:10.710> display<00:00:12.019> this

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.609 
the seven-segment LED display this
display<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.380> common<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:13.980> not<00:00:14.250> display<00:00:15.619> which

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
display is common and not display which

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.980 
display is common and not display which
means<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.340> need<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.600> connect<00:00:19.350> minuses<00:00:20.250> or<00:00:20.990> zeros

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
means I need to connect minuses or zeros

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.480 
means I need to connect minuses or zeros
if<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.380> want<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:23.340> each<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.769> segments<00:00:26.189> to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
if you want on each of the segments to

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.640 
if you want on each of the segments to
light<00:00:26.789> up<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.529> I<00:00:28.529> need<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.630> take<00:00:30.630> only<00:00:30.900> one<00:00:31.289> of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
light up and I need to take only one of

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.459 
light up and I need to take only one of
the<00:00:32.489> pluses<00:00:34.100> connects<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:37.010> display<00:00:39.469> it

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the pluses connects it to the display it

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.959 
the pluses connects it to the display it
works<00:00:40.890> pretty<00:00:41.430> well<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:42.739> this<00:00:43.739> board<00:00:44.070> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
works pretty well on this board it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.080 
works pretty well on this board it
should<00:00:45.600> work<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.960> any<00:00:46.670> Arduino<00:00:47.670> port<00:00:47.940> I'm

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
should work on any Arduino port I'm

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.180 
should work on any Arduino port I'm
using<00:00:48.360> board<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.960> know<00:00:49.079> because<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.680> bought<00:00:50.010> it

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
using board we know because I bought it

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.630 
using board we know because I bought it
that's<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:51.410> couldn't<00:00:52.410> get<00:00:52.590> any<00:00:52.860> other<00:00:53.219> ardena

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
that's I couldn't get any other ardena

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.290 
that's I couldn't get any other ardena
port<00:00:54.890> in<00:00:55.890> my<00:00:56.039> country<00:00:56.510> so<00:00:58.879> here<00:00:59.879> we<00:00:59.969> see<00:01:00.149> it

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
port in my country so here we see it

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.080 
port in my country so here we see it
counting<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:02.629> have<00:01:03.629> made<00:01:03.899> myself<00:01:04.339> but<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.610> will

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
counting I have made myself but I will

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.190 
counting I have made myself but I will
show<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:09.890> computer<00:01:11.990> you<00:01:12.990> see

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
show this to you on computer you see

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.310 
show this to you on computer you see
this<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.369> my<00:01:14.580> program<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:16.369> made<00:01:17.369> myself

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
this is my program for it I made myself

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:27.410 
this is my program for it I made myself
basic<00:01:21.200> grid<00:01:22.200> or<00:01:22.790> metric<00:01:23.790> matrix<00:01:25.670> for<00:01:26.670> lighting

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
basic grid or metric matrix for lighting

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.660 
basic grid or metric matrix for lighting
up<00:01:27.780> them<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.540> is<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.810> one<00:01:31.049> B<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.220> I

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
up them you know a is this one B is I

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.109 
up them you know a is this one B is I
think<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.659> I'm<00:01:33.930> not<00:01:34.049> sure<00:01:34.110> c<00:01:34.860> d<00:01:35.070> e<00:01:35.100> f<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.939> g

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
think this I'm not sure c d e f and g

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.289 
think this I'm not sure c d e f and g
you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.180> check<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.439> your<00:01:41.299> data

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
you can check that out in your data

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:52.700 
you can check that out in your data
sheet<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.420> program<00:01:50.899> program<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.049> pretty

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
sheet so the program program is pretty

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.109 
sheet so the program program is pretty
much<00:01:53.009> easy

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.270 

here<00:01:57.719> are<00:01:57.840> some<00:01:58.049> calculations<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.100> made

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
here are some calculations I have made

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.270 
here are some calculations I have made
for<00:01:59.969> blinking<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.920> stupid<00:02:01.920> thing<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.100> I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
for blinking just stupid thing that I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:11.780 
for blinking just stupid thing that I
wanted<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.729> try<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:08.750> check<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.899> out<00:02:10.790> it

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
wanted to try and check this out it

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.850 
wanted to try and check this out it
looks<00:02:12.030> okay<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:14.310> should<00:02:14.370> look<00:02:14.670> fine<00:02:15.440> okay<00:02:16.440> it's

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
looks okay it should look fine okay it's

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.170 
looks okay it should look fine okay it's
okay<00:02:17.069> now<00:02:18.769> this<00:02:19.769> is<00:02:19.830> our<00:02:20.129> board<00:02:20.580> winner<00:02:20.849> board

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
okay now this is our board winner board

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.530 
okay now this is our board winner board
it<00:02:21.780> use<00:02:22.879> atmega328<00:02:23.879> chip<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:26.120> will<00:02:27.120> put<00:02:27.360> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
it use atmega328 chip I will put the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
it use atmega328 chip I will put the
code<00:02:27.750> on<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.680> internet<00:02:29.360> for<00:02:30.360> lighting<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.440> up

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
code on the internet for lighting it up

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.420 
code on the internet for lighting it up
now<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.220> want<00:02:32.549> to<00:02:32.610> show<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:32.880> something<00:02:33.480> and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
now I want to show you something and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.229 
now I want to show you something and
look<00:02:35.430> at<00:02:35.579> this<00:02:35.700> okay<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:38.239> basically

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
look at this okay so I basically

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:47.559 
look at this okay so I basically
connected<00:02:40.220> -<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.519> -<00:02:41.870> just<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.959> second<00:02:43.579> plug<00:02:44.579> it

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.339 

hits<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.660> second

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
hits a second

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.589 
hits a second
you<00:02:50.280> should<00:02:50.489> go<00:02:50.670> out<00:02:51.829> it<00:02:52.829> doesn't<00:02:53.250> go<00:02:53.400> out

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
you should go out it doesn't go out

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.190 
you should go out it doesn't go out
I<00:02:54.629> will<00:02:55.230> show<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:56.090> in<00:02:57.090> just<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.390> second<00:02:57.810> okay

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
I will show you in just a second okay

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.140 
I will show you in just a second okay
I'm<00:02:58.379> back<00:02:58.560> I'm<00:02:58.769> sorry<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.099> just<00:02:59.489> need<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.970> take

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
I'm back I'm sorry I just need to take

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.020 
I'm back I'm sorry I just need to take
it<00:03:00.269> out<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:01.260> show<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.829> you<00:03:02.010> okay<00:03:02.459> so<00:03:04.850> this<00:03:05.850> is

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
it out to show it to you okay so this is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.870 
it out to show it to you okay so this is
common<00:03:06.239> energy<00:03:06.569> display<00:03:07.139> like<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.319> said<00:03:07.880> hope

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
common energy display like I said hope

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.330 
common energy display like I said hope
it's<00:03:09.120> good<00:03:09.750> okay<00:03:10.109> so<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.280> put<00:03:11.989> my<00:03:13.010> plus<00:03:14.010> on<00:03:14.190> this

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
it's good okay so I put my plus on this

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.099 
it's good okay so I put my plus on this
pin<00:03:14.579> and<00:03:14.930> then<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:15.959> put<00:03:16.489> minus<00:03:17.489> s<00:03:17.639> here<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.810> I

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
pin and then I put minus s here so I

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:26.300 
pin and then I put minus s here so I
turned<00:03:19.950> them<00:03:20.099> off<00:03:21.049> on<00:03:22.049> in<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.099> program<00:03:25.310> from

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
turned them off on in the program from

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.050 
turned them off on in the program from
these<00:03:26.519> you<00:03:27.000> know<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.419> turn<00:03:28.109> them<00:03:28.290> off<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:29.060> then

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
these you know I turn them off and then

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.349 
these you know I turn them off and then
it<00:03:30.450> starts<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.870> lighting<00:03:31.319> so<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:32.310> power<00:03:33.060> goes

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
it starts to lighting so the power goes

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.789 
it starts to lighting so the power goes
from<00:03:34.049> here<00:03:34.349> to<00:03:34.530> each<00:03:34.859> of<00:03:35.069> these<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:36.680> if<00:03:37.680> you

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
from here to each of these and if you

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.000 
from here to each of these and if you
power<00:03:38.730> this<00:03:39.030> up<00:03:39.269> then<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.989> what<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.680> will<00:03:40.859> not

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
power this up then it what it will not

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.580 
power this up then it what it will not
like<00:03:41.250> because<00:03:42.239> peril<00:03:42.599> won't<00:03:42.870> be<00:03:43.079> able<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.349> go

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
like because peril won't be able to go

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:51.379 
like because peril won't be able to go
here<00:03:44.599> to<00:03:45.599> the<00:03:46.139> edge<00:03:46.349> and<00:03:49.880> so<00:03:50.880> this<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.209> how<00:03:51.329> it

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
here to the edge and so this is how it

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.220 
here to the edge and so this is how it
looks<00:03:51.889> it's<00:03:52.889> pretty<00:03:53.400> small<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:54.120> mean<00:03:54.329> it's<00:03:55.109> you

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
looks it's pretty small I mean it's you

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.309 
looks it's pretty small I mean it's you
know<00:03:55.260> it's<00:03:55.500> big<00:03:55.859> enough<00:03:55.980> but<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.489> is<00:03:56.780> small<00:03:57.780> so

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
know it's big enough but it is small so

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:07.479 
know it's big enough but it is small so
I<00:03:58.650> needed<00:03:59.250> to<00:04:00.260> put<00:04:01.260> one<00:04:01.739> of<00:04:02.000> these

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.420 

resisters<00:04:08.900> just<00:04:09.900> for<00:04:10.290> it<00:04:10.410> just<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.160> it

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
resisters just for it just so it

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.120 
resisters just for it just so it
wouldn't<00:04:11.819> work<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.540> was<00:04:13.080> without<00:04:13.950> the

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
wouldn't work it was without the

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.729 
wouldn't work it was without the
resistor<00:04:14.880> but<00:04:15.030> it's<00:04:15.239> so<00:04:15.599> it's<00:04:16.019> so<00:04:16.290> strong<00:04:16.530> that

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
resistor but it's so it's so strong that

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.580 
resistor but it's so it's so strong that
you<00:04:16.799> cannot<00:04:17.220> look<00:04:17.400> at<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.989> that's<00:04:18.989> why<00:04:19.200> I<00:04:19.230> put

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
you cannot look at it that's why I put

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.790 
you cannot look at it that's why I put
one<00:04:19.980> of<00:04:20.100> these<00:04:20.250> here<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:22.100> well<00:04:23.100> I<00:04:24.680> have<00:04:25.680> to

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
one of these here and well I have to

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.230 
one of these here and well I have to
connect<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.630> to<00:04:27.630> my<00:04:27.810> board<00:04:28.139> I<00:04:28.700> think<00:04:29.700> it's<00:04:30.000> good

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
connect it to my board I think it's good

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.740 
connect it to my board I think it's good
here

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
here

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.840 
here
there's<00:04:33.750> some<00:04:33.960> pin<00:04:34.260> sight<00:04:36.950> that's<00:04:37.950> right<00:04:38.370> this

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
there's some pin sight that's right this

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.180 
there's some pin sight that's right this
is<00:04:39.030> how<00:04:39.210> it<00:04:39.330> goes<00:04:39.479> just<00:04:39.540> a<00:04:39.870> second<00:04:40.260> to<00:04:40.919> test

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
is how it goes just a second to test

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:49.180 
is how it goes just a second to test
this<00:04:41.340> out<00:04:41.580> if<00:04:41.910> it<00:04:42.150> works<00:04:42.419> now<00:04:44.000> hope<00:04:45.000> it<00:04:45.180> works

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.100 

yes<00:04:50.190> it<00:04:50.430> works

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
yes it works

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:59.540 
yes it works
so<00:04:52.970> you<00:04:53.970> see<00:04:56.300> board<00:04:57.300> we<00:04:57.479> know<00:04:57.660> works<00:04:58.520> great<00:04:59.520> on

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
so you see board we know works great on

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.780 
so you see board we know works great on
Ubuntu<00:05:00.270> on<00:05:01.110> my<00:05:01.350> Linux<00:05:03.320> I<00:05:04.320> did<00:05:04.800> not<00:05:05.340> need<00:05:05.729> to

Ubuntu on my Linux I did not need to

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.290 
Ubuntu on my Linux I did not need to
install<00:05:06.330> any<00:05:06.690> additional<00:05:07.040> drivers<00:05:08.040> just<00:05:08.430> they

second data sheet I need to find nothing

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:33.400 
second data sheet I need to find nothing
nothing<00:05:27.660> a<00:05:27.900> second

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.860 

I<00:05:35.260> can't<00:05:36.260> find<00:05:36.530> it<00:05:36.680> now<00:05:36.890> I<00:05:37.250> have<00:05:38.000> saved<00:05:38.600> it

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
I can't find it now I have saved it

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.720 
I can't find it now I have saved it
somewhere<00:05:39.400> but<00:05:41.920> cannot<00:05:42.920> remember<00:05:43.310> where<00:05:43.700> that

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
somewhere but cannot remember where that

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:52.120 
somewhere but cannot remember where that
is<00:05:47.590> well<00:05:48.590> you<00:05:50.020> simply<00:05:51.020> download<00:05:51.350> the<00:05:51.920> data

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
is well you simply download the data

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:58.060 
is well you simply download the data
sheet<00:05:52.460> for<00:05:52.750> your<00:05:53.750> own<00:05:56.230> sentiment<00:05:57.230> LED<00:05:57.680> display

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
sheet for your own sentiment LED display

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:05.230 
sheet for your own sentiment LED display
and<00:05:58.430> that's<00:05:59.210> very<00:05:59.510> look<00:06:00.310> which<00:06:03.100> on<00:06:04.100> which<00:06:04.400> pins

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
and that's very look which on which pins

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.600 
and that's very look which on which pins
you<00:06:05.420> need<00:06:05.570> to<00:06:06.190> connect<00:06:07.190> I<00:06:08.320> am<00:06:09.320> again<00:06:09.800> I'm<00:06:09.980> sorry

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
you need to connect I am again I'm sorry

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.640 
you need to connect I am again I'm sorry
for<00:06:10.820> my<00:06:10.910> English<00:06:11.150> because<00:06:11.330> not<00:06:12.290> that<00:06:12.440> if

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
for my English because not that if

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.420 
for my English because not that if
English<00:06:12.980> speakers<00:06:13.460> so<00:06:13.700> it's<00:06:14.270> hard<00:06:14.510> for<00:06:14.570> me<00:06:15.430> to

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
English speakers so it's hard for me to

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.390 
English speakers so it's hard for me to
say<00:06:16.640> some<00:06:16.880> things<00:06:18.280> so<00:06:19.930> this<00:06:20.930> is<00:06:21.080> it<00:06:21.340> this<00:06:22.340> is

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
say some things so this is it this is

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.390 
say some things so this is it this is
how<00:06:22.640> it<00:06:22.670> works<00:06:23.290> it's<00:06:24.290> pretty<00:06:24.380> simple<00:06:25.040> it's

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
how it works it's pretty simple it's

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.220 
how it works it's pretty simple it's
pretty<00:06:25.820> easy<00:06:25.880> you<00:06:26.300> can<00:06:26.600> do<00:06:26.690> it<00:06:26.750> at<00:06:26.900> your<00:06:26.930> home
