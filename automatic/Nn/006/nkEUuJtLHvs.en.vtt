00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
hitting them this stage is a this stage

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.080 
hitting them this stage is a this stage
the<00:02:20.849> harder<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.420> harder<00:02:21.500> set<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.680> guess<00:02:23.090> he

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
the harder the harder set I guess he

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.369

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
with the spear and you can't um

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.770 
with the spear and you can't um
interrupt<00:02:29.549> this<00:02:29.670> little<00:02:29.879> electric<00:02:30.480> attack

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
interrupt this little electric attack

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.149 
interrupt this little electric attack
they're<00:02:31.019> like<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.349> can't<00:02:31.560> run<00:02:31.739> up<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:32.010> them

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
and uh and hit them so that's kind of a

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.599 
and uh and hit them so that's kind of a
pain<00:02:34.379> in<00:02:34.409> the<00:02:34.560> ass<00:02:34.769> because<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.310> that

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
pain in the ass because that that

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.429 
pain in the ass because that that
electric<00:02:35.969> attack<00:02:36.239> does<00:02:36.510> massive<00:02:37.019> amounts<00:02:37.349> of

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
electric attack does massive amounts of

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.830 
electric attack does massive amounts of
damage<00:02:38.329> so<00:02:39.329> what<00:02:39.420> you're<00:02:39.510> going<00:02:39.629> to<00:02:39.689> want<00:02:39.810> to

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
possibly can at all times and that's

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.360 
possibly can at all times and that's
basically<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.930> best<00:02:46.169> advice<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.889> can<00:02:46.950> provide

basically the best advice I can provide
you<00:02:47.639> for<00:02:47.909> for<00:02:48.329> that<00:02:48.450> section<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.049> just<00:02:49.079> make

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
you for for that section is just make

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.809 
you for for that section is just make
sure<00:02:49.590> you're<00:02:49.739> close<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.040> them<00:02:50.280> keep<00:02:50.549> keep

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
sure you're close to them keep keep

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.009 
sure you're close to them keep keep
yourself<00:02:51.209> very<00:02:51.359> close<00:02:51.599> to<00:02:51.720> them<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:51.930> he

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
yourself very close to them so he

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.050 
yourself very close to them so he
doesn't<00:02:52.260> do<00:02:52.349> that<00:02:52.379> electric<00:02:52.859> attack<00:02:53.129> for

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
doesn't do that electric attack for

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.220 
doesn't do that electric attack for
those<00:02:54.180> guys

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
those guys

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.149 
those guys
you<00:02:55.560> can<00:02:55.709> run<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.480> don't<00:02:57.480> really<00:02:57.629> recommend

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
you can run I don't really recommend

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.720 
you can run I don't really recommend
rolling<00:02:59.569> because<00:03:00.569> after<00:03:00.959> two<00:03:01.139> rolls<00:03:01.379> uh

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
rolling because after two rolls uh

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.220 
rolling because after two rolls uh
there's<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.879> little<00:03:03.090> there's<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:03.689> timing

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
there's this little there's this timing

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.020 
there's this little there's this timing
difference<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.829> you<00:03:05.310> will<00:03:05.430> get<00:03:05.549> hit<00:03:05.700> by<00:03:05.819> them

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
difference and you will get hit by them

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.280 
difference and you will get hit by them
they<00:03:06.180> don't<00:03:06.269> do<00:03:06.419> a<00:03:06.450> lot<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.629> damage<00:03:06.870> we<00:03:07.169> can

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
they don't do a lot of damage we can

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.770 
they don't do a lot of damage we can
just<00:03:07.500> stand<00:03:07.680> there<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:07.889> take<00:03:08.099> the<00:03:08.250> hit<00:03:08.370> and

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
just stand there and take the hit and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.420 
just stand there and take the hit and
then<00:03:09.780> for<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.019> last<00:03:10.230> stage<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.799> fourth<00:03:11.069> stage

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
then for the last stage the fourth stage

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.149 
then for the last stage the fourth stage
I<00:03:11.700> just<00:03:11.909> like<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.599> like<00:03:13.290> using<00:03:13.500> reckoning<00:03:14.010> mode

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
I just like I like using reckoning mode

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.699 
I just like I like using reckoning mode
just<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.489> finish<00:03:14.760> them<00:03:14.909> off<00:03:15.500> it's<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.530> pretty

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
just to finish them off it's a pretty

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.309 
just to finish them off it's a pretty

rolling in the same direction but you

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.740 
rolling in the same direction but you

a<00:03:51.780> roll<00:03:51.959> backwards<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.680> works<00:03:52.889> as<00:03:53.099> well<00:03:54.139> but

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139

this<00:05:06.600> armor<00:05:07.260> has<00:05:07.410> a<00:05:07.440> high<00:05:07.680> armor<00:05:08.130> rating<00:05:08.340> but

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
this armor has a high armor rating but

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.000 
this armor has a high armor rating but
the<00:05:09.030> stats<00:05:09.390> if<00:05:09.630> you<00:05:09.750> saw<00:05:09.960> if<00:05:10.230> you<00:05:10.470> rewind<00:05:10.770> and

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
the stats if you saw if you rewind and

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.060 
the stats if you saw if you rewind and
look<00:05:11.130> back<00:05:11.370> the<00:05:12.060> stats<00:05:12.360> weren't<00:05:12.720> that<00:05:12.870> great

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
look back the stats weren't that great

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.780
