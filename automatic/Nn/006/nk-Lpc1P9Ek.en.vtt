00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
for me that's like one of the really

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.660 
for me that's like one of the really
cool<00:01:14.290> features<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:14.979> this<00:01:15.130> doesn't<00:01:15.400> have<00:01:15.490> an

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
cool features and this doesn't have an

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.060 
cool features and this doesn't have an
offset<00:01:16.030> tilter<00:01:16.570> is<00:01:16.869> one<00:01:17.140> thing<00:01:17.350> so<00:01:17.680> it's

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
offset tilter is one thing so it's

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.950 
offset tilter is one thing so it's
straight<00:01:18.490> up<00:01:18.610> above<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.090> snares<00:01:19.360> game<00:01:19.660> so<00:01:19.840> you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
straight up above the snares game so you

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.140 
straight up above the snares game so you
actually<00:01:20.140> have<00:01:20.470> less<00:01:20.650> chance<00:01:21.490> of<00:01:21.730> the<00:01:21.880> drum

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
actually have less chance of the drum

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.870 
actually have less chance of the drum
vibrating<00:01:23.080> around<00:01:23.560> them<00:01:23.860> well<00:01:24.070> yeah<00:01:24.250> like
