00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.540
 transfer your contacts our calendar 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.490

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.869
 hello its ipod touch and pau and 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.759
 today I'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.550
 iphone 5 is what I bought your two 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.450
 days and tell you that I think about it after 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.550
 its use 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.529
 so of course I had before an iphone 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.230
 without was 64 ging now I 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.700
 passed 1 5s of 32 geek why because 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.399
 I used not even ten guides 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.190
 dato on my iphone so that gives me 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.870
 nothing to have a guide 64 so this one 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.570
 it's my iphone 5 just in the process of 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.949
 sell on the internet so it's not bad 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.120
 the same color when you take the 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.629
 silver gray is not really 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.030
 difference 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.769
 there is the camera that has changed so we 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.899
 is the whole more than five done 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:53.050
 we can not see the comparison anymore 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.940
 especially the top heidi that allows 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.249
 unlock your device for 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.159
 use it on the springboard if not there 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:02.559
 is not bad the same on the sides it's 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.819
 not bad the same thing so that's what 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.920
 it's good for those who have 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.980
 accessories already on the iphone 5 stops 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.470
 100% compatible on your iphone 5s 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.300
 so people but in my account of 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.610
 needs 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.080
 I also bought this here but I had it 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.700
 before for me a fund of 5 so that's 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.770
 an external battery that I just have to 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.030
 put on my iphone 5 aces like those 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.620
 one that it allows their charges and that 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.720
 is sold in stores especially Quebec a 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.720
 shift europe otherwise you may have 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.760
 mouse b or on any site 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.790
 to advance the word girl m 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.890
 to the toll which is so for the pimples 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.100
 it's really very well done 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.050
 the + button - the power for the camera to 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.670
 the backside worse if we see it the 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.680
 percentage of battery on which he 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.350
 all we have to do is 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.410
 move this little thing there so that the 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.630
 battery facal battery charger 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.060
 madoff to stop it and the advantage 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.160
 it's only for those who have no 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.100
 lightning but just the usb micro you 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.840
 can charge it in micro usb then 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.870
 to there I just want to remove this 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.659
 pocket there to show iphone 5s 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.159
 so after two days of use I 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.840
 find very very fast even 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.830
 compared to 5 even though I had 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.300
 the bones 7 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.070
 I do not even find that 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.010
 started much faster it's 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.970
 incredible so either we concretes you 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.070
 do so far 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.570
 udder to unlock your device if 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.490
 you have another person or another 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.470
 finger it's not going to work because 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.930
 it's not really with the imprint 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.410
 digital is really a very 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.990
 special so we see it like that with me 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.530
 I took the money tpiy I looked at the 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.050
 gombe 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.310
 ie the champagne the bells in 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.590
 bank then I really find it 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.540
 really more beautiful so more than 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.450
 buying an iphone 5 is what you have 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.760
 14 days for exchange either a 16 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.730
 32 or 64 human for another color 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.280
 so I went back to an apple store 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.900
 change it to 32 guigue god 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.090
 because in the photos it looked 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.380
 not very very beautiful legault so it's 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.630
 for that I had hesitated to buy it 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.680
 but when I saw it in real time recently 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.720
 I said wow 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.520
 who is really beautiful of gossas not even 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.709
 by the way it's these two things 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.680
 different so in terms of speed 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.030
 very fast internet 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.010
 it's all the same has failed as the iphone 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.050
 5 me a lot faster the camera 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.880
 either it would change really when 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.040
 you take a picture of an object or 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.600
 anything just because of the small 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.060
 flash of change that changes almost 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.920
 everything about the pictures made as being 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.920
 I take my beautiful keyboard in photo 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.860
 now I'm not their dirty photo is going to the 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.060
 see 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.010
 it's great pictures where you can 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.290
 may be wrong because we are 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.300
 camera over a camera but we 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.000
 and the flash is not very very white nor 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.100
 very very how to say 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.630
 golden makes it really another 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.600
 double it makes beautiful colors 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.610
 when you take people in pictures 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.750
 otherwise it's not bad all liked the same 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.640
 something that before me I handed over my 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.730
 apps that I had on my iphone 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.260
 5 through ag cloud then if not I 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.920
 am very satisfied with the iphone 5 is 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.440
 poor he 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.120
