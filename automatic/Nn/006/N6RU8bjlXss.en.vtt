00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
scoliotic her going off to one side the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.050 
scoliotic her going off to one side the
deformity<00:02:09.050> was<00:02:09.410> corrected<00:02:09.979> in<00:02:10.100> two<00:02:10.340> stages<00:02:10.670> in

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
deformity was corrected in two stages in

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.020 
deformity was corrected in two stages in
the<00:02:11.630> first<00:02:11.870> stage<00:02:12.110> we<00:02:12.350> go<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.710> and<00:02:12.740> release<00:02:13.370> the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
the first stage we go in and release the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.670 
the first stage we go in and release the
spine<00:02:14.390> anteriorly

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
spine anteriorly

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.619 
spine anteriorly
and<00:02:15.769> open<00:02:16.069> up<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.670> channels<00:02:17.269> where<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
and open up the channels where the

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.520 
and open up the channels where the
nerves<00:02:17.870> go<00:02:18.109> through<00:02:18.439> and<00:02:18.739> then<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.609> stage<00:02:19.879> 2

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
nerves go through and then the stage 2

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.349 
nerves go through and then the stage 2
involves<00:02:21.579> completely<00:02:22.579> trying<00:02:22.879> to<00:02:22.969> pull<00:02:23.209> the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
spine back over the post-operative

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.729 
spine back over the post-operative
x-rays<00:02:25.909> show<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.269> correction<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.590> can

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
x-rays show the correction and you can

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.399 
x-rays show the correction and you can
see<00:02:27.950> how<00:02:28.159> straight<00:02:28.579> her<00:02:28.730> spine<00:02:29.000> is<00:02:29.180> now<00:02:29.409> you
