00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
example of the trip wire so this is a

amazing<00:00:32.340> goodies<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:34.100> realize<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.520> are

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
amazing goodies and realize that you are

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.209 
amazing goodies and realize that you are
getting<00:00:36.360> mobbed<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.739> death<00:00:38.239> by<00:00:41.600> oops<00:00:42.600> and

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
getting mobbed to death by oops and

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:52.660 
getting mobbed to death by oops and
there<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.960> any<00:00:46.100> escape<00:00:48.500> is<00:00:49.820> futile

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
there you have it any escape is futile

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.920 
there you have it any escape is futile
now<00:00:54.559> how<00:00:55.559> does<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.860> work<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.520> might<00:00:56.640> ask

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
now how does this work you might ask

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.459 
now how does this work you might ask
well<00:00:58.820> let<00:00:59.820> me<00:00:59.940> show<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.149> quickly<00:01:00.930> how<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
well let me show you quickly how it

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.929 
well let me show you quickly how it
works<00:01:01.940> first<00:01:02.940> off<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.359> course<00:01:04.280> stop<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
works first off of course stop the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.130 
works first off of course stop the
redstone<00:01:06.330> current<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:08.360> it<00:01:09.360> takes<00:01:09.630> advantage

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
redstone current so it takes advantage

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.320 
redstone current so it takes advantage
of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.320> fact<00:01:10.560> that's<00:01:12.890> go<00:01:13.890> mode<00:01:14.640> 1<00:01:16.430> ok<00:01:17.430> takes

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
of the fact that's go mode 1 ok takes

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.179 
of the fact that's go mode 1 ok takes
adventure<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.840> fact<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.040> now

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
adventure to the fact that you can now

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:29.720 
adventure to the fact that you can now
dispense<00:01:20.729> lava<00:01:21.390> from<00:01:22.229> dispensers

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.980 

did<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.450> take<00:01:30.690> the<00:01:30.840> lava<00:01:32.240> well<00:01:33.240> love<00:01:33.870> was

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
did I take the lava well love was

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.090 
did I take the lava well love was
bugging<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.500> guess<00:01:35.810> but<00:01:36.810> yes<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.950> takes

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
bugging I guess but yes it takes

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.060 
bugging I guess but yes it takes
advantage<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.180> look<00:01:40.170> some<00:01:41.010> stuff

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
advantage of that and look some stuff

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.040 
advantage of that and look some stuff
survived<00:01:42.230> sorry<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:45.450> temptation<00:01:45.960> is

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
survived sorry the temptation is

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.640 
survived sorry the temptation is
overwhelming<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:47.570> yes<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.870> course<00:01:49.200> if<00:01:49.410> I<00:01:49.530> was

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
overwhelming but yes of course if I was

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.110 
overwhelming but yes of course if I was
to<00:01:49.740> be<00:01:49.800> practical<00:01:50.190> of<00:01:50.460> course<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.760> put<00:01:51.000> this

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
to be practical of course I put this

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.090 
to be practical of course I put this
more<00:01:51.450> dispensers<00:01:52.110> maybe<00:01:52.410> even<00:01:52.590> hidden<00:01:52.800> them

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
more dispensers maybe even hidden them

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.590 
more dispensers maybe even hidden them
but<00:01:53.790> that's<00:01:53.970> not<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.210> point<00:01:55.040> pretty<00:01:56.040> much<00:01:56.600> now

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
but that's not the point pretty much now

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.230 
but that's not the point pretty much now
it<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.780> very<00:01:58.140> easy<00:01:58.230> to<00:01:58.530> make<00:01:58.800> a<00:01:59.070> trap<00:01:59.580> because

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
it is very easy to make a trap because

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.580 
it is very easy to make a trap because
look<00:02:00.740> if<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.920> was<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.160> have<00:02:02.220> made<00:02:02.400> the<00:02:02.550> trap<00:02:03.590> with

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
look if I was to have made the trap with

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.880 
look if I was to have made the trap with
a<00:02:04.890> stunt<00:02:05.790> pressure<00:02:06.000> plate<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:07.710> would<00:02:07.740> have

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
a stunt pressure plate you would have

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.760 
a stunt pressure plate you would have
molted<00:02:08.430> noticed<00:02:08.940> immediately<00:02:09.510> that<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.649> was<00:02:10.740> a

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
molted noticed immediately that it was a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.450 
molted noticed immediately that it was a
stone<00:02:11.010> pressure<00:02:11.190> plate<00:02:13.700> on<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.540> other<00:02:15.690> hand

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
stone pressure plate on the other hand

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:23.030 
stone pressure plate on the other hand
simply<00:02:17.460> having<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:19.370> tripwire<00:02:21.590> means<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.800> don't

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
simply having a tripwire means you don't

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.970 
simply having a tripwire means you don't
need<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.560> much<00:02:25.830> more<00:02:25.860> discreet

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
need that and it is much more discreet

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.570 
need that and it is much more discreet
one<00:02:28.980> thing<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.610> try<00:02:29.760> first<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.420> items

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
one thing I on the try first is to items

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:40.310 
one thing I on the try first is to items
dispenser<00:02:34.850> nope<00:02:36.290> okay<00:02:37.290> but<00:02:38.690> yes<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.959> any

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
dispenser nope okay but yes and any

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.870 
dispenser nope okay but yes and any
other<00:02:40.560> redstone<00:02:41.280> current<00:02:41.720> would<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:42.930> set<00:02:43.470> it

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
other redstone current would have set it

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.810 
other redstone current would have set it
well<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.090> would<00:02:45.209> have<00:02:45.330> set<00:02:46.200> off<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.440> current

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
well that would have set off the current

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.580 
well that would have set off the current
would<00:02:47.820> be<00:02:47.970> much<00:02:48.330> more<00:02:48.360> visible<00:02:48.660> except<00:02:49.350> for

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
would be much more visible except for

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.190 
would be much more visible except for
proximity<00:02:50.580> detectors<00:02:51.330> but<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:51.750> let's<00:02:51.900> not<00:02:52.050> get

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
proximity detectors but so let's not get

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.280 
proximity detectors but so let's not get
into<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.910> for<00:02:53.910> simple<00:02:54.300> redstone<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:55.020> is

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
into that for simple redstone is this is

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.310 
into that for simple redstone is this is
the<00:02:56.070> new<00:02:56.430> thing<00:02:57.050> that'll<00:02:58.050> think<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.290> a

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
the new thing that'll think of a

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.590 
the new thing that'll think of a
crafting<00:02:58.680> recipe<00:02:59.370> yet<00:02:59.550> but<00:02:59.730> there<00:03:00.060> are<00:03:00.180> many

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
crafting recipe yet but there are many
