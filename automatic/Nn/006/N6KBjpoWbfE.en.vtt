00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
turn it so far and then you can flip it

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.129

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
that's facing that way and you can just

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.020 
that's facing that way and you can just
really<00:05:03.440> mess<00:05:03.650> with<00:05:03.680> a<00:05:03.949> turnaround<00:05:04.340> it's<00:05:04.789> real

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
really mess with a turnaround it's real

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.620 
really mess with a turnaround it's real
cool<00:05:05.270> and<00:05:06.490> here's<00:05:07.490> one<00:05:07.729> thing<00:05:07.909> I<00:05:08.000> really<00:05:08.449> like

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.250 
cool and here's one thing I really like
about<00:05:08.659> it<00:05:08.930> look<00:05:09.830> you<00:05:10.400> can<00:05:10.550> fold<00:05:10.849> them<00:05:11.150> up<00:05:11.260> here

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
about it look you can fold them up here

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:20.140 
about it look you can fold them up here
I'll<00:05:12.560> show<00:05:12.620> you<00:05:17.710> see<00:05:18.710> they're<00:05:19.669> really<00:05:19.909> small

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
I'll show you see they're really small

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.360 
I'll show you see they're really small
they<00:05:20.840> can't<00:05:21.110> fit<00:05:21.349> in<00:05:21.470> your<00:05:21.590> pocket<00:05:21.860> when<00:05:22.190> it's

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
you could bring them to school or you

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.800 
you could bring them to school or you
know<00:05:30.740> whatever<00:05:30.889> so<00:05:31.639> yeah<00:05:32.650> ok<00:05:33.650> now<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:33.889> cord

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
know whatever so yeah ok now the cord

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.439 
know whatever so yeah ok now the cord
what<00:05:35.810> is<00:05:35.930> it<00:05:36.229> has<00:05:36.710> two<00:05:37.039> separate<00:05:37.400> cords<00:05:38.030> a<00:05:38.210> core

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
what is it has two separate cords a core

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.760 
what is it has two separate cords a core
for<00:05:38.690> each<00:05:38.840> of<00:05:39.080> the<00:05:40.870> parts<00:05:41.870> like<00:05:42.560> for<00:05:42.740> each

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
for each of the parts like for each

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.610 
for each of the parts like for each
speaker<00:05:43.190> there's<00:05:43.699> one<00:05:43.880> there's<00:05:44.479> two<00:05:44.599> and<00:05:44.870> then

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
speaker there's one there's two and then

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.879 
speaker there's one there's two and then
it<00:05:45.740> goes<00:05:45.889> and<00:05:46.310> it<00:05:46.490> binds<00:05:47.060> right<00:05:47.479> here<00:05:47.750> and<00:05:47.990> then

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
it goes and it binds right here and then

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.100 
it goes and it binds right here and then
it's<00:05:49.130> just<00:05:49.220> that<00:05:49.669> remains<00:05:50.150> as<00:05:50.300> one<00:05:50.509> chord<00:05:50.810> and

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
it's just that remains as one chord and

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.379 
it's just that remains as one chord and
then<00:05:51.199> certainly<00:05:51.650> goes<00:05:51.949> to<00:05:51.979> the<00:05:52.130> jack<00:05:52.400> so

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
then certainly goes to the jack so

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.230 
then certainly goes to the jack so
that's<00:05:53.570> how<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:53.840> code<00:05:54.530> works<00:05:54.560> I<00:05:55.310> hope<00:05:56.090> you

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
that's how the code works I hope you

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.360 
that's how the code works I hope you
