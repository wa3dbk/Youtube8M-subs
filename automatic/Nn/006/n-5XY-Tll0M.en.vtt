00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
rise in the cost of fish but again you

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.910 
rise in the cost of fish but again you
want<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> rock<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.240> load<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.720> when<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:55.860> a

want the rock to load up when you get a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.260 
want the rock to load up when you get a
good<00:01:56.130> fish<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.000> cushion

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
good fish on so that you can cushion

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.609 
good fish on so that you can cushion
those<00:01:57.540> big<00:01:57.720> head<00:01:57.930> shakes<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.290> get<00:01:58.380> over<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
those big head shakes and get over the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.109 
those big head shakes and get over the
top<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.979> wall<00:01:59.100> get<00:01:59.280> your<00:01:59.399> transducer<00:02:00.000> out

top of the wall get your transducer out
of<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.270> wall<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.049> that's<00:02:01.259> why<00:02:01.619> our

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
of the wall and so that's why our

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.980 
of the wall and so that's why our
spinning<00:02:02.460> rods<00:02:02.640> been<00:02:02.820> able<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.000> catch<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.810> many

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
spinning rods been able to catch so many

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.539 
spinning rods been able to catch so many
more<00:02:04.140> walleyes<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:04.890> many<00:02:05.070> more<00:02:05.159> anglers

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
more walleyes for so many more anglers

more walleyes for so many more anglers
on<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.820> ice<00:02:05.969> another<00:02:06.600> thing<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.930> we're

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
on the ice another thing that we're

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.150 
on the ice another thing that we're
seeing<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.469> lot<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.770> people<00:02:08.070> are

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
seeing is that a lot of people are

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.830 
seeing is that a lot of people are
trying<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.579> rattle<00:02:08.850> baits<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.420> some<00:02:09.570> of<00:02:09.690> the

this right here
in<00:02:21.329> the<00:02:21.840> key<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.140> using<00:02:22.290> these<00:02:22.470> rattle<00:02:22.799> baits

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
in the key to using these rattle baits

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.520 
in the key to using these rattle baits
with<00:02:23.730> these<00:02:23.850> small<00:02:24.150> treble<00:02:24.510> hooks<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:24.959> use<00:02:25.410> a

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
with these small treble hooks just use a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.590 
with these small treble hooks just use a
little<00:02:25.769> bit<00:02:26.010> softer<00:02:26.430> action<00:02:26.880> rather<00:02:27.299> this

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
little bit softer action rather this

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.699 
little bit softer action rather this
loads<00:02:27.900> up<00:02:28.079> a<00:02:28.200> little<00:02:28.380> bit

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
loads up a little bit

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.530 
loads up a little bit
and<00:02:29.010> when<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.250> stroke<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.090> lure<00:02:30.299> that's

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
and when you stroke that lure that's

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.780 
and when you stroke that lure that's
soft<00:02:30.810> or<00:02:31.019> rock<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.470> really<00:02:32.220> engages<00:02:32.340> these

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
soft or rock it really engages these

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.550 
soft or rock it really engages these
rattles<00:02:33.209> okay<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.750> then<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> lot<00:02:34.019> of<00:02:34.109> times<00:02:34.320> two

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
rattles okay and then a lot of times two

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.690 
rattles okay and then a lot of times two
of<00:02:34.650> these<00:02:34.769> small<00:02:35.040> treble<00:02:35.340> hooks<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:35.579> need

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
of these small treble hooks you need

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.340 
of these small treble hooks you need
just<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.910> touch<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.329> a<00:02:36.390> softer<00:02:36.810> rod<00:02:37.019> so<00:02:37.200> that's

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
just a touch of a softer rod so that's

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.809 
just a touch of a softer rod so that's
why<00:02:37.470> I've<00:02:37.530> designed<00:02:37.890> this<00:02:38.010> bait<00:02:38.220> casting<00:02:38.640> rod

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
why I've designed this bait casting rod

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.300 
why I've designed this bait casting rod
specifically<00:02:39.810> for<00:02:40.110> these<00:02:40.620> rattle<00:02:41.010> baits

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
specifically for these rattle baits

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.830 
specifically for these rattle baits
does<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.760> other<00:02:41.879> thing<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.120> notice<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.540> us<00:02:42.660> see

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
does the other thing to notice to us see

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.890 
does the other thing to notice to us see
how<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.959> spiral<00:02:43.440> wrap

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
how the spiral wrap

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.199 
how the spiral wrap
the<00:02:44.019> line<00:02:44.530> never<00:02:44.799> touches<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.250> rod<00:02:45.489> Blake<00:02:45.760> and

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
the line never touches a rod Blake and

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.940 
the line never touches a rod Blake and
when<00:02:46.299> you<00:02:46.390> load<00:02:46.659> that<00:02:46.690> rod<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.650> get<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:47.769> nice

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
when you load that rod you get a nice

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.770 
when you load that rod you get a nice
smooth<00:02:48.310> transition<00:02:48.459> down<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.180> hole<00:02:49.360> all

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
smooth transition down the hole all

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.229 
smooth transition down the hole all
these<00:02:49.989> features<00:02:50.440> were<00:02:51.220> designed<00:02:51.670> from<00:02:51.970> just

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
these features were designed from just

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.509 
these features were designed from just
spending<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.540> lot<00:02:52.659> of<00:02:52.690> time<00:02:52.810> out<00:02:53.170> on<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.319> ice

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
spending a lot of time out on the ice

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.130 
spending a lot of time out on the ice
figuring<00:02:54.519> out<00:02:54.580> things<00:02:54.940> seeing<00:02:55.239> applications

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
figuring out things seeing applications

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.570 
figuring out things seeing applications
that<00:02:56.260> we<00:02:56.500> knew<00:02:56.709> that<00:02:56.860> we<00:02:56.950> had<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.129> build<00:02:57.310> rod

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
that we knew that we had to build rod

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.580 
that we knew that we had to build rod
for<00:02:57.879> and<00:02:58.209> present<00:02:58.810> them<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.989> usually<00:02:59.349> you<00:02:59.470> can

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
for and present them to usually you can

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.459 
for and present them to usually you can
go<00:02:59.709> up<00:02:59.799> get<00:03:00.010> more<00:03:00.190> fish
