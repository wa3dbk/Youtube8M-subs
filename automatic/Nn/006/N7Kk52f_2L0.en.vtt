00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:30.349
 informative and guys and gentlemen I return to 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.840
 channel my vacation was over and that 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.879
 means that I watched daily videos and I think 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.750
 that more than one is going to love that 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.790
 what I just said 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.200
 and well, I have a lot of things that 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.680
 tell you but first I have to tell you 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.140
 count is the subject of the review of the 1.6 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.220
 that you are now looking at the map of the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.320
 review of the 1.6 voucher that was was 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.850
 working on it like crazy when 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.550
 suddenly something very important came up 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.830
 and I had to completely abort the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.820
 theme of recording this video that is that I 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:05.129
 it annoyed a lot and I went totally 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.410
 unable to determine it in fact according to 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.100
 moment when I said I do not have time and 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.440
 can not finish it then I'm sorry 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.229
 that's why you already have lots of reviews 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.360
 people the interests have made them super 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.950
 complete so you have all the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.430
 information on youtube you just have to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.430

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.100
 being pretty nice to my taste 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.930

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.990

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.070

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.260
 a danger or in a mainz to a pyramid 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.620

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.360

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.360
 although really, I've been working 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:03.140
 very much I was not doing a thousand things 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.900
 of the canal but without the pressure and 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.120
 worry about having to upload a video 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.069
 a day is worth many times because 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.720
 I like it a lot and as much as I love 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.890
 this is because it upsets me a little bit 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.540
 then they have come great 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.220

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.670

 helping in a server to make a 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:37.040
 pvp server probably ends 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.930

 I come back with the live streaming they're worth 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.829

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.490
 the 1.6 point 2 since I could not do the 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:28.030
 review was going to make a criticism about the 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:31.060
 1.6 but they have taken the 1.6 points where 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.320
 they arrange all the things by which 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.570
 I was hungry vale was pissed off and 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.240
 well they fixed the sprint what is 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.419
 what do you see I give double w and now 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.510
 I come out with half a second delay 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:48.970
 start running this is a hateful thing 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.090
 I said that I was going to finish the series of his 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.920
 rival and I keep what I said 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.750
 even though I have fixed the book 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.139

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.270
 happy for everyone since 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.280

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.860
 the worlds its rival to you not only to 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.129

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.469
