00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.949 
up but there's an easy solution to this
okay<00:03:23.459> first<00:03:23.760> thing<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:24.690> they're<00:03:24.870> not

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
okay first thing is so they're not

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.810 
okay first thing is so they're not
focusing<00:03:25.560> completely<00:03:25.709> on<00:03:26.100> gripping<00:03:26.640> that's

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
focusing completely on gripping that's

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.430 
focusing completely on gripping that's
why<00:03:27.030> we're<00:03:27.420> doing<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.750> stops<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.260> things

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
why we're doing the stops and things

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.530 
why we're doing the stops and things
like<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.650> at<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:28.980> start<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.970> next<00:03:30.269> thing<00:03:30.390> is

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
like that at the start the next thing is

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.000 
like that at the start the next thing is
your<00:03:30.720> fingers<00:03:31.049> are<00:03:31.200> designed<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.860> have

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
your fingers are designed to have

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.280 
your fingers are designed to have
strength<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.489> that<00:03:32.760> closing<00:03:33.090> action<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.959> they

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
strength in that closing action and they

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.170 
strength in that closing action and they
have<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.590> in<00:03:34.920> one<00:03:35.130> direction<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.640> just<00:03:36.030> that

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
have it in one direction so just that

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.750 
have it in one direction so just that
racking<00:03:36.540> around<00:03:36.870> but<00:03:37.680> fingers<00:03:38.040> can<00:03:38.280> not<00:03:38.459> have

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
racking around but fingers can not have

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.130 
racking around but fingers can not have
a<00:03:38.790> lot<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.000> strength<00:03:39.360> in<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.570> sideways

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
a lot of strength in the sideways

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.300 
a lot of strength in the sideways
direction<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:41.220> when<00:03:41.790> I'm<00:03:41.910> here<00:03:42.330> rather<00:03:42.780> than

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
direction so when I'm here rather than

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.890 
direction so when I'm here rather than
get<00:03:44.310> his<00:03:44.430> finger<00:03:44.760> coming<00:03:45.120> straight<00:03:45.390> up<00:03:45.450> if<00:03:45.750> I

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
get his finger coming straight up if I

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.810 
get his finger coming straight up if I
can't<00:03:46.140> get<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.440> come<00:03:46.680> straight<00:03:47.040> up<00:03:47.070> if<00:03:47.580> I

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
can't get it to come straight up if I

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.630 
can't get it to come straight up if I
turn<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.420> side<00:03:48.890> okay<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.370> joint

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
turn it to the side okay the joint

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.410 
turn it to the side okay the joint
starts<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.209> twist<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.900> until

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
starts to twist and until

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.570 
starts to twist and until
I'm<00:03:52.870> coming<00:03:53.200> it's<00:03:53.440> very<00:03:53.740> very<00:03:54.010> difficult<00:03:54.190> to

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
I'm coming it's very very difficult to

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.720 
I'm coming it's very very difficult to
resist<00:03:54.880> that<00:03:55.000> okay<00:03:55.840> then<00:03:56.349> I<00:03:56.680> just<00:03:57.190> continue

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
resist that okay then I just continue

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.370 
resist that okay then I just continue
get<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.209> finger<00:03:58.510> up<00:03:58.660> grab<00:03:59.470> on<00:03:59.940> grab<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.150> wrist

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
get the finger up grab on grab the wrist

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.830 
get the finger up grab on grab the wrist
and<00:04:02.380> come<00:04:02.680> around<00:04:02.830> out<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.459> side<00:04:03.840> okay

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
and come around out to the side okay

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.750 
and come around out to the side okay
let's<00:04:05.290> have<00:04:05.410> a<00:04:05.500> look<00:04:05.620> at<00:04:05.770> it<00:04:05.860> one<00:04:06.010> last<00:04:06.190> time

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
let's have a look at it one last time

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.430 
let's have a look at it one last time
so<00:04:07.030> it's<00:04:07.150> grabbing<00:04:07.480> on<00:04:07.599> grab<00:04:07.870> up<00:04:08.170> high<00:04:08.380> this
