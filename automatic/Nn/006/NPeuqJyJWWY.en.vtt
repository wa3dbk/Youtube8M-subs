00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.749 
one procedure will probably do you know
a<00:01:52.259> thousand<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.890> twelve<00:01:53.069> hundred<00:01:53.250> grafts<00:01:53.549> in

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
a thousand and twelve hundred grafts in

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.010 
a thousand and twelve hundred grafts in
this<00:01:53.969> zone<00:01:54.179> okay

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
this zone okay

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.559 
this zone okay
and<00:01:55.490> what<00:01:56.490> we'll<00:01:56.640> do<00:01:56.789> is<00:01:56.819> if<00:01:57.209> you<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.539> a

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
and what we'll do is if you have a

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.179 
and what we'll do is if you have a
second<00:01:58.049> session<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.500> get<00:01:58.590> more<00:01:58.799> density

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
second session to get more density

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.480 
second session to get more density
you'll<00:01:59.490> really<00:01:59.789> only<00:02:00.000> need<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.689> zone

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
you'll really only need it in this zone

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.919 
you'll really only need it in this zone
and<00:02:02.490> again<00:02:02.729> that's<00:02:02.909> that'll<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> preference

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
and again that's that'll be a preference

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.539 
and again that's that'll be a preference
thing<00:02:04.109> for<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.439> but<00:02:04.679> this<00:02:05.099> should<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:05.399> a

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
thing for you but this should be a

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.800 
thing for you but this should be a
little<00:02:05.819> bit<00:02:05.939> thinner<00:02:06.179> but<00:02:06.420> we<00:02:06.509> just<00:02:06.630> don't

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
little bit thinner but we just don't

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.749 
little bit thinner but we just don't
want<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.200> totally<00:02:07.799> recede<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.250> up<00:02:08.340> nothing

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
want it to totally recede it up nothing

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.059 
want it to totally recede it up nothing
there<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.450> what<00:02:09.780> we'll<00:02:09.959> do<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.739> we're<00:02:10.920> going<00:02:11.009> to

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
there so what we'll do is we're going to

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.289 
there so what we'll do is we're going to
take<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.370> hair<00:02:11.519> from<00:02:11.549> back<00:02:11.849> here

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
take the hair from back here

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.280 
take the hair from back here
okay<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.340> we'll<00:02:14.450> have<00:02:15.450> your<00:02:15.599> hair<00:02:15.840> combed<00:02:16.110> up

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
okay and we'll have your hair combed up

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.589 
okay and we'll have your hair combed up
here<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.829> we'll<00:02:17.010> tape<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.579> so<00:02:18.030> I'll

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
here and we'll tape it and so I'll

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.449 
here and we'll tape it and so I'll
remove<00:02:18.959> this<00:02:19.140> trip<00:02:19.379> from<00:02:19.560> back<00:02:19.739> here<00:02:20.010> and

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
remove this trip from back here and

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.800 
remove this trip from back here and
you'll<00:02:20.579> never<00:02:20.760> see<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.209> when<00:02:21.329> you<00:02:21.390> walk<00:02:21.599> out

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810
