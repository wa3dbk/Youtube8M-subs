00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.740
 how are you here in a new video of 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.619
 youtube guys I'm here I'm very 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.869
 grateful for the 970 subscribers who 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.820
 We are already and well, here I bring you a 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.189
 review of one of the best modes that 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.950
 found in minecraft forum is good 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.050
 the creator has been vai tarajal action to 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.520
 see if I forget that they say to me hey then 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.079
 there are never six the creators and it is not 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.540
 for badness is worth or because they want me 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.520
 take in the merit no if not because 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.320
 I'm just very forgetful and so I 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.150
 I forget to say it's worth 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.370
 so nothing since the map has been created 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.320
 by me for the dark and magic here always 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.090
 in alone and in divided this gp and good 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.590
 Nothing simply wanted to show you 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.330
 what are all the mechanisms of 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.160
 redstone because if I did not tell you 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.770
 this way it is worth rest as we see 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.420
 here are redstone good first 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.490
 we have the lever and the reason that we 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.230
 allows then to open the door is worth a 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.690
 time that we want you know 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.299
 we can open it close here we see the 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.890
 button is worth the stone button that 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.229
 open and close it is worth beige with a 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.509
 2 seconds time I think here we have 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.490
 for the metal door that was not in 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.090
 the version but then we will add it 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.619
 why 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.869
 as we see here we create a 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.659
 page and we have here all the 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.340
 items worth this consists of a supplement 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.289
 sorry that investigates cutting all the 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.340
 things that this consists of a supplement 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.170
 and a mod 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.270
 inscribed that good then we're going to 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.670
 add and we would simply create this 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.950
 leaf with the wolf of the rest and with all 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.899
 the blocks let's say and the items of the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.579
 restón and what happens with the things that 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.079
 they were on the sword page 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.700
 they are simply here, as you see 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.709
 we have plan torch to cube in short 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.270
 good to put it restore quique that 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.009
 that looks pretty and now that it's done 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.409
 night it will be nice what the 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.060
 the camperas good as we see then we go 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.530
 to turn it off today here we have 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.819
 just the same but with the door 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.459
 ok metal ok link did not put a 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.420
 that a minecraft is worth the link of this 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.950
 map so I'll leave it in the 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.360
 description is valid so you can 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.179
 download if you want to do review 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.099
 and other good as we see this when 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.049
 pass by it 's like it's a button 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:09.849
 so it's going to turn on here as we see 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.349
 a mechanism that there stops a 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.209
 poquillo and returns to take hold a 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.769
 poquillo and he gets it again and good 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.350
 Well, as we see, there is a lamp that can be seen 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.540
 very nice and good around here I have 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.640
 tried to do 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.040
 the same as this is true but I started I do not know 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.990
 if you know that then and in xbox then it 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.840
 does this way it's worth and it's 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.390
 we can choose the good time here 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.610
 has a low ombú voucher like you do not want 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.930
 and mark and then it can not be done so 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.090
 as we see no matter how much you do it 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.880
 fast as you see in pieces and makes pim 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.280
 pam pim pam until it gets blocked and then 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.620
 the two are blocked and you can not 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.660
 that nothing guys that can not be now 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.100
 as demonstrated by this mechanism here 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.380
 I've done that because it's very simple 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.910
 as we see then we can move our 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.710
 block of networks we made concrete there 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.960
 We can move it from one side of the 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.540
 another as we see here where to move and 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.890
 here we can move it and well then 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.390
 just to make a small 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.160
 door is worth it then we can cover over there 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.690
 we can put two babícora blocks 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.660
 could teach how to put all blocks 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.190
 and well, here we have the same thing but 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.530
 with the rest part though I'm going to 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.620
 leave on because it serves very nice and 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.630
 here we have a box or plate 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.180
 pressure that here with our body 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.270
 with a valid mode we can turn it on and 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.250
 turn it off, turn it on and turn it off 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.140
 and good here we have this that then 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.210
 you will say it is practically the same parking 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.580
 but not why because here we 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.870
 we can launch our attempt that good 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.470
 how are we in creative because I do not know 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.840
 launches but if we throw our item what 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.880
 what is going to do then it is also 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.310
 we make an item here on Baltic now 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.780
 Well, I can not activate 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.760
 It's worth not only with our body it's worth 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.350
 the sections an item to this one is like going 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.150
 to be a little harder then it's not going 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.670
 to activate with an item only with our 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.820
 body in this case, it is going to 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.500
 activate on an item so good that 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.660
 we have around here guys here 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.830
 we have a cannon if a cannon that's going 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.320
 to throw trees we are going to put 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.590
 here to throw up so 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.730
 let's try my latest invention in the 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.740
 hand 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.480
 reston ok and let's run we're going to 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.410
 get it and let's put the water in here and 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.860
 let's go flying 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.410
 and what happens what happened guys this great 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.570
 mod fire nothing said what I hope you 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.950
 have liked the video that you share 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.320
 with your friends so that more people 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.970
 can download this great mod that by 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.040
 true is a native mode it's not worth a 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.780
 good is a mobile strike but also what 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.320
 the most important part let's say of the mod 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.480
 because one reason is to say a complement 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.920
 a pk that posts said all the links 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.570
 in the description to create gay clark 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.810
 and enjoy it eye if you do not enjoy it 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.160
 Well, it's bad and good, guys, nothing 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.260
 said I hope you liked the 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.260
 video you already know that a like that helps 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.360
 it always helps too much even more than 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.830
 what should help to win online 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.960
 that helps too much and exceeds more videos 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.450

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.130

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.270
 I really had a tremendous illusion 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.410
 good boy lying defended but I 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.420
