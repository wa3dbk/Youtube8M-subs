00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.310
 alexander hello dcp let's have a look 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.500
 topic briefly and that is mine 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.740
 favorit in shows you the same as 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.559
 Although the camp was the first we were 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.080
 the same looks practically only thick 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.180
 string similar to the car 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.310
 quite interesting in those stories 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.189
 because I intend to go up 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.330
 correspond 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.740
 accordingly also small packmaÃŸ 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.960
 low weight 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.519
 There is also an ultralight good 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.500
 I have seen today in business 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.780
 but he felt that I felt that 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.730
 as if you had a hat from the for feeling 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.219
 Here it is too extreme again 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.559
 ultralight that's why he is in this 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.510
 car well I've tested so well 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.860
 I go for a hike here 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.840
 you can see you find yourself 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.910
 probably further back transmission 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.920
 I'll tell you right away if you have something 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.170
 looks for it often inside is that 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.809
 Nothing for you year but a good one 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.510
 Hidden practically to that you 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.359
 probably less but yours 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.129
 life will be okay for sports then 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.840
 definitely something more padded than 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.540
 this ultra live ticker or this one 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.000
 compact things so my favorite right in the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.799
 first video is money here what me 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.280
 even surprised it is from the small caught 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.610
 game 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.950
 I do not know the brand but why 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.720
 First of all, I like it here in here 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.880
 the bend for the carbine on the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.290
 right side 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.340
 German shipowners have coal either 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.220
 Left 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.579
 yes this laichinger and otherwise fits 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.439
 the impeccable and here, too 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.540
 thighs are far enough apart and 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.850
 one more detail here inside 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.290
 Thigh is thinner than sewn 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.390
 in the rest of thigh 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.290
 I am quite good for that, we are others 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.780
 are either sleep then it has so 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.420
 in turn, I'll give you a word 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.549
 with the whole via ferrata law and 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.590
 So he goes just the times know 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.880
 since at the wall long a traverse 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.159
 correspond or in bar approx 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.710
 high up the mountain at the wall 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.780
 accordingly and so it can detail here 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.119
 you can practically bend it 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.799
 open and hermes is left open 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.390
 can rausholen that as if first 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.039
 I could wrap my clothes 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.019
 corresponding 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.489
 good part synonymous rausholen I think 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.349
 interesting if it use worldwide 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.879
 cut at others, they are rather firm 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.769
 I hope we can watch it 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.890
 As always, it is now this one 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.989
 ultralight things since this one 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.840
 Representative only disadvantage I found 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.849
 is you can behind the asg 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.409
 Do not regulate load there you have to 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.420
 what came up was not in small ones 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:39.829
 knot in or something or something 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.480
 once below rumschrauben so on the 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.400
 is actually my favorite low 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.239
 pack size balance times on the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.239
 Libra needs 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.560
 is also a thigh back to 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.360
 far from the bands 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.660
 I show the matching well that is from 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.970
 The bender is just too far away 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.390
 interesting that you are here actually 20 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.310
 kilometers as the crow flies are 320 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.140
 kilometer 30 kilometers away 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.330
 live in the airport and still the 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.050
 planes are still over it 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.750
 fly 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:23.220
 This is frankfurt airport is one 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.720
 Of course I wanted to hang in there 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.850
 not now but here too 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.820
 exactly accept gifts inside 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.910
 s is ground made shorter this looks 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.890
 simply more comfortable and narrower here 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.480
 There is often something like that and it is just 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.130
 not like other good ones you still see 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.920
 later slept here but from behind 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.200
 this is my favorite 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.480
 so far because he fulfills that 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.150
 except that she is swimming behind 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.160
 may be fritter bit longer 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.380
 example simply means little knot 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.330
 purely then that probably holds back 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.610
 but otherwise it has to look like big 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:04.170
 take advantage that the coal does not fall to you 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.170
 the kielerin good of the believer 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.190
 technology clothing hannes 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:13.050
 standard product costs with buffett euro 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.470
 Again I pack handling and wonder 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.000
 to amazon you can look at and 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.140
 otherwise it is now the next 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.490
 rate still weigh halt halt halt 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.720
 this is a acrobatic performance makes 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.710
 you jump those things 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.710
 I think I'm really worth it 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:39.770
 now even as young fourth graders even 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.770
 308 have good again then to the next
