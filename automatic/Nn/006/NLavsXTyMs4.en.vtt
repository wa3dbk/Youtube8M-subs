00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello people and nice that you are there 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.250
 we'll look at my forest now 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.830
 driving park 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.910
 You can already see something there 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.929
 in it are three different mods 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.600
 once here skipper mitreder so to speak 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.460
 which you can haul trees here mean 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.109
 timber loader attach the tractor to 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.260
 can 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:28.019
 and now such a pair of pliers for the band 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.490
 lada for growing and for trees to pull 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.810
 I will be all mods and we 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.700
 Describe again to link with it 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.750
 everybody is so in this video, it works 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.899
 mainly around the front loader here 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.540
 you can find it under mods home appliances here 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.149
 the first block skipper frontline 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.180
 lockscreen dependent land then in advance 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.010
 clear and just the normal lures scanner 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.690
 for rear age there are separately to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.789
 download links below every now and then 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.030
 description well we have the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:02.370
 front loader still lure you can completely 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.920
 normal from and followers works 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.939
 music also pans I have one 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.700
 taken a small tractor here 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.040
 you have seen that moves pretty much 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.979
 strong with the star strongest weight 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.670
 locked weight there and is six kilo 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.170
 it scarce 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.170
 that works but it is scarce 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.330
 Unfortunately I can weight the front of 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.000
 the whole not as low 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.170
 that does not work that way and here 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.880
 have a big tug with the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.260
 looks all a bit better 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.410
 Of course, he also wobbles a bit 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.300
 but that works if you get up fast 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.450
 and ab driving while you always 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.240
 never has to think about it in reality 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.040
 quickly up and down though comes in synonymous 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.910
 Tug not forced but now back 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.340
 the market works better and so 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.350
 everything as usual with me in 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.840
 black kept the first version always 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.580
 black that you have to know first 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.110
 version black and only in the departure 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.920
 second or third version comes in there 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.230
 Color well we only take the power saw 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.910
 and our beautiful birch must turn 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.090
 Believe is always the same 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:15.620
 not correct 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:17.610
 I wanted to buy power saw here 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.680
 the birch always has to 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:32.940
 suffer should be understood as disturbing 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:35.280
 bit warm then cut away here 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.590
 I'll do it again first 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.360
 unfortunately we found it nice to go with 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.900
 the two mouse buttons can be 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.220
 Of course, open the pliers again and 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.220
 close and turn again 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:02.270
 strong against the tree high today 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.770
 do not take the wrong direction 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.930
 up and you can see you can 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.640
 accordingly, just the whole tree 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.830
 lift and drive naturally 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.280
 Driving faster is not advantageous 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.260
 that of course you also say so 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.440
 It works as far as you can see and I can 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.280
 transport it well that comes 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.820
 of course with all the trees below 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.320
 and there 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:32.290
 so this is variant 2b the shield here 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.940
 I found a collision so you have a tree 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.290
 the not so nice from the side of 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.870
 can grip no problem 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:42.670
 Turn the pliers 90 degrees down 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:48.480
 so you drive over the tree together 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:52.470
 adjust with the shield down 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:57.220
 and lo and behold you can really get the tree 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.710
 wonderfully pick up and the whole tree 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.300
 tangible almost a whole tree a branch 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.190
 fathers can then transport 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.330
 of course, too slowly 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.730
 driving noon not complete now 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.140
 drive fast around the bend 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.940
 Well, it does not slip out any more 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.510
 but of course you can do it in time 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.190
 slip for example now has ok 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.280
 get caught up and now why soon 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.230
 it's easy to understand 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.860
 if you have dranhÃ¤ngen tree friends 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:30.640
 or the reality so its like mine 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:35.800
 is curious, yes, here with back 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:38.260
 the other kids doing what he does 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.140
 you could also do that with the 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.770
 turn the mouse button 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:47.580
 I have to open device change 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.190
 close as clear and coach of course 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.490
 and with the xt I can go down 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.730
 catch the tree and we lift and 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.110
 can then go for a walk with the tree 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.520
 a good combination with the demand 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.810
 if you see him out of the woods when 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.830
 he is in and off with farthmann 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.750
 then I have another one here 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.960
 school force qrf works of course 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:15.190
 also complete mouse control here too 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.490
 everything as usual with v you can him 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.490
 reduce 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.850
 so extend and support 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.070
 you already have a decent stock 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.720
 where you can issue Schlippe 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.690
 and do not always go on the trailer 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.510
 so that was my little introduction 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.370
 in my fleet I myself 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.640
 I have hoped you have fun there 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.160
 once said all three left in the again 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.290
 description and the asstel a collabo 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.730
 That's what you liked and let yourself go 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:51.630
 not by the textures and the small ones 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.910
 German animations are very important to me 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.900
 that the mods work and that 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.230
 also error-free 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:01.100
 one sees completely error-free all mods 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.570
 and that's me right textures and 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.160
 baubles are personally incidental to me 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.730
 unfortunately you have to with it 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.520
 Life 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.350
 but as I said nv200 income mostly 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.080
 textures as well as here with mine 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.130
 Ill well with that much fun 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.840
 Hopefully we'll meet again in the next 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.840
 video makes it good people until then
