hey youtubers this is tim AKA sky and

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.829 
hey youtubers this is tim AKA sky and
this<00:00:04.560> is<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.799> be<00:00:04.920> Twista<00:00:05.279> toriel<00:00:05.640> in<00:00:05.879> this

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
this is the be Twista toriel in this

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.330 
this is the be Twista toriel in this
tutorial<00:00:06.990> t<00:00:07.680> is<00:00:07.830> going<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.069> be<00:00:08.160> demonstrating

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
tutorial t is going to be demonstrating

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.879 
tutorial t is going to be demonstrating
the<00:00:08.760> B<00:00:08.910> twist<00:00:09.260> okay<00:00:10.260> so<00:00:10.320> this<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.679> what<00:00:10.800> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
the B twist okay so this is what the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.550 
the B twist okay so this is what the
move<00:00:11.070> looks<00:00:11.280> like<00:00:15.109> so<00:00:16.109> let's<00:00:16.289> get<00:00:16.410> this

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
move looks like so let's get this

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.950 
move looks like so let's get this
started<00:00:16.770> breaking<00:00:17.730> down<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> beaches<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
started breaking down the beaches the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.480 
started breaking down the beaches the
beat<00:00:19.199> west<00:00:19.500> otherwise<00:00:19.980> known<00:00:20.250> as<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
beat west otherwise known as the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.099 
beat west otherwise known as the
butterfly<00:00:20.760> twist<00:00:20.939> can<00:00:21.359> be<00:00:21.449> broken<00:00:21.600> down<00:00:21.810> into

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
butterfly twist can be broken down into

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.349 
butterfly twist can be broken down into
four<00:00:22.230> stages<00:00:22.619> for<00:00:23.279> momentum<00:00:23.789> sets<00:00:24.090> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
four stages for momentum sets the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.310 
four stages for momentum sets the
butterfly<00:00:24.779> kick<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.439> twist<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.220> land

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
butterfly kick the twist and the land

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.870 
butterfly kick the twist and the land
bringing<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.560> down<00:00:28.710> even<00:00:28.949> further<00:00:29.099> here's<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
bringing it down even further here's the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.690 
bringing it down even further here's the
windup<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.900> cement<00:00:31.380> consensus<00:00:32.070> dip<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.149> lip

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.000 

okay<00:00:36.700> so<00:00:36.760> let's<00:00:37.060> start<00:00:37.210> at<00:00:37.330> the<00:00:37.420> beginning<00:00:37.510> of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
okay so let's start at the beginning of

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.310 
okay so let's start at the beginning of
entries<00:00:39.010> that

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
entries that

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.560 
entries that
the<00:00:40.650> momentum<00:00:41.130> stats<00:00:41.370> are<00:00:41.490> fairly<00:00:41.700> easy<00:00:41.970> all

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
the momentum stats are fairly easy all

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.960 
the momentum stats are fairly easy all
you<00:00:42.630> gotta<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.470> get<00:00:44.220> the<00:00:44.370> real<00:00:44.490> acknowledge

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
you gotta do is get the real acknowledge

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.600 
you gotta do is get the real acknowledge
there<00:00:45.720> are<00:00:45.840> two<00:00:46.020> important<00:00:46.530> steps<00:00:46.740> the<00:00:47.400> first

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
there are two important steps the first

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.670 
there are two important steps the first
step<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.120> then<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.420> hood<00:00:48.570> step<00:00:48.870> every<00:00:49.440> step

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
step and then the hood step every step

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.630 
step and then the hood step every step
that<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.890> take<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.190> want<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.460> reach<00:00:50.610> with

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
that you take you want to reach with

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.820 
that you take you want to reach with
your<00:00:50.820> foot<00:00:51.180> cover<00:00:51.870> more<00:00:52.050> ground<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.560> to<00:00:52.680> gain

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
your foot cover more ground and to gain

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.229 
your foot cover more ground and to gain
momentum<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:54.270> try<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.780> bounce<00:00:54.870> around

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
momentum and try not to bounce around

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.819 
momentum and try not to bounce around
the<00:00:57.239> next<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.750> probably<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> most<00:00:58.289> important

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the next and probably the most important

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.220 
the next and probably the most important
step<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.039> take<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> butterfly<00:01:00.019> when<00:01:01.019> you<00:01:01.109> do

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
step you take the butterfly when you do

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.509 
step you take the butterfly when you do
the<00:01:01.350> butterfly<00:01:01.620> kick<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.070> want<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.339> dip

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
the butterfly kick you want to dip

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.520 
the butterfly kick you want to dip
really<00:01:02.969> low<00:01:03.149> when<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.659> do<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> dip<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.379> want

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
really low when you do the dip you want

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.840 
really low when you do the dip you want
to<00:01:04.619> bend<00:01:04.830> your<00:01:04.860> knees<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.309> spring<00:01:05.610> back<00:01:05.790> up

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
to bend your knees and spring back up

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.060 
to bend your knees and spring back up
into<00:01:06.180> here<00:01:06.479> as<00:01:06.630> high<00:01:06.840> as<00:01:06.899> you<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.229> using<00:01:07.979> your

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
into here as high as you can using your

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.859 
into here as high as you can using your
arms<00:01:08.399> and<00:01:08.549> your<00:01:08.670> upper<00:01:08.880> body<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.360> swing<00:01:09.750> your

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
arms and your upper body to swing your

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.840 
arms and your upper body to swing your
body<00:01:10.020> up<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.320> get<00:01:10.619> very<00:01:10.770> much<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.189> possible

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
body up and get very much of it possible

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.940 
body up and get very much of it possible
then<00:01:12.539> you<00:01:12.570> want<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> kick<00:01:13.049> your<00:01:13.170> back<00:01:13.409> leg<00:01:13.740> up

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
then you want to kick your back leg up

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.100 
then you want to kick your back leg up
towards<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.580> sky<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:14.880> part<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.450> happen<00:01:15.899> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
towards the sky as part is to happen and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.529 
towards the sky as part is to happen and
spring<00:01:16.500> off<00:01:16.740> your<00:01:16.950> jumping<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:18.090> key<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
spring off your jumping the key to the

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.480 
spring off your jumping the key to the
beach<00:01:18.750> was<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.350> get<00:01:19.530> as<00:01:19.680> much<00:01:19.920> height<00:01:20.310> as

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
beach was to get as much height as

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.700 
beach was to get as much height as
possible<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.390> higher<00:01:21.539> you<00:01:21.690> get<00:01:21.869> easier<00:01:22.530> this

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
possible the higher you get easier this

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.710 
possible the higher you get easier this
tool<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.940> why<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.149> need<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.450> throw

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
tool and that's why you need to throw

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.230 
tool and that's why you need to throw
every<00:01:25.200> part<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> body<00:01:26.009> up<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> sky<00:01:26.909> to

every part of the body up for the sky to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.580 
every part of the body up for the sky to
launch<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.899> high<00:01:28.200> spot<00:01:29.929> to<00:01:30.929> initiate<00:01:31.319> you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
launch you a high spot to initiate you
