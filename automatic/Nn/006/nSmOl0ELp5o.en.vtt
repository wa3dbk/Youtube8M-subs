soon this one I think you just give it a

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.530 
soon this one I think you just give it a
little<00:02:33.780> twist<00:02:34.110> like<00:02:34.379> this<00:02:34.440> it's<00:02:35.370> good<00:02:35.610> but<00:02:36.329> the

little twist like this it's good but the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.190 
little twist like this it's good but the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
gentlest of squeezes and it starts to

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.440 
gentlest of squeezes and it starts to
open<00:02:40.349> out<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.400> we<00:02:41.489> can<00:02:41.670> do<00:02:41.849> that<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.150> to
