fellows<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.170> cuatro<00:02:42.560> Polly<00:02:42.860> Jaques<00:02:43.190> and

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
fellows and the cuatro Polly Jaques and

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.970 
fellows and the cuatro Polly Jaques and
I've<00:02:44.330> loaned<00:02:44.660> them<00:02:44.930> my<00:02:45.110> boat<00:02:45.349> because<00:02:45.709> it<00:02:45.830> was

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
I've loaned them my boat because it was

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.130 
I've loaned them my boat because it was
easier<00:02:46.400> for<00:02:46.459> them<00:02:46.819> to<00:02:46.880> manage<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.540> get<00:02:47.690> in<00:02:47.870> in

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
easier for them to manage to get in in

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.550 
easier for them to manage to get in in
and<00:02:48.769> out<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:50.269> it's<00:02:50.450> an<00:02:50.569> ideal<00:02:50.959> boat<00:02:51.290> it's

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.650 
and out and so it's an ideal boat it's
very<00:02:51.890> versatile<00:02:52.519> like<00:02:52.910> I<00:02:52.940> said<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.239> don't<00:02:53.299> want

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
very versatile like I said I don't want

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.360 
very versatile like I said I don't want
to<00:02:53.750> say<00:02:53.870> it's<00:02:54.019> just<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.380> woman's<00:02:54.769> boat<00:02:55.010> but<00:02:55.250> it

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
to say it's just a woman's boat but it

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.670 
to say it's just a woman's boat but it
makes<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.819> more<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.060> an<00:02:56.330> ideal<00:02:56.810> boat<00:02:57.230> for<00:02:57.650> a

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.250 
makes it more of an ideal boat for a
woman<00:02:58.099> because<00:02:58.549> of<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:59.150> weight<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.630> the<00:03:00.110> fact

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
woman because of the weight and the fact

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.680 
woman because of the weight and the fact
that<00:03:00.410> we<00:03:00.739> really<00:03:01.010> don't<00:03:01.610> need<00:03:01.940> any<00:03:02.329> help
