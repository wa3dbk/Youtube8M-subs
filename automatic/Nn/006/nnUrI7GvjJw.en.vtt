00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.410 
so I'm really excited that there's
already<00:00:34.980> something<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:35.969> do<00:00:36.090> with<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
already something you can do with the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.270 
already something you can do with the
maps<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.520> so<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.540> very<00:00:40.280> amazing

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
maps and so this one is very amazing

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.360 
maps and so this one is very amazing
look<00:00:41.700> at<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:42.590> you<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.770> basically<00:00:43.980> glitch

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
look at this you can basically glitch

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.970 
look at this you can basically glitch
out<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.700> map<00:00:44.879> pitfall<00:00:45.360> using<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.350> teleporter

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
out of map pitfall using a teleporter

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.150 
out of map pitfall using a teleporter
and<00:00:47.480> get<00:00:48.480> access<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> whole<00:00:49.350> open<00:00:49.739> land<00:00:49.920> of

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
and get access to a whole open land of

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.600 
and get access to a whole open land of
space<00:00:50.960> so<00:00:51.960> all<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.140> got<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.800> go<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> your

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
space so all you got to do is go to your

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.500 
space so all you got to do is go to your
gadgets<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> teleporter<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> node<00:00:57.120> is

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
gadgets in a teleporter and to a node is

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.410 
gadgets in a teleporter and to a node is
probably<00:00:57.960> recommended<00:00:58.590> if<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.609> go<00:00:59.820> up<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.030> it

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
probably recommended if you go up to it

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.590 
probably recommended if you go up to it
I<00:01:00.719> notice<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.379> can't<00:01:01.890> really<00:01:02.160> go<00:01:02.940> through<00:01:03.329> it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
I notice you can't really go through it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.100 
I notice you can't really go through it
but<00:01:03.780> even<00:01:04.260> phased<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.479> mean<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.990> just

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
but even phased on so I mean you just

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.420 
but even phased on so I mean you just
got<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> little<00:01:07.710> trick<00:01:08.040> where<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.250> go

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
got to do the little trick where you go

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.950 
got to do the little trick where you go
up<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.850> then<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.060> spawns<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.540> right<00:01:09.659> out<00:01:09.810> in

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
up to and then it spawns it right out in

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.510 
up to and then it spawns it right out in
front<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.470> then<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:11.220> makes<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
front of you and then it makes it a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.390 
front of you and then it makes it a
little<00:01:11.580> bit<00:01:11.760> easier<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.890> then<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.220> pull

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
little bit easier so then you can pull

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.460 
little bit easier so then you can pull
out<00:01:14.580> your<00:01:14.909> two-way<00:01:15.180> known<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.720> duplicated<00:01:16.350> or

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
out your two-way known and duplicated or

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.560 
out your two-way known and duplicated or
whatever<00:01:16.770> pulling<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.729> your<00:01:17.880> side<00:01:18.150> go<00:01:18.360> through

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
whatever pulling on your side go through

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.080 
whatever pulling on your side go through
it<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.750> then<00:01:18.900> there<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.470> go<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.670> aware<00:01:20.729> if

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
it and then there you go now be aware if

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.320 
it and then there you go now be aware if
you<00:01:21.180> go<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.360> left<00:01:21.780> too<00:01:22.500> high<00:01:22.770> too<00:01:23.700> far<00:01:23.909> out<00:01:24.060> or

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
you go to left too high too far out or

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.280 
you go to left too high too far out or
to<00:01:24.479> write<00:01:24.979> too<00:01:25.979> far<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.580> right<00:01:26.750> or<00:01:27.750> are

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
to write too far to the right or are

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.740 
to write too far to the right or are
those<00:01:28.590> different<00:01:29.040> directions<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.670> there<00:01:30.570> are

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
those different directions and there are

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.690 
those different directions and there are
like<00:01:30.990> kill<00:01:31.259> boundary<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.740> stuff<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.460> just

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
like kill boundary and stuff so you just

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.510 
like kill boundary and stuff so you just
got<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:33.000> aware<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.520> everything

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
got to be aware of that and everything

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.910 
got to be aware of that and everything
is<00:01:35.670> pretty<00:01:36.329> awesome<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.259> sand<00:01:37.619> everywhere

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
is pretty awesome the sand everywhere

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.569 
is pretty awesome the sand everywhere
there's<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:38.720> destroyed<00:01:39.720> pelicans<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.950> it

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
there's like destroyed pelicans and it

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.639 
there's like destroyed pelicans and it
just<00:01:41.759> looks<00:01:41.970> very<00:01:43.460> extravagant<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.259> so<00:01:46.259> right

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
just looks very extravagant and so right

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.789 
just looks very extravagant and so right
now<00:01:46.680> I'm<00:01:46.920> spawning<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.610> guess<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.320> metal<00:01:49.320> palette

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
now I'm spawning I guess a metal palette

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.060 
now I'm spawning I guess a metal palette
and<00:01:50.299> as<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:51.990> see<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.350> drop<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.860> on

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
and as you can see if you drop it on

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.710 
and as you can see if you drop it on
normal<00:01:53.340> physics<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.240> goes<00:01:54.420> right

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
normal physics it just goes right

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.870 
normal physics it just goes right
through<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.079> floor<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.520> one

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
through the floor so that is one

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.440 
through the floor so that is one
downfall<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.049> has<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.119> floor<00:02:00.119> is

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
downfall that this has is the floor is

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.709 
downfall that this has is the floor is
obviously<00:02:01.430> not<00:02:02.430> really<00:02:02.820> suitable<00:02:03.149> for<00:02:03.509> this

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
obviously not really suitable for this

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.240 
obviously not really suitable for this
so<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.200> don't<00:02:04.619> know<00:02:04.710> what<00:02:04.890> happened<00:02:05.340> there<00:02:05.520> like

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
so I don't know what happened there like

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.669 
so I don't know what happened there like
I<00:02:06.340> hopped<00:02:07.210> on<00:02:07.360> pallet<00:02:07.750> and<00:02:07.840> then<00:02:07.930> I<00:02:08.020> died<00:02:08.259> so

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
I hopped on pallet and then I died so

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.590 
I hopped on pallet and then I died so
leave<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.340> comment<00:02:09.550> if<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:09.880> know<00:02:10.060> why<00:02:10.240> I<00:02:10.270> died

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600

leave a comment if you know why I died
there<00:02:10.899> maybe<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:11.680> hit<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.980> kill<00:02:12.220> boundary<00:02:12.610> but<00:02:12.790> I

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
there maybe I hit a kill boundary but I

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.120 
there maybe I hit a kill boundary but I
think<00:02:13.270> they'd<00:02:13.420> be<00:02:13.570> that<00:02:13.750> low<00:02:14.020> plus<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.040> was

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
think they'd be that low plus I was

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.950 
think they'd be that low plus I was
higher<00:02:15.370> than<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:15.640> when<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:15.880> dropped<00:02:16.330> out<00:02:16.570> so

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
higher than that when I dropped out so

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.710 
higher than that when I dropped out so
not<00:02:17.530> really<00:02:17.680> sure<00:02:17.950> but<00:02:18.190> yeah<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.630> only

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
not really sure but yeah the only

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.410 
not really sure but yeah the only
downfall<00:02:20.020> is<00:02:20.230> falling<00:02:20.980> before<00:02:21.270> some<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.330> the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
downfall is falling before some of the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.520 
downfall is falling before some of the
co<00:02:22.540> boundaries<00:02:22.990> but<00:02:23.170> other<00:02:23.350> than<00:02:23.470> that

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
co boundaries but other than that

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.410 
co boundaries but other than that
there's<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.860> lot<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.040> space<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.790> create<00:02:25.270> your

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
there's a lot of space and create your

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.610 
there's a lot of space and create your
own<00:02:25.480> floor<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.140> stuff<00:02:26.290> like<00:02:26.380> that<00:02:26.440> and

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
own floor and stuff like that and

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.530 
own floor and stuff like that and
hopefully<00:02:27.160> some<00:02:27.550> matters<00:02:27.730> can<00:02:28.030> come<00:02:28.209> out<00:02:28.240> with

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
hopefully some matters can come out with

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.730 
hopefully some matters can come out with
some<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:29.080> guess<00:02:29.980> multiple<00:02:30.870> objects<00:02:31.870> maps<00:02:32.320> sort

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
some I guess multiple objects maps sort

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.550 
some I guess multiple objects maps sort
of<00:02:32.800> like<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.520> 256<00:02:34.300> pieces<00:02:34.810> ones<00:02:35.170> on<00:02:35.320> Ford
