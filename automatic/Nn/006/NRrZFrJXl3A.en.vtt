00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
just going to take a little bit of

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.790 
just going to take a little bit of
multi-purpose<00:02:40.280> liquid<00:02:40.700> glue<00:02:41.350> we<00:02:42.350> can<00:02:42.530> just

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
multi-purpose liquid glue we can just

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.060 
multi-purpose liquid glue we can just
set<00:02:43.550> those<00:02:43.730> right<00:02:44.090> on<00:02:44.270> top<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.570> our<00:02:44.900> bunny<00:02:45.680> ears

like this and then we need our face part
put<00:02:52.520> together<00:02:52.700> so<00:02:53.209> I<00:02:53.390> have<00:02:53.930> some<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.350> this

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
put together so I have some of this

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.410 
put together so I have some of this
assembled<00:02:55.190> already<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:55.880> I'm<00:02:55.970> just<00:02:56.120> going<00:02:56.330> to

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
assembled already so I'm just going to

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.630 
assembled already so I'm just going to
show<00:02:56.720> you<00:02:56.780> how<00:02:57.050> quickly<00:02:57.350> this<00:02:57.620> goes<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.550> of

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
show you how quickly this goes and of

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.430 
show you how quickly this goes and of
course<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:59.060> need<00:02:59.239> your<00:02:59.420> peppermint<00:02:59.810> pattie

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
course you need your peppermint pattie

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.100 
course you need your peppermint pattie
this<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.400> Pearson's<00:03:02.120> peppermint<00:03:02.660> pattie

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
this is a Pearson's peppermint pattie

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.800 
this is a Pearson's peppermint pattie
there<00:03:03.560> are<00:03:03.800> some<00:03:04.130> york<00:03:04.790> peppermint<00:03:05.090> patties

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
there are some york peppermint patties

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.440 
there are some york peppermint patties
that<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:06.770> when<00:03:07.100> i<00:03:07.130> purchased<00:03:07.520> i<00:03:07.880> discovered

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
that that when i purchased i discovered

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.300 
that that when i purchased i discovered
that<00:03:08.480> they<00:03:08.720> were<00:03:08.750> in<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:09.080> square<00:03:09.530> wrapper<00:03:09.890> so

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
that they were in a square wrapper so

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.280 
that they were in a square wrapper so
that<00:03:10.489> doesn't<00:03:10.880> really<00:03:11.090> work<00:03:11.570> as<00:03:11.810> well<00:03:12.020> for

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
that doesn't really work as well for

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.010 
that doesn't really work as well for
this<00:03:12.410> particular<00:03:12.920> project<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:14.030> try<00:03:14.570> to<00:03:14.630> find

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
this particular project so try to find

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.900 
this particular project so try to find
the<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.620> Pearson's<00:03:16.250> if<00:03:16.400> you'd<00:03:16.550> like<00:03:16.760> to

I'm just gonna set the peppermint pattie

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.539 
I'm just gonna set the peppermint pattie
right<00:03:32.570> in<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.989> middle<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.470> that<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:34.370> now<00:03:34.489> the

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
right in the middle of that and now the

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.150 
right in the middle of that and now the
base<00:03:34.910> of<00:03:35.239> our<00:03:35.390> little<00:03:35.989> treat<00:03:36.260> paper<00:03:36.590> is<00:03:36.830> done

base of our little treat paper is done
and<00:03:37.580> now<00:03:38.360> let's<00:03:38.630> go<00:03:38.810> ahead<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:39.260> build<00:03:39.440> the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
and now let's go ahead and build the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.680 
and now let's go ahead and build the
face<00:03:39.920> so<00:03:40.730> we've<00:03:41.000> got<00:03:41.299> our<00:03:42.280> our<00:03:43.280> other<00:03:44.030> circle

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
face so we've got our our other circle

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.020 
face so we've got our our other circle
that<00:03:44.810> goes<00:03:44.989> over<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.410> top<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:45.980> then<00:03:46.790> we're

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
that goes over the top and then we're

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.020 
that goes over the top and then we're
going<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.299> take<00:03:47.630> those<00:03:47.959> black<00:03:48.890> punch<00:03:49.340> outs<00:03:49.670> for

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
going to take those black punch outs for

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:58.130 
going to take those black punch outs for
the<00:03:50.120> eyes<00:03:50.860> just<00:03:51.860> set<00:03:52.160> them<00:03:52.370> in<00:03:52.610> like<00:03:53.600> so

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.920 

maybe<00:03:58.920> I'll<00:03:59.190> move<00:03:59.880> that<00:03:59.910> down<00:04:00.390> a<00:04:00.450> little<00:04:00.660> bit

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
maybe I'll move that down a little bit

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.640 
maybe I'll move that down a little bit
there<00:04:01.350> we<00:04:01.380> go<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:02.520> then<00:04:03.060> let's<00:04:03.300> get<00:04:03.570> our<00:04:03.840> our

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
there we go and then let's get our our

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.100 
there we go and then let's get our our
nose<00:04:05.280> on<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.600> we're<00:04:07.020> gonna<00:04:07.110> take<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.680> heart

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
nose on and we're gonna take the heart

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.360 
nose on and we're gonna take the heart
having<00:04:10.110> some<00:04:10.290> trouble<00:04:10.680> getting<00:04:10.920> that<00:04:11.010> on<00:04:11.190> my

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
having some trouble getting that on my

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.730 
having some trouble getting that on my
poker<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:12.360> we're<00:04:12.690> going<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.930> set<00:04:13.170> that<00:04:13.200> upside

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
poker and we're going to set that upside

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.650 
poker and we're going to set that upside
down<00:04:14.010> if<00:04:14.250> we<00:04:14.400> set<00:04:14.670> it<00:04:14.790> right<00:04:14.970> side<00:04:15.300> up<00:04:15.480> it's

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
down if we set it right side up it's

I should be waiting for this to dry a

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.500 
I should be waiting for this to dry a
little<00:05:43.320> bit<00:05:43.440> since<00:05:43.890> I<00:05:44.040> was<00:05:44.790> so<00:05:45.090> liberal<00:05:45.360> with

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
little bit since I was so liberal with

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.219 
little bit since I was so liberal with
the<00:05:45.690> glue<00:05:46.760> but<00:05:47.760> we<00:05:47.940> are<00:05:48.150> not<00:05:48.390> going<00:05:48.630> to<00:05:48.870> wait<00:05:49.020> we

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.820 
the glue but we are not going to wait we
are<00:05:49.350> just<00:05:49.560> gonna<00:05:49.850> jump<00:05:50.850> right<00:05:50.940> in<00:05:51.830> now

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
are just gonna jump right in now

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.719 
are just gonna jump right in now
normally<00:05:53.430> I<00:05:53.460> would<00:05:53.580> um<00:05:54.140> put<00:05:55.140> the<00:05:55.460> the<00:05:56.460> glue

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
normally I would um put the the glue

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.090 
normally I would um put the the glue
dots<00:05:56.940> right<00:05:57.360> here<00:05:57.419> well<00:05:58.320> I<00:05:58.350> think<00:05:58.530> I<00:05:58.800> still<00:05:59.070> can

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
dots right here well I think I still can

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.290 
dots right here well I think I still can
so<00:06:00.000> I'm<00:06:00.060> gonna<00:06:00.150> put<00:06:00.390> one<00:06:00.630> here<00:06:01.320> I<00:06:02.000> was<00:06:03.000> a<00:06:03.060> little

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
so I'm gonna put one here I was a little

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.120 
so I'm gonna put one here I was a little
worried<00:06:03.570> about<00:06:03.630> the<00:06:03.930> glue<00:06:04.140> being<00:06:04.410> too<00:06:04.650> wet<00:06:04.890> but

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
worried about the glue being too wet but

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.469 
worried about the glue being too wet but
I<00:06:05.160> guess<00:06:05.370> that<00:06:05.550> doesn't<00:06:05.790> matter

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
I guess that doesn't matter

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.839 
I guess that doesn't matter
and<00:06:07.410> it's<00:06:07.590> probably<00:06:07.860> about<00:06:08.190> ready

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849 
and it's probably about ready

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.760 
and it's probably about ready
here<00:06:10.149> we<00:06:10.270> go<00:06:10.629> all<00:06:10.929> right<00:06:11.169> so<00:06:11.349> I've<00:06:11.439> got<00:06:11.469> the

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
here we go all right so I've got the

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.829 
here we go all right so I've got the
three<00:06:12.009> glue<00:06:12.249> dots<00:06:12.490> now<00:06:12.759> on<00:06:13.029> the<00:06:13.179> back<00:06:13.360> of<00:06:13.599> this

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:13.839 
three glue dots now on the back of this

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:17.010 
three glue dots now on the back of this
side<00:06:14.139> and<00:06:14.439> then<00:06:15.009> we<00:06:15.129> just<00:06:15.389> layer<00:06:16.389> that<00:06:16.689> right

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
side and then we just layer that right

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.129 
side and then we just layer that right
over<00:06:17.379> the<00:06:17.529> top<00:06:17.770> of<00:06:18.249> our<00:06:19.209> peppermint<00:06:19.809> pattie
