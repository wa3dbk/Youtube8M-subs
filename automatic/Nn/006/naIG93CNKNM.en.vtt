 Durov 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:50.140
 Well, we went to build a plane for me and 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.250
 here we are the settings of these parts we 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.950
 let's build the real plane and who 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.950
 don't believe see this highway 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:19.180
 wheels and base and now look you 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:24.010
 already built the wings of the plane in the plane 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:32.950
 they are the most important two wings left and 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:38.859
 right yes yes yes now check everything 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:41.159

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.159
 fine 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.230
 and now we built the tail of the aircraft he 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:57.299
 we also really need a plane and without 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:03:05.379
 tail so there everything is well done 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:08.310

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:11.799
