well their war is an awesome game the
only<00:03:25.329> things<00:03:25.569> that<00:03:25.750> break<00:03:25.930> break<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.709> or<00:03:26.889> in<00:03:27.459> my

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
only things that break break it or in my

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.199 
only things that break break it or in my
opinion<00:03:28.359> is<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:29.859> mp40<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.639> the<00:03:30.909> knifing

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
opinion is the mp40 and the knifing

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.819 
opinion is the mp40 and the knifing
system<00:03:31.629> and<00:03:31.840> maybe<00:03:32.349> sometimes<00:03:32.739> the

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
system and maybe sometimes the

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.470 
system and maybe sometimes the
connection<00:03:33.280> but<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:33.790> know<00:03:33.940> what<00:03:34.090> other<00:03:34.299> than

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
connection but you know what other than

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.750 
connection but you know what other than
that<00:03:34.540> if<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.530> mp40<00:03:35.949> was<00:03:36.129> a<00:03:36.159> little<00:03:36.489> bit<00:03:36.609> more

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
that if the mp40 was a little bit more

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.149 
that if the mp40 was a little bit more
balance<00:03:37.000> this<00:03:37.870> game<00:03:38.139> would<00:03:38.290> be<00:03:38.349> more<00:03:38.799> balanced

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
balance this game would be more balanced

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.509 
balance this game would be more balanced
than<00:03:39.220> cold<00:03:39.669> early<00:03:39.940> for<00:03:40.120> in<00:03:40.299> my<00:03:40.599> opinion<00:03:41.519> the

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
than cold early for in my opinion the

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.809 
than cold early for in my opinion the
guns<00:03:42.760> are<00:03:42.940> very<00:03:43.470> solid<00:03:44.470> it's<00:03:45.280> nothing<00:03:45.489> like

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
guns are very solid it's nothing like

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.000 
guns are very solid it's nothing like
it's<00:03:45.849> not<00:03:46.479> like<00:03:46.540> something<00:03:46.959> so<00:03:47.379> overpowered

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
it's not like something so overpowered

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.149 
it's not like something so overpowered
or<00:03:48.129> not<00:03:48.780> aside<00:03:49.780> from<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.079> mp40<00:03:50.560> if<00:03:50.829> you<00:03:50.949> take

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
or not aside from the mp40 if you take

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.330 
or not aside from the mp40 if you take
that<00:03:51.310> gun<00:03:51.459> out<00:03:51.489> I<00:03:51.639> think<00:03:51.819> this<00:03:52.090> is<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:53.340> more

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
that gun out I think this is a more

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.899 
that gun out I think this is a more
balanced<00:03:54.669> game<00:03:54.849> than<00:03:55.120> call<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:55.780> duty<00:03:56.019> 4<00:03:56.579> but<00:03:57.579> i

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
balanced game than call of duty 4 but i

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.860 
balanced game than call of duty 4 but i
will<00:03:58.359> just<00:03:58.840> just<00:03:59.199> go<00:03:59.590> enough<00:03:59.799> topic<00:04:00.099> for<00:04:00.280> a<00:04:00.310> sec

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
will just just go enough topic for a sec
