00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hi to all friends welcome to this 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.629
 new video today as you can see here 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.679
 in front of me is the new gadget i 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.019
 mouse of doubleduck controls 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.610
 even before starting with the video vi 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.470
 I immediately say course here is obviously not 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.390
 a lesser player I don't know as a 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.789
 toy but in fact is to collect 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.949
 so not even in the comments I declare to 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.359
 cody the long egypt then not just for 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.980
 himself or when he can still give us read 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.090
 the mouse the wong because it is not there 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.619
 nothing bad in the end little mouse 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.399
 passionate about a lot of great people 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.780
 adults is nothing said this premise 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.670
 we start immediately with the video we start 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.210
 immediately with the initials from the calls of the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.210
 evening by 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.030
 then guys that's the point 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.280
 hardback that we find ourselves when 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.649
 we will buy you as ridiculously cooked 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.479
 see here we dedicated a set up 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.110
 middle of the protective plastic 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:21.000
 here doubleduck obviously the number here 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.250
 that the 3.051 the price is 240 as 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.070
 you can see decorating the comic 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.439
 single but the price with the gadget in 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.780
 annex and 7 euros 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.009
 then here we have a little mouse for 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.640
 example i say three double double 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.920
 double up that getting ridiculous here 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.200
 we have another image the stereo ed 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.610
 abandoned in the back in the adventure yes 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.360
 unleash food and against 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.369
 doubleduck then here tells us he knows 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.549
 where to put them throw charge radar seeks 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.840
 enemies hatch secret problems 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.270
 impossible to shoot extractable missiles and 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.929
 here we have a complete knife mushroom 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.110
 with its beautiful gross of a city 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.789
 this one was born during what 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.729
 we will find the opening this will be here 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.259
 that is the number 3000 the topolino 51 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.840
 with the dedicated uncle cover 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:18.300
 scrooge as a substantial roberto 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.190
 let's see the stories that are fast 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.819
 contained in this issue from the summary 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.069
 which should be more or less here 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:29.010
 however we have in the last the last of the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.290
 grammy clarabella act in the shot 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.140
 decisive gosling and the irrepressible 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.080
 laughter pippo's floor the band of 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.680
 pipolo scopio let's go either way or the other 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.110
 by mistake of this, however, I departed and then 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.790
 after coups here obviously in these 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.580
 magistrates are the numbers after he left them 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.260
 Speaking a lot about soccer, this one says 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.769
 still something that bothers me not enough 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.900
 zerg for those who one day apostle of coach 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.330
 then report the comic inside 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.050
 to find 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:04.240
 it's ridiculous that this one knows want 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.040
 it's already beautiful out of its plastic from the 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.830
 his productive classic in goal of 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.840
 coproduce an instruction sheet but 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.690
 since already a given I don't believe that there 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.120
 they say yes a basin to position 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:21.090
 doubleduck in the seat and attach it 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:24.520
 the rope is there when boarding 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.200
 rudy special coter then here for 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.660
 start the mechanism that will do afterwards 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.740
 move the diptych trunk dramas of the 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.410
 breeching that will make wings 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.300
 let's analyze more closely for 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.880
 The first thing we can determine 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.650
 doubleduck and is in his cabin in the 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.570
 cabin the command can be opened e 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.140
 we can easily extract 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.760
 doubleduck characters of course 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.360
 personal doubleduck this here a lot 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.110
 small is not a very good fact because 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.880
 precisely expressed with the gadget with the 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.050
 gadgets that come complete all in one 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.840
 week are the materials are are 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.420
 much much cheaper I consider here 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.600
 we mark the agreement that altered 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.660
 the star boldak in the relationship of money 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.430
 in the dicatero game we will have this 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.470
 small trapdoor that will serve to make 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:22.000
 get out to get doubleduck out but 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.040
 since as you well know everyone will know 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.990
 these things make water from all 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.270
 leave in a forest to show it to you here 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.919
 look at the door you already have 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:35.080
 I struggle to open my mind should 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:40.900
 open by itself but as you know it is so 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:44.800
 here is look at what a mess my mom 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.320
 casino ok, going on obviously 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:52.150
 after this thing I can't see it here 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.680
 on what put things okay everyone from everyone 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.800
 the thing with water on all sides does not 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.570
 just the hatch we need that will do 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.270
 get out quickly in boldak 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.180
 another thing that will make water was la 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.310
 recharging that personally one day 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.070
 I quote making more or less what he says 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.139
 so they raise the head in resources 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.509
 they go in to pull back after leaving 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.520
 to stay 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:17.970
 and it is for goal odds where to start but a 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.639
 apparently does nothing like that 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.850
 I will read quietly if possible 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.620
 we will need another one 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:30.350
 so I don't know I haven't read enough 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.580
 well in front we also have the minister 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:42.990
 a few quarters are shot like that 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:45.180
 let's watch them wow then in the other 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.930
 we will find the Louvre 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.430
 dorona para a parabola here it is 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.199
 spent that can not be moved is not 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.820
 not even done very well here we have 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.500
 precisely she who works through the 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.139
 mechanism that can be pulled up 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.009
 Jupiter 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:06.409
 here we have another helix and a view 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:08.760
 a lot goes down it is very very fragile 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:11.190
 the view is very very beautiful the 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.280
 really nice quadcopter guys 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:17.400
 obviously it is on the newsstands starting 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.770
 since yesterday on this video I am 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.860

 nothing I dedicate very very nice at 7 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.740
 EUR 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.930
 if the parts should be taken away 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.370
 obviously in the comic little thing that 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.770
 I would like to say since the squirrel already 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.139
 cin fast there are no answer 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.750

 I tell you guys it's not a deal

 all collected the musical both of 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.020
 budget you have to take it but since it is 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.909
 really something fragile and doing it 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.039
 you will take in hand you will have to do 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:18.259
 be careful if you break it into a thousand 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:20.460
 pieces and after, ok, repeat after you can 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:24.590
