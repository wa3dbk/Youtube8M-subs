facts<00:04:03.019> which<00:04:03.769> are<00:04:04.570> 150<00:04:05.570> fifa<00:04:05.840> points<00:04:06.019> set<00:04:06.380> of

facts which are 150 fifa points set of
the<00:04:06.530> hundred<00:04:06.860> i<00:04:07.040> think<00:04:07.459> those<00:04:07.610> are<00:04:07.640> probably

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
the hundred i think those are probably

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.430 
the hundred i think those are probably
better<00:04:08.090> deal<00:04:08.360> if<00:04:08.570> they're<00:04:08.810> not<00:04:08.930> let<00:04:09.230> me<00:04:09.290> know

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
better deal if they're not let me know

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.160 
better deal if they're not let me know
but<00:04:10.180> in<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:11.330> big<00:04:11.480> thing<00:04:11.660> with<00:04:11.780> foot<00:04:11.989> is<00:04:12.140> you

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.240 
but in a big thing with foot is you
can't<00:04:12.260> do<00:04:12.560> duplicates<00:04:13.040> so<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:14.420> took<00:04:14.630> me<00:04:14.840> maybe

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
can't do duplicates so it took me maybe

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.800 
can't do duplicates so it took me maybe
30<00:04:16.250> minutes<00:04:16.519> to<00:04:16.790> learn<00:04:16.910> these<00:04:17.090> menus<00:04:17.479> so<00:04:17.690> when

have so if you want to use something
that<00:05:06.660> only<00:05:06.930> use<00:05:07.169> one<00:05:07.440> striker<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:07.979> then<00:05:08.070> use

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
that only use one striker and then use

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.700 
that only use one striker and then use
this<00:05:08.370> like<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:08.550> left-wing<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:09.150> right-wing<00:05:09.710> go

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
this like a left-wing and right-wing go

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.050 
this like a left-wing and right-wing go
with<00:05:10.860> that<00:05:10.979> setup<00:05:11.310> if<00:05:11.580> you<00:05:11.699> have<00:05:11.850> good
