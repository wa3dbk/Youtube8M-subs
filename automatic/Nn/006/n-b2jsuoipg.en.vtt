00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
front hub motor here you can see this is

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.929 
front hub motor here you can see this is
the<00:00:26.610> power<00:00:26.820> cable<00:00:27.360> coming<00:00:27.869> out<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:29.640> ebike

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
the power cable coming out and the ebike

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.080 
the power cable coming out and the ebike
kit<00:00:30.210> comes<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:31.200> number<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.890> different

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
kit comes with a number of different

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.110 
kit comes with a number of different
easy<00:00:33.090> connect<00:00:34.020> or<00:00:34.199> disconnect<00:00:34.879> cables<00:00:35.879> there

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
easy connect or disconnect cables there

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.330 
easy connect or disconnect cables there
and<00:00:36.330> so<00:00:37.080> it<00:00:37.199> makes<00:00:37.350> setting<00:00:37.680> up<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.949> system

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
and so it makes setting up the system

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.759 
and so it makes setting up the system
pretty<00:00:38.519> easy<00:00:38.900> on<00:00:39.900> the<00:00:40.110> other<00:00:40.230> side<00:00:40.470> here

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
pretty easy on the other side here

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.460 
pretty easy on the other side here
you've<00:00:41.040> got<00:00:41.220> the<00:00:41.430> torque<00:00:42.090> arm<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.930> just

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
you've got the torque arm and this just

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.310 
you've got the torque arm and this just
basically<00:00:43.769> resists<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.910> motors<00:00:45.300> force<00:00:45.629> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
basically resists the motors force and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.189 
basically resists the motors force and
ties<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.559> into<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.070> fork<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:47.610> these<00:00:48.570> are<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
ties it into the fork here these are the

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.160 
ties it into the fork here these are the
bolt<00:00:50.159> mounts<00:00:50.610> if<00:00:51.089> you<00:00:51.239> wanted<00:00:51.479> to<00:00:51.600> use<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> disc

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
bolt mounts if you wanted to use a disc

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.680 
bolt mounts if you wanted to use a disc
brake<00:00:52.470> that<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.129> would<00:00:53.250> attach<00:00:53.519> the<00:00:53.790> rotor<00:00:54.059> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
brake that you would attach the rotor to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.680 
brake that you would attach the rotor to
the<00:00:54.839> motor<00:00:55.080> with<00:00:55.860> those<00:00:56.210> bolts<00:00:57.210> right<00:00:57.390> there

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the motor with those bolts right there

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.259 
the motor with those bolts right there
and<00:00:57.900> then<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> front<00:00:59.610> end<00:00:59.760> here

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
and then on the front end here

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.049 
and then on the front end here
speaking<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.080> brakes<00:01:01.320> we've<00:01:01.769> got<00:01:01.979> the<00:01:02.190> brake

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
speaking of brakes we've got the brake

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.549 
speaking of brakes we've got the brake
levers<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.420> come<00:01:03.720> with<00:01:03.869> a<00:01:03.900> kit<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.409> they

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
levers that come with a kit and they

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.680 
levers that come with a kit and they
have<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> switch<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.909> when<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.119> engage<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
have a switch that when you engage the

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.200 
have a switch that when you engage the
brake<00:01:06.869> lever<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.740> will<00:01:07.890> send<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.220> signal<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
brake lever it will send a signal to the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.990 
brake lever it will send a signal to the
controller<00:01:09.690> to<00:01:10.110> basically<00:01:10.830> cut<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.070> power<00:01:11.400> so

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
controller to basically cut the power so

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.780 
controller to basically cut the power so
it's<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.210> nice<00:01:12.330> safety<00:01:12.960> feature<00:01:13.140> there<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it's a nice safety feature there on the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.910 
it's a nice safety feature there on the
front<00:01:15.119> here<00:01:15.390> we've<00:01:15.630> got<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.020> throttle<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
front here we've got the throttle and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.830 
front here we've got the throttle and
this<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> thumb<00:01:17.520> throttle<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.689> just

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
this is the thumb throttle and you just

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.320 
this is the thumb throttle and you just
engage<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.380> by<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:19.980> turn<00:01:20.460> pushing<00:01:21.210> on

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
engage it by you know turn pushing on

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.690 
engage it by you know turn pushing on
the<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:22.260> thumb<00:01:22.470> throttle<00:01:22.740> there<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.520> also

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the on the thumb throttle there it also

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.790 
the on the thumb throttle there it also
comes<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.180> another<00:01:24.990> type<00:01:25.260> of<00:01:25.290> throttle

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
comes with another type of throttle

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.590 
comes with another type of throttle
which<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.070> your<00:01:26.370> probably<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> little<00:01:27.420> more

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
which is your probably a little more

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.830 
which is your probably a little more
traditional<00:01:27.800> twist<00:01:28.800> grip<00:01:29.040> style<00:01:29.550> and<00:01:29.850> that's

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
traditional twist grip style and that's

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.570 
traditional twist grip style and that's
right<00:01:31.230> here<00:01:31.620> and<00:01:31.830> then<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.010> comes<00:01:32.040> with<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
right here and then it comes with the

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.970 
right here and then it comes with the
grips<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.300> that<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.960> wanted<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.620> use<00:01:34.770> that

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
grips for that if you wanted to use that

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.790 
grips for that if you wanted to use that
style<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.610> throttle<00:01:36.480> and<00:01:37.230> then<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
style of a throttle and then here is the

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.060 
style of a throttle and then here is the
other<00:01:38.160> brake<00:01:38.940> lever<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.860> switch<00:01:40.860> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
other brake lever with the switch and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.130 
other brake lever with the switch and
you<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.280> see<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.760> this<00:01:42.210> has<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.450> pretty

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
you can see that this has a pretty

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.340 
you can see that this has a pretty
simple<00:01:44.070> connector<00:01:44.700> piece<00:01:44.940> right<00:01:45.180> there<00:01:45.350> to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
simple connector piece right there to

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.470 
simple connector piece right there to
tie<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.590> whole<00:01:46.830> thing<00:01:47.640> into<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.940> kit<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
tie the whole thing into the kit the

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.960 
tie the whole thing into the kit the
reason<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.900> that's<00:01:49.110> not<00:01:49.950> used<00:01:50.310> as<00:01:50.550> this<00:01:50.730> bike

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
reason that that's not used as this bike

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.810 
reason that that's not used as this bike
doesn't<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:51.659> front<00:01:52.380> brake<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.730> a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
doesn't have the front brake just just a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.360 
doesn't have the front brake just just a
rear<00:01:54.030> brake<00:01:54.150> on<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.600> particular<00:01:55.140> bike<00:01:55.370> so

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
rear brake on this particular bike so

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.360 
rear brake on this particular bike so
then<00:01:57.180> you've<00:01:57.300> got<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> cables<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.229> run<00:01:58.370> from

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
then you've got the cables that run from

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.890 
then you've got the cables that run from
the<00:01:59.460> throttle<00:01:59.700> from<00:02:00.120> the<00:02:00.210> brake<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.659> from<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
the throttle from the brake and from the

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.590 
the throttle from the brake and from the
motor<00:02:01.110> they<00:02:02.100> run<00:02:02.310> under<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.120> top<00:02:03.330> tube

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
motor they run under the the top tube

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.590 
motor they run under the the top tube
here<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.190> see<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.700> well<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.510> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
here and you can see that well it's a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.270 
here and you can see that well it's a
little<00:02:06.900> hard<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.710> know<00:02:08.069> these

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
little hard to see but you know these

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.940 
little hard to see but you know these
are<00:02:08.879> these<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.959> know<00:02:10.019> basically<00:02:10.379> click

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
are these you know basically click

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.399 
are these you know basically click
together<00:02:11.370> connections<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.110> makes<00:02:13.260> it

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
together connections so it makes it

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.199 
together connections so it makes it
pretty<00:02:13.530> easy<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:14.010> tie<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.519> whole<00:02:14.790> system

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
pretty easy to tie the whole system

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.449 
pretty easy to tie the whole system
together<00:02:15.390> then<00:02:16.260> all<00:02:16.409> that<00:02:16.590> runs<00:02:16.830> back<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.340> the

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
together then all that runs back to the

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.920 
together then all that runs back to the
controller<00:02:17.879> which<00:02:18.209> I've<00:02:18.390> actually<00:02:18.629> got

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
controller which I've actually got

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.979 
controller which I've actually got
housed<00:02:19.230> in<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.129> battery<00:02:20.459> bag<00:02:20.670> itself<00:02:21.239> you<00:02:21.840> can

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
housed in the battery bag itself you can

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.449 
housed in the battery bag itself you can
put<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> controller<00:02:22.650> almost<00:02:23.129> anywhere<00:02:23.370> you

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
put the controller almost anywhere you

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.420 
put the controller almost anywhere you
want<00:02:23.640> but<00:02:23.790> I've<00:02:23.940> put<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.450> battery<00:02:25.200> bag

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
want but I've put it in the battery bag

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.700 
want but I've put it in the battery bag
and<00:02:26.430> then<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:27.650> back

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
and then the back

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.920 
and then the back
is<00:02:28.920> attached<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.490> rear<00:02:29.670> rack<00:02:29.880> with<00:02:30.480> these
