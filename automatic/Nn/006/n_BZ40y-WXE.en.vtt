 the world «Der Spiegel» 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.469
 Computer games are a go let's go 8 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.359
 allow them and tear through time and space and visit jobs 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.739
 that either never existed or even are part of our own story 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.750
 For example, Tobies often understood it excellently in 2007, for example 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.899
 to put us into the time around 1190 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.359
 and by an unprecedented detail of the cities like Jerusalem 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.399
 to create an atmosphere 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.350
 Finance playful idling of Assassin's Creed elegantly concealed 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.670
 that there is much more in the concept 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.890
 As soon as that could be implemented in a game, every player was clear and soon 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.590
 so we are all the more looking forward to assassin's Creed 2 which 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.530
 expected to appear in November this year 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.900
 our editor let Christiansen attend the Tokyo Game Show the 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.950
 show current developer version 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.950
 and wants exciting details 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.829
 and this often remains the framework of the predecessor we faithfully support 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:04.280
 again 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.890
 this usually takes the role of an ancestor 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.590
 becomes possible that through the Anni computer of the man this time ins 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.840
 if those like me send the 15th century 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.520
 Hotels Euro the gates the ferry decided the craft of Assassins 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:17.459
 exerts 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.109
 but even for Ezio the direct route to the destination is never the right one 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.150
 instead, he must first perform his duties for a certain Antonio 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.159
 complete 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.159
 before approaching the main goal 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:36.389
 already at the beginning it is noticeable that the mission structure of the first part is missing 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.879
 instead, we set the goals the developers want 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.739
 avoid repetitive tasks of the predecessor and the mission 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.739
 make it more varied 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.909
 Here, too, we have to start with the help of a 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.019
 Viewpoint from a lofty height an overview of the city 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.269
 and synchronize our map 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.560
 And so that the descent is not too difficult we can go back with one 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:04.529
 daring leap into the soft today back to the bottom of the facts 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.610
 Thus, the beautifully designed city not only staffage the actual 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.840
 Mission remains in winding streets on dreamy 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.650
 to press 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.650
 and, of course, in the big squares of the city all sorts of information 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.979
 which are collected in a database 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:28.279
 This offers especially a lot of reading material and background to Schmöker friends 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:30.679
 Info 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:32.939
 but also worth a visit to the dealers 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.480
 because Ezio can by an appropriate disguise to enemy unrecognized 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.299
 Soldiers sneak past 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.449
 In addition, extras as well as prompt fashion healing items are coming as well 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.039
 the help with the escape 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:46.039
 Haig objects 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:50.029
 in contrast to its predecessor, the life energy does not regenerate by itself 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.029
 but need was active support 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:59.349
 the 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.800
 also the fight was upgraded by innovations 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.689
 so surprisingly hidden sound the opponent particularly with the Oracle attacks 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.889
 Similarly, the Assassin proves to be skilled at Anna Kemper when it comes to it 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:15.269
 to disarm his enemies but it is also different how it would be for example 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.579
 in order to 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.430
 we send a group of prostitutes to the guards and 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.229
 so unrecognized sneak past the now inattentive gentleman 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.800
 The help of the population should be some variation of the game 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.800
 to tickle out 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.250
 Ezio can climb as well as his relatives 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.210
 The city even becomes an ally, because we understand one thing 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.800
 The spring bounces off the water in the numerous channels of our lintel Abt 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.690
 because it fits perfectly the bed CIO swimming and diving can because 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.690
 Gondolas are a great hideaway 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.120
 These are a lot of arguments to the old Venice with its drawing worthiness 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.479
 Mouth to pay a visit to the world-famous carnival, we hope anyway 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.620
 that Ubisoft can keep the targeted release date, with the 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.620
 so hopefully delivered Christmas can come 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.190
 Year and I go 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.830
 because the war again with the StTV 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.449
 and if you want to know more about assassin's Creed 2 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.460
 that should immediately jump on the article by LaCie Christiansen 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.330
 As usual, you can reach it via the tv-coach embedded below 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
 go to the search box at Kate Moss 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.139
 and here's a tip for the end also iphone and iPod touch users allowed 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.750
 as an assassin sneaking through the ancient Jerusalem the first part has namely 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:55.059
 Even a totally usable implementation works best 

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:59.150
 Just try the demo for free and see you next week 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:02.149
