i've<00:00:32.009> got<00:00:32.219> my<00:00:32.340> iphone<00:00:32.520> 5<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.600> can<00:00:33.780> see<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
i've got my iphone 5 so you can see the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.970 
i've got my iphone 5 so you can see the
differences<00:00:34.440> here<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:35.700> size<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.450> hardware

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
differences here in size and hardware

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.930 
differences here in size and hardware
between<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> two<00:00:38.219> let's<00:00:38.520> take<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.700> look<00:00:38.850> at

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
between the two let's take a look at

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.170 
between the two let's take a look at
what's<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.210> box<00:00:39.770> so<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.129> open<00:00:42.059> up<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
what's in the box so you open up the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.660 
what's in the box so you open up the
iphone<00:00:42.570> 5s<00:00:42.989> looking<00:00:43.890> at<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> phone<00:00:44.370> there's

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
iphone 5s looking at the phone there's

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.510 
iphone 5s looking at the phone there's
not<00:00:44.879> much<00:00:45.680> differences<00:00:46.680> wise<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.129> terms<00:00:47.340> of

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
not much differences wise in terms of

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.580 
not much differences wise in terms of
hardware<00:00:48.030> other<00:00:48.539> than<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.870> few<00:00:48.960> things<00:00:49.260> let's

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
hardware other than a few things let's

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.400 
hardware other than a few things let's
point<00:00:49.770> those<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.160> you've<00:00:50.820> got<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.420> new<00:00:52.050> touch

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
point those out you've got the new touch

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.319 
point those out you've got the new touch
ID<00:00:52.649> sensor<00:00:52.770> which<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> fingerprint<00:00:53.969> sensor

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
ID sensor which is a fingerprint sensor

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.510 
ID sensor which is a fingerprint sensor
that<00:00:54.840> when<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.079> unlock<00:00:55.379> your<00:00:55.440> phone<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:56.280> knows

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
that when you unlock your phone it knows

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.950 
that when you unlock your phone it knows
that<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.329> only<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.809> unlock

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
that it's you and only you can unlock

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.389 
that it's you and only you can unlock
your<00:00:58.230> phone<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.770> different<00:00:59.219> than<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
your phone so that is different than the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.000 
your phone so that is different than the
iphone<00:00:59.699> 5<00:00:59.879> as<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.329> see<00:01:00.510> here<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.890> other

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
iphone 5 as you can see here the other

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.470 
iphone 5 as you can see here the other
hardware<00:01:02.399> difference<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.210> back

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
hardware difference is in the back

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.130 
hardware difference is in the back
you'll<00:01:04.140> notice<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.830> dual<00:01:05.820> flash<00:01:06.270> looks

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
you'll notice that the dual flash looks

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.440 
you'll notice that the dual flash looks
a<00:01:07.320> little<00:01:07.619> differently<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.820> dual<00:01:09.000> LED<00:01:09.240> flash

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
a little differently the dual LED flash

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.690 
a little differently the dual LED flash
looks<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.080> little<00:01:10.200> different<00:01:10.409> than<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.040> flash

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
looks a little different than the flash

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.060 
looks a little different than the flash
in<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> old<00:01:12.210> iphone<00:01:12.600> 5<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.830> is

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
in the old iphone 5 and so this is

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.679 
in the old iphone 5 and so this is
supposed<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.670> better<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.119> terms<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.450> what

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
supposed to be better in terms of what

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.260 
supposed to be better in terms of what
it<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.080> pick<00:01:16.320> up<00:01:16.530> both<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.520> low<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.090> bright

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
it can pick up both a low and bright

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.050 
it can pick up both a low and bright
light<00:01:18.710> this<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.890> actually<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> champagne<00:01:21.030> or

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
light this is actually the champagne or

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.440 
light this is actually the champagne or
the<00:01:21.360> gold<00:01:21.689> version<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.409> iphone<00:01:22.820> 5s<00:01:23.820> you

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
the gold version of the iphone 5s you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.760 
the gold version of the iphone 5s you
can<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:24.689> how<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.960> differs<00:01:25.320> between<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
can see how it differs between the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.280 
can see how it differs between the
iphone<00:01:26.040> 5<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.360> can't<00:01:27.570> get<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> iphone<00:01:27.960> 5

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
iphone 5 and you can't get the iphone 5

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.469 
iphone 5 and you can't get the iphone 5
anymore<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.610> know<00:01:29.640> so

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
anymore just so you know so

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.510 
anymore just so you know so
hardware-wise<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.920> there's<00:01:32.159> not<00:01:32.340> much

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
hardware-wise that's it there's not much

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.069 
hardware-wise that's it there's not much
of<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.729> difference<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.240> terms<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.540> size<00:01:33.750> i<00:01:33.780> mean

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
of a difference in terms of size i mean

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.310 
of a difference in terms of size i mean
looking<00:01:34.409> at<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.880> hardware<00:01:36.090> itself<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:37.170> not

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
looking at the hardware itself it's not

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.399 
looking at the hardware itself it's not
bigger<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.430> screen<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.759> not<00:01:38.790> bigger<00:01:39.030> at<00:01:39.240> all

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
bigger the screen is not bigger at all

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.370 
bigger the screen is not bigger at all
but<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.590> quality<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.520> terms<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.380> the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.120 
but the quality and in terms of the
screen<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.009> still<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> same<00:01:45.710> that's<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.950> in

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
screen is still the same that's it in

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.499 
screen is still the same that's it in
terms<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.490> differences<00:01:47.909> between<00:01:47.939> the
