00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.980 
review on this core life aqua light
power<00:00:05.009> center<00:00:05.339> I<00:00:06.150> found<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:06.690> it's<00:00:06.839> called

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
power center I found that it's called

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.990 
power center I found that it's called
dual<00:00:07.200> power<00:00:07.470> center<00:00:07.830> when<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.610> stride<00:00:08.880> to

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
dual power center when I stride to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.240 
dual power center when I stride to
search<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.480> find<00:00:09.599> out<00:00:09.780> how<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.929> work<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.349> I

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
search and find out how to work this I

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.009 
search and find out how to work this I
know<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.059> comes<00:00:12.269> with<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> directions

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
know that it comes with the directions

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.650 
know that it comes with the directions
and<00:00:13.200> such<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.799> don't<00:00:14.549> know<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.910> carry<00:00:15.360> that

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
and such I don't know you carry that

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.660 
and such I don't know you carry that
it's<00:00:15.839> really<00:00:16.049> quite<00:00:16.260> confusing<00:00:16.650> once<00:00:17.550> you

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
it's really quite confusing once you

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.279 
it's really quite confusing once you
read<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.119> not<00:00:18.330> actually<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.750> bad<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.230> I

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
read it it's not actually that bad and I

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.960 
read it it's not actually that bad and I
figured<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.680> out<00:00:19.770> but<00:00:20.100> for<00:00:20.279> ease<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.609> use<00:00:20.789> I

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
figured it out but for ease of use I

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.189 
figured it out but for ease of use I
figured<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.510> would<00:00:21.689> try<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.840> make<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.050> video

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
figured that I would try to make a video

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.470 
figured that I would try to make a video
about<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.430> was<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> more

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
about it so that it was a more

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.300 
about it so that it was a more
straightforward<00:00:24.689> for<00:00:25.019> people<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.830> basically

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
straightforward for people so basically

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.929 
straightforward for people so basically
it<00:00:26.550> all<00:00:26.670> came<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.090> box<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.720> fancy

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
it all came in the box and this fancy

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.030 
it all came in the box and this fancy
this<00:00:29.939> fancy<00:00:30.510> box<00:00:30.720> which<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.320> not<00:00:31.500> really<00:00:31.710> fancy

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
this fancy box which is not really fancy

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.080 
this fancy box which is not really fancy
at<00:00:32.130> all

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
at all

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.490 
at all
it<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.870> controls<00:00:34.410> uh<00:00:34.640> three-day<00:00:35.640> lights<00:00:36.500> to

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
it it controls uh three-day lights to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.700 
it it controls uh three-day lights to
Lunars<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.850> act<00:00:39.059> annex<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.690> then<00:00:40.170> one<00:00:40.410> always

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
Lunars to act annex and then one always

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.119 
Lunars to act annex and then one always
on<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> yellow<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.480> top<00:00:43.079> guy<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.620> says

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
on to the yellow and the top guy it says

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.069 
on to the yellow and the top guy it says
you<00:00:44.730> probably<00:00:45.059> won't<00:00:45.180> be<00:00:45.270> able<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.450> see<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.840> but

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
you probably won't be able to see it but

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.540 
you probably won't be able to see it but
right<00:00:46.829> there<00:00:47.600> it<00:00:48.600> says<00:00:48.989> timer<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.010> row<00:00:50.309> so

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
right there it says timer this row so

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.760 
right there it says timer this row so
something<00:00:51.420> about<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.660> timer<00:00:51.960> going<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.559> down

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
something about this timer going on down

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.510 
something about this timer going on down
this<00:00:52.949> row<00:00:53.480> so<00:00:55.010> once<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.100> find<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.309> out<00:00:56.489> you

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
this row so once you find that out you

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.130 
this row so once you find that out you
know<00:00:56.820> then<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.329> which<00:00:57.570> one<00:00:57.750> does<00:00:57.960> which

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
know then you know which one does which

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.410 
know then you know which one does which
and<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> new<00:00:59.670> version<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.270> don't

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
and I do have the new version I don't

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.549 
and I do have the new version I don't
know<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.629> matters<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.930> anybody<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
know if that matters to anybody but the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.560 
know if that matters to anybody but the
older<00:01:01.770> version<00:01:02.039> was<00:01:02.190> where<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.000> tops<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.420> them

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
older version was where the tops of them

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.990 
older version was where the tops of them
didn't<00:01:03.930> twist<00:01:04.140> when<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.189> open<00:01:05.460> them<00:01:05.519> up<00:01:05.670> I

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
didn't twist when you open them up I

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.359 
didn't twist when you open them up I
they<00:01:06.360> slid<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.930> these<00:01:07.470> new<00:01:07.680> ones<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:08.070> twist

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
they slid and these new ones do twist

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.830 
they slid and these new ones do twist
and<00:01:08.640> apparently<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.299> better<00:01:09.540> way<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and apparently it's a better way to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.390 
and apparently it's a better way to
prevent<00:01:10.439> water<00:01:10.850> anyway<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:11.909> begin<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
prevent water anyway so begin with the

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.630 
prevent water anyway so begin with the
begin<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.820> tutorial<00:01:15.750> per<00:01:16.170> se<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.640> for

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
begin with the tutorial per se so for

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.980 
begin with the tutorial per se so for
doing<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:18.000> started<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> day<00:01:18.630> once

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
doing I started with the day once

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.840 
doing I started with the day once
because<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.439> found<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.920> was<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.729> was

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
because I found that it was that was

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.160 
because I found that it was that was
like<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> main<00:01:21.330> when<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.570> want<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.869> figure<00:01:22.049> out

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
like the main when I want to figure out

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.179 
like the main when I want to figure out
so<00:01:22.740> what<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.979> do<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.759> first<00:01:23.939> take<00:01:24.240> this

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
so what you do is you first take this

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.060 
so what you do is you first take this
like<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.840> first<00:01:27.840> take<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.470> point<00:01:29.009> it

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
like this first take that and point it

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.010 
like this first take that and point it
to<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.189> middle<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.450> middle<00:01:30.479> thing<00:01:30.840> which

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
to the middle the middle thing which

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.890 
to the middle the middle thing which
kind<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> clock<00:01:31.860> like<00:01:32.540> at<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.659> 12

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
kind of like a clock like at the 12

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.660 
kind of like a clock like at the 12
o'clock<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.259> 9<00:01:34.380> o'clock<00:01:34.409> sign<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.520> put

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
o'clock and 9 o'clock sign and you put

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.620 
o'clock and 9 o'clock sign and you put
it<00:01:35.850> there<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.090> means<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.450> you're

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
it there and that means like you're

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.569 
it there and that means like you're
gonna<00:01:36.750> set<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> time<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.009> then<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.490> do

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
gonna set the time so then what you do

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.580 
gonna set the time so then what you do
from<00:01:38.729> there<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.350> uh<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:41.240> point<00:01:42.240> down<00:01:42.590> you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
from there is you uh you point down you

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
what I have mine set up for so you push

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.240 
what I have mine set up for so you push
down<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.989> tabs<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.530> ones<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.770> want<00:02:10.979> on

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
down the tabs of the ones you want on

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.979 
down the tabs of the ones you want on
and<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.239> time<00:02:12.450> where<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.720> want<00:02:12.810> on

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
and this is the time where you want on

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.430 
and this is the time where you want on
and<00:02:13.200> they

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
and they

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.980 
and they
our<00:02:13.530> each<00:02:13.740> tab<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:15.090> 15<00:02:15.420> minute<00:02:15.690> interval

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
our each tab is in a 15 minute interval

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.280 
our each tab is in a 15 minute interval
so<00:02:16.650> then<00:02:16.860> um<00:02:17.490> once<00:02:18.210> you<00:02:18.270> have<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.510> down<00:02:18.750> then

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
so then um once you have that down then

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.680 
so then um once you have that down then
you<00:02:19.590> have<00:02:19.770> those<00:02:20.070> ones<00:02:20.250> set<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.820> they<00:02:21.480> are

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
you have those ones set and they are

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.470 
you have those ones set and they are
they<00:02:22.260> work<00:02:22.560> they<00:02:22.890> don't<00:02:22.980> need<00:02:23.330> they<00:02:24.330> don't

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
they work they don't need they don't

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.240 
they work they don't need they don't
work<00:02:24.570> with<00:02:24.690> each<00:02:24.780> other<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.290> these<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.100> doesn't

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
work with each other so these it doesn't

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.950 
work with each other so these it doesn't
matter<00:02:26.460> what<00:02:26.700> their<00:02:27.420> whether<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:27.780> one<00:02:27.930> is

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
matter what their whether this one is

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.380 
matter what their whether this one is
set<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.650> one<00:02:28.800> will<00:02:28.980> work<00:02:29.130> individually<00:02:30.000> or

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
set this one will work individually or

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.510 
set this one will work individually or
independently<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.930> should<00:02:31.080> say<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:32.100> this<00:02:32.280> guy

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
independently I should say but this guy

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.010 
independently I should say but this guy
here<00:02:33.000> this<00:02:33.180> one's<00:02:33.420> kind<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.630> cool<00:02:33.810> actually

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
here this one's kind of cool actually

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.470 
here this one's kind of cool actually
how<00:02:34.230> they<00:02:34.350> did<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:35.490> this<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.210> same

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
how they did this so this is the same

how they did this so this is the same
thing<00:02:36.720> basically<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.980> same<00:02:38.130> concept<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:39.120> put

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
push down the little tabs and then you

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.410 
push down the little tabs and then you

just line it up with the middle little

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.770 
just line it up with the middle little
clock<00:02:42.690> guy<00:02:42.930> like<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.560> have<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.010> push<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.250> over

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
clock guy like I have and push it over

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.330 
clock guy like I have and push it over
like<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:45.990> that's<00:02:46.320> that's<00:02:46.590> like<00:02:46.770> I'm<00:02:47.010> that's

you want to change it like you change
the<00:02:50.850> time<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.090> day<00:02:51.210> like<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.350> whatever<00:02:52.530> time<00:02:52.800> of

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
the time of day like to whatever time of

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.140 
the time of day like to whatever time of
day<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:53.520> whole<00:02:53.700> thing<00:02:53.940> rotates

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
day it is in this whole thing rotates

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.960 
day it is in this whole thing rotates
like<00:02:54.600> that<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.800> makes<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.070> little<00:02:56.220> little<00:02:56.730> sound

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
like that it makes a little little sound

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.850 
like that it makes a little little sound
or<00:02:57.150> whatever<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:58.260> would<00:02:58.380> twist<00:02:58.530> around<00:02:58.650> and

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
or whatever that would twist around and

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.850 
or whatever that would twist around and
there<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.070> little<00:02:59.310> arrow<00:02:59.520> right<00:03:00.030> there<00:03:00.060> I

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
there is a little arrow right there I

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.740 
there is a little arrow right there I
can<00:03:01.860> already<00:03:01.980> see<00:03:02.190> anyway<00:03:02.820> so<00:03:03.180> then<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:03.540> one

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
can already see anyway so then this one

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.600 
can already see anyway so then this one
you<00:03:03.990> will<00:03:04.500> set<00:03:04.740> for<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.920> act<00:03:05.040> enix<00:03:05.370> and

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
you will set for the act enix and

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.940 
you will set for the act enix and
whatever<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.120> actinic<00:03:06.570> sauron<00:03:06.960> so<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.620> have

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
and then I probably might always on I'm

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.210 
and then I probably might always on I'm
gonna<00:03:30.870> use<00:03:31.080> either<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.320> heater<00:03:31.620> or<00:03:31.920> something

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
gonna use either a heater or something

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.710 
gonna use either a heater or something
else<00:03:32.310> but<00:03:32.550> um<00:03:33.380> yeah<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:34.590> that's<00:03:34.739> basically

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
else but um yeah so that's basically

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.580 
else but um yeah so that's basically
basically<00:03:36.720> how<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.900> works<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:37.230> if<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.410> need

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
basically how it works and if you need

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
basically how it works and if you need
any<00:03:37.680> questions<00:03:38.040> or<00:03:38.130> anything<00:03:38.280> let<00:03:38.520> me<00:03:38.550> know

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
any questions or anything let me know

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.020 
any questions or anything let me know
they're<00:03:39.209> just<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.690> directions<00:03:40.970> but<00:03:41.970> they

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
they're just the directions but they

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.880 
they're just the directions but they
weren't<00:03:42.150> too<00:03:42.390> bad<00:03:42.600> I<00:03:42.930> mean<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.260> figured<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.769> out

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
weren't too bad I mean I figured it out

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.640 
weren't too bad I mean I figured it out
and<00:03:44.130> then<00:03:44.250> 16<00:03:44.820> years<00:03:44.970> old<00:03:45.120> or<00:03:45.180> whatever<00:03:45.300> but<00:03:45.650> it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
and then 16 years old or whatever but it

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.140 
and then 16 years old or whatever but it
makes<00:03:46.860> sense<00:03:47.100> but<00:03:47.519> just<00:03:47.580> for<00:03:47.970> easier<00:03:48.600> hands-on

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
makes sense but just for easier hands-on

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.430 
makes sense but just for easier hands-on
type<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.300> thing<00:03:51.480> then<00:03:51.690> there's<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.080> and<00:03:52.320> they

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
type of thing then there's that and they

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.960 
type of thing then there's that and they
also<00:03:52.650> have<00:03:52.920> this<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.280> also<00:03:53.430> think<00:03:53.610> that<00:03:53.790> was<00:03:53.940> a

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
also have this is also think that was a

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.090 
also have this is also think that was a
wave<00:03:54.150> maker<00:03:54.330> I<00:03:54.630> won't<00:03:55.350> be<00:03:55.440> utilizing<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:55.980> for

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
wave maker I won't be utilizing it for

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.729 
wave maker I won't be utilizing it for
that<00:03:56.220> but<00:03:56.550> it<00:03:57.360> has<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.660> potential<00:03:57.959> because<00:03:58.709> a

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
that but it has that potential because a

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.350 
that but it has that potential because a
big<00:03:58.920> diagram<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.489> stuff<00:03:59.670> if<00:03:59.820> you<00:03:59.940> do<00:04:00.090> get<00:04:00.209> this
