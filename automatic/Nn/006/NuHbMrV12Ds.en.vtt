00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:08.490
 today I come to bring you two programs for 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.490
 watch television online 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.379
 recently these two programs started 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.210
 for android and computer 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.579
 and we have seen that some have 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.590
 had some problems we're going to see 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:25.939
 if we can solve them right now 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.489
 so that they can enjoy this 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:33.000
 application rather for md computer 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:37.079
 accept x of ok we give those who have 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.860
 problem to open them right click 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.070
 and run one as administrator 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.460
 many times that solves the problems 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.260
 that I have out there let yes 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.210
 I will also teach you how to put the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:58.350
 vlc player or classic player 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.000
 for as default so that it does not 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.760
 go out itunes as many have told me 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.880
 that itunes has left what when 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.869
 we are here because the interface is 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.790
 easy 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.720
 can you this one 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.750
 click 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.850
 you can look at it in this message if you 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.290
 goes out to accept not only or close it 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.840
 there has to be that force of 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.929
 player 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.479
 when you already have it is predetermined 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.469
 the average or the plc the one that better 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.840
 work 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.229
 you can put it here we're going to what 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.229
 let's do 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.040
 I'll show you how to open it 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.610
 from the control panel we are going to 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.610
 do 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.480
 well let's hope it calms a bit 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.800
 this 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.300
 is to wait for it to load takes a little 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.850
 ammo my computer a bit slow 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.170
 but 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.170
 we know what happens 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.560
 well while opening we're going to go to the panel 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.710
 of control I will teach them how how 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.539
 make your player default 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.720
 we go in programs above programs 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.470
 then in predetermined programs a 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.270
 click 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.760
 and we give you to establish programs 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.270
 predetermined 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.270
 we hope it charges 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.690
 this is to do so that your 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.390
 player 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.650
 so that your player is the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.750
 default and the program when you open 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.600
 do not be 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.670
 do not do it with highs let's hope that 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.590
 Create a little bit or you have to install 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.290
 when you get this out that you do not know 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.410
 listen here is because it has mute can 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.110
 close it and reopen that is the 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.319
 solution that has come to me to for 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.719
 to be heard again 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.989
 yes because if in this corner you get that 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:53.489
 it's like muten that's why you can not hear it 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.749
 we come to the control panel and in this 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.969
 list we will look for the program that 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:03:00.030
 we want the player that we want 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:02.790
 be predetermined in my option I do not 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.040
 the classic media player appears because 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.010
 I already have the sport and here it has 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.079
 to appear you or the plc as you want 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.480
 you just select it and you would be 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.400
 by clicking on set program as 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.319
 predetermined the only thing that there is 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.269
 do accept and close although she already 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.909
 being there only to expand the 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.040
 screen we give to the inter extends the 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.349
 screen and to return it to the 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.310
 between the time and the screen returns 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.840
 we close 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.330
 let's go back 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.220
 for the premium channels we put a 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.890
 password because it has strong content 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:44.480
 you just have to put five zeros 1 2 3 4 5 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:47.269
 50 channels rewards and already gives you access to 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.440
 prizes and good return channels 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.120
 here is already registered in the 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.390
 password but if you do not want that 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.430
 someone between only you delete it if not 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.849

 slow but 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:58.219

 ok here the paypal page appears 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.030
 you have to wait a little bit 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:16.409

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:17.939

 are you looking ok 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.720
 the other way to make the player 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:36.900
 you also need to go to the videos 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:40.580
 we come to videos and any video 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.580
 you click right 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.490
 it is not expected to continue 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.910
 if I have them as I reproduce them 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.639
 the windows media player 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.530
 but 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.530
 you just have to right click the video 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:10.800
 it says open as we give where it says choose 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.800
 predetermined programs we click there 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.840
 okay 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.840
 this is very slow 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:36.719
 we're going to wait 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.370
 ok this list appears if it does not appear here 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.009
 your player only has to give more 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.919
 functions and we keep looking ok mine 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:50.780
 would this continue to use this seems to me 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:53.180
 because I already have one click and I already 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.550
 all this is going to transform and it's like 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.620
 this program is going to work with her and 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:02.449
