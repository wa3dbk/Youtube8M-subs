00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
trials in the way that they cannot

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.700 
trials in the way that they cannot
compete<00:00:35.430> anymore<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.809> want<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.380> say<00:00:37.500> them

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710

that<00:00:37.739> rest<00:00:38.520> assured<00:00:38.940> nothing<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.600> broken

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
that rest assured nothing is broken

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.650 
that rest assured nothing is broken
tricks<00:00:40.800> are<00:00:41.040> something<00:00:41.430> extra<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.059> can<00:00:42.270> do<00:00:42.420> a

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
tricks are something extra you can do a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.930 
tricks are something extra you can do a
new<00:00:43.469> game<00:00:43.710> mode<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.460> physics-based

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
new game mode and it's physics-based

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.510 
new game mode and it's physics-based
tricks<00:00:45.480> system<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.320> there<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.620> no<00:00:46.800> predefined

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
tricks system so there is no predefined

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.060 
tricks system so there is no predefined
control<00:00:48.090> mechanisms<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.899> are<00:00:49.230> controls<00:00:49.770> you

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
control mechanisms you are controls you

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.130 
control mechanisms you are controls you
do<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.489> tricks<00:00:50.760> that's<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.390> keen<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.020> be

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
do the tricks that's really keen to be

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.139 
do the tricks that's really keen to be
clear<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.680> tricks<00:00:52.949> take<00:00:53.489> place<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.969> their<00:00:54.120> own

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
clear the tricks take place in their own

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.420 
clear the tricks take place in their own
mode<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.930> there's<00:00:55.440> still<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.710> pure<00:00:56.070> trials

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
mode and there's still a pure trials

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.500 
mode and there's still a pure trials
mode<00:00:56.579> where<00:00:56.789> you're<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
mode where you're just going for the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.240 
mode where you're just going for the
fastest<00:00:57.809> possible<00:00:57.960> time<00:00:58.140> definitely<00:00:58.590> that's

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
fastest possible time definitely that's

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.799 
fastest possible time definitely that's
that's<00:00:59.609> really<00:00:59.789> important<00:01:00.270> think<00:01:00.510> there's<00:01:00.719> a

combos are they based in the in the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.410 
combos are they based in the in the
physics<00:01:13.290> they're<00:01:14.220> based<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.640> physics<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.360> you

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
physics they're based on physics so you

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.749 
physics they're based on physics so you
are<00:01:15.869> controlling<00:01:16.409> how<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.860> tricks<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.729> done

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
are controlling how the tricks are done

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.090 
are controlling how the tricks are done
it's<00:01:18.630> really<00:01:18.960> easy<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:19.860> are<00:01:19.950> not

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
it's really easy but we are not

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.399 
it's really easy but we are not
revealing<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.790> how<00:01:21.000> exactly<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> will<00:01:21.960> be<00:01:22.020> done

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
revealing it how exactly it will be done

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.679 
revealing it how exactly it will be done
it's<00:01:22.860> more<00:01:23.100> gameplay<00:01:23.670> stuff<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.299> people

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
it's more gameplay stuff when you people

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.260 
it's more gameplay stuff when you people
can<00:01:24.990> get<00:01:25.200> hands<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.799> rig<00:01:26.159> system<00:01:26.369> but<00:01:27.090> it's

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
can get hands of the rig system but it's

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.880 
can get hands of the rig system but it's
totally<00:01:27.659> something<00:01:27.810> new<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> cinematic

garnish<00:01:47.250> new<00:01:47.460> stuff<00:01:47.729> people<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.180> create

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
garnish new stuff people to create

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.450 
garnish new stuff people to create
tracks<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.960> obviously<00:01:49.740> what<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.100> use<00:01:50.280> to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
tracks and obviously what we use to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.100 
tracks and obviously what we use to
create<00:01:50.610> tracks<00:01:51.000> okay<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> remember<00:01:51.840> between

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
create tracks okay I remember between

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.980 
create tracks okay I remember between
Charles<00:01:52.680> HD<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.220> charles<00:01:53.250> evolution<00:01:53.990> you

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
Charles HD and charles evolution you

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.450 
Charles HD and charles evolution you
increase<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.680> distance<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> bike

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
increase the distance that the bike

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.249 
increase the distance that the bike
could<00:01:56.640> fall<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> believe<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.899> increased

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
could fall I believe is that increased

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.870 
could fall I believe is that increased
even<00:01:58.439> further<00:01:58.530> now<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.189> do<00:01:59.280> these<00:01:59.430> insane

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
even further now you can do these insane

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.429 
even further now you can do these insane
Falls

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
Falls

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.560 
Falls
yes<00:02:01.439> they're<00:02:01.920> real<00:02:02.159> let's<00:02:02.460> say<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:03.240> could<00:02:03.390> aim

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
yes they're real let's say we could aim

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.749 
yes they're real let's say we could aim
for<00:02:03.810> 1<00:02:04.049> kilometer<00:02:04.290> drop<00:02:04.979> maybe<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.520> would<00:02:05.729> be

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
for 1 kilometer drop maybe that would be

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.520 
for 1 kilometer drop maybe that would be
good<00:02:06.090> gold<00:02:06.390> will<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.750> tracks<00:02:07.020> be<00:02:07.229> getting

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
good gold will the tracks be getting

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.419 
good gold will the tracks be getting
bigger<00:02:07.680> as<00:02:07.829> well<00:02:07.920> are<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.069> gonna<00:02:08.190> see

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
bigger as well are we gonna see

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.919 
bigger as well are we gonna see
something<00:02:08.640> bigger<00:02:08.940> than<00:02:09.060> giga<00:02:09.239> track<00:02:09.539> in

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
something bigger than giga track in

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.930 
something bigger than giga track in

remnants like forest there's a snow so
does<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.290> mean<00:02:38.440> you've<00:02:38.620> moved<00:02:38.740> away<00:02:38.950> from

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
does that mean you've moved away from

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.920 
does that mean you've moved away from
the<00:02:39.340> aesthetic<00:02:39.580> of<00:02:39.880> like<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.180> junkyard<00:02:40.660> and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
the aesthetic of like the junkyard and

the aesthetic of like the junkyard and
the<00:02:41.170> kind<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.470> things<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:41.830> we<00:02:42.190> will

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
the kind of things that we will

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.370 
the kind of things that we will
recognize<00:02:43.030> from<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.540> earlier<00:02:43.960> trails<00:02:44.200> game

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
recognize from the earlier trails game

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.590 
recognize from the earlier trails game
yes<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.770> think<00:02:45.160> step<00:02:45.850> from<00:02:46.090> glass<00:02:46.300> hey<00:02:46.540> see

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
yes I think step from glass hey see

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.570 
yes I think step from glass hey see
what's<00:02:46.930> in<00:02:47.020> warehouse<00:02:47.500> class<00:02:47.800> evolution<00:02:48.400> went

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
what's in warehouse class evolution went

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.790 
what's in warehouse class evolution went
out<00:02:48.820> but<00:02:49.540> when<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.870> look<00:02:50.080> at<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.380> objects

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
out but when you look at the objects

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.470 
out but when you look at the objects
they<00:02:51.040> look<00:02:51.220> at<00:02:51.400> same<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:51.910> there<00:02:52.120> was<00:02:52.270> like

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
they look at same so there was like

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.990 
they look at same so there was like
weren't<00:02:52.750> barrels<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.860> those<00:02:54.490> can<00:02:54.760> stuff

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
weren't barrels and and those can stuff

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.970 
weren't barrels and and those can stuff
so<00:02:55.180> visually<00:02:55.750> all<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.020> obvious<00:02:56.350> look<00:02:56.560> at<00:02:56.709> same

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
so visually all the obvious look at same

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.760 
so visually all the obvious look at same
so<00:02:57.550> we<00:02:57.700> thought<00:02:57.880> how<00:02:58.240> we<00:02:58.780> could<00:02:59.080> improve<00:02:59.500> it

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
so we thought how we could improve it

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.460 
so we thought how we could improve it
visually<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.580> now<00:03:01.180> everything<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:01.780> new<00:03:02.020> shiny

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
visually and now everything is new shiny

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.650 
visually and now everything is new shiny
so<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.400> creates<00:03:03.820> a<00:03:03.940> new<00:03:04.090> loop<00:03:04.300> for

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
so that creates a new loop for

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.050 
so that creates a new loop for
transfusion<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.310> handling<00:03:06.850> of<00:03:06.940> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
transfusion the the handling of the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.120 
transfusion the the handling of the
bikes<00:03:07.270> has<00:03:07.510> has<00:03:07.810> changed<00:03:08.200> somewhat<00:03:08.650> but<00:03:08.709> not<00:03:09.100> a

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
bikes has has changed somewhat but not a

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.070 
bikes has has changed somewhat but not a
great<00:03:09.310> deal<00:03:09.430> how<00:03:10.150> are<00:03:10.390> you<00:03:10.510> going<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.780> preserve

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
great deal how are you going to preserve

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.830 
great deal how are you going to preserve
that<00:03:11.410> physics<00:03:11.830> into<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.700> next<00:03:12.880> generation<00:03:13.330> I

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
that physics into the next generation I

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.020 
that physics into the next generation I
think<00:03:14.350> that's<00:03:14.590> really<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:15.010> long<00:03:15.160> process<00:03:15.490> and

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
think that's really a long process and

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.000 
think that's really a long process and
we<00:03:16.180> are<00:03:16.270> doing<00:03:16.570> good<00:03:16.750> right<00:03:17.080> at<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.470> moment<00:03:17.830> so

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
we are doing good right at the moment so

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.710 
we are doing good right at the moment so
obviously<00:03:18.519> we<00:03:18.670> have<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:19.000> be<00:03:19.090> careful<00:03:19.570> we

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
obviously we have to be careful we

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.930 
obviously we have to be careful we
looped<00:03:19.930> how<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.260> bike<00:03:20.560> Anderson<00:03:21.070> tries<00:03:21.250> HD<00:03:21.790> oh

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
looped how the bike Anderson tries HD oh

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.330
