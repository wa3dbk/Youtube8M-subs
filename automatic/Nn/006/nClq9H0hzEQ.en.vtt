now<00:01:20.640> once<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:22.040> you'll<00:01:23.040> see<00:01:23.780> we<00:01:24.780> have

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
now once I do this you'll see we have

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
now once I do this you'll see we have
all<00:01:25.320> those<00:01:25.770> outputs<00:01:26.430> now<00:01:27.740> they're<00:01:28.740> not<00:01:28.920> going

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
all those outputs now they're not going

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.410 
all those outputs now they're not going
to<00:01:29.070> automatically<00:01:30.020> go<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:32.030> separate<00:01:33.030> outputs

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
to automatically go to separate outputs

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.730 
to automatically go to separate outputs
that's<00:01:33.659> something<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.380> configure

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
that's something you have to configure

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.149 
that's something you have to configure
in<00:01:35.130> your<00:01:35.310> drum<00:01:35.610> software<00:01:39.799> now<00:01:40.799> I'm<00:01:40.920> going<00:01:41.100> to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
in your drum software now I'm going to

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.630 
in your drum software now I'm going to
do<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> same<00:01:41.610> thing<00:01:42.680> with<00:01:43.680> ezdrummer<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
do the same thing with ezdrummer and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.399 
do the same thing with ezdrummer and
show<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.000> how<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.600> way<00:01:48.409> let's

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
show you how to do it that way let's

00:01:49.409 --> 00:02:07.380 
show you how to do it that way let's
take<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.799> out

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.290 

once<00:02:07.659> again<00:02:09.929> here<00:02:10.929> we<00:02:11.020> go<00:02:11.280> activate<00:02:12.280> pop<00:02:12.760> put

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
once again here we go activate pop put

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.890 
once again here we go activate pop put
whoops<00:02:13.750> upped<00:02:14.430> activate<00:02:15.430> all<00:02:15.730> outputs<00:02:16.690> and

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
whoops upped activate all outputs and

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.980 
whoops upped activate all outputs and
that<00:02:16.990> gives<00:02:17.230> us<00:02:17.410> our<00:02:17.590> multiple<00:02:18.430> tracks<00:02:18.990> now

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
that gives us our multiple tracks now

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.440 
that gives us our multiple tracks now
once<00:02:20.200> again<00:02:20.550> that's<00:02:21.550> always<00:02:21.970> needs<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.360> be

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
once again that's always needs to be

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.970 
once again that's always needs to be
configured<00:02:23.170> in<00:02:23.860> your<00:02:23.920> software<00:02:24.670> as<00:02:24.820> well<00:02:25.980> very

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
configured in your software as well very

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.230 
configured in your software as well very
simple<00:02:27.520> here<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:27.880> ezdrummer<00:02:29.340> simply<00:02:30.340> just

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
simple here and ezdrummer simply just

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.680 
simple here and ezdrummer simply just
open<00:02:31.420> your<00:02:31.660> mixer<00:02:32.110> go<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.709> first<00:02:32.980> output

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
open your mixer go to the first output

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.110 
open your mixer go to the first output
and<00:02:34.690> click<00:02:35.230> multi-channel<00:02:38.730> now<00:02:39.730> we<00:02:39.790> have

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
and click multi-channel now we have

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.510 
and click multi-channel now we have
everything<00:02:40.739> configured<00:02:41.739> each<00:02:41.980> drum<00:02:42.370> two

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
everything configured each drum two

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.540 
everything configured each drum two
separate<00:02:42.850> outputs<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:44.040> let's<00:02:45.040> take<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.250> look

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
separate outputs and let's take a look

00:02:45.550 --> 00:03:00.449 
separate outputs and let's take a look
now<00:02:57.120> you'll<00:02:58.120> notice<00:02:58.360> some<00:02:59.100> multiple<00:03:00.100> tracks

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
now you'll notice some multiple tracks

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.370 
now you'll notice some multiple tracks
being<00:03:00.970> triggered<00:03:03.810> that's<00:03:04.810> because<00:03:05.140> we<00:03:05.260> have

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
being triggered that's because we have

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.170 
being triggered that's because we have
overheads<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:08.340> room<00:03:09.340> mics<00:03:09.370> which<00:03:10.000> are

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
overheads and room mics which are

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.940 
overheads and room mics which are
already<00:03:10.660> set<00:03:10.930> up<00:03:12.329> right<00:03:13.329> here<00:03:16.470> or<00:03:17.470> effect

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
already set up right here or effect

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.590 
already set up right here or effect
returns<00:03:18.430> overhead<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.480> real<00:03:20.230> mic<00:03:21.450> we<00:03:22.450> can

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
returns overhead and real mic we can

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.300 
returns overhead and real mic we can
change<00:03:22.900> any<00:03:23.110> of<00:03:23.260> those<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.829> way<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:23.980> like

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
change any of those to the way you like

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.390 
change any of those to the way you like
but<00:03:25.230> this<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:26.290> how<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.650> get<00:03:26.890> going<00:03:27.220> with
