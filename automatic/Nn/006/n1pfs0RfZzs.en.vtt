00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello my name is anastasia 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.120
 Kulikova in this video I will show how 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.980
 make here such a bezel with a butterfly from 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.900
 kanzashi petals for working us 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.120
 squares of satin ribbon are required 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.460
 5 centimeters wide in my two 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.520
 shades make the first kind of petals 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.680
 make two triangles and add one 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.000
 on the other so that the lower triangle 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.000
 was visible 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.710
 we roll a sharp kanzashi petal 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.760
 at 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.780
 lower edge is cut parallel 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.780
 top 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.909
 we will need 16 such petals 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.909
 second kind of petal round in sharp 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.750
 but 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.060
 here 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.910
 this is one of my favorite petals 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.010
 kanzashi which petals most 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.209
 like you looking forward to your 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.480
 replies in the comments 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.060
 we will make 26 such petals for the body 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.910
 butterflies make two sharp petals of 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.920
 squares of satin ribbons 5 cm wide to 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.700
 and one petal will cut a little more 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.700
 than the other 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.060
 now starting to stick petals on 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.060
 felt base 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.630
 but 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.920
 you 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.379
 Similarly, we make the right wing of the butterfly 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:47.490
 cut try to cut as much as possible 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:47.490
 more basics 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.590
 additionally glue the petals where 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.590
 it's necessary 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.820
 and 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.210
 decorate the middle of the button I found here 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.210
 this kind of butterfly 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.510
 but 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.430
 glue stamens instead of antennae 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.610
 fastened on the bezel which I advance 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.610
 braided pink satin ribbons 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:15.550
 here is a bezel turned butterfly 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.930
 turned out big enough if you take 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.500
 tape two and a half centimeters 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:22.330
 then get a more acceptable option 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.830
 I hope my lesson was good for you 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.240

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.250

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.370

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.370
