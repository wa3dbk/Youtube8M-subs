fresh garlic or whatever garlic you have
available<00:04:07.629> because<00:04:08.409> this<00:04:08.799> I<00:04:09.069> know<00:04:09.190> it's<00:04:09.459> not

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.960 

ok<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:20.709> then<00:04:20.919> what<00:04:21.099> I<00:04:21.130> do<00:04:21.250> is<00:04:21.370> I<00:04:21.639> mix

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
ok and then what I do is I mix

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.580 
ok and then what I do is I mix
everything<00:04:22.120> together<00:04:22.570> if<00:04:22.990> you<00:04:23.139> have<00:04:23.320> a<00:04:23.349> food

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
everything together if you have a food

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.159 
everything together if you have a food
processor<00:04:23.710> it's<00:04:24.340> gonna<00:04:24.490> be<00:04:24.639> easier<00:04:25.120> but<00:04:25.900> once

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
processor it's gonna be easier but once

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.060 
processor it's gonna be easier but once
again<00:04:26.289> I<00:04:26.500> don't<00:04:26.560> have<00:04:26.740> that<00:04:27.160> I<00:04:27.430> broke<00:04:28.150> it<00:04:29.070> so

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
again I don't have that I broke it so

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.040 
again I don't have that I broke it so
I'm<00:04:30.160> gonna<00:04:30.310> mix<00:04:30.550> everything<00:04:30.849> together<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.840> so

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
I'm gonna mix everything together and so

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.420 
I'm gonna mix everything together and so
every<00:04:32.349> everything<00:04:32.770> blends<00:04:33.190> together<00:04:33.370> alright

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
every everything blends together alright

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.070 
every everything blends together alright
so<00:04:36.430> basically<00:04:36.639> you<00:04:37.090> keep<00:04:37.270> blending<00:04:37.570> it<00:04:37.870> or<00:04:37.990> you

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
so basically you keep blending it or you

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.690 
so basically you keep blending it or you
put<00:04:38.289> it<00:04:38.320> in<00:04:38.470> the<00:04:38.590> food<00:04:38.740> processor<00:04:38.800> until<00:04:39.580> you

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
put it in the food processor until you

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.680 
put it in the food processor until you
get<00:04:39.880> this<00:04:40.120> kind<00:04:40.419> of<00:04:40.570> consistency<00:04:42.450> it<00:04:43.450> sound

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
get this kind of consistency it sound

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.529 
get this kind of consistency it sound
like<00:04:43.810> a<00:04:43.870> paste<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:45.400> remind<00:04:46.000> you<00:04:46.150> with<00:04:46.300> this

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.180 
like a paste and remind you with this
you<00:04:46.750> only<00:04:46.900> need<00:04:47.139> a<00:04:47.169> little<00:04:47.410> bit<00:04:47.620> to<00:04:47.770> season

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
you only need a little bit to season

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.500 
you only need a little bit to season
whatever<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.729> only<00:04:48.849> need<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.060> little<00:04:49.240> bit

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
whatever you only need a little bit

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.600 
whatever you only need a little bit
don't<00:04:50.169> need<00:04:50.380> that<00:04:50.590> much<00:04:50.800> because<00:04:51.039> then<00:04:51.340> it'll

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
don't need that much because then it'll

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.900 
don't need that much because then it'll
then<00:04:52.449> it'll<00:04:52.810> become<00:04:52.930> salty<00:04:53.680> so<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.340> only<00:04:54.669> need

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
then it'll become salty so you only need

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.670 
then it'll become salty so you only need
