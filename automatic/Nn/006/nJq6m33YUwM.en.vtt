00:00:59.629 --> 00:00:59.639 
cars and one thing I've learned actually

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:01.219 
cars and one thing I've learned actually
for<00:00:59.789> any<00:00:59.909> car<00:01:00.179> is<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.510> what<00:01:00.749> we<00:01:00.870> do<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
for any car is that what we do on the

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.500 
for any car is that what we do on the
racetrack<00:01:01.440> relates<00:01:02.100> very<00:01:02.159> closely<00:01:02.510> to

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
racetrack relates very closely to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.910 
racetrack relates very closely to
driving<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.929> the<00:01:04.049> street<00:01:04.320> now<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.860> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
driving on the street now in a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.499 
driving on the street now in a
front-drive<00:01:05.219> car<00:01:05.610> we've<00:01:05.969> got<00:01:06.149> to<00:01:06.270> remember

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
front-drive car we've got to remember

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.539 
front-drive car we've got to remember
all<00:01:06.899> the<00:01:07.049> powers<00:01:07.350> going<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.009> front<00:01:08.250> tires

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
all the powers going to the front tires

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.149 
all the powers going to the front tires
what<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.659> means<00:01:09.899> is<00:01:10.170> you've<00:01:10.530> got<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.890> wait

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
what that means is you've got to wait

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.130 
what that means is you've got to wait
until<00:01:11.490> you've<00:01:11.640> got<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.939> car<00:01:12.149> turned<00:01:12.570> before

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
until you've got the car turned before

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.510 
until you've got the car turned before
you<00:01:13.530> begin<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.920> get<00:01:14.040> serious<00:01:14.430> about

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you begin to get serious about

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.700 
you begin to get serious about
accelerating<00:01:15.210> because<00:01:15.899> when<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.320> go<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.649> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
accelerating because when you go for the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.880 
accelerating because when you go for the
gas<00:01:16.920> you're<00:01:17.820> done<00:01:18.119> turning<00:01:18.420> front<00:01:19.380> drive<00:01:19.619> cars

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
gas you're done turning front drive cars

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.219 
gas you're done turning front drive cars
begin<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.880> straighten<00:01:21.390> out<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.689> their<00:01:21.840> own<00:01:21.960> so

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
begin to straighten out on their own so

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.139 
begin to straighten out on their own so
it<00:01:22.560> better<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.829> the<00:01:23.009> right<00:01:23.159> time<00:01:23.399> now

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
it better be the right time now

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.270 
it better be the right time now
let's<00:01:24.479> complicate<00:01:24.840> things<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.590> add<00:01:25.710> two<00:01:26.070> more

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
let's complicate things and add two more

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.399 
let's complicate things and add two more
wheels<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.180> Drive<00:01:27.450> how<00:01:27.780> about<00:01:27.930> an<00:01:28.020> all-wheel

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
wheels of Drive how about an all-wheel

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.469 
wheels of Drive how about an all-wheel
drive<00:01:28.740> system<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.490> dynamics<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.210> it's

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
drive system and the dynamics there it's

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.719 
drive system and the dynamics there it's
actually<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.840> easiest<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.560> all<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
actually the easiest of all the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.399 
actually the easiest of all the

you're<00:01:34.829> never<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.250> one<00:01:35.460> end<00:01:35.640> or

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
you're never going to have one end or

most<00:02:37.300> of<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.510> weights<00:02:37.660> in<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.080> back<00:02:38.290> it's

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
most of the weights in the back it's

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:39.960

backwards and what that means is that

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.070 
backwards and what that means is that
entering<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:42.970> corner<00:02:43.150> especially<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.930> have<00:02:44.020> a

you've<00:02:46.450> got<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.690> treat<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.989> car<00:02:47.140> with<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.320> lot

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
they're light if that happens and you

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.960 
they're light if that happens and you
lift<00:03:01.780> off<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.140> gas<00:03:02.290> they<00:03:03.010> come<00:03:03.310> down<00:03:03.610> and

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
lift off the gas they come down and

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.990 
lift off the gas they come down and
you've<00:03:04.480> got<00:03:04.690> a<00:03:04.720> problem<00:03:04.989> so<00:03:05.980> in<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.370> 911<00:03:06.550> it's

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
you've got a problem so in a 911 it's

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.759 
you've got a problem so in a 911 it's
very<00:03:07.209> important<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.720> be<00:03:07.810> very<00:03:07.989> smooth<00:03:08.410> with

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
very important to be very smooth with

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.920 
very important to be very smooth with
your<00:03:08.980> throttle<00:03:09.400> application<00:03:09.519> and<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.810> be<00:03:10.900> a

your throttle application and to be a

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.210 
your throttle application and to be a

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
little bit gentle on corner entry

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.400 
little bit gentle on corner entry
because<00:03:12.549> there's<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.209> much<00:03:13.360> momentum<00:03:13.600> in<00:03:13.989> the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
because there's so much momentum in the
