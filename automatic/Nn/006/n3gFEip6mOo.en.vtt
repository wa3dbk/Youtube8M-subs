and my iPhone 5

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.600 
and my iPhone 5
right<00:04:27.360> here<00:04:27.690> can<00:04:28.560> fit<00:04:28.950> in<00:04:29.130> one<00:04:29.250> of<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.460> pockets

poking<00:04:32.610> out<00:04:32.730> as<00:04:32.910> you<00:04:33.030> can<00:04:33.150> see<00:04:33.390> so<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.080> pocket

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
poking out as you can see so the pocket

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.050 
poking out as you can see so the pocket
is<00:04:34.470> not<00:04:34.590> going<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.800> be<00:04:34.890> like<00:04:35.250> those<00:04:35.730> side

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
it and this works I think a whole lot

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.440 
it and this works I think a whole lot
better<00:05:10.050> than<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:11.280> minimap<00:05:11.760> would<00:05:12.030> for<00:05:12.330> me

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
better than the minimap would for me

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.570 
better than the minimap would for me
just<00:05:13.080> because<00:05:13.380> it's<00:05:13.560> like<00:05:13.710> more<00:05:13.920> security<00:05:14.370> and

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
just because it's like more security and

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.250 
just because it's like more security and
all<00:05:14.670> that<00:05:14.850> stuff<00:05:15.150> and<00:05:15.330> I'm<00:05:15.600> very<00:05:15.810> excited<00:05:16.230> for
