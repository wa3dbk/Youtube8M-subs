basic ways is one China thought that

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.340 
basic ways is one China thought that
says<00:00:13.590> chip<00:00:13.889> in<00:00:14.040> through<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.429> side<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.350> open

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
says chip in through the side and open

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.710 
says chip in through the side and open
it<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.590> way<00:00:16.800> my<00:00:17.070> way<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:18.439> go<00:00:19.439> down<00:00:19.680> here<00:00:20.189> and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
just easy way in and and it's not it's

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.810 
just easy way in and and it's not it's
this<00:00:24.779> isn't<00:00:24.990> real<00:00:25.619> man<00:00:25.890> way<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.490> can<00:00:26.640> just

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
this isn't real man way you can just

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.910 
this isn't real man way you can just
look<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.359> people<00:00:27.660> make<00:00:27.900> such<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> federal<00:00:28.710> bear

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
look the people make such a federal bear

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.490 
look the people make such a federal bear
that<00:00:29.130> but<00:00:29.369> that's<00:00:30.029> all<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.269> got<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.599> it's

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
that but that's all you got to do it's

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.740 
that but that's all you got to do it's
really<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.160> simple<00:00:32.189> when<00:00:32.850> I'm<00:00:33.030> impatient

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
really that simple when I'm impatient

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.240 
really that simple when I'm impatient
and<00:00:33.899> I'm<00:00:34.110> trying<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.500> open<00:00:34.800> them<00:00:34.980> without

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
and I'm trying to open them without

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.040 
and I'm trying to open them without
actually<00:00:35.730> getting<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.719> knife<00:00:36.930> right<00:00:37.290> down

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
actually getting the knife right down

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.560 
actually getting the knife right down
then<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.379> does<00:00:40.590> require<00:00:40.950> muscle<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:42.239> I'm<00:00:42.390> just

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
then it does require muscle but I'm just

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
then it does require muscle but I'm just
gonna<00:00:42.750> show<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.739> may<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.309> couple<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.410> this<00:00:46.410> is

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
gonna show if I may a couple and this is

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.260 
gonna show if I may a couple and this is
what<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.770> mean<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.309> try<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.760> open<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
what I mean if you try and open the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.930 
what I mean if you try and open the
oyster<00:00:48.660> by<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:49.020> getting<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.440> here<00:00:49.940> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
oyster by just getting in here you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.910 
oyster by just getting in here you
haven't<00:00:51.149> got<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> good<00:00:51.570> leverage<00:00:52.050> point<00:00:52.379> here

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
haven't got a good leverage point here

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.010 
haven't got a good leverage point here
so<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.640> need<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.030> use<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> lot<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.480> muscle<00:00:54.660> but

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
so you need to use a lot of muscle but

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.720 
so you need to use a lot of muscle but
if<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.559> patient<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.309> lever

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
if you just be patient and just lever

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.970 
if you just be patient and just lever
your<00:00:57.000> way<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.420> bakers<00:00:57.930> though<00:00:58.320> just<00:00:58.530> open<00:00:58.949> like

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
your way in bakers though just open like

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.310 
your way in bakers though just open like
a<00:00:59.190> little<00:00:59.579> like<00:01:00.239> you've<00:01:00.449> got<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> key<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
a little like you've got the key in the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.770 
a little like you've got the key in the
box<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.460> becomes<00:01:02.789> very<00:01:03.059> easy<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.660> then

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
box and it becomes very easy and then

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.750 
box and it becomes very easy and then
all<00:01:04.019> you've<00:01:04.199> got<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> do<00:01:04.710> basically<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.489> get

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
all you've got to do basically is get

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.800 
all you've got to do basically is get
the<00:01:06.720> abductor<00:01:07.170> muscle<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> side<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the abductor muscle is on the side the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.660 
the abductor muscle is on the side the
curved<00:01:10.080> side<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.740> oyster<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.460> right

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
curved side of the oyster so it's right

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.270 
curved side of the oyster so it's right
there<00:01:12.170> so<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.439> slip<00:01:13.710> your<00:01:13.890> knife<00:01:14.010> in

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
there so if you slip your knife in

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.160 
there so if you slip your knife in
through<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.670> side<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.360> release<00:01:15.840> that

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
through this side and just release that

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.890 
through this side and just release that
and<00:01:16.470> then<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.700> all<00:01:17.909> comes<00:01:17.939> apart<00:01:18.299> very<00:01:18.750> easily

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
and then it all comes apart very easily

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.590 
and then it all comes apart very easily
you<00:01:19.799> get<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.979> nice<00:01:20.189> clean<00:01:20.520> cut<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.090> abductor

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
you get a nice clean cut on the abductor

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.350 
you get a nice clean cut on the abductor
and<00:01:21.950> then<00:01:22.950> all<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.670> knock<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and then all you have to do is knock the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.090 
and then all you have to do is knock the
shell<00:01:24.570> off<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.930> I've<00:01:25.110> pushed<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.740> because

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
shell off that I've pushed in because

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.580 
shell off that I've pushed in because
I'm<00:01:26.250> not<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.610> good<00:01:26.670> at<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.630> don't<00:01:28.380> lose

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
I'm not that good at this and don't lose

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.499 
I'm not that good at this and don't lose
than<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> cure<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.670> keep<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.000> up<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.299> then

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
than the cure just keep it up and then

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.539 
than the cure just keep it up and then
just<00:01:30.720> slip<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.320> your<00:01:31.680> knife<00:01:31.829> round<00:01:32.130> release
