00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
glitch on extinction specifically the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.130 
glitch on extinction specifically the
map<00:00:19.260> Mayday<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:21.000> new<00:00:21.180> map<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.689> if<00:00:21.960> you've

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
ever got far enough your lotus mouth

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.080 
ever got far enough your lotus mouth
you'll<00:00:25.109> have<00:00:25.260> realized<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.490> boss<00:00:26.730> at

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
you'll have realized that the boss at

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.050 
you'll have realized that the boss at
the<00:00:27.119> end<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.570> Kraken<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.670> literally

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
the end the Kraken is it is literally

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.200 
the end the Kraken is it is literally
impossible<00:00:30.740> so<00:00:31.759> today<00:00:32.759> I'm<00:00:32.940> going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.149> be

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
impossible so today I'm going to be

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.520 
impossible so today I'm going to be
showing<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> glitch<00:00:34.640> basically<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:36.530> it's

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
showing you a glitch basically it it's

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.280 
showing you a glitch basically it it's
just<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.700> when<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.000> fighting<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.600> Kraken

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
there's no aliens attacking you it's

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.529 
there's no aliens attacking you it's
just<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.420> versus<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> Kraken<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:44.420> when<00:00:45.420> you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
get to the gas chamber bit you don't you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.080 
get to the gas chamber bit you don't you
keep<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:48.870> person<00:00:49.260> at<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.559> control<00:00:50.280> panel<00:00:50.700> and

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
keep one person at the control panel and

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.459 
keep one person at the control panel and
then<00:00:51.239> everyone<00:00:51.600> else<00:00:51.690> run<00:00:51.989> downs<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.440> this

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
then everyone else run downs on this

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.920 
then everyone else run downs on this
crate<00:00:52.860> down<00:00:53.070> here<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.550> then<00:00:54.059> when<00:00:54.420> everyone's

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
crate down here and then when everyone's

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.889 
crate down here and then when everyone's
in<00:00:55.170> tell<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.010> person<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.149> gas<00:00:57.329> chamber<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
in tell the person in the gas chamber to

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.479 
in tell the person in the gas chamber to
press<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.289> button<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.100> then<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.309> basically

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
press the button and then you basically

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.479 
press the button and then you basically
just<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.270> hold<00:01:00.449> down<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:01.129> crate<00:01:02.129> with

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
just have to hold down this crate with

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.490 
just have to hold down this crate with
like<00:01:02.640> sentry<00:01:03.059> guns<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.840> can't<00:01:04.110> move<00:01:04.320> out

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
like sentry guns but you can't move out

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.399 
like sentry guns but you can't move out
of<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.860> if<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.549> bitch<00:01:05.790> will<00:01:06.000> work<00:01:06.409> so

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
of it if you do this bitch will work so

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.780 
of it if you do this bitch will work so
I<00:01:07.680> don't<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:08.250> how<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.729> works<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:10.010> think<00:01:11.010> one

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
I don't know how this works I think one

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.550 
I don't know how this works I think one
of<00:01:11.820> my<00:01:11.909> friends<00:01:12.270> told<00:01:12.299> me<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.020> aliens

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
of my friends told me all the aliens

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.399 
of my friends told me all the aliens
fall<00:01:13.860> off<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.189> edge<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.520> map<00:01:14.760> down<00:01:15.720> into

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
fall off the edge of the map down into

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.140 
fall off the edge of the map down into
the<00:01:16.560> pit<00:01:16.740> below<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:17.790> why<00:01:17.970> there

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
the pit below you that's why there

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.560 
the pit below you that's why there
aren't<00:01:18.299> any<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:18.869> I'm<00:01:19.110> not<00:01:19.380> sure<00:01:19.409> how<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.799> works

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
aren't any but I'm not sure how it works

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.679 
aren't any but I'm not sure how it works
so<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:23.000> actually<00:01:24.000> didn't<00:01:24.360> figure<00:01:24.540> this

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
so it's I actually didn't figure this

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.350 
so it's I actually didn't figure this
out<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:25.080> I'm<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.409> listed<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.850> big<00:01:27.060> shout<00:01:27.330> out

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360

out with I'm now listed so big shout out
to<00:01:27.570> him<00:01:27.840> thinking<00:01:28.380> about

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
to him thinking about

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.850 
to him thinking about
I'm<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:29.790> sure<00:01:29.850> if<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.120> was<00:01:30.240> him<00:01:30.510> look<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.620> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
I'm not sure if it was him look it's a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.970 
I'm not sure if it was him look it's a
really<00:01:32.190> really<00:01:32.520> good<00:01:32.790> glitch<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.980> everybody

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
really really good glitch but everybody

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.900 
really really good glitch but everybody
can't<00:01:35.430> really<00:01:35.670> complete<00:01:36.030> extinction<00:01:36.770> so

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
can't really complete extinction so

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.540 
can't really complete extinction so
that's<00:01:38.910> named<00:01:39.800> well<00:01:40.800> that's<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.160> main<00:01:41.310> bit<00:01:41.460> of

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
that's named well that's the main bit of

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.490 
that's named well that's the main bit of

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
to go back to the gas chamber and that's

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.390 
to go back to the gas chamber and that's
when<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.860> finish<00:01:53.190> so<00:01:53.820> when<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:55.830> meter<00:01:56.100> on
