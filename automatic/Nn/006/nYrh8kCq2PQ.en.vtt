 we are shooting a car today 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:51.710
 dream of removing any car 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.809

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.129
 what is worth two-liter boxer 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.710
 four cylinder engine 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.100
 passport 260 horsepower constant 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.100
 four-wheel drive 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.299
 but 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.140
 perhaps on any other car 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.840
 except on this the yellow discs are not 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.429
 look so harmonious I think that 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.070
 when the Japanese decided to put here 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:25.429
 yellow discs they thought that blue 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.950
 colors on the ticket to the sky yellow wheels 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.590

 Shoe a beautiful woman beautiful 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.229
 unlike most subaru machines on 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.450
 this car nameplate is pink 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.799
 they are blue at first we thought that he 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.140
 just burned out in the sun 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.090
 but actually pink subaru nameplate 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.799
 is a fetish object among them 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.799
 lovers of this car brand 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.170

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.810
 richard bird

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.120
 Transmission 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.520

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.400

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.380
 and wesson this is not any 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.690
 automatic transmission and other 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.590
 good this is a rally car on which 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.070
 need to drive 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.070
 be able to 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:04.000
 awesome god this is awesome 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.630
 all you knew before about management 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.920
 by car forget here it is not 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.500
 works here a lot of all sorts of features 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.020
 same 3000 revolutions below which 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.970
 machines do not need to keep because she 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.470
 stops driving and starts like this 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.950
 sound and it's not cool so here the wheel is not 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.630
 one role become look yes he is sharp but 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.090
 the car is behaving nervously i mean no 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.630
 it feels like she wants to kill you 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.870
 and combing to the nearest words there is no such 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.870
 not 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.189
 characteristic feature of engines 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.989
 car subaru the fact that they are boxer 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.720
 that is, the collapse 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.090
 cylinder engines 180 degrees and 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.010
 it turns out that the engine is as if 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.720
 well at the bottom of the car, that is, when 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.310
 you open the engine hood immediately 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.930
 see a bunch of other details that 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.359
 relate to the engine us little motor not 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.189
 visible and it gives that of course it gives 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.739
 a slight advantage in racing because 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:09.940
 that the center of gravity of this machine is 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.490
 lower, respectively, better holding the road 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.540
 I would like to note the convenience of landing 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.540
 driver in this car 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.740
 no they can ride in civil 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.419
 Mode selection is absolutely quiet but not 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.010
 the plaintiff may have said the same 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.900
 sports car so it stands here 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.900
 sports suspension hard assembled 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:39.820
 Adrenaline provide I do not know how 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:42.010
 the owner of this car to this is not a wagon in 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.190
 overall this car is not impressed 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.200
 only us but also our camera which is not 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:52.410
 Could hold back more precisely 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.410
 keep aboard this car and
