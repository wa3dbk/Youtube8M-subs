warfare two you know in those modern
warfare<00:01:55.290> two<00:01:55.530> videos<00:01:55.829> before<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.369> game<00:01:56.610> came

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
warfare two videos before the game came

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.530 
warfare two videos before the game came
out<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.329> at<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> end<00:01:58.619> they<00:01:59.399> know<00:02:00.270> there's<00:02:00.450> a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
out and at the end they know there's a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.330 
out and at the end they know there's a
small<00:02:00.840> there's<00:02:01.200> almost<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.799> three<00:02:02.100> that

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
small there's almost like a three that

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.980 
small there's almost like a three that
faded<00:02:02.729> out<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.899> outro<00:02:04.469> all<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> videos

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
of course they had to make this intro

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.490 
of course they had to make this intro
and<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.450> know<00:02:18.540> someone<00:02:18.870> told<00:02:19.050> them<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.320> put<00:02:19.440> a

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
and you know someone told them to put a
