00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
I thought was the exact same thing in

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
I thought was the exact same thing in
the<00:01:31.770> coyote<00:01:32.220> tan<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:33.119> there<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:34.130> really<00:01:35.130> just

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the coyote tan but there are really just

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.990 
the coyote tan but there are really just
one<00:01:35.939> slight<00:01:36.659> difference<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
one slight difference and that is on the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.469 
one slight difference and that is on the
coyote<00:01:39.720> tan<00:01:40.020> version<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.740> has<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:41.340> very<00:01:41.790> small

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
coyote tan version it has a very small

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.179 
coyote tan version it has a very small
grommet<00:01:43.170> which<00:01:44.130> allows<00:01:44.850> us<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.600> breathable

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
grommet which allows us to be breathable

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.330 
grommet which allows us to be breathable
but<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.250> does<00:01:47.729> not<00:01:47.970> allow<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:49.110> store<00:01:49.740> your

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
but it does not allow you to store your

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.560 
but it does not allow you to store your
multi-tool<00:01:51.350> open<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.579> older<00:01:54.180> black

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
multi-tool open like the older black

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
multi-tool open like the older black
version<00:01:55.170> does<00:01:55.790> so<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:58.380> allows

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
version does so with this this allows

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.639 
version does so with this this allows
you<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.130> store<00:01:59.430> your<00:01:59.460> tool<00:02:00.000> when<00:02:00.390> open<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.560> you

don't have to continually open it to get
to<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> pliers<00:02:05.659> whereas<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.869> one<00:02:07.170> does<00:02:07.350> not

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
to the pliers whereas this one does not

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.850 
to the pliers whereas this one does not
allow<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.459> do<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.929> but<00:02:09.929> otherwise<00:02:10.289> that

are virtually the same

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.170

anywhere that there's Molly webbing on

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.510 
anywhere that there's Molly webbing on
the<00:02:33.310> back<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.440> like<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.739> keep<00:02:36.069> it<00:02:36.310> up

front<00:02:36.880> so<00:02:37.750> that<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.959> could<00:02:38.200> get<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.680> if<00:02:39.069> I

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
front so that I could get to it if I

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.699 
front so that I could get to it if I
really<00:02:39.610> need<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:40.030> as<00:02:40.239> it's<00:02:40.690> probably<00:02:41.200> my<00:02:41.380> most

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.620 
this yes I really do of the pouches it's
my<00:02:50.500> favorite<00:02:51.130> though<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.459> wish<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.180> did<00:02:52.360> have<00:02:52.600> a

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
my favorite though I wish it did have a

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.720 
my favorite though I wish it did have a
larger<00:02:53.110> grommet<00:02:53.560> hole<00:02:53.800> so<00:02:54.070> that<00:02:54.100> could<00:02:54.430> store

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
larger grommet hole so that could store

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.090 
larger grommet hole so that could store
my<00:02:54.910> tool<00:02:55.209> open<00:02:55.750> should<00:02:56.019> I<00:02:56.110> need<00:02:56.350> it<00:02:56.530> but

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
my tool open should I need it but

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.890 
my tool open should I need it but
ultimately<00:02:57.370> it's<00:02:58.060> not<00:02:58.120> something<00:02:58.690> that<00:02:58.720> I

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
ultimately it's not something that I

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.229 
ultimately it's not something that I
need<00:02:59.170> very<00:02:59.410> often<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.550> doesn't<00:03:00.880> bother<00:03:01.000> me

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
need very often so it doesn't bother me

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.600 
need very often so it doesn't bother me
all<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.630> much<00:03:01.870> what<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:02.650> like<00:03:02.920> about<00:03:03.100> it<00:03:03.400> is

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
all that much what I like about it is

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.270 
all that much what I like about it is
that<00:03:03.850> it<00:03:03.970> has<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.150> long<00:03:04.630> closure<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.830> it<00:03:05.950> stays

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
that it has a long closure that it stays

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.780 
that it has a long closure that it stays
secure<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:07.180> then<00:03:07.930> it's<00:03:08.140> very<00:03:08.620> tight<00:03:09.250> on<00:03:09.489> the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
secure and then it's very tight on the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.110 
secure and then it's very tight on the
molle<00:03:10.000> webbing<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:11.500> thank<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:12.459> for<00:03:12.700> watching

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120
