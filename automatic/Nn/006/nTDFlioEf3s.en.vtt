thing actually has

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:30.520 
thing actually has
it's<00:00:20.169> very<00:00:20.470> cool

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.950 

this<00:00:31.530> is<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:32.400> is<00:00:32.670> cool<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.240> explain<00:00:33.660> why<00:00:33.900> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
this is this is cool but explain why the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.730 
this is this is cool but explain why the
third<00:00:34.380> wheel<00:00:34.650> well<00:00:35.580> it's<00:00:36.450> two<00:00:36.630> things<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:37.590> is

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:37.740 
third wheel well it's two things one is

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.320 
third wheel well it's two things one is
that<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> third<00:00:38.370> wheel<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.880> second<00:00:39.240> one

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
that it's the third wheel the second one

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.150 
that it's the third wheel the second one
is<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> two<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.900> tilting<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.800> this

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
is the two is that tilting and this

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.310 
is the two is that tilting and this
provides<00:00:41.610> much<00:00:41.850> better<00:00:42.090> performance<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:43.110> can

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
provides much better performance you can

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.930 
provides much better performance you can
break<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.770> shorter<00:00:44.100> distance<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.850> have

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
break in a shorter distance you have

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.570 
break in a shorter distance you have
much<00:00:45.210> more<00:00:45.420> stability<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.020> turns<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:47.309> can

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
much more stability in the turns you can

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.540 
much more stability in the turns you can
handle<00:00:48.150> you<00:00:48.420> know<00:00:48.540> tougher<00:00:48.870> terrain<00:00:49.280> and<00:00:50.280> so

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
handle you know tougher terrain and so

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.369 
handle you know tougher terrain and so
this<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> next<00:00:51.420> innovation<00:00:51.930> at<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.050> motor

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
this is the next innovation at the motor

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.990 
this is the next innovation at the motor
scooters<00:00:52.739> when<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.220> gonna<00:00:53.340> start<00:00:53.700> seeing

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
scooters when are we gonna start seeing

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.430 
scooters when are we gonna start seeing
them<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.420> country<00:00:54.690> there's<00:00:54.840> only<00:00:54.960> two<00:00:55.200> so

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
them in this country there's only two so

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.700 
them in this country there's only two so
we<00:00:55.559> want<00:00:55.739> deliverance<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.910> January<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.710> yeah

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
we want deliverance in January so yeah

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.440 
we want deliverance in January so yeah
so<00:00:59.040> then<00:00:59.220> should<00:00:59.520> go<00:00:59.610> to<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> store<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.329> make

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
so then should go to the store and make

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.900 
so then should go to the store and make
it<00:01:00.540> a<00:01:00.600> policy<00:01:04.100> it's<00:01:05.100> interesting<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.610> mean<00:01:05.700> just

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
it a policy it's interesting I mean just

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.249 
it a policy it's interesting I mean just
a<00:01:05.940> couple<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.180> things<00:01:06.390> right<00:01:06.570> off<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.900> bat<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
a couple of things right off the bat the

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:08.990 
a couple of things right off the bat the
third<00:01:07.500> wheel<00:01:07.740> allows<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.520> something<00:01:08.910> I

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
third wheel allows you to do something I

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.030 
third wheel allows you to do something I
just<00:01:09.060> engaged<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:10.020> kind<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.500> stability

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
just engaged this kind of stability

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.670 
just engaged this kind of stability
system<00:01:11.310> now<00:01:11.640> except<00:01:12.180> pick<00:01:12.509> my<00:01:12.750> feet<00:01:13.020> up<00:01:13.229> you're

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
system now except pick my feet up you're

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.950 
system now except pick my feet up you're
not<00:01:13.800> holding<00:01:14.070> me<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.550> don't<00:01:14.880> tip<00:01:15.509> either<00:01:15.810> way

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
not holding me I don't tip either way

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.810 
not holding me I don't tip either way
here<00:01:16.290> that's<00:01:16.500> exactly<00:01:17.070> right<00:01:17.160> the<00:01:17.520> next<00:01:17.640> step

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
here that's exactly right the next step

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.800 
here that's exactly right the next step
they<00:01:17.910> rise<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.300> this<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.540> an<00:01:18.630> additional

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
they rise so this is an additional

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.359 
they rise so this is an additional
benefits<00:01:19.530> when<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.770> stop<00:01:20.070> at<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:20.250> traffic

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
benefits when you stop at a traffic

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.370 
benefits when you stop at a traffic
light<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:21.210> don't<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.869> hold<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.200> bike

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
light you don't have to hold the bike
