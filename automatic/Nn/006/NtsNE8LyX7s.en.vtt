00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 when the world rolls into the abyss only gods 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.089
 can intercede for mortals destroying 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.660
 enemies in dynamic and bloody 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.880
 fights 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.260
 using the skill of any class because of them 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.660
 can be changed right in the exe 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.700
 lacquer renner and become a god to play 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.360
 go skyforge now 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.520
 under the roller 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.650
 hello people with you again check 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.930
 reality just passed 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.850
 another sale in the incentive for whom 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.910
 not pis gamers and suffering 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.890
 moaning wallets but what if you 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.330
 convinced konsolschiki unfamiliar to you 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.149
 pending sales incentive 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.399
 what salt in general but don't worry lucy 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.520
 new video gamespot producer and help 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:47.760
 I clearly show what it is and so 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:49.320
 lucy here is all my money that's nothing 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.719
 what of it all just a couple 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.420
 gonna play said sell out so why 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.250
 we do it what is the question of sales 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.760
 the name that people are willing to leave on them 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.760
 so much money 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.540
 ok but first I have to clarify that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.760
 I think steam is very good, he is extremely 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.650
 convenient to download games easily and in contrast 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.190
 from other stores he doesn't insist on 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.960
 purchase of the game on physical media 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.880
 However, if you connect the psychology 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.310
 You may notice that many used 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.990
 with the principles 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.990
 play on the weaknesses of the human brain 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.270
 in general, sales 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.070
 that's good they make people 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.140
 part with your money and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.940
 the main mechanism of their action is that 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.070
 we easily give in to excitement and 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.110
 the excitement caused by them and this in his 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.030
 queue makes it difficult to reason soberly 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.280
 name is also used in sales 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.200
 a whole bunch of classic tricks learned 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.770
 retailers for long long 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.570
 the years 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.250
 for example, the representation of discounts in the form 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.690
 percent in not in the form saved 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.340
 the amount of example we recall 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.080
 sale farky 3 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.060
 it was possible to buy seventy- five 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.030
 a percentage discount that is just three 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.720
 75 cents point no doubt this is generous 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.450
 sentence 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.190
 but 75 percent discount is definitely 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.920
 looks much more attractive than 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.900
 save 12 pounds 25 cents right 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.760
 and vice versa it works the opposite 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.829
 way when it comes to large amounts 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.780
 for example when buying a computer for 2000 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:23.239
 dollars saving 500 dollars looks like 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.239
 more than a 25 percent discount 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.230
 probably the most ingenious move 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.330
 sales incentive is 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.700
 artificial creation of limitations 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.650
 Daily offer acting 24 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.510
 hours even more fast 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.160
 discounts allow you to take advantage of them 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.709
 only for a limited time 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.379
 and as soon as their time is up you all 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.660
 We are late why this makes us 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.370
 more willing to lay out money for games in 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.230
 first research in psychology 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.049
 more than once argued that rare things 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.129
 much more appreciated by us 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.440
 lightning speed increases 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.780
 Desire doesnâ€™t matter what it is 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.340
 wine and or cookies it means that 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.220
 people time after time gives a big 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.900
 the significance of something rare one more 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.459
 the reason why these limited 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.360
 offer time seems so 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.640
 attractive 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.950
 this is a phenomenon called fear of loss 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.260
 this is due to nature's trend 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.940
 assess loss avoidance greater than 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.430
 potential gain 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.010
 Imagine that you are lost let's say 20 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.709
 pounds according to experiments you need 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.480
 will find 30 or even 40 pounds in that 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.190
 same day to compensate for the bitterness 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.379
 losing 20 pounds 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.060
 all this leads to the fact that our brain 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.150
 hate can not miss profitable 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.340
 deals so we'd rather buy the game with 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.940
 quick discounts than we will suffer that 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.340
 let the steam offer as well 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.780
 effectively using gamification she 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.639
 is to use items 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.290
 games to encourage people 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.329
 take part in something 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.040
 collectible cards are visual 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.870
 example of gamification and their you 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.510
 you earn just by playing games on 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.190
 incentive then you can create from them 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.760
 award reward badges 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.530
 of course approval from friends however 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.540
 time sales on the incentive appear 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.280
 you can earn new cards 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.319
 different ways including through 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.900
 purchase of games and the cards themselves 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.849
 You can also make icons directly from them 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.620
 which makes them the very reason 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.019
 buy a game about the acquisition of which 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.639
 you doubted 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:19.190
 this whole process is explained so 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.959
 called the effect of progress when we 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.639
 We feel that we are making some progress on 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.910
 the path to our goal is increasing our 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.430
 the desire to achieve it such an effect 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.960
 catch them all as jimmy notes 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.300
 madigan their wonderful articles 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.860
 the psychology of summer sales on the incentive one 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.430
 just a demonstration of what you do 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.410
 success on your way to your goal 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.240
 already creates mental stress due to 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.160
 the fact that for this purpose have not yet reached 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.780
 people are willing to spend some money 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.140
 cheap game solely for that 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.120
 to reach it reducing this gap to 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.430
 summer sales in 2014 in 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.470
 presented something that they called summer 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.520
 adventure in the incentive and at the same time they 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.460
 first cranked 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.650
 one very tricky thing they combined 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.570
 people in teams all who participated in 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.270
 the sale was randomly distributed in 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.400
 team blue pink green purple 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.650
 or red for various actions like 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.660
 creating badges are given team points 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.790
 at the same time every day the team wins 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.140
 most points 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.150
 besides some of the participants 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.950
 the winning team will be awarded prizes 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.020
 that sounds fair 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.180
 however, this method brazenly uses our 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.830
 desire to belong in a group that is 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.960
 concept division into insiders and 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.610
 outsiders data psychological 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.260
 research has shown more than once that 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.700
 being in a team people tend 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.860
 treat positively to other members 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.660
 of their team and negative to members 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.270
 other teams, even if not included in the 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.220
 some group randomly naturally 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.170
 if you are a member of the red team you will 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.970
 want this team to win and you 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.040
 will be more motivated to collect 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.400
 points create marks and earn points 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.380
 very clever steam very clever but what 6 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.850
 may use in the future in order 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.340
 to work on our miserable 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.870
 brain what else besides lucy and our 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.940
 new video producer she is also 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.130
 a certified psychologist is from lucy 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.320
 explain to us okay how about principle 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.850
 mutual psychology is smart 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.100
 way of saying we need some 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.350
 way to respond to service and so 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.330
 what service can steve provide what 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.860
 your how about a free game we can 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.630
 don't even play it but the fact of that 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.860
 what we have it can cause us 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.600
 desire to return service 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.290
 by buying something on 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.210
 selling off 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.710
 or imagine that the game that you 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.510
 interesting there is no demo version 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.490
 you do not want to buy it for fear 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.320
 that you do not like it and here is steam 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.120
 for a while allows you to play 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.040
 her for free thereby rendering you 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.110
 the service you probably want 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.760
 answer when the game is over 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.470
 In this study, we do this by 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.000
 respect 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.920
 to a friend in response to showing kindness and 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.480
 often our retaliatory actions are 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.500
 more valuable than initially and 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.060
 kindness 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.070
 if we behave like this in real life 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.870
 then why not apply to our 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.870
 favorite digital distributor
