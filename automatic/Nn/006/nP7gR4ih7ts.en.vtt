talk about that but really fishing it's
just<00:00:43.829> an<00:00:43.950> idea<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.520> getting<00:00:44.820> away<00:00:45.059> from

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
just an idea of just getting away from

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.400 
just an idea of just getting away from
everything<00:00:45.360> else<00:00:45.660> leaving<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.260> all<00:00:46.379> behind

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and for me growing up I'm from a very

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.869 
and for me growing up I'm from a very
large<00:00:51.180> family<00:00:51.590> it<00:00:52.590> was<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.949> idea<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> being

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
large family it was the idea of being

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.420 
large family it was the idea of being
able<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.149> go<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.930> water<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.410> kayak<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
able to go on the water in a kayak and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.560 
able to go on the water in a kayak and
right<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.870> Sun<00:00:58.469> started<00:00:58.920> set<00:00:59.270> split<00:01:00.270> two

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
right as the Sun started set split two

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.110 
right as the Sun started set split two
minutes<00:01:01.190> where<00:01:02.190> everything<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.850> quiet

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
minutes where everything is just quiet

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.039 
minutes where everything is just quiet
nothing<00:01:03.719> moves<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:05.129> water<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.640> still<00:01:06.049> and

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
nothing moves the water is still and

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.560 
nothing moves the water is still and
just<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.280> nature<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:08.850> your<00:01:09.000> idea<00:01:09.330> that

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
just in nature it's your idea that

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
just in nature it's your idea that
reconnect<00:01:10.049> everything<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.680> really<00:01:11.100> take

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
reconnect everything just really take

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.359 
reconnect everything just really take
granted<00:01:11.790> what<00:01:12.750> exactly<00:01:13.619> you're<00:01:13.860> able<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> do

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
granted what exactly you're able to do

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.620 
granted what exactly you're able to do
and<00:01:14.760> relax

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
and relax

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.149 
and relax
