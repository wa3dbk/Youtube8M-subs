it does help with waterproofness it's
not<00:01:53.670> there<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.450> does<00:01:54.570> help<00:01:54.750> with

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
not there for that but it does help with

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.270 
not there for that but it does help with
that<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.320> has<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> separate<00:01:55.860> waterproof

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
that it has a separate waterproof

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.160 
that it has a separate waterproof
coating<00:01:56.490> as<00:01:56.670> well<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:57.509> definitely<00:01:57.630> helps

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
coating as well that definitely helps

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.520 
coating as well that definitely helps
back<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.590> up<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.729> helps<00:02:00.060> with<00:02:00.119> UV<00:02:00.509> okay<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
back that up and helps with UV okay and

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.300 
back that up and helps with UV okay and
so<00:02:02.430> are<00:02:03.119> they<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.920> range<00:02:04.920> they're<00:02:05.189> all

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
so are they in this range they're all

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.889 
so are they in this range they're all
going<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.549> be<00:02:05.640> changed<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.509> brief

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
going to be changed to that brief

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.950 
going to be changed to that brief
cross-breeze<00:02:07.890> style

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
cross-breeze style

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.500 
cross-breeze style
because<00:02:10.960> if<00:02:11.230> on<00:02:11.380> each<00:02:11.500> side<00:02:11.770> that's<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:13.300> still

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
because if on each side that's it still

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.760 
because if on each side that's it still
it's<00:02:13.660> just<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.900> small<00:02:14.170> over<00:02:14.380> such<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.650> small

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
it's just a small over such a small

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.680 
it's just a small over such a small
aversion<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.520> get<00:02:15.640> out<00:02:15.850> a<00:02:15.880> vestibule<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
aversion to get out a vestibule the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.900 
aversion to get out a vestibule the
three<00:02:17.140> video<00:02:17.500> with<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.980> vestibule<00:02:18.430> okay<00:02:18.850> so

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
three video with the vestibule okay so

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.100 
three video with the vestibule okay so
you<00:02:19.060> can<00:02:19.150> get<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.360> either<00:02:19.480> with<00:02:19.720> or<00:02:19.840> without<00:02:19.930> a
