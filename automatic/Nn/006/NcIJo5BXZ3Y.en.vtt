00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.409 

all<00:00:26.180> right<00:00:26.980> here's<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.070> little<00:00:28.340> bit<00:00:28.490> about<00:00:29.180> the

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
all right here's a little bit about the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:40.580 
all right here's a little bit about the
ice<00:00:29.480> Alaska<00:00:31.270> in<00:00:32.270> this<00:00:33.050> tube<00:00:33.379> here<00:00:33.890> are<00:00:36.190> rubbers

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:50.370 

that<00:00:41.590> isolate<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.970> frame<00:00:43.390> from<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.960> engine

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.890 

there's<00:00:51.380> another<00:00:51.770> one<00:00:52.070> right<00:00:52.150> here<00:00:53.150> another

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
there's another one right here another

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:06.289 
there's another one right here another
two<00:00:54.380> goes<00:00:54.740> all<00:00:54.950> the<00:00:54.980> way<00:00:55.100> across

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.149 

one<00:01:06.479> underneath<00:01:07.079> the<00:01:07.289> tank<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.829> just<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
one underneath the tank it's just a

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.710 
one underneath the tank it's just a
small<00:01:08.520> one<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.299> looks<00:01:09.829> just<00:01:10.829> like<00:01:11.009> this

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.170 

again<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:17.370> exhaust<00:01:18.200> this<00:01:19.200> isolates<00:01:20.180> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
again the exhaust this isolates the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.530 
again the exhaust this isolates the
exhaust<00:01:21.660> from<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> frame<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:26.490> swingarm

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
exhaust from the frame the swingarm

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.460 
exhaust from the frame the swingarm
is<00:01:28.700> hooked<00:01:29.700> up<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.940> the<00:01:30.930> transmission<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:33.470> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
is hooked up to the transmission and the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.290 
is hooked up to the transmission and the
engine<00:01:36.140> all<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.980> is<00:01:38.190> isolated<00:01:38.880> from<00:01:39.120> the

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
engine all this is isolated from the

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:48.670 
engine all this is isolated from the
frame<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:43.530> when<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:45.920> go<00:01:46.920> down<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.430> road

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
frame so when you do go down the road

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.190 
frame so when you do go down the road
the<00:01:49.680> vibrations<00:01:50.400> are<00:01:50.610> virtually<00:01:51.150> gone

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the vibrations are virtually gone

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.520 
the vibrations are virtually gone
it<00:01:52.260> runs<00:01:53.040> buttery<00:01:53.790> buttery<00:01:54.450> smooth<00:01:56.570> that<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
it runs buttery buttery smooth that the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.730 
it runs buttery buttery smooth that the
thing<00:01:58.830> with<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.280> ice<00:02:00.020> which<00:02:01.020> what<00:02:01.410> they<00:02:01.530> call

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
thing with the ice which what they call

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.780 
thing with the ice which what they call
the<00:02:01.860> ice<00:02:02.010> elastic<00:02:02.790> system<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:04.790> they're

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
the ice elastic system is they're

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.470 
the ice elastic system is they're
difficult<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.660> replace<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:10.170> took<00:02:10.410> me<00:02:11.480> ten

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
difficult to replace it's it took me ten

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.160 
difficult to replace it's it took me ten
hours<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.500> do<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.860> job<00:02:14.870> essentially<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.960> have

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
hours to do the job essentially you have

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.780 
hours to do the job essentially you have
to<00:02:17.660> take<00:02:18.660> two<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:19.670> them<00:02:20.670> off<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.610> can

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
to take two of them off so that you can

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.010 
to take two of them off so that you can
pivot<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.290> used<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.910> my<00:02:26.910> tire<00:02:27.239> iron<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.900> do

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
pivot it and I used a my tire iron to do

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.680 
pivot it and I used a my tire iron to do
that<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.430> can<00:02:29.700> lift<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.180> engine<00:02:30.480> up

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
that so that you can lift the engine up

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.800 
that so that you can lift the engine up
so<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.380> can<00:02:31.620> remove<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:33.300> old<00:02:33.330> rubbers

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
so you can remove the old rubbers

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.390 
so you can remove the old rubbers
especially<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.959> rear<00:02:37.170> one<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.890> rear<00:02:38.130> ones

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
especially the rear one the rear ones

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.120 
especially the rear one the rear ones
really<00:02:38.790> very<00:02:39.180> difficult<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:40.050> was<00:02:40.560> able<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.890> do

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
really very difficult I was able to do

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:49.190 
really very difficult I was able to do
it<00:02:41.310> but<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:42.959> was<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> pain<00:02:43.620> let<00:02:44.220> me<00:02:44.340> tell<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:48.200> so

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
it but it was a pain let me tell you so

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.290 
it but it was a pain let me tell you so
I'm<00:02:49.590> sitting<00:02:50.010> there<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.190> I'm<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.640> have<00:02:51.000> to

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
I'm sitting there and I'm I have to

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.440 
I'm sitting there and I'm I have to
pivot<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.840> get<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.709> old<00:02:52.830> one<00:02:52.920> out<00:02:53.250> get<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.300> new

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
pivot it get the old one out get the new

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.479 
pivot it get the old one out get the new
one<00:02:54.690> in<00:02:54.900> it's<00:02:55.290> really<00:02:55.380> hard<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.980> get<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.280> in

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
one in it's really hard to get it in

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.670 
one in it's really hard to get it in
because<00:02:56.940> it's<00:02:57.239> really<00:02:57.510> tight<00:03:00.140> but<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.170> did<00:03:01.500> it

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
because it's really tight but I did it

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.090 
because it's really tight but I did it
so<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:02.430> kept<00:03:03.180> on<00:03:03.330> telling<00:03:03.570> myself<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.500> this

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
so I kept on telling myself that this

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.310 
so I kept on telling myself that this
can<00:03:05.340> be<00:03:05.459> done<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.880> can<00:03:06.090> do<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.630> can<00:03:06.660> do<00:03:06.930> this

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
so I got it done I put a lot of new

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.910 
so I got it done I put a lot of new
parts<00:03:12.269> in<00:03:12.709> there's<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:14.330> push<00:03:15.330> rubbers<00:03:15.780> in<00:03:16.019> here

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
parts in there's a push rubbers in here

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.940 
parts in there's a push rubbers in here
they<00:03:17.100> were<00:03:17.160> all<00:03:17.519> wore<00:03:17.880> out<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:19.470> I<00:03:19.500> put<00:03:19.800> all<00:03:19.920> new

old need be replaced put new missus
all-new<00:03:36.280> here<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:36.760> here<00:03:37.210> this<00:03:37.510> is<00:03:37.570> new<00:03:38.020> this

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
all-new here and here this is new this

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.390 
all-new here and here this is new this
isn't<00:03:39.460> new<00:03:39.640> because<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.590> it's<00:03:41.590> rarely<00:03:42.100> ever

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
isn't new because it it's rarely ever

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.350 
isn't new because it it's rarely ever
used<00:03:42.760> so<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.570> still<00:03:44.110> looks<00:03:44.140> like<00:03:44.560> new<00:03:45.150> this<00:03:46.150> is

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
used so it still looks like new this is

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.040 
used so it still looks like new this is
new

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:58.890 

yeah<00:03:53.050> that's<00:03:53.500> new<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:56.230> yeah<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.900> unique

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
yeah that's new and so yeah the unique

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.190 
yeah that's new and so yeah the unique
thing<00:03:59.200> about<00:03:59.230> this<00:04:00.090> bike<00:04:01.090> is<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.930> ice

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
thing about this bike is the ice

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.490 
thing about this bike is the ice
elastics<00:04:03.010> that's<00:04:03.370> that's<00:04:04.120> what<00:04:04.360> makes<00:04:04.630> the
