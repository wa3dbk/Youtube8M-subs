00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.690
 Finnish coffee stains developers 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.730
 studios could not resist and let 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.279
 and with some universal lag 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.380

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.150
 business on pc and mobile platforms 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.369
 running android it is clear that 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.430
 opportunities about mobile games are far from 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.920
 such as u traditional pc version not 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.190
 then the graphics dimmer is smaller however from 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.930
 this game does not get duller 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.090
 begins our cases of dug graves 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.399
 jump out of the open 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.890
 the coffin and immediately faced with the harsh 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.350
 reality happening everywhere sheer 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.809
 bacchanalia live people coexist 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.360
 completely survivors of gum zombies 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.489
 that only one can understand 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.579
 from our favorite goat leave only 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.250
 horns and legs goat is not a fool 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.409
 knows how to kick and kick from what a zombie 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.510
 will fly apart but not 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.520
 die to finish off 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.460
 zombie will need to add him 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.500
 hooves or horns several times a 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.880
 Overall this is a traditional crazy 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.650
 survival simulator 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.570
 to somehow brighten up not quite 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.040
 varied pastime 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.350
 developers will periodically 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.229
 send the goat boxes of humanitarian 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.119
 using them you need to break and lick 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.400
 language is what is in them 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.470
 it can be as simple boost 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.680
 health apples such items 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.560
 necessary to create weapons and maybe 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.270
 be by the way and the weapon itself for starters 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.220
 five devices will be available for the goat 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.560
 which he can craft 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.229
 independently for example you can build 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.180
 colander with antenna and light bulb which 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.790
 worn on the head and allows the goat 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.670
 take control of the zombie dull mind 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.829
 but some weapons can not be created and his 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.320
 only need to find yourself 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.130
 but without a weapon the goat can for himself 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.540
 stand 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.490
 well, so as not to lose the point 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.590
 what is happening on the right of the screen will 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.399
 show current assignment icons 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.530
 which main character will need to choose 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.540
 as tasks are completed, the system will 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.910
 scroll inside the game calendar 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.040
 adding new quests to the game of new zombies 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.470
 and will also unlock a few 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.680
 new can be said unique goats a 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.510
 still our main character can pretend 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.790
 dead under it in Vienna set aside 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.040
 a separate button which is quite 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.230
 useful in high-risk situations 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.390
 who is sure to knock with the main 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.880
 the hero of his adventure before 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.220
 sitting in one place will not work for 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.200
 Goat's health is not iron but to 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.840
 he needs to replenish his vital resources 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.910
 constantly something that is, however, if 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.069
 do not want to goat 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.280
 you can switch the game to normal mode 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.880
 in general, quite fun it is a long time for you 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.880
 hardly enough
