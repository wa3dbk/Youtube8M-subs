 discover new ways 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.590
 lending rates 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.079
 Experience stories 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:20.880
 be on the move 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.519
 be outside 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.519
 enjoy the nature 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.599
 breathe 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.230
 the tension and relaxation for a contradiction holds 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.460
 who does not own anything from this game 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.590
 a game 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.950
 which has been recorded all over the world by the modern treasure hunt 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.510
 It is about looking for and finding 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.200
 a so-called cash flow 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.260
 that is a treasure webinars can be hidden everywhere 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.850
 with a win the receiver as the players in the markets 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.850
 invest 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.400
 that's sending her kid 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.880
 but how does the city get there? 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.880
 because it is found 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.900
 Next, prepare the treasure to need a waterproof container 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.190
 which, depending on the climate, it must be frost, we have it from the outside clearly 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.200
 labeled so everyone sees right away that they are geo-caching and 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.650
 not about oil 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.670
 and what belongs in it 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.670
 in a bag the logbook understood a pencil and a tip 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.990
 in a second bag midi-tower rose stalls 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.990
 These must be free of children 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.800
 by no means include contraceptives 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.910
 Drugs or alcohol in a cache 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.910
 also food is unsuitable 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.590
 instead, no toys or similar trinkets are suitable 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.990
 the finder that they take out and trade for equivalent things 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.669
 we put in a motto Cash 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.779
 the name Spielparadies is program 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:16.529
 it may only be exchanged for game pieces, cards, help or the like 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:17.849
 and otherwise 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.420
 For casual finders, we maintain a letter 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.520
 to explain 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.219
 the geo-caching works 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.719
 and should it once moisture have come into the can this 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.029
 Silicate Bakken for remedy 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:32.029
 Oh and 40 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.269
 then hunt for a hiding place 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:43.229
 hol 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.749
 the states stays at home 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.089
 the first rule for hiding search 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:49.949
 bury the snow 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:53.839
 in places where many people are staying Dittmann is watching 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:58.189
 Many models are called the non cash EBIT then driven fast 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:02:59.739
 or feel disturbed 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.939
 that is not natural to avoid 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.469
 What else do I need to keep in mind 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:06.029
 important is 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:09.029
 You have to be able to reach him without breaking the law 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:14.419
 School and military property must always be excluded 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.669
 if the property is private property Wyss with the owners permission questions 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.149
 The hiding place is best in a place where you like to go 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.970
 Many Geo Kerscher wanted to find not only a treasure 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.589
 but also discover places 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:31.019
 they would never have seen otherwise 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.639
 Tablecloths who have a cache in a landscaped nature reserve 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.719
 you leave his corresponding regulations 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:41.479
 It is always a good start to stay close to and because of that 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.399
 To take consideration of nature 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:45.059
 that means, for example 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:47.179
 the birds do not disturb the brood 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:50.499
 Do not crush plants or leave garbage 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:53.199
 In addition, many become the animal shows 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.359
 not the only ones coming here in the future 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.349
 spot must find a hiding place 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.319
 that is not easy to see 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.879
 Nobody should find our sweetheart by chance 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.450
 But nobody should stay on the wrong track and be frustrated without 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.239
 Ahausen have to go 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.779
 as soon as we have decided on a hiding place it is the jeep 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:14.029
 it's either the exact coordinates 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:18.209
 the coordinates are recorded on the court later in the logbook and for us 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.209
 to publish bottlenecks on the Internet 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.289
 Now we hide our cash 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.479
 the heavy ones possibly with a stone 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.479
 or Tonny with branches and leaves 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.449
 how were the coordinates? 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:49.559
 important 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:51.569
 the wear and the website 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:54.130
 www point geo-caching Funcom 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.130
 and on the search 40 going 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.220
 Our cash can be the target of every treasure hunter who goes out and himself 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.180
 on the way 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.210
 the world new 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.210
 to discover 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.349
 4 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:56.090
 because
