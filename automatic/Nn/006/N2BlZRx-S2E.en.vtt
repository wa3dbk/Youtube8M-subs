looking new mechtogan that no one has

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.270 
looking new mechtogan that no one has
ever<00:02:27.930> seen<00:02:28.110> instead<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.560> saying<00:02:28.740> play<00:02:29.040> free

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
ever seen instead of saying play free

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.530

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.700 
online so I'm thinking they're going to
take<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.810> wheels<00:02:31.020> off<00:02:31.140> about<00:02:31.410> these<00:02:31.590> on

take the wheels off about these on

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.860 
take the wheels off about these on
dimensions<00:02:32.130> I'll<00:02:32.700> actually<00:02:32.910> be<00:02:33.210> back<00:02:33.480> because

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
dimensions I'll actually be back because

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.540 
dimensions I'll actually be back because
I<00:02:34.050> have<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.470> get<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> little<00:02:35.070> proof<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.490> I

five<00:04:14.140> back<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.680> nano<00:04:14.950> boards<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:16.690> air<00:04:16.780> can't

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
five back to nano boards the air can't

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.870 
five back to nano boards the air can't
count<00:04:17.169> one<00:04:17.620> two<00:04:18.330> three<00:04:19.330> and<00:04:20.260> four<00:04:20.440> or<00:04:20.590> five<00:04:20.880> so

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
count one two three and four or five so

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.040 
count one two three and four or five so
you<00:04:21.970> can<00:04:22.060> pick<00:04:22.210> whatever<00:04:22.390> you<00:04:22.540> really<00:04:22.690> want<00:04:22.810> on

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
you can pick whatever you really want on

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.280 
you can pick whatever you really want on
them

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
them

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.720 
them
and<00:04:23.380> what<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:23.650> find<00:04:23.890> really<00:04:24.010> cool<00:04:24.310> is<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.550> fit

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
and what I find really cool is to fit

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.560 
and what I find really cool is to fit
Zen<00:04:25.240> Thon's<00:04:25.510> blades<00:04:26.020> on<00:04:26.410> him<00:04:27.330> because<00:04:28.330> these

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
Zen Thon's blades on him because these

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.230 
Zen Thon's blades on him because these
are<00:04:28.780> also<00:04:29.080> sort<00:04:29.620> of<00:04:29.680> looked<00:04:30.370> like<00:04:30.460> bakunanos

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
are also sort of looked like bakunanos

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.090 
are also sort of looked like bakunanos
so<00:04:32.050> you<00:04:32.140> can<00:04:32.260> put<00:04:32.410> them<00:04:32.500> on<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.680> back<00:04:32.830> of<00:04:32.860> his

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
so you can put them on the back of his

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.950 
so you can put them on the back of his
wings<00:04:33.400> like<00:04:33.610> this<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.150> plus<00:04:34.300> in<00:04:34.450> sis's<00:04:34.720> event

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
wings like this and plus in sis's event

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.210 
wings like this and plus in sis's event
isn't<00:04:35.229> that<00:04:35.410> it<00:04:35.500> looks<00:04:35.650> even<00:04:35.890> better<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:36.160> it

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
isn't that it looks even better and it

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.650 
isn't that it looks even better and it
makes<00:04:36.250> titanium<00:04:36.820> Dragonoid<00:04:37.000> look<00:04:37.419> like<00:04:37.540> he's

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
makes titanium Dragonoid look like he's

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.810 
makes titanium Dragonoid look like he's
got<00:04:37.840> an<00:04:37.960> extra<00:04:38.760> set<00:04:39.760> of<00:04:39.790> wings<00:04:40.320> all<00:04:41.320> right<00:04:41.820> let

button and of course visible there it's
obviously<00:05:31.000> gave<00:05:31.300> a<00:05:31.330> lot<00:05:31.690> of<00:05:31.720> thought<00:05:31.900> into<00:05:32.110> the

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
obviously gave a lot of thought into the

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.460 
obviously gave a lot of thought into the
design<00:05:32.470> of<00:05:32.740> this<00:05:33.039> spot<00:05:33.340> agon<00:05:33.669> and<00:05:34.229> he<00:05:35.229> was<00:05:35.349> the

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
design of this spot agon and he was the

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.200 
design of this spot agon and he was the
front<00:05:35.740> view<00:05:35.860> once<00:05:36.130> more<00:05:36.430> so<00:05:36.639> yes<00:05:36.880> this<00:05:37.030> is

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
front view once more so yes this is

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.950 
front view once more so yes this is
again<00:05:37.720> very<00:05:38.699> epic<00:05:39.699> looking<00:05:40.180> titanium

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
again very epic looking titanium

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.689 
again very epic looking titanium
Dragonoid<00:05:41.199> which<00:05:41.710> I'm<00:05:41.889> hoping<00:05:42.070> I<00:05:42.310> can<00:05:42.340> pair

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
Dragonoid which I'm hoping I can pair

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.879 
Dragonoid which I'm hoping I can pair
with<00:05:42.729> something<00:05:43.300> because<00:05:43.479> of<00:05:44.050> course<00:05:44.349> I<00:05:44.650> think

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
with something because of course I think

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.689 
with something because of course I think
it's<00:05:45.690> not<00:05:46.690> confirmed<00:05:47.020> yet<00:05:47.139> but<00:05:47.440> I<00:05:47.470> think

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
it's not confirmed yet but I think

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.029 
it's not confirmed yet but I think
titanium<00:05:48.699> Dragonoid<00:05:48.849> is<00:05:49.650> going<00:05:50.650> to<00:05:50.740> be<00:05:50.860> with

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
titanium Dragonoid is going to be with

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.610 
titanium Dragonoid is going to be with
some<00:05:51.250> thon<00:05:51.599> so<00:05:52.599> yeah<00:05:52.720> this<00:05:52.900> is<00:05:52.960> titanium

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
some thon so yeah this is titanium

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.339 
some thon so yeah this is titanium
Dragonoid<00:05:53.800> adventists<00:05:54.759> very<00:05:55.539> awesome<00:05:55.990> but<00:05:56.320> I
