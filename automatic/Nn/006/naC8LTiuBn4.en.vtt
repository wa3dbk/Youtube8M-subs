00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
only a certain portion of the map now

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.290 
only a certain portion of the map now
there's<00:00:47.190> another<00:00:47.460> part<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> map<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.090> you

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
there's another part of the map that you

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.119 
there's another part of the map that you
guys<00:00:48.450> don't<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.719> access<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.980> reason

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
guys don't have access to and the reason

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.250 
guys don't have access to and the reason
for<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.910> volcano<00:00:51.420> hasn't<00:00:51.989> erupted

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
for that is the volcano hasn't erupted

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.220 
for that is the volcano hasn't erupted
so<00:00:52.890> that's<00:00:53.039> right<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.969> map<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.510> taking<00:00:55.079> place

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230

so that's right this map is taking place
in<00:00:55.530> Hawaii<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.219> any<00:00:56.699> minute<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.239> volcano<00:00:57.719> is

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
in Hawaii and any minute of volcano is

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.229 
in Hawaii and any minute of volcano is
set<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.410> erupt<00:00:58.770> now<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.699> guys<00:00:59.879> stay<00:01:00.210> on

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
as that timer starts counting down but

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.289 
as that timer starts counting down but

side of the map these two big awesome
gates<00:01:32.820> are<00:01:32.970> opening<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.630> ridiculously

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
gates are opening this is ridiculously

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.859 
gates are opening this is ridiculously
used<00:01:34.619> doors<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.310> that's<00:01:35.790> where<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.329> recommend

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
used doors and that's where I recommend

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.630 
used doors and that's where I recommend
using<00:01:36.990> snipers<00:01:37.650> from<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.860> looks<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.220> but

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
using snipers from the looks of it but

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.550 
using snipers from the looks of it but
for<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> most<00:01:39.030> part<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.630> guys<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:40.079> access

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
for the most part you guys have access

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.590 
for the most part you guys have access
to<00:01:40.710> both<00:01:40.860> parts<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.909> said<00:01:41.970> if<00:01:42.360> you

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
to both parts but like I said if you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.719 
to both parts but like I said if you
guys<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.930> say<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.500> side<00:01:43.770> you're<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.579> to

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
guys to say on this side you're going to

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.850 
guys to say on this side you're going to
die<00:01:44.909> after<00:01:45.240> about<00:01:45.450> 30<00:01:45.750> seconds<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.560> doors

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
die after about 30 seconds the doors

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.649 
die after about 30 seconds the doors
will<00:01:47.130> close<00:01:47.159> back<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.270> guys<00:01:48.450> are

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
will close back up and you guys are

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.969 
will close back up and you guys are
stuck<00:01:48.899> over<00:01:49.170> there<00:01:49.200> simply<00:01:49.560> because<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
stuck over there simply because the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.010 
stuck over there simply because the
debris<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.280> fly-in<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.299> those<00:01:51.479> gates<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:51.930> gonna

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
debris a fly-in so those gates are gonna

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.990 
debris a fly-in so those gates are gonna
close<00:01:52.290> back<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:53.130> go<00:01:53.280> ahead<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.610> prevent

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
close back up to go ahead and prevent

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.310 
close back up to go ahead and prevent
everything<00:01:54.390> else<00:01:54.659> from<00:01:54.720> getting<00:01:54.869> destroyed

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
everything else from getting destroyed

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.050 
everything else from getting destroyed
or<00:01:55.740> at<00:01:55.860> least<00:01:56.009> realistically<00:01:56.700> that's<00:01:56.850> how

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
or at least realistically that's how

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
or at least realistically that's how
we're<00:01:57.210> gonna<00:01:57.270> talk<00:01:57.570> about<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:58.009> but<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.159> I

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
we're gonna talk about it but like I

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.830 
we're gonna talk about it but like I
said<00:01:59.369> guys<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.119> looks<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.630> first

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
said guys it looks like the first

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.569 
said guys it looks like the first
portion<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> map<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.920> gonna<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.310> some

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
portion of the map is gonna be some

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.580 
portion of the map is gonna be some
machine<00:02:02.909> guns<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.329> shotguns<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.350> has<00:02:04.439> you

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
machine guns and shotguns and it has you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.260 
machine guns and shotguns and it has you
guys<00:02:04.740> convert<00:02:05.189> over<00:02:05.549> you're<00:02:05.880> gonna<00:02:05.939> be<00:02:06.119> using

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
guys convert over you're gonna be using

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.660 
guys convert over you're gonna be using
snipers<00:02:06.960> Miley<00:02:07.530> concern<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.340> looked<00:02:08.520> as<00:02:08.640> if

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
snipers Miley concern is it looked as if

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.760 
snipers Miley concern is it looked as if
there<00:02:08.910> are<00:02:09.000> only<00:02:09.119> two<00:02:09.450> entry<00:02:09.869> ways<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.500> get<00:02:10.649> to

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
there are only two entry ways to get to

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.979 
there are only two entry ways to get to
the<00:02:10.860> other<00:02:11.069> side<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.970> if<00:02:12.239> your<00:02:12.420> team<00:02:12.720> was<00:02:12.870> to

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
the other side so if your team was to

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.860 
the other side so if your team was to
get<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.260> other<00:02:13.379> side

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
get to the other side

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.539 
get to the other side
first<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.349> looks<00:02:14.620> like<00:02:14.769> you<00:02:14.890> guys<00:02:15.040> might<00:02:15.370> win

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
first it looks like you guys might win

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.820
