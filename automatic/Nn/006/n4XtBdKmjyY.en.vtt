00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
quantity and any type the reason i bring

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.470 
quantity and any type the reason i bring
up<00:00:10.950> arrow<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.370> more<00:00:11.610> than<00:00:11.759> other<00:00:11.910> items<00:00:12.330> is

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
up arrow is more than other items is

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.970 
up arrow is more than other items is
because<00:00:12.780> ours<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.230> probably<00:00:13.650> one<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
because ours is probably one of the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.310 
because ours is probably one of the
harder<00:00:14.460> ones<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.790> come<00:00:14.940> by<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.719> can't<00:00:16.020> exactly

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
you to actually get infinite arrows

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.380 
you to actually get infinite arrows
without<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.520> know<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:32.910> by<00:00:33.059> doing<00:00:33.120> the

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
you can do it while you play instead of

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.299 
you can do it while you play instead of
instead<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.690> trying<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.020> jump<00:00:40.649> around<00:00:40.770> our<00:00:41.219> way

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
instead of trying to jump around our way

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.920 
instead of trying to jump around our way
for<00:00:41.550> people<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.850> shoot<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.750> could<00:00:42.899> just

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
for people to shoot you you could just

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.110 
for people to shoot you you could just
gradually<00:00:43.410> gain<00:00:43.710> up<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.100> virus<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.760> it's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
gradually gain up on a virus and it's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.330 
gradually gain up on a virus and it's
not<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> bad<00:00:45.600> tip<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.649> generally<00:00:46.980> what<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.190> need
