00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:13.559
 a the ball today I want to make me the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.290
 game but at home 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:24.390
 teniamoci coming a wood bit which 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:31.439
 I always need my best wishes this other 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:35.600
 I do n't like this other estimate than if not 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.519
 I don't find another tour I drop next 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.960
 all the kids are the killers in Baku 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:41.400
 This video will show you how it is 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.970
 build the trap you just have 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.120
 seen 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.879
 but this trap is based on 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.100
 the inverter back even if I already have it 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.750
 explained in one of my tutorials 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.909
 about the arrest I leave the link in 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.449
 value descriptions I will explain has 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:01:01.500
 practically if we have the things we have 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.400
 we have a torch of a line one 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.670
 any block at the same time 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.920
 we can create a rest inverter 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.020
 that is, we can make the signal arrive 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.460
 turned on and the other side turned off 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.439
 so we put the rest still 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:22.679
 for example let's put a positive block 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.329
 block except the glass on this thing 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.939
 I always explained it in my tutorials 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.799
 just a shower and here on the other side 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.399
 the rest then you can see that 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.710
 here it is turned on and then turned off but if we 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.049
 here we turn on what happens that the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.490
 so this flow is reversed 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.130
 turns on and turns off 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.530
 consequently this one is off 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.149
 assuming also that if you don't call him 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.079
 precisely this release the torch yes 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.069
 breaks we can create a mechanism 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:56.329
 point that when we destroy 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:02:00.030
 the tree explodes just the year 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:02.159
 we must find a tree type of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.579
 what I did I experience this here 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.579
 that's fine 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.830
 we have to dig here behind it 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.610
 climb over here two points here and then 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.430
 we have to put in the area there is water 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.760
 therefore, there are not in the most part 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:31.750
 we struggle 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:31.750
 Yes No 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.140
 that's when I complain, I'm down here 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.790
 in the cube below is the torch and then 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.760
 then we have to run away two more 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:49.840
 Public get another time 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.840
 now there remain now ships in this 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:03:00.560
 there is a brief 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:06.080
 no no it's ok then here we put the 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.670
 torcia here is how you see it goes out and here 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.190
 here we can put ourselves directly 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.340
 United States 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:26.180
 now let's make some planets slip 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:31.150
 what is it but that stuff outdoors and there 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:36.380
 but do we place carefully because 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:45.500
 I did it because I did a lot of 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:48.860
 perfect times we exaggerate but not here 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.020
 because I am the perfect school there 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.150
 trap is practically over then 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:59.770
 now we were the theme to deploy a little 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:08.480
 let's see what we're here with 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:10.610
 perfect now the poor miner who a 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.620
 poor miner who may be exposed to 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.480
 this which you can use but which for 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.140
 make a joke to your friends at 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:23.630
 poor miner here begins to 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:26.570
 destroy the blocks but we put it 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:33.740
 put destroys the blocks because i don't 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:35.510
 has put in survive anyway e 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.740
 however he would not have the time to 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:42.470
 escape this concept can be 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:46.280
 also used maybe with stone with 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.620
 example with a stone wall and that 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:58.139
 when he breaks the block he destroys himself 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:05:00.669
 this strange who knows he is digging 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:04.080
 but here I do this now maybe 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.080
 you do it in a cave that is better 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:18.520
 here is this mineral here aside 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.080
 of a fashion so you do n't know all the 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.160
 day to ask you what they are talking about 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.560
 cavani mind 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.380
 let's say he breaks this here 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.130
 we want everything to break out but there 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.669
 let's get to work here later 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.669
 Devil 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:54.389
 then we put ourselves then then it remains 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:54.389
 here then a block here a torch here 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:04.780
 pass like this is the same or you do so or 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:08.880
 or you do so I think it is the same 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.880
 to the same thing and then so put it 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:14.099
 tnt abounded so i don't know 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:35.780
 oh well then our poor miner 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:39.919
 I do not remember if right here here you go 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.810
 well you don't have time to guys with 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:43.160
 this video is all we see in 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.430
 next tutorial 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.430
 Hello
