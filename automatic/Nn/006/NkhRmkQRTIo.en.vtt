00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.209 
at the end and a plug at this end that
I'm<00:00:27.119> going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> clamp<00:00:30.380> so<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.410> don't<00:00:31.710> know<00:00:31.800> this

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
I'm going to clamp so I don't know this

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.930 
I'm going to clamp so I don't know this
is<00:00:32.399> maybe<00:00:32.610> five<00:00:33.000> feet<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.690> exhaust<00:00:34.440> hose<00:00:34.940> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
is maybe five feet of exhaust hose and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.479 
is maybe five feet of exhaust hose and
it<00:00:36.840> fits<00:00:37.110> around<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.500> my<00:00:37.649> stuffing<00:00:38.280> nut

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
it fits around on my stuffing nut

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:49.010 
it fits around on my stuffing nut
perfectly<00:00:43.309> so<00:00:47.329> I'm<00:00:48.329> also<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.809> use<00:00:48.989> a

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
perfectly so I'm also going to use a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.930 
perfectly so I'm also going to use a
wooden<00:00:49.320> plug<00:00:54.980> basically<00:00:55.980> can't<00:00:56.730> wear<00:00:56.910> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
wooden plug basically can't wear a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:08.990 
wooden plug basically can't wear a
wooden<00:00:57.329> plug<00:00:59.390> right<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.780> goes<00:01:07.880> here<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
wooden plug right here goes here the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.600 
wooden plug right here goes here the
bilge<00:01:09.210> pump<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:09.979> not<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> lot<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.189> water<00:01:16.610> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
bilge pump going not a lot of water the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:35.860 
bilge pump going not a lot of water the
books<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.540> water

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.740 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:56.980 

starter

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:11.619 

give<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> little<00:01:58.380> tap

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.509 

so<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.810> exhaust<00:02:13.050> hose<00:02:13.349> fits<00:02:13.709> over<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.069> plug

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
so the exhaust hose fits over that plug

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:29.630 
so the exhaust hose fits over that plug
as<00:02:14.730> well<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.099> fits<00:02:29.310> over<00:02:29.459> that

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
as well and and it fits over that

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.559 
as well and and it fits over that
stuffing<00:02:30.330> nothing<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:32.190> all<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.090> got<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.299> do<00:02:33.420> is

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
stuffing nothing so all I got to do is

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:41.720 
stuffing nothing so all I got to do is
tighten<00:02:33.989> down<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.200> clamp<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:40.980> think<00:02:41.250> with

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
tighten down that clamp and I think with

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.940 
tighten down that clamp and I think with
the<00:02:41.849> hose<00:02:42.030> above<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.480> water<00:02:42.720> line<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.290> don't

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
the hose above the water line I don't

00:02:43.950 --> 00:03:03.349 
the hose above the water line I don't
have<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.280> worry<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:59.310> that's<00:03:00.110> pretty<00:03:01.110> much<00:03:01.200> it
