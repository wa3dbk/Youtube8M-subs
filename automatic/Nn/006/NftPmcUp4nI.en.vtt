00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the second row pattern and this is the

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
row you just keep repeating these two

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.730 
row you just keep repeating these two
rows<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.360> first<00:02:06.600> you're<00:02:07.079> just<00:02:07.110> gonna<00:02:07.350> knit

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740

you'll<00:02:11.450> see<00:02:11.660> here<00:02:12.050> I<00:02:12.170> changed<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:12.860> pattern<00:02:13.220> so

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
you'll see here I changed the pattern so

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.960 
you'll see here I changed the pattern so
that<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.090> would<00:02:14.209> be<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.360> little<00:02:14.600> bit<00:02:14.720> more<00:02:14.840> lacy

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
that it would be a little bit more lacy

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.180 
that it would be a little bit more lacy
in<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.660> pattern<00:02:18.080> written<00:02:18.590> link<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.130> the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
in the pattern written link in the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.520 
in the pattern written link in the
description<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:20.240> says<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.959> knit<00:02:21.260> through<00:02:21.470> the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
description it says to knit through the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.559 
description it says to knit through the
front<00:02:21.770> and<00:02:21.830> back<00:02:22.010> loop<00:02:22.459> on<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.120> next<00:02:23.390> steps

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
front and back loop on the next steps

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.460 
front and back loop on the next steps
but<00:02:24.110> instead<00:02:24.500> I'm<00:02:24.830> just<00:02:25.100> going<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.370> yarn<00:02:25.700> over

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
but instead I'm just going to yarn over

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.500 
but instead I'm just going to yarn over
and<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.950> makes<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.760> fabric<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:29.300> little

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
and that it makes the fabric a little

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.590 
and that it makes the fabric a little
bit<00:02:29.750> wider<00:02:29.959> too<00:02:30.290> which<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.709> good<00:02:30.830> for<00:02:31.040> me<00:02:31.600> then

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
bit wider too which is good for me then

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:41.590 
bit wider too which is good for me then
you're<00:02:32.750> going<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:32.959> knit<00:02:33.170> four<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:41.480> then

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
you're going to knit four and then

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.290 
you're going to knit four and then
you're<00:02:41.690> gonna<00:02:41.810> SSK<00:02:42.590> let<00:02:43.489> just<00:02:43.790> slip<00:02:44.030> slip<00:02:44.239> knit

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
you're gonna SSK let just slip slip knit

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.199 
you're gonna SSK let just slip slip knit
so<00:02:44.690> you're<00:02:44.810> gonna<00:02:44.930> slip<00:02:45.380> two<00:02:46.280> stitches<00:02:46.310> as<00:02:47.000> if

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
so you're gonna slip two stitches as if

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.640 
so you're gonna slip two stitches as if
to<00:02:47.390> knit<00:02:47.650> come<00:02:48.650> back<00:02:49.010> at<00:02:49.280> them<00:02:49.580> with<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:51.290> left

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
to knit come back at them with the left

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.270 
to knit come back at them with the left
needle<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.420> then<00:02:53.709> like<00:02:54.709> you're<00:02:54.860> knitting<00:02:55.040> two

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
needle and then like you're knitting two

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.509 
needle and then like you're knitting two
together<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:56.170> then<00:02:57.170> you're<00:02:57.530> gonna<00:02:57.650> knit<00:02:58.280> two

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
together and then you're gonna knit two

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.210 
together and then you're gonna knit two
together<00:02:59.260> and<00:03:00.260> here<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.530> always<00:03:00.800> find<00:03:01.010> that<00:03:01.160> I

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
together and here I always find that I

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.850 
together and here I always find that I
have<00:03:01.519> gaps<00:03:02.510> between<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.019> stitches<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:03.650> try

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
have gaps between the stitches so try

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.150 
have gaps between the stitches so try
and<00:03:04.010> make<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:05.290> tight<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.530> little<00:03:06.709> bit<00:03:06.920> tighter

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
and make that tight a little bit tighter

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.190 
and make that tight a little bit tighter
and<00:03:12.880> yeah

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
and yeah

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.449 
and yeah
then<00:03:15.200> you're<00:03:15.320> gonna<00:03:15.440> knit<00:03:15.680> four<00:03:17.560> three<00:03:18.560> and

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.020 

four<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.860> now<00:03:25.040> again<00:03:25.190> in<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.610> pattern<00:03:25.970> that

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030

says<00:03:26.269> just<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.720> knit<00:03:26.900> through<00:03:27.049> the<00:03:27.079> front<00:03:27.440> and

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
says just to knit through the front and

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.949 
says just to knit through the front and
back<00:03:27.680> loops<00:03:27.980> on<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.280> next<00:03:28.579> two<00:03:28.730> stitches<00:03:28.959> but

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
back loops on the next two stitches but

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.890 
back loops on the next two stitches but
instead<00:03:30.350> I'm<00:03:30.799> gonna<00:03:30.950> have<00:03:31.130> yarn<00:03:31.400> overs

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
instead I'm gonna have yarn overs

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.090 
instead I'm gonna have yarn overs
outside<00:03:32.900> of<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.170> next<00:03:33.440> two<00:03:33.620> so<00:03:33.829> I'm<00:03:33.920> going<00:03:34.070> to
