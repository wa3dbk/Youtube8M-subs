wizards and today I'm going to teach you
how<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.480> do<00:00:09.690> some<00:00:09.870> cool<00:00:10.280> experiments<00:00:11.309> now<00:00:17.690> in

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
how to do some cool experiments now in

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.450 
how to do some cool experiments now in
this<00:00:18.869> video<00:00:19.050> I'm<00:00:19.260> going<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.980> show<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.189> how<00:00:20.400> to

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
this video I'm going to show you how to

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.250 
this video I'm going to show you how to
make<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.850> potato<00:00:21.240> battery<00:00:23.390> for<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:25.109> will

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
make a potato battery for this you will

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.800 
make a potato battery for this you will
need<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.910> wire<00:00:27.230> some<00:00:28.230> potatoes<00:00:29.300> some<00:00:30.300> zinc

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
need a wire some potatoes some zinc

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.209 
need a wire some potatoes some zinc
nails<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.009> some<00:00:32.820> copper<00:00:33.420> nails<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.950> have

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
nails and some copper nails and I have

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.610 
nails and some copper nails and I have
here<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.640> voltmeter<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.930> test<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.469> it's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
here a voltmeter so I can test that it's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.340 
here a voltmeter so I can test that it's
generating<00:00:38.250> electricity<00:00:38.780> but<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.930> could<00:00:40.170> buy

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
generating electricity but you could buy

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.310 
generating electricity but you could buy
a<00:00:40.680> low<00:00:41.250> voltage<00:00:41.489> LED<00:00:41.850> light<00:00:42.390> or<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> small<00:00:43.110> light

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
a low voltage LED light or a small light

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.350 
a low voltage LED light or a small light
bulb<00:00:43.530> from<00:00:43.829> any<00:00:44.070> hardware<00:00:44.460> shop<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.030> make<00:00:45.180> sure

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
bulb from any hardware shop to make sure

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.540 
bulb from any hardware shop to make sure
that<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.660> working<00:00:45.809> right<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:47.190> need<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.430> begin

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
that it's working right we need to begin

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.900 
that it's working right we need to begin
by<00:00:47.730> putting<00:00:48.090> our<00:00:48.329> nails<00:00:48.600> into<00:00:49.020> our<00:00:49.320> potato<00:00:49.910> so

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
by putting our nails into our potato so

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.600 
by putting our nails into our potato so
you<00:00:51.000> need<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.239> put<00:00:51.420> one<00:00:51.840> zinc<00:00:52.649> nail<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.590> one

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
you need to put one zinc nail in and one

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.599 
you need to put one zinc nail in and one
copper<00:00:56.610> nailing<00:00:57.170> now<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.890> check<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.460> it's

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
copper nailing now to check that it's

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.290 
copper nailing now to check that it's
generating<00:01:00.180> power<00:01:00.420> I'm<00:01:00.980> going<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.190> put<00:01:02.430> my

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
generating power I'm going to put my

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.970 
generating power I'm going to put my
voltmeter<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:04.019> it

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.330 

now<00:01:07.610> you<00:01:07.850> see<00:01:08.090> it's<00:01:08.600> generating<00:01:09.200> power<00:01:09.410> now<00:01:10.160> if

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
now you see it's generating power now if

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.550 
now you see it's generating power now if
we<00:01:10.550> wanted<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.880> generate<00:01:11.060> more<00:01:11.600> power<00:01:11.870> we

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
we wanted to generate more power we

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.140 
we wanted to generate more power we
could<00:01:12.740> add<00:01:12.920> another<00:01:13.250> potato<00:01:13.990> so<00:01:14.990> once<00:01:15.530> again

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
could add another potato so once again

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.550 
could add another potato so once again
you<00:01:17.150> put<00:01:17.360> zinc<00:01:18.110> nail<00:01:18.620> in<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.780> a<00:01:20.780> copper<00:01:21.230> nail

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
you put zinc nail in and a copper nail

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.630 
you put zinc nail in and a copper nail
in<00:01:22.090> now<00:01:23.090> using<00:01:23.570> our<00:01:23.780> wire<00:01:24.080> now<00:01:24.770> why<00:01:24.980> my<00:01:25.400> wire

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
in now using our wire now why my wire

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.480 
in now using our wire now why my wire
has<00:01:25.940> got<00:01:26.260> crocodile<00:01:27.260> clips<00:01:27.530> but<00:01:28.070> you<00:01:28.160> can<00:01:28.370> use

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
has got crocodile clips but you can use

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.220 
has got crocodile clips but you can use
any<00:01:28.730> wire<00:01:28.940> and<00:01:29.150> just<00:01:29.210> wrap<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.720> ends<00:01:30.080> around

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
any wire and just wrap the ends around

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.100 
any wire and just wrap the ends around
the<00:01:30.710> nails<00:01:30.920> now<00:01:31.760> what's<00:01:32.240> very<00:01:32.360> important<00:01:32.990> is

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
the nails now what's very important is

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.490 
the nails now what's very important is
you<00:01:33.320> need<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.500> connect<00:01:33.860> one<00:01:34.280> end<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:36.170> copper

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
you need to connect one end to a copper

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.930 
you need to connect one end to a copper
nail<00:01:36.770> which<00:01:37.760> then<00:01:38.000> goes<00:01:38.330> to<00:01:38.690> a<00:01:39.500> zinc<00:01:40.100> nail<00:01:40.960> now

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
nail which then goes to a zinc nail now

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.150 
nail which then goes to a zinc nail now
we'll<00:01:43.940> see<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:46.630> it's<00:01:47.630> generating<00:01:48.290> more

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
we'll see that it's generating more

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.330 
we'll see that it's generating more
power<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:49.840> that<00:01:50.840> is<00:01:51.170> how<00:01:51.410> you<00:01:51.470> make<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.950> potato

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
power and that is how you make a potato

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.810 
power and that is how you make a potato
battery<00:01:52.720> but<00:01:53.720> you<00:01:54.200> could<00:01:54.500> always<00:01:54.820> make

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
battery but you could always make

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.260 
battery but you could always make
batteries<00:01:56.570> out<00:01:56.810> of<00:01:57.350> any<00:01:57.830> fruit<00:01:58.490> or<00:01:58.670> veg<00:01:58.820> like<00:01:59.240> a

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
batteries out of any fruit or veg like a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.649 
batteries out of any fruit or veg like a
carrot<00:01:59.780> or<00:02:00.020> an<00:02:00.500> orange

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.719 

you
