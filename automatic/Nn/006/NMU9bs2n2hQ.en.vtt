 modest to tackle any object 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.820
 that we have in the inventory as well 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.860

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.020
 lit by will have the little green light 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.879

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.980

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.469
 wool and fixed with the left click 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.870
 of the mouse we are going to give it on him 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.820
 we click click and we go bouncing the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.410
 garbage eye care for that we're going to 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.660

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.059
 let's have a sword and play and vote 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.480
 because we are stupid do not commit that 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.170
 error 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.210
 saying this we turn to 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.340
 you know what we put in suggestion 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.600
 and we start here the care with the sky 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.700
 in creative because we get a 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.250
 plomazo that we are not going to fuck told 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.530
 this then we turn now to creative and 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.880
 adventure you know what this droplet is 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.750
 of water if we give it on by 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.909
 start raining 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.190
 obviously let's move on to be more or 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.380
 less by day or had this whole day at 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.030
 noon if you do not like how I speak 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.350
 I feel I really want to happen what 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.850
 same if we want to make at night 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.060
 that we have in the normal difficulty 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.530
 difficult easy or nothing peaceful the heart 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.330
 for the hearts we would not charge the 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.700
 hearts in this last cube that is a 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.380
 milk bucket exists milk is not cured 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.119
 with what benefits poisoning for 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.649
 discouragement whatever we have in the 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.479
 body and now we move to the part 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.250
 upper right where we see that chest 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.380
 so the basics are taken here we put a 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.000
 name and we will appear to the star 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.009
 yellow then here the favorites if 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.929
 we want some object or something that we use 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.330
 from the list of the chest so 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.659
 we add here we will have it by hand and 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.640
 obviously it is more comfortable we go to the 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.310
 of the book of fiddling to improve 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.979
 good weapons 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.959
 here we can use a atocha sword that 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:16.800
 are not the basic ones of the game and the 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.930
 enchantment and improvements we are not going to 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.120
 make an example until a fish can you 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.459
 improve select the sword we're going 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.870
 to give 100 to several things here to the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.480
 right where we have the numbers 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.370
 zeros the maximum of 125 I put 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.440
 always to not abuse too much acid 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.590
 abusing when we finish we give to 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.910
 favorites we add star or max it 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.880
 we will add food 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.100
 set 132 years days successes the rest 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.110
 100 would be a weapon for super mega touch 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.239
 to the dragon and if it does not complicate touching the 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.920
 collapses if you do not have and lose anything in 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.500
 the favorite and it will appear in the list of 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.349
 the stars the star is the weapon 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.420
 strike of 132 attack 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.340
 we move to positions here we have 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.230
 we choose the color we want this for 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.549
 manipulate and create the positions that 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.099
 we want 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.099
 here we have all the benefits the 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.769
 level of strength in this case I'm going to 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.480
 leave it at 4 worth the Romans number for 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.770
 course and the minutes that we want that 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.020
 last this 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.210
 benefits we will see then force and you 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.290
 we give more than and we will appear then the 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.380
 look options we can do these 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.860
 two strength positions very strength 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.890
 and hurry we put level 4 and also 10 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.290
 minutes the turn since we could 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.360
 face a super billet boss of the 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.650
 death 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.580
 basically more than here we give to 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.940
 machine 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.209
 here perfect there we have good benefit 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:44.500
 plus 520 percent of attack damage a 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:47.830
 past is a whole is amazed by 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.010

 easy we add the colors the quantity 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.550
 all you can put two colors 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.900
 when it explodes when the fleets I 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.060
 that silly because I basically 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.860
 I do not use them, you want 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.050

 we go down below we have a small and 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.300
 he asked him that I do not know if there is a little 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:09.159
 more or less longer than mine and as 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.169
 is installed here to download by 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.060
 important assumption the proper forge the 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.080
 version that you have download on motorcycle 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.449
 about 72 or about 710 they fall to run 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.060
 the port and then open the folder by 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.390
 course one is point minecraft folders 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.000
 and add 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:29.120
 We in question is nit and Tuma 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.850
 of course we give beyond the version 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.280
 that we want to this and in the part 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.690
 top right it seems to give all five 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.580
 seconds that you have to wait for all the 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.550
 life seems to have to have me a 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.550
 21-4 of the year 2000 that took longer with 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.530
 but do not listen to me, we hope and 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.380
 we give to jump advertising 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.900
 and will appear here of course to me never 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.030
 has downloaded a virus or anything like that 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.950
 ok but you know that yes or yes always 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.230
 we had because the network is going to 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.960
 download basically we are always 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.420
 downloading data data data and not us 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.000
 we realize that it is terrible to spend 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.490
 the antivirus that five every week 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.290
 so that we live our computer ok 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.870
 that's why I always pass the desk 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.510
 here we have it on the desk and now 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.370
 let's go to the menu we put percent afp 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.440
 data percent of all life already what 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.940
 you know we enter the point folder 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.700
 minecraft up here I have more things 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.950

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.750
 folder mod and we have mod and 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.070
 drag and paste I already have for 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.060
 Of course that is going to tell me that if 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.419
 replacement replacements 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.710
 as you see here I do not teach all the 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:36.389
 desktop screen because I have 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.450

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:40.950

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.200
 fragment that in the corners of the menu 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:46.820
