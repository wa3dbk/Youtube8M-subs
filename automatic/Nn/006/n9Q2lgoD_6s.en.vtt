of<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.350> sudden<00:01:22.619> hit<00:01:22.740> fast<00:01:22.890> forward<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.880> heard

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
of a sudden hit fast forward we we heard

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.760 
of a sudden hit fast forward we we heard
some<00:01:24.330> rumblings<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.990> didn't<00:01:25.409> really<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.740> a

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
some rumblings we didn't really have a

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.310 
some rumblings we didn't really have a
timetable<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.880> now<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.390> appears<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.200> be

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
timetable and and now it appears to be

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.490 
timetable and and now it appears to be
happening<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.880> team<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.390> really<00:01:30.840> it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
happening this is a team that really it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.899 
happening this is a team that really it
looks<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> NHL<00:01:32.280> didn't<00:01:32.520> go<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.670> bat<00:01:32.880> for

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
looks like the NHL didn't go to bat for

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.420 
looks like the NHL didn't go to bat for
like<00:01:33.329> they<00:01:33.479> did<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> Phoenix<00:01:34.140> Coyotes

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.530 
like they did with the Phoenix Coyotes
well<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.700> know<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.820> don't<00:01:35.939> think<00:01:36.119> they<00:01:36.329> had<00:01:36.450> an

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
well you know I don't think they had an

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.850 
well you know I don't think they had an
alternative<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.140> Atlanta<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.770> know

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
alternative in Atlanta that you know

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.990 
alternative in Atlanta that you know
that's<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.189> difference<00:01:38.310> they<00:01:38.640> didn't<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
that's the difference they didn't have a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.179 
that's the difference they didn't have a
government<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.380> Georgia<00:01:40.770> willing<00:01:41.100> to

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
government in in Georgia willing to

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.560 
government in in Georgia willing to
throw<00:01:41.280> money<00:01:41.579> at<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> team<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.150> keep<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.450> there

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
throw money at the team to keep it there

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.030 
throw money at the team to keep it there
for<00:01:42.600> another<00:01:42.869> year<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.380> know<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.649> think<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
for another year you know I think the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.319 
for another year you know I think the
interesting<00:01:44.310> scenario<00:01:44.970> here<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
interesting scenario here is the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.149 
interesting scenario here is the
possibility<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.259> National<00:01:47.009> Hockey

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
possibility that the National Hockey

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.770 
possibility that the National Hockey
League<00:01:47.430> might<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.700> had<00:01:47.820> two<00:01:48.060> teams<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.570> play

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
League might have had two teams in play

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.740 
League might have had two teams in play
and<00:01:49.049> only<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.500> buyer<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.159> Winnipeg<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.759> again

think there was a moment there when the

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.500 
think there was a moment there when the
NHL<00:02:15.549> might<00:02:15.700> have<00:02:15.790> been<00:02:15.879> in<00:02:15.969> a<00:02:16.090> very<00:02:16.269> awkward

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.470 
that that's the plan I can't imagine
that<00:03:02.560> anybody<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:03.639> know<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.030> league<00:03:04.209> or

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
that anybody you know that the league or

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.149 
that anybody you know that the league or
anyone<00:03:04.780> else<00:03:04.959> wants<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.260> operate<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:05.709> Atlanta

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
anyone else wants to operate in Atlanta

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.500 
anyone else wants to operate in Atlanta
next<00:03:06.400> year<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:06.639> lose<00:03:06.730> tens<00:03:07.000> of<00:03:07.150> millions<00:03:07.419> of

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
next year and lose tens of millions of

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.569 
next year and lose tens of millions of
dollars<00:03:07.810> with<00:03:07.959> a<00:03:07.989> lame-duck<00:03:08.230> franchise<00:03:08.950> so

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
dollars with a lame-duck franchise so

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:10.740 
dollars with a lame-duck franchise so
I'm<00:03:09.700> assuming<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.209> they<00:03:10.389> will<00:03:10.540> start

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
I'm assuming that they will start

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.289 
I'm assuming that they will start
playing<00:03:10.870> Winnipeg<00:03:11.379> Knicks<00:03:11.650> fall<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.639> think

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
playing Winnipeg Knicks fall and I think

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.599 
playing Winnipeg Knicks fall and I think
it's<00:03:13.419> a<00:03:13.510> reasonably<00:03:13.989> good<00:03:14.109> guess<00:03:14.919> that<00:03:15.459> the

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
it's a reasonably good guess that the

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:16.559 
it's a reasonably good guess that the
National<00:03:15.970> Hockey<00:03:16.120> League<00:03:16.299> has<00:03:16.540> been

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
National Hockey League has been

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
quite some time well clearly there's

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.599
