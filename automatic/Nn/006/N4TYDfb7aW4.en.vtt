five<00:01:18.990> listing<00:01:19.680> south<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> total<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.119> about

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
five listing south for a total of about

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.240 
five listing south for a total of about
forty<00:01:22.080> five<00:01:22.110> thousand<00:01:22.619> dollars<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.100> income

forty five thousand dollars in income

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.030 
forty five thousand dollars in income
commission<00:01:24.180> which<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.869> great<00:01:25.110> more<00:01:25.799> than<00:01:25.920> i

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
commission which is great more than i

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.710 
commission which is great more than i
ever<00:01:26.220> thought<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:28.790> guess<00:01:29.790> when<00:01:30.689> I

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
ever thought and I guess when I

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.810 
ever thought and I guess when I
calculated<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> cost<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> program<00:01:32.250> I

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
calculated the cost of the program I

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.140 
calculated the cost of the program I
ended<00:01:33.720> up<00:01:33.840> at<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> 25<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.920> 1<00:01:35.159> ratio<00:01:35.189> which<00:01:36.119> is

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
ended up at a 25 to 1 ratio which is

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.660 
ended up at a 25 to 1 ratio which is
amazing<00:01:36.840> that's<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.770> little<00:01:37.890> better<00:01:38.130> than<00:01:38.430> do

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
amazing that's a little better than do
