00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:09.120
 look here is where the articular surface 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:13.679
 for an acromia end like this 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.310
 looked as if at an angle so that 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.850
 the clavicle was above the coxoid 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:23.070
 process because 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.849
 disconnect from the beak can be seen the question of how 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.500
 clavicle go ligament 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:33.270
 giant slides for regulars 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:42.110
 so it means not and not somehow 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:50.329
 otherwise , now we see where this 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:53.480
 the joint here is this joint ligament which 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.760
 strengthen the joint capsule 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.780
 fuses with the capsule so when 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.559
 uplift to say here it is I can not but 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.280
 but see I raise my collarbone but 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.830
 that's what i was talking about bark 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.070
 as for vikulya 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:20.460
 which is actually but have to look 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:23.159
 to taste consists of two bundles from 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.670
 whom we on the outside clavicle 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.180
 today called tuberculin canoe house 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.240
 nights you a bunch should be league minton k 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:40.490
 on food and league cops eat youtube a 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:45.060
 common name bark as levi eyepiece 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:49.799
 this joint is articulation of stubble for 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:54.360
 vikulya rice show on this drug 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:58.530
 we have in our stocks same 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:03.320
 the drug of the best quality where opened 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.899
 bag and we see what's inside there 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.069
 disk that divides the cavity 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.069
 in two parts 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:18.840
 bundles that strengthen the capsules with this 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:22.330
 the joint also fuses with the capsule 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.740
 so what do they look like and so 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:31.690
 the visual picture was before my eyes 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:34.960
 look at the atlas when I showed 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.740
 I explained this clavicle end I 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.900
 he said saddle joint 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.710
 saddles are visible 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:48.700
 by function which biaxial but only 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:53.230
 there is a disk so here are three kinds 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:57.850
 movements but they are not typical 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:01.350
 in what sense can we make a move 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.350
 around and that is
