hey<00:00:00.840> guys<00:00:01.110> grotto<00:00:01.620> 1<00:00:01.829> here<00:00:02.070> so<00:00:02.570> today<00:00:03.570> we're

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hey guys grotto 1 here so today we're

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.690 
hey guys grotto 1 here so today we're
going<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.929> make<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.110> video<00:00:04.380> about<00:00:04.740> exhaust

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
going to make a video about exhaust

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.900 
going to make a video about exhaust
header<00:00:06.150> collectors<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:07.280> the<00:00:08.280> collector<00:00:08.730> is

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
header collectors and the collector is

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.680 
header collectors and the collector is
the<00:00:09.559> end<00:00:10.559> piece<00:00:10.950> on<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.550> header<00:00:11.759> which<00:00:12.090> joins

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
the end piece on the header which joins

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.990 
the end piece on the header which joins
the<00:00:12.929> four<00:00:13.139> pipes<00:00:13.410> together<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.130> we<00:00:14.759> want<00:00:14.910> to

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
the four pipes together and we want to

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.930 
the four pipes together and we want to
have<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.150> look<00:00:15.360> at<00:00:15.949> what<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.279> collector

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
have a look at what is that collector

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.150 
have a look at what is that collector
doing<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.570> just<00:00:18.900> there<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.439> join<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.949> pipes

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
doing is it just there to join the pipes

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.279 
doing is it just there to join the pipes
together<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.180> can<00:00:21.359> put<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> muffler

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
together so that you can put a muffler

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.279 
together so that you can put a muffler
on<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.519> or<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:24.029> does<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.510> have<00:00:24.539> some<00:00:24.869> science

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
on it or is does it have some science

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.679 
on it or is does it have some science
behind<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:25.980> that's<00:00:26.640> particularly<00:00:27.359> what

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
behind it and that's particularly what

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.509 
behind it and that's particularly what
I'm<00:00:27.810> interested<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.470> having<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.279> look<00:00:29.369> at

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
I'm interested in is having a look at

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.240 
I'm interested in is having a look at
the<00:00:29.609> science<00:00:30.029> behind<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.779> let's<00:00:31.560> go<00:00:31.769> have<00:00:32.189> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the science behind it so let's go have a

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.880 
the science behind it so let's go have a
look<00:00:32.460> ok<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.899> what<00:00:34.200> I'm<00:00:34.290> going<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.770> I'm

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
look ok so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.130 
look ok so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.130> simulate<00:00:35.520> what<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.300> header<00:00:36.600> does

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
going to simulate what a header does

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.160 
going to simulate what a header does
using<00:00:37.530> clear<00:00:38.129> plastic<00:00:38.610> hose<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.210> some<00:00:39.840> water

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
using clear plastic hose and some water

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.569 
using clear plastic hose and some water
you<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.559> see<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> water<00:00:41.070> level<00:00:41.160> right<00:00:41.550> in

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you can see the water level right in

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.020 
you can see the water level right in
there<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.260> some<00:00:43.260> compressed<00:00:43.680> air<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
there and some compressed air and a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.779 
there and some compressed air and a
little<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.770> little<00:00:46.770> kind<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.520> homemade

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
little a little kind of a homemade

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.850 
little a little kind of a homemade
collector<00:00:48.570> here<00:00:48.750> made<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.960> cardboard<00:00:49.440> so

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
collector here made of cardboard so

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.540 
collector here made of cardboard so
let's<00:00:50.850> uh<00:00:51.140> I'm<00:00:52.140> going<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.379> take<00:00:53.010> these<00:00:53.219> three

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
let's uh I'm going to take these three

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.700 
let's uh I'm going to take these three
pieces<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:54.300> now<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.690> I'm<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.379> fasten

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
pieces here now and I'm going to fasten

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.979 
pieces here now and I'm going to fasten
them<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> long<00:00:56.640> piece<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.059> hose<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.449> then

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
them to the long piece of hose and then

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.860 
them to the long piece of hose and then
we're<00:00:58.140> going<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.410> another<00:00:58.649> look<00:00:58.800> at<00:00:58.949> it

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
we're going to have another look at it

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.740 
we're going to have another look at it
ok<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.670> got<00:01:02.670> those<00:01:02.820> three<00:01:03.120> short<00:01:03.359> pieces

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
ok so I got those three short pieces

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.990 
ok so I got those three short pieces
attached<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.350> now<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.799> we've<00:01:05.309> got<00:01:05.489> kind<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.850> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
attached here now so we've got kind of a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.870 
attached here now so we've got kind of a
header<00:01:06.270> look<00:01:07.080> here<00:01:07.380> at<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> end<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.130> one<00:01:08.790> of

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
header look here at the end and one of

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.310 
header look here at the end and one of
them<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> long<00:01:09.450> one<00:01:09.659> with<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> water<00:01:10.080> in

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
them is the long one with the water in

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.620 
them is the long one with the water in
it<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.680> three-year<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.280> short<00:01:11.630> so

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it and the three-year just short so

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.390 
it and the three-year just short so
let's<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.770> step<00:01:14.220> one<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.490> our<00:01:14.760> testing<00:01:15.180> now<00:01:16.400> ok

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
let's do step one of our testing now ok

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.890 
let's do step one of our testing now ok
guys<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.939> know<00:01:18.060> what<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> want<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:18.720> is

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
guys that know what I want you to do is

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.020 
guys that know what I want you to do is
keep<00:01:19.080> an<00:01:19.229> eye<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.680> water<00:01:19.950> level<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:20.520> I

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
keep an eye on this water level as I

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.390 
keep an eye on this water level as I
blast<00:01:21.330> air<00:01:21.689> inside<00:01:22.560> one<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.979> these<00:01:23.100> short

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
blast air inside one of these short

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.390 
blast air inside one of these short
pieces<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.850> hose<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.990> probably<00:01:25.950> nothing<00:01:26.310> will

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
pieces of hose so probably nothing will

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.800 
pieces of hose so probably nothing will
happen<00:01:26.610> now

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
happen now

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.130 
happen now
but<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.560> only<00:01:28.710> test<00:01:29.579> one<00:01:32.869> so<00:01:33.869> there<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
but this is only test one so there is a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.130 
but this is only test one so there is a
very<00:01:34.500> slight<00:01:34.829> rise<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.790> water<00:01:35.939> level<00:01:36.119> as<00:01:37.079> I

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
very slight rise in the water level as I

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.069 
very slight rise in the water level as I
put<00:01:37.979> air<00:01:38.189> inside<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> hoses<00:01:39.900> that's

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
put air inside one of the hoses that's

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.200 
put air inside one of the hoses that's
beside<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.650> now<00:01:41.100> let's<00:01:41.369> put<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> collector<00:01:42.060> on

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
beside it now let's put the collector on

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.069 
beside it now let's put the collector on
it<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.540> let's<00:01:43.170> try<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.470> again

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
it and let's try it again

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.469 
it and let's try it again
ok<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.140> I've<00:01:47.130> got<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.549> collector<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.299> there

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
ok so I've got that collector on there

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.300 
ok so I've got that collector on there
now<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.689> little<00:01:49.079> fancy<00:01:49.590> piece<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.920> cardboard

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
now that little fancy piece of cardboard

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.130 
now that little fancy piece of cardboard
and<00:01:50.490> if<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.060> look<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.390> there<00:01:51.600> that's

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
and if you look in there that's

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.899 
and if you look in there that's
basically<00:01:52.680> what<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> header<00:01:53.250> looks<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.729> on

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
basically what a header looks like on

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.670 
basically what a header looks like on
the<00:01:54.030> inside<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.600> see<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> four<00:01:55.110> pipes<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
the inside you see the four pipes and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.459 
the inside you see the four pipes and
they're<00:01:56.280> wrapped<00:01:56.610> by<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.229> collector<00:01:58.229> and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
they're wrapped by the collector and

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.039 
they're wrapped by the collector and
joins<00:01:59.430> them<00:01:59.610> all<00:01:59.729> together<00:01:59.909> now<00:02:00.630> let's<00:02:00.869> do

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
joins them all together now let's do

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.690 
joins them all together now let's do
step<00:02:01.950> 2<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.369> our<00:02:02.460> testing<00:02:03.380> ok<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.520> now<00:02:05.520> what<00:02:05.640> I

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
step 2 of our testing ok so now what I

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.160 
step 2 of our testing ok so now what I
want<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.090> do<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.450> keep<00:02:06.719> an<00:02:06.869> eye<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
want you to do is keep an eye on the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.070 
want you to do is keep an eye on the
water<00:02:07.380> level<00:02:07.710> again<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.310> also<00:02:09.239> watch<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.899> end

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
water level again and also watch the end

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.980 
water level again and also watch the end
of<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.440> collector<00:02:10.920> and

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
of the collector and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.870 
of the collector and
see<00:02:12.080> if<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.320> see<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:12.920> water<00:02:13.130> being<00:02:13.370> drawn<00:02:13.670> at

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
see if you see that water being drawn at

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.580 
see if you see that water being drawn at
the<00:02:13.970> top<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:15.460> put<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.550> air<00:02:16.700> hose<00:02:16.910> on<00:02:17.120> there<00:02:17.360> and

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
the top so put the air hose on there and

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.480 
the top so put the air hose on there and
you<00:02:18.590> just<00:02:18.620> keep<00:02:18.860> an<00:02:19.010> eye<00:02:19.100> on<00:02:19.160> it

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
you just keep an eye on it

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.320 
you just keep an eye on it
tell<00:02:19.700> me<00:02:19.820> what<00:02:19.940> happens<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.970> there<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.300> have

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
tell me what happens so there you have

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.080 
tell me what happens so there you have
it<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:27.500> fancy<00:02:27.950> collector<00:02:28.340> actually<00:02:28.700> worked

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
it this fancy collector actually worked

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.080 
it this fancy collector actually worked
pretty<00:02:29.180> good<00:02:29.420> if<00:02:29.750> this<00:02:30.260> was<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.470> real<00:02:30.770> header

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
pretty good if this was a real header

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.180 
pretty good if this was a real header
the<00:02:32.090> same<00:02:32.300> thing<00:02:32.510> would<00:02:32.660> be<00:02:32.780> happening<00:02:33.190> each

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
the same thing would be happening each

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.130 
the same thing would be happening each
cylinder<00:02:34.700> fires<00:02:35.090> at<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> different<00:02:35.720> time<00:02:35.900> and

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
cylinder fires at a different time and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.710 
cylinder fires at a different time and
the<00:02:36.860> one<00:02:36.980> that's<00:02:37.160> ahead<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.490> it<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:37.880> entering

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
the one that's ahead of it and entering

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.720 
the one that's ahead of it and entering
the<00:02:38.810> collector<00:02:39.260> helps<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.100> scavenge<00:02:40.670> the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
the collector helps to scavenge the

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.370 
the collector helps to scavenge the
exhaust<00:02:41.180> gasses<00:02:41.720> from<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.020> one<00:02:42.170> that's

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
exhaust gasses from the one that's

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.400 
exhaust gasses from the one that's
behind<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:44.180> they<00:02:44.570> all<00:02:44.720> take<00:02:44.960> turns<00:02:45.110> so

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
behind it and and they all take turns so

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.680 
behind it and and they all take turns so
then<00:02:45.650> ultimately<00:02:46.550> you<00:02:46.760> pull<00:02:47.030> more<00:02:47.270> exhaust

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
then ultimately you pull more exhaust

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.240 
then ultimately you pull more exhaust
from<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:49.400> cylinders<00:02:50.270> allowing<00:02:50.810> more

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
from the the cylinders allowing more

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.100 
from the the cylinders allowing more
room<00:02:52.250> for<00:02:52.280> air<00:02:52.880> fuel<00:02:53.300> which<00:02:53.870> ultimately

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
room for air fuel which ultimately

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.560 
room for air fuel which ultimately
builds<00:02:54.770> more<00:02:54.920> power<00:02:55.100> so<00:02:55.430> this<00:02:55.940> is<00:02:56.120> called<00:02:56.360> the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
builds more power so this is called the

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.750 
builds more power so this is called the
this<00:02:57.320> is<00:02:57.380> called<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.650> Bernoulli<00:02:58.190> effect<00:02:58.280> I

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
this is called the Bernoulli effect I

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.430 
this is called the Bernoulli effect I
think<00:02:59.060> that's<00:02:59.240> how<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.420> say<00:02:59.690> it<00:02:59.720> it's<00:03:00.230> not<00:03:00.320> how

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
think that's how you say it it's not how

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.550 
think that's how you say it it's not how
you<00:03:00.470> say<00:03:00.710> it<00:03:00.800> oh<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:02.690> now<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:02.870> want<00:03:03.140> my<00:03:03.260> help

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
you say it oh so now you want my help

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.680 
you say it oh so now you want my help
first<00:03:03.830> you<00:03:03.980> unplug<00:03:04.310> my<00:03:04.490> guitar<00:03:04.880> just<00:03:05.510> because

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
first you unplug my guitar just because

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.020 
first you unplug my guitar just because
you're<00:03:05.840> making<00:03:05.960> a<00:03:06.140> video<00:03:06.470> now<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.030> whatever

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
you're making a video now you whatever

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.490 
you're making a video now you whatever
I'm<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:08.990> little<00:03:09.230> busy<00:03:09.350> here<00:03:10.900> man<00:03:11.900> can't<00:03:12.290> count

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
I'm a little busy here man can't count

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.740 
I'm a little busy here man can't count
on<00:03:12.560> that<00:03:12.620> guy<00:03:12.860> for<00:03:12.920> anything<00:03:13.400> your<00:03:14.360> guitar<00:03:14.660> is

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
on that guy for anything your guitar is

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.640 
on that guy for anything your guitar is
out<00:03:14.840> of<00:03:14.900> tune<00:03:15.020> by<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.380> way<00:03:16.810> so<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:17.840> was<00:03:18.260> also

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
out of tune by the way so I was also

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.320 
out of tune by the way so I was also
going<00:03:18.770> to<00:03:18.830> show<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.370> collectors<00:03:20.150> that

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
going to show you the collectors that

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.200 
going to show you the collectors that
are<00:03:20.480> on<00:03:20.600> my<00:03:20.780> race<00:03:20.960> car<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:22.010> can<00:03:22.190> see<00:03:22.400> here<00:03:22.790> that

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
are on my race car you can see here that

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.430 
are on my race car you can see here that
the<00:03:24.010> collector<00:03:25.010> there<00:03:25.870> where<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:27.140> see<00:03:27.290> where

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
the collector there where you see where

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.440 
the collector there where you see where
the<00:03:27.590> weld<00:03:27.770> is<00:03:27.980> right<00:03:28.220> here<00:03:28.460> well<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.330> actually

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
the weld is right here well it actually

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.280 
the weld is right here well it actually
gets<00:03:29.810> smaller<00:03:30.170> right<00:03:30.470> there<00:03:30.680> so<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:33.110> can

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
gets smaller right there so you can

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.740 
gets smaller right there so you can
imagine<00:03:33.680> if<00:03:33.770> a<00:03:34.220> collector<00:03:34.700> helps<00:03:35.240> to<00:03:35.480> make

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
imagine if a collector helps to make

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.170 
imagine if a collector helps to make
power<00:03:36.050> then<00:03:36.740> if<00:03:36.980> your<00:03:37.160> collector<00:03:37.880> is

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
power then if your collector is

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.840 
power then if your collector is
efficient<00:03:38.810> then<00:03:39.470> it's<00:03:39.710> going<00:03:39.860> to<00:03:39.920> make<00:03:40.550> even

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
efficient then it's going to make even

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.610 
efficient then it's going to make even
more<00:03:41.030> power<00:03:41.240> so<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.290> that's<00:03:42.410> what's

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
more power so and that's what's

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.490 
more power so and that's what's
happening<00:03:43.010> here<00:03:43.070> this<00:03:43.670> collector<00:03:44.540> it's<00:03:45.080> thin

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
happening here this collector it's thin

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.840 
happening here this collector it's thin
there<00:03:45.770> it<00:03:46.480> develops<00:03:47.480> more<00:03:47.930> air<00:03:48.170> speed<00:03:48.530> and

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
there it develops more air speed and

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.690 
there it develops more air speed and
helps<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:50.000> extract<00:03:50.450> more<00:03:51.380> from<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.070> the<00:03:52.520> ones

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
helps to extract more from the the ones

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.030 
helps to extract more from the the ones
that<00:03:52.910> haven't<00:03:53.060> fired<00:03:53.390> yet<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:53.840> I'll<00:03:54.800> show<00:03:54.980> you

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
that haven't fired yet and I'll show you

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.930 
that haven't fired yet and I'll show you
the<00:03:55.160> inside<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.640> this<00:03:55.730> collector<00:03:56.180> also<00:03:57.940> okay

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
the inside of this collector also okay

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.100 
the inside of this collector also okay
let's<00:03:59.210> have<00:03:59.330> a<00:03:59.450> look<00:03:59.630> in<00:03:59.780> there<00:04:00.340> you<00:04:01.340> can<00:04:01.490> see

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
let's have a look in there you can see

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.770 
let's have a look in there you can see
where<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.290> pipes<00:04:03.530> join<00:04:03.890> together<00:04:04.690> there's<00:04:05.690> a

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
where the pipes join together there's a

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.550 
where the pipes join together there's a
there's<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:06.800> nicely<00:04:07.750> fabricated<00:04:08.750> little<00:04:09.080> cone

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
there's a nicely fabricated little cone

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.460 
there's a nicely fabricated little cone
shape<00:04:09.890> right<00:04:10.370> there<00:04:10.610> in<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.850> middle<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.470> that

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
shape right there in the middle and that

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.630 
shape right there in the middle and that
helps<00:04:12.740> to<00:04:12.950> get<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.940> airflow<00:04:15.160> more<00:04:16.160> efficient

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
helps to get the airflow more efficient

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.820 
helps to get the airflow more efficient
faster<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:17.420> then<00:04:17.870> right<00:04:18.049> here<00:04:18.080> is<00:04:18.350> where<00:04:18.500> next

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
faster and then right here is where next

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.930 
faster and then right here is where next
down<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.459> then<00:04:20.419> exits<00:04:21.290> here<00:04:21.470> so<00:04:21.739> oh<00:04:21.950> you<00:04:22.850> know

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
down and then exits here so oh you know

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.629 
down and then exits here so oh you know
it<00:04:23.090> all<00:04:23.210> helps<00:04:23.419> every<00:04:23.810> little<00:04:24.050> bit

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
it all helps every little bit

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.270 
it all helps every little bit
