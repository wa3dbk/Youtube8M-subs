00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.860 
to the left there was such a violent
opening<00:00:38.670> because<00:00:39.120> your<00:00:39.270> BASE<00:00:39.390> jumping<00:00:39.750> it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
opening because your BASE jumping it

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.799 
opening because your BASE jumping it
canopy<00:00:40.230> opens<00:00:40.530> instantly<00:00:41.100> yeah<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:42.120> spun<00:00:42.510> her

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
canopy opens instantly yeah it spun her

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.049 
canopy opens instantly yeah it spun her
underneath<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.860> canopy<00:00:44.010> when<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.820> start

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
underneath the canopy when you start

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.520 
underneath the canopy when you start
twisting<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.809> all<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.379> is

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
twisting like that all you can do is

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.560 
twisting like that all you can do is
wait<00:00:46.800> until<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.219> stop<00:00:47.489> or<00:00:47.700> try<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.969> stop<00:00:48.300> and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
wait until you stop or try to stop and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.720 
wait until you stop or try to stop and
and<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:49.230> twists<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.620> down<00:00:49.770> my<00:00:49.920> risers<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.610> I'm

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
and it twists it down my risers and I'm

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.459 
and it twists it down my risers and I'm
looking<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.270> way<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:51.660> my<00:00:51.750> canopy<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.230> flying

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
looking this way but my canopy is flying

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.529 
looking this way but my canopy is flying
that<00:00:52.710> way<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> don't<00:00:53.910> know<00:00:54.030> which<00:00:54.210> way<00:00:54.390> I'm

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
that way but I don't know which way I'm

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.180 
that way but I don't know which way I'm
going<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.020> reach<00:00:55.260> up<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.829> go<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
going I reach up and I just go for a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.490 
going I reach up and I just go for a
rear<00:00:56.399> riser<00:00:56.640> above<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.390> twists<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.260> try<00:00:58.440> to

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
rear riser above the twists to try to

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.770 
rear riser above the twists to try to
turn<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.640> actually<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.059> front<00:01:00.300> raiser<00:01:00.510> I

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
turn it it's actually a front raiser I

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.319 
turn it it's actually a front raiser I
dive<00:01:01.050> myself<00:01:01.500> backwards<00:01:02.010> at<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.520> cliff<00:01:02.760> no

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
dive myself backwards at the cliff no

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.780 
dive myself backwards at the cliff no
turn<00:01:03.570> whatsoever<00:01:04.199> at<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.769> point<00:01:05.070> all<00:01:05.729> I

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
turn whatsoever at that point all I

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.130 
turn whatsoever at that point all I
could<00:01:06.090> think<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.810> get<00:01:06.900> out<00:01:07.020> of

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
could think is I have to get out of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.560 
could think is I have to get out of
these<00:01:07.229> twists<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.299> can

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
these twists so that I can so that I can

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.270 
these twists so that I can so that I can
at<00:01:09.780> least<00:01:09.900> control<00:01:10.170> my<00:01:10.409> your<00:01:10.650> mind<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:11.070> working

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
at least control my your mind is working

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.340 
at least control my your mind is working
your<00:01:11.820> mind<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.119> working<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.570> million<00:01:12.960> miles<00:01:13.140> a

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
your mind is working a million miles a

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.140 
your mind is working a million miles a
minute<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.010> got<00:01:14.220> out<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.549> twist<00:01:14.790> just

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
minute and I got out of the twist just

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.999 
minute and I got out of the twist just
in<00:01:15.270> time<00:01:15.479> from<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.960> distance<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.619> me<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.860> you

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
in time from the distance for me to you

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.030 
in time from the distance for me to you
to<00:01:17.220> see<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> cliff<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:19.229> at<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.590> point<00:01:19.860> there

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
to see the cliff so at that point there

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.859 
to see the cliff so at that point there
was<00:01:20.070> nothing<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.180> but<00:01:21.299> hang<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
was nothing to do but hang on for the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:36.830 
was nothing to do but hang on for the
ride

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.090 

how<00:01:37.840> much<00:01:38.020> further<00:01:38.200> did<00:01:38.530> you<00:01:38.650> have<00:01:38.770> to<00:01:38.890> fall

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
how much further did you have to fall

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.160 
how much further did you have to fall
about<00:01:39.400> another<00:01:39.640> 200<00:01:40.180> feet<00:01:40.210> probably<00:01:40.720> free

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
about another 200 feet probably free

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.110 
about another 200 feet probably free
fooled<00:01:41.500> by<00:01:41.710> this<00:01:41.770> yeah<00:01:42.160> at<00:01:42.370> that<00:01:42.430> point<00:01:42.790> it<00:01:42.970> was

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
fooled by this yeah at that point it was

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.200 
fooled by this yeah at that point it was
Tallis<00:01:43.570> so<00:01:43.870> I<00:01:43.900> would<00:01:44.230> have<00:01:44.350> III<00:01:44.830> remember<00:01:45.580> /<00:01:46.090> I

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
Tallis so I would have III remember / I

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.540 
Tallis so I would have III remember / I
could<00:01:46.390> like<00:01:46.690> paint<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.470> rock<00:01:47.680> around<00:01:48.100> me

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
could like paint the rock around me

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.890 
could like paint the rock around me
because<00:01:48.880> I<00:01:48.910> was<00:01:49.210> looking<00:01:49.510> at<00:01:49.600> every<00:01:49.870> little
