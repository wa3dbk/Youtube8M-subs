brings up these little circles see there

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.969 
brings up these little circles see there

and then what you want to be doing is

using your adjust button to select

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.929 
using your adjust button to select
between<00:01:14.610> your<00:01:14.939> brightness<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.729> see

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
between your brightness so you can see

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.179 
between your brightness so you can see
there<00:01:18.150> that's<00:01:18.360> obviously<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.840> lowest<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:20.040> it

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
there that's obviously the lowest and it

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.490 
there that's obviously the lowest and it
goes<00:01:20.369> up<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.759> stages<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:21.990> mine<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.229> its

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
goes up in stages I have mine on its

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.030 
goes up in stages I have mine on its
brightest<00:01:22.979> said<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> think<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.500> gets<00:01:25.680> more

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
brightest said so I think it gets more

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.670 
brightest said so I think it gets more
attention<00:01:26.880> if<00:01:27.600> you're<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:27.900> paying<00:01:28.259> quite<00:01:28.530> so

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
attention if you're not paying quite so

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.109 
attention if you're not paying quite so
much<00:01:28.770> attention<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.310> your<00:01:29.549> revs<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.000> you're

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
much attention to your revs and you're

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.789 
much attention to your revs and you're
looking<00:01:30.509> where<00:01:30.689> you're<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.590> going

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
looking where you're going that's going

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.450 
looking where you're going that's going
to<00:01:31.890> grab<00:01:32.070> your<00:01:32.189> attention<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.729> bit<00:01:32.880> more<00:01:34.460> so

settings you can see Hulsey here so they

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.649 
settings you can see Hulsey here so they
go<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.189> some<00:01:50.460> people's<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.820> 500<00:01:53.659> RPM

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
go up in some people's a 500 RPM

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.569 
go up in some people's a 500 RPM
increments<00:01:55.290> but<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:55.979> look<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.219> bit<00:01:56.369> more<00:01:56.520> like

250<00:01:57.420> rpm<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.890> me<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.060> max<00:02:00.270> obviously<00:02:00.509> 16<00:02:01.320> I

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
250 rpm to me so the max obviously 16 I

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.779 
250 rpm to me so the max obviously 16 I
have<00:02:03.149> mine<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:05.299> 14<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.540> half<00:02:06.570> or<00:02:07.500> 14<00:02:07.979> 750

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
have mine on 14 and a half or 14 750

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.190 
have mine on 14 and a half or 14 750
normally<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.450> press<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.810> obviously

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
normally so you press this obviously

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.450 
normally so you press this obviously
this<00:02:10.319> adjust<00:02:10.709> button<00:02:10.920> there<00:02:11.129> too

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
this adjust button there too

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.680 
this adjust button there too
put<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.240> up<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.660> have<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:13.470> like<00:02:14.130> they're<00:02:14.340> 14<00:02:14.820> 750

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
put it up I have it like they're 14 750

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.680 
put it up I have it like they're 14 750
and<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.890> think<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.910> gives<00:02:18.090> me<00:02:18.240> enough<00:02:18.420> time

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
and I think that gives me enough time

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.240 
and I think that gives me enough time
