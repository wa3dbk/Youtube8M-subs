00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
now I'm going to use bond aid to balance

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.099 
now I'm going to use bond aid to balance
the<00:00:27.900> pH<00:00:28.050> levels<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> nails<00:00:29.660> and<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.840> course

the OPI freeform and I'm applying it to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.610 
the OPI freeform and I'm applying it to
the<00:00:38.910> free<00:00:39.210> edge<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> nails<00:00:39.809> make<00:00:40.410> sure

the free edge of the nails make sure

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.069 
the free edge of the nails make sure
it's<00:00:40.800> nice<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.010> tight<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.700> finger<00:00:42.300> here
