00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
what I wanted to do just build a beetle

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.600 
what I wanted to do just build a beetle
I've<00:00:54.040> done<00:00:54.550> a<00:00:54.820> v8<00:00:55.390> cars<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:56.280> stuff<00:00:57.280> like<00:00:57.489> that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
and I just wanted something with a bit

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.310 
and I just wanted something with a bit
more<00:01:00.010> attitude<00:01:00.190> so<00:01:01.180> that's<00:01:01.780> where<00:01:01.989> I<00:01:02.020> got<00:01:02.230> the

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
more attitude so that's where I got the

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.150 
more attitude so that's where I got the
idea<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:02.800> do<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:03.580> lead-up<00:01:04.710> Zilker<00:01:05.710> came<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:06.040> me

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
idea to do the lead-up Zilker came to me

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.880 
idea to do the lead-up Zilker came to me
with<00:01:06.310> an<00:01:06.400> idea<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:06.820> a<00:01:06.910> car<00:01:07.229> that's<00:01:08.229> he's<00:01:08.650> had<00:01:08.860> a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
with an idea of a car that's he's had a

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.080 
with an idea of a car that's he's had a
vision<00:01:09.130> up<00:01:09.340> for<00:01:09.580> some<00:01:09.970> time<00:01:10.210> I<00:01:10.979> feel<00:01:11.979> a<00:01:12.369> certain

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
vision up for some time I feel a certain

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.370 
vision up for some time I feel a certain
style<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:15.190> wheels<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:16.660> size<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.170> wheels

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
style the wheels the size of the wheels

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.510 
style the wheels the size of the wheels
and<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.759> look<00:01:18.940> was<00:01:19.210> very<00:01:20.280> prominent<00:01:21.280> in<00:01:21.490> his

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
and the look was very prominent in his

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.400 
and the look was very prominent in his
head<00:01:21.820> first<00:01:22.360> when<00:01:22.600> you<00:01:22.690> start<00:01:22.780> building<00:01:23.320> the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
head first when you start building the

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.670 
head first when you start building the
car<00:01:23.590> I<00:01:23.890> realized<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:25.360> all<00:01:26.170> what<00:01:26.380> I<00:01:26.410> wanted

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
car I realized that all what I wanted

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.290 
car I realized that all what I wanted
out<00:01:26.830> of<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:26.979> car<00:01:27.190> to<00:01:27.670> do<00:01:27.850> all<00:01:28.119> the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
out of the car to do all the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.270 
out of the car to do all the
modification<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:29.320> be<00:01:29.410> done<00:01:29.619> in<00:01:29.860> a<00:01:29.920> subtle<00:01:30.250> way

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
modification to be done in a subtle way

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.850 
modification to be done in a subtle way
that<00:01:31.119> it<00:01:31.330> won't<00:01:31.450> change<00:01:31.810> for<00:01:32.140> compromise<00:01:32.619> the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
that it won't change for compromise the

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.740 
that it won't change for compromise the
original<00:01:33.220> look<00:01:33.430> of<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.610> beetle<00:01:33.940> once<00:01:34.600> I

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
original look of the beetle once I

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.210 
original look of the beetle once I
purchase<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.170> wheels<00:01:35.470> all<00:01:35.740> we<00:01:35.860> had<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.070> do

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
purchase the wheels all we had to do

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.969 
purchase the wheels all we had to do
it's<00:01:36.880> built<00:01:37.270> this<00:01:37.750> car<00:01:37.990> from<00:01:38.259> the<00:01:38.380> ground<00:01:38.649> up

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
it's built this car from the ground up

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.399 
it's built this car from the ground up
the<00:01:39.729> wheels<00:01:39.940> that<00:01:40.090> he<00:01:40.240> chose<00:01:40.540> were<00:01:40.900> a<00:01:40.930> little

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
the wheels that he chose were a little

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.570 
the wheels that he chose were a little
bit<00:01:41.560> of<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:41.710> challenge<00:01:42.070> for<00:01:42.310> Volkswagen

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
bit of a challenge for Volkswagen

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.160 
bit of a challenge for Volkswagen
because<00:01:43.210> they<00:01:43.390> weren't<00:01:43.840> meant<00:01:44.080> for

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
because they weren't meant for

because they weren't meant for
Volkswagen<00:01:44.830> that<00:01:45.040> if<00:01:45.580> there's<00:01:45.940> a<00:01:46.000> will

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
Volkswagen that if there's a will

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.649 
Volkswagen that if there's a will
there's<00:01:46.420> a<00:01:46.510> way

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.450 

the<00:01:49.110> drilling<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> stunt<00:01:49.979> pattern<00:01:50.310> was

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the drilling of the stunt pattern was

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.370 
the drilling of the stunt pattern was
the<00:01:50.490> easy<00:01:50.789> part<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.390> making<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> offset<00:01:52.259> of

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the easy part that making the offset of

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.620 
the easy part that making the offset of
the<00:01:52.439> wheel<00:01:52.649> fit<00:01:53.100> under<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> beetle<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.509> the

the wheel fit under the beetle to the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.410 
the wheel fit under the beetle to the
look<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.920> Zeljko<00:01:55.920> wanted<00:01:56.310> was<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
look that Zeljko wanted was the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.410 
look that Zeljko wanted was the
challenge<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.530> wheels<00:01:58.799> eight<00:01:59.729> inch<00:01:59.970> wide<00:02:00.240> in

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
challenge the wheels eight inch wide in

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.240 
challenge the wheels eight inch wide in
the<00:02:00.509> rear<00:02:00.659> end<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.110> we<00:02:01.229> have<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.560> actually<00:02:01.979> make

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
the rear end so we have to actually make

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.819 
the rear end so we have to actually make
the<00:02:03.149> steel<00:02:03.390> guards<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.960> suit<00:02:04.170> there's<00:02:04.500> no<00:02:04.649> way

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
the steel guards to suit there's no way

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.710
