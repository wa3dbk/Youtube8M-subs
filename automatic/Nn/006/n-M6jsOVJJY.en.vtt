when we're actually working for it
shifting<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.210> weight<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.750> stepping<00:00:16.410> forward

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
shifting the weight and stepping forward

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.910 
shifting the weight and stepping forward
backward<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.820> even<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> side<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.289> let's

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
backward and even to the side so let's

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.070 
backward and even to the side so let's
take<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.279> apart<00:00:20.640> it's<00:00:20.880> very<00:00:21.150> simple<00:00:21.660> it's

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
apart okay so we have our third line

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.630 
apart okay so we have our third line
distance<00:00:30.960> from<00:00:31.619> here<00:00:31.859> we're<00:00:32.160> gonna<00:00:32.219> work<00:00:32.489> on

the toes out and straight okay so as we

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.790 
the toes out and straight okay so as we
pivot<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:51.420> shift<00:00:51.719> our<00:00:52.020> weight<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
pivot we shift our weight to the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.250 
pivot we shift our weight to the
opposite<00:00:53.309> leg<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.329> has<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.050> pivot<00:00:55.920> out<00:00:56.160> I

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
opposite leg so has that pivot out I
