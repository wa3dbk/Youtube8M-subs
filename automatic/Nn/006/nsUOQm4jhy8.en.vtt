00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.769
 attention on Seimenta likes to sit 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.939
 just like that 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.830
 so let's not tighten 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.739
 let's see what's in that box 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.640
 as always, the design is on top 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.370
 little beauty boxes like this 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.649
 this whole thing unpacked she looked 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.809
 so usually very cool here everything is tied up 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.239
 it was ribbons all tied up all 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.090
 beautifully laid out 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.780
 from above was such a picture series 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.719
 there about spring some words further here 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.899
 It went that there are different stocks that are now 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.850
 pass together with this box 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.210
 and different sites and here actually 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.189
 the contents let's get started by 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.890
 interesting and actually we are one 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.549
 here's how you see clamped this 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.860
 box the most recent means here 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.720
 such is such good here 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.210
 present let's start from the very 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.490
 the beginning. 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.090
 the biggest tube is a company occasion 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.409
 mizon 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:34.009
 This Korean Brand Means Face Cream 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.170
 cream gel for the face is a light formula 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.659
 simple moisturizer all year round he and 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.930
 this color looks very cool so 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:47.040
 tiffany color man cream is very big 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.350
 here is 50 milliliters and I think many 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.420
 will appreciate this cream especially for the summer because 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.090
 what is gel cream texture us 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.060
 better suited for summer let's say 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.899
 so I'm looking for him not particularly tried but 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.409
 I think I'll try soon 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:08.110
 Further here, too, models 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.000
 Here is a moisturizing body lotion 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.100
 also very big so significant 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.920
 a jar of 50 milliliters I think for a long time 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.940
 enough even with all this for 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.250
 body lotion 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.819
 but still, I think for a very long time 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.860
 enough for smell now smell 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.980
 so unobtrusive in principle he 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.040
 present but he is very unobtrusive 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.890
 even a good one, I use it as always with 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.200
 these cards I'll try everything later 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.299
 these means and get off of them something 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.280
 I'm really interested in you about 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.549
 This will tell in some separate video 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.290
 or favorites in some kind of a 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.110
 also refused 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.459
 here is such a micellar water for 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.360
 makeup remover 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.160
 not a big tube 30 milliliters very 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.170
 convenient I think it will take me to 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.290
 the journey so most likely I have it 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.209
 leave for some case when you need 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.810
 will put together some kind of cycles 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:11.739
 miniatures here too 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.400
 shower oil from l'oxitan very me 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.060
 interested in this particular almond oil 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.609
 For shower 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.040
 In general, the whole theory of oil for me 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.320
 very much like it is because it 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.890
 must be moisturizing so at night 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.850
 it smells good and he just smells 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.280
 amazing have not tried but 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.140
 I will definitely try to tell you how 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.700
 I liked her and I did not like 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.250
 honestly thought to order full 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.060
 the size of yourself such an oil because 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.620
 a lot of him who praised and not in the very 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.930
 it was just interesting to see 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.019
 how good it is but generally 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.450
 I'll try to tell you the last one too 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:53.620
 what is there here is such a balm 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.420
 lip under ios very famous testicle 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.090
 which is promoted just like on 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.680
 American youtube and on our already 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.230
 starting 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.620
 I have to spin it for sure 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.420
 same I used it in 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.140
 principle for me it is not enough 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.299
 moisturizing this lip balm he 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.510
 not enough moisturizing 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.930
 which are more such some oily 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.970
 probably which feed my lips better 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.770
 so maybe it let me play 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.340
 in some kind of giveaway maybe even 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.919

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.919
 noticed that in all the boxes the referee and 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.740
 not very much filling but in principle 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.410
 they cooperate with such pretty 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.320
 no budget don't say so marks 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.949
