one shot counter still at zero one thing
my<00:01:47.280> somewhat<00:01:48.240> theory<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.290> um<00:01:49.890> I

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
my somewhat theory on this is that um I

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.109 
my somewhat theory on this is that um I
don't<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.810> shot<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.460> gotta<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.939> your

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
don't have the shot you gotta have your

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.090 
don't have the shot you gotta have your
own<00:01:54.270> shooting<00:01:54.720> based<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.409> real<00:01:55.740> shooting

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
own shooting based on real shooting

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.100 
own shooting based on real shooting
percentages<00:01:56.670> or<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.479> timing<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.049> your

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
percentages or the timing of your

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.109 
percentages or the timing of your
