00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
because if I later decided oh I want to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.860 
because if I later decided oh I want to
reapply<00:03:28.830> some<00:03:29.370> makeup<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.720> 10

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
reapply some makeup this is the 10

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.350 
reapply some makeup this is the 10
mascara<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.440> could<00:03:31.590> probably<00:03:31.830> reapply<00:03:32.820> but<00:03:33.330> I

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
mascara you could probably reapply but I

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.960 
mascara you could probably reapply but I
think<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:33.780> very<00:03:34.080> lengthening<00:03:34.920> of<00:03:35.640> my

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
think it is very lengthening of my
