00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:07.480 

yeah<00:00:06.229> I<00:00:06.259> thought<00:00:06.470> the<00:00:06.589> city<00:00:06.919> intensity<00:00:07.339> was

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
yeah I thought the city intensity was

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.310 
yeah I thought the city intensity was
was<00:00:07.999> quite<00:00:08.240> high<00:00:08.420> in<00:00:08.540> the<00:00:08.630> quarter-final<00:00:09.200> so

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
was quite high in the quarter-final so

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.690 
was quite high in the quarter-final so
I'm<00:00:09.410> expecting<00:00:09.679> it<00:00:09.920> to<00:00:10.009> be<00:00:10.040> the<00:00:10.219> same<00:00:10.400> if<00:00:10.580> not

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
I'm expecting it to be the same if not

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.030 
I'm expecting it to be the same if not
higher<00:00:11.000> again<00:00:11.330> in<00:00:11.450> the<00:00:11.540> semi-final<00:00:12.139> and<00:00:12.259> I'm

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
higher again in the semi-final and I'm

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.739

up against them a hell of a lot the last

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.310 
up against them a hell of a lot the last
12<00:00:22.310> a<00:00:22.400> 10<00:00:22.580> months<00:00:22.850> and<00:00:23.030> I<00:00:23.240> think<00:00:23.750> now<00:00:23.870> you've

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
12 a 10 months and I think now you've

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.570 
12 a 10 months and I think now you've
seen<00:00:24.530> that<00:00:24.560> I've<00:00:24.740> spent<00:00:24.920> a<00:00:25.010> fabulous<00:00:25.310> time<00:00:25.460> in

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
seen that I've spent a fabulous time in

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.130 
seen that I've spent a fabulous time in
the<00:00:25.640> country<00:00:25.970> so<00:00:26.150> they've<00:00:26.300> adapted<00:00:26.750> well<00:00:27.080> to

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
the country so they've adapted well to

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.410 
the country so they've adapted well to
the<00:00:27.260> conditions<00:00:27.680> and<00:00:27.940> it's<00:00:28.940> no<00:00:29.030> surprise<00:00:29.180> that

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
the conditions and it's no surprise that

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.240 
the conditions and it's no surprise that
they're<00:00:29.930> up<00:00:30.140> against<00:00:30.440> us<00:00:30.500> in<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:30.620> semi-final

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
they're up against us in the semi-final

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.630 
they're up against us in the semi-final
I<00:00:31.280> think<00:00:31.460> they're<00:00:31.610> a<00:00:31.820> very<00:00:31.910> strong<00:00:32.650> team<00:00:33.650> and<00:00:34.550> I

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
I think they're a very strong team and I

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.710 
I think they're a very strong team and I
think<00:00:34.670> we<00:00:34.850> are<00:00:34.940> as<00:00:35.120> well<00:00:35.270> so<00:00:35.450> it's<00:00:35.570> kind<00:00:35.600> of

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
think we are as well so it's kind of

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.580 
think we are as well so it's kind of
like<00:00:35.840> I<00:00:35.960> said<00:00:36.050> it's<00:00:36.170> gonna<00:00:36.260> be<00:00:36.350> a<00:00:36.440> great

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
like I said it's gonna be a great

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.410 
like I said it's gonna be a great
contest<00:00:37.010> I<00:00:37.220> think<00:00:37.700> there<00:00:37.820> always<00:00:37.970> is<00:00:38.240> in<00:00:38.360> the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
contest I think there always is in the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.450 
contest I think there always is in the
game<00:00:38.570> if<00:00:38.720> there<00:00:38.870> isn't<00:00:39.020> you've<00:00:39.890> got<00:00:40.070> problems

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
game if there isn't you've got problems

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.010 
game if there isn't you've got problems
that's<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:41.329> nature<00:00:41.540> of<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:41.750> game<00:00:41.840> so

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
that's the nature of the game so

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.390 
that's the nature of the game so
semi-final<00:00:42.590> it's<00:00:42.710> cutthroat<00:00:42.890> there's<00:00:43.280> going

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
semi-final it's cutthroat there's going

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.220 
semi-final it's cutthroat there's going
to<00:00:43.460> be<00:00:43.610> words<00:00:44.300> said<00:00:44.630> there's<00:00:44.810> it's<00:00:45.050> again<00:00:45.200> it's

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
to be words said there's it's again it's

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.870 
to be words said there's it's again it's
going<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:45.530> be<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.650> really<00:00:46.040> tough<00:00:46.130> contest<00:00:46.520> and

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
going to be a really tough contest and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.910 
going to be a really tough contest and
both<00:00:47.030> teams<00:00:47.210> will<00:00:47.450> be<00:00:47.480> I<00:00:47.780> suppose<00:00:48.140> not<00:00:48.680> backing

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
both teams will be I suppose not backing

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.280 
both teams will be I suppose not backing
down<00:00:49.070> I<00:00:49.400> think<00:00:50.329> a<00:00:50.360> lot<00:00:50.510> depends<00:00:50.840> on<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:51.020> wicket

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
down I think a lot depends on the wicket

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.830 
down I think a lot depends on the wicket
the<00:00:51.860> last<00:00:52.820> game<00:00:53.000> we<00:00:53.120> played<00:00:53.300> here<00:00:53.450> the<00:00:53.570> wicket

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
the last game we played here the wicket

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.940 
the last game we played here the wicket
was<00:00:53.989> obviously<00:00:54.200> very<00:00:54.290> good<00:00:54.590> against<00:00:54.800> Sri

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
was obviously very good against Sri

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.450 
was obviously very good against Sri
Lanka<00:00:54.980> we<00:00:55.280> made<00:00:56.410> 360<00:00:57.410> I<00:00:57.440> think<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:57.860> they<00:00:58.310> made

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
Lanka we made 360 I think and they made

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.310 
Lanka we made 360 I think and they made
over<00:00:58.579> 300<00:00:58.880> so<00:00:59.270> we<00:00:59.360> saw<00:00:59.510> a<00:00:59.540> great<00:01:00.020> one-day

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
over 300 so we saw a great one-day

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.069 
over 300 so we saw a great one-day
wicket<00:01:00.649> so<00:01:01.579> yeah<00:01:01.700> I'm<00:01:01.820> expecting<00:01:02.300> it's<00:01:02.899> much

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
wicket so yeah I'm expecting it's much

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.810 
wicket so yeah I'm expecting it's much
locked<00:01:03.320> out<00:01:03.500> I'm<00:01:03.620> expecting<00:01:04.009> a<00:01:04.220> lot<00:01:04.549> of<00:01:04.670> runs

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
locked out I'm expecting a lot of runs

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.249 
locked out I'm expecting a lot of runs
scored<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.239> I<00:01:05.389> think<00:01:05.689> if<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:05.840> look<00:01:05.960> over<00:01:06.170> the

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
scored and I think if you look over the

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:07.779 
scored and I think if you look over the
past<00:01:06.289> between<00:01:06.679> India<00:01:07.069> and<00:01:07.100> Australia<00:01:07.249> whether

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
past between India and Australia whether

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.429 
past between India and Australia whether
we<00:01:08.389> played<00:01:08.600> them<00:01:08.749> over<00:01:08.929> there<00:01:09.079> in<00:01:09.170> one<00:01:09.289> day

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
we played them over there in one day

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.230 
we played them over there in one day
series<00:01:09.799> or<00:01:10.069> recent<00:01:10.520> ones<00:01:10.670> or<00:01:10.819> in<00:01:11.149> Australia

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
series or recent ones or in Australia

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.270 
series or recent ones or in Australia
I've<00:01:11.630> seen<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.810> lot<00:01:11.960> of<00:01:11.990> runs<00:01:12.200> I<00:01:12.710> think<00:01:13.130> that's

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
I've seen a lot of runs I think that's

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.889 
I've seen a lot of runs I think that's
what<00:01:13.429> will<00:01:13.969> happen<00:01:14.090> come<00:01:14.420> gander

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
what will happen come gander

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.109 
what will happen come gander
I<00:01:15.069> think<00:01:16.069> everyone's<00:01:16.459> gonna<00:01:16.579> be<00:01:16.700> nervous<00:01:16.969> in

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
I think everyone's gonna be nervous in

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.580 
I think everyone's gonna be nervous in
their<00:01:17.240> own<00:01:17.329> little<00:01:17.479> way<00:01:17.689> and<00:01:17.899> it's<00:01:18.200> up<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.439> them

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
their own little way and it's up to them

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.709 
their own little way and it's up to them
how<00:01:18.709> they<00:01:18.740> want<00:01:18.859> to<00:01:19.039> deal<00:01:19.159> with<00:01:19.310> it<00:01:19.429> I<00:01:19.969> think

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
how they want to deal with it I think

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:21.849 
how they want to deal with it I think
you<00:01:20.780> could<00:01:20.899> see<00:01:21.049> a<00:01:21.079> lot<00:01:21.229> of<00:01:21.350> a<00:01:21.380> lot<00:01:21.590> of<00:01:21.649> nerves

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859 
you could see a lot of a lot of nerves

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:24.730 
you could see a lot of a lot of nerves
are<00:01:22.009> on<00:01:22.069> show<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.579> couple<00:01:23.060> of<00:01:23.240> nights<00:01:23.389> ago<00:01:23.539> and<00:01:23.899> I

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
are on show a couple of nights ago and I

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.709

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:03.429 
all I think that well we see the tests
test<00:02:01.999> what<00:02:02.179> started<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.509> summer<00:02:02.719> off<00:02:02.929> and<00:02:02.959> one

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
test what started the summer off and one

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.539 
test what started the summer off and one
day<00:02:03.560> could<00:02:03.709> I'm<00:02:03.829> not<00:02:03.979> surprised<00:02:04.279> that<00:02:04.310> they're

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
day could I'm not surprised that they're

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.909 
day could I'm not surprised that they're
doing<00:02:04.669> well<00:02:05.289> every<00:02:06.289> time<00:02:06.439> I<00:02:06.469> come<00:02:06.649> up<00:02:06.709> against

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:06.919 
doing well every time I come up against

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:07.809 
doing well every time I come up against
them<00:02:07.039> it's<00:02:07.189> been<00:02:07.279> a<00:02:07.310> very<00:02:07.520> good<00:02:07.639> game<00:02:07.759> of

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
them it's been a very good game of

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.279 
them it's been a very good game of
cricket<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.240> it's<00:02:08.660> gonna<00:02:08.780> rock<00:02:08.959> down<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.229> the

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
cricket and it's gonna rock down of the

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.960 
cricket and it's gonna rock down of the
war<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.500> think<00:02:09.649> if<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.220> go<00:02:10.340> back<00:02:10.519> on<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.729> Indian

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
war I think if you go back on the Indian

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.610 
war I think if you go back on the Indian
series<00:02:11.269> and<00:02:11.390> all<00:02:11.450> over<00:02:11.689> there<00:02:11.840> there's<00:02:12.019> a<00:02:12.079> lot

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
player but i think the way he started

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.760 
player but i think the way he started
these<00:02:42.270> monday<00:02:42.600> cricket<00:02:42.930> he<00:02:42.990> obviously<00:02:43.380> he's

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
these monday cricket he obviously he's

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.320 
these monday cricket he obviously he's
taking<00:02:44.070> wickets<00:02:44.190> from<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.550> from<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.120> start

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
taking wickets from the from the start

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.910 
taking wickets from the from the start
of<00:02:45.390> his<00:02:45.480> career<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.960> hence<00:02:46.350> why<00:02:46.500> his<00:02:46.590> record

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
of his career and hence why his record

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.250 
of his career and hence why his record
so<00:02:47.040> good<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.490> I<00:02:48.300> know<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.720> boys<00:02:48.900> don't<00:02:49.020> face

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
so good and I know the boys don't face

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.780 
so good and I know the boys don't face
him<00:02:49.500> or<00:02:49.680> lock<00:02:49.920> facing<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.400> Nets<00:02:50.580> at<00:02:50.700> all

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
him or lock facing in the Nets at all

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.580 
him or lock facing in the Nets at all
because<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.060> how<00:02:51.210> fast<00:02:51.390> he<00:02:51.570> bowls<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.110> think

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
because of how fast he bowls and I think

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.750 
because of how fast he bowls and I think
he's<00:02:52.710> he's<00:02:52.980> major<00:02:53.220> threats<00:02:53.520> when<00:02:53.670> he's

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
he's he's major threats when he's

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
he's he's major threats when he's
swinging<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.090> if<00:02:54.180> he's<00:02:54.270> swinging<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.600> ball

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
swinging and if he's swinging the ball

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.080 
swinging and if he's swinging the ball
140<00:02:55.500> hundred<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:55.830> fifty<00:02:56.070> k's<00:02:56.220> back<00:02:56.790> into<00:02:56.970> the

140 hundred and fifty k's back into the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.000 
140 hundred and fifty k's back into the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
batsman it's it's quite tough and and

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.990
