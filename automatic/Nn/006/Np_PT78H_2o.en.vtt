00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 do not 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.120
 to make this amigurumi what we're going to 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.940
 need is a needle of 2 and a half and 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.820
 green colored thread for what is the 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.279
 head and hands yellow for the 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.840
 suit and white for the jacket and 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.790
 we will also use a little wool 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.710
 brown to create the belt cited that 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.710
 ties her clothes 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.090
 to start them amigurumi what are we going to 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.410
 to do is work in circles but you 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.440
 I'm going to teach a technique called 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.510
 magic ring because in this way what 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.720
 what we get is that the circle of 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.570
 start as close as possible to 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.370
 what we will do is take the thread and 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.489
 we turn it around forming an X 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.730
 we will take the needle we will pass it by 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.259
 under the first and above strand 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:08.360
 of the second we will remove the thread that we 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:10.250
 it remains and we will make a point 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.310
 what we have to do once we take out 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.250
 is a strand is between these two strands 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.520
 we passed the needle 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.760
 we take out the thread and we already do the first 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.190
 low point 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.930
 Now what we have to do is 5 more 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.930
 a total of 6 low points 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.850
 this is the result 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.380
 we will have the 6 points within the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.229
 two strands 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.070
 once we have the 6 points done what 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:49.000
 what we have to do is stretch a little 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.000
 and we take this strand the short thread 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:57.090
 we tighten well and stretch 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:00.870
 we will have this more closed circle 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.870
 we put the needle back 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.090
 and we went below the first point 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.300
 Now what we are going to do is increase 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.319
 at each point until you have 12 points is 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.810
 say within each first low point 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.340
 we will do 2 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.349
 First 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.760
 and again we pass it below 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.530
 same 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.530
 and we take out the second 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.130
 and we will continue weaving around until 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.130
 have the 12 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.410
 let's go from now to increase each 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.450
 turn a couple of points like that 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.250
 we will get the ball for the head 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.920
 it gets bigger what we have to 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.330
 do in this round is a low point in 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.820
 every normal point 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.010
 and then in the next one we increase 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.490
 making two points at the same point 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.490
 low 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.600
 we will continue to increase in this way 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.430
 until we have 18 points 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.370
 for the next increase we will have to 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.900
 do 24 points as you can see increase 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.390
 it's simple the only thing you have to 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.790
 to do in each round is to add a point 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.710
 under extra before increasing for 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.890
 get the 24 points what we will do 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.840
 is 2 low points 1 at each point and in 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.150
 the third point is where we will do the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.750
 increase with 2 low points within that 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.750
 same point 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.730
 we will continue working in the same way without 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.090
 lose the account until you have 24 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.090
 points 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.070
 in the next round we have to 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.990
 increase to get 30 points if 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.370
 you want a trick to not get lost 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.590
 while doing the rounds you can 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.870
 use a piece of thread and put it in 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.300
 the starting point or also sell 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.470
 markers that are a kind of 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.690
 plastic safety pins that you put on 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.820
 the first round and so it helps you to know 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.310
 where each round begins and ends 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.020
 of gain to get 30 points 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.440
 as I said before, the only thing you have 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.510
 what to do is add a point to a point 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.230
 under the following that is to say we would continue 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:38.870
 3 normal and current low points and in 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.870
 the 4th we would make 2 lows together 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.110
 for the next increase we have to 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.169
 get 54 points 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.289
 we will do it by weaving 7 low points and 2 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.749
 In the next 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.029
 when we have the 54 points made we 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:15.189
 will be this this will be the total width of 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:17.860
 head next what we have 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:20.680
 What to do is 7 more rounds and 3 rounds 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.569
 more than 54 points each, so what 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.729
 we will do is the widest part of the 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.460
 head from there we'll start with 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.229
 the decreases when we have all 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.969
 the turns made we will have half of 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:34.240
 head now what we have to do 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:38.229
 is to make it smaller for it what 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.479
 we will do is weave a spin but instead 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.479
 to increase 2 points what we will do is 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:46.029
 decrease 2 points in the first round 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.189
 of decrease we have to do 48 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:50.979
 points what we will do this exercise 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:54.339
 low points and decrease two points 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:57.340
 together what we will do is pass the needle 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:59.240
 below the point 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.840
 take out the thread 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.990
 we will have two we will pass the needle through 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.870
 below the next point 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.950
 we will return to remove the thread we will remain 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.100
 3 and now we can close the point 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.529
 we passed 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.949
 between 3 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:20.399
 and we will have managed to reduce two points 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.399
 in 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.639
 Here we can see how it starts 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.650
 close and head when we do the 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:41.720
 decreases what we have to do 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.810
 now it is to continue decreasing until 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.789
 let's just have a circle of 12 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.400
 points to decrease we will follow the same 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:51.590
 proportion that we removed a point before 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.560
 that is , if the return was 7 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.990
 the next one will be 6 and we'll make a point 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.360
 a point of decline equally as 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.969
 the previous ones we will take 2 points and the 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.219
 we will join in 1 

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:06.050
 once we have all the decreases 

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:08.900
 done we will have this ball 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.840
 put like that is the head what we're going to 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.000
 do now is fill it with a bit of 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.110
 stuffing for pillows or cushions 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.550
 What we will do is go grabbing 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:24.409
 pieces and we'll make them more fluffy 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.560
 We will separate the finger with the 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:31.090
 hands and we will be getting into the 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.090
 inside the hole that we have left 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:37.160
 do not fill it too much you have to 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:39.710
 be consistent but not too 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.630
 tight if it does not remain is pretty to 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:44.000
 the wool is too tight and not 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.010
 it is soft and after all this 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.450
 is a doll has to be soft and 

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.450
 come and pick it up
