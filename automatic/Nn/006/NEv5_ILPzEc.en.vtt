we've<00:03:02.269> got<00:03:02.390> 476<00:03:03.290> 472<00:03:05.230> 432<00:03:07.150> about<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:08.239> start

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
we've got 476 472 432 about to start

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:38.800 
we've got 476 472 432 about to start

now<00:03:39.810> we<00:03:39.870> got<00:03:40.109> both<00:03:40.349> frames<00:03:40.799> put<00:03:41.310> together<00:03:41.900> the

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
now we got both frames put together the

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.660 
now we got both frames put together the
outer<00:03:43.079> frames<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.950> next<00:03:44.189> thing<00:03:44.370> we'll<00:03:44.549> be

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
outer frames the next thing we'll be

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.470 
outer frames the next thing we'll be
doing<00:03:44.700> is<00:03:45.269> we'll<00:03:46.079> put<00:03:46.530> them<00:03:46.680> we'll<00:03:47.239> get<00:03:48.239> these

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
doing is we'll put them we'll get these

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.750 
doing is we'll put them we'll get these
tacked<00:03:48.780> up<00:03:49.049> these<00:03:49.290> sides<00:03:49.590> welded<00:03:50.189> to<00:03:50.430> ground

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
tacked up these sides welded to ground

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.940 
tacked up these sides welded to ground
down<00:03:51.079> then<00:03:52.079> we'll<00:03:52.170> take<00:03:52.409> them<00:03:52.560> we'll<00:03:52.680> put<00:03:52.859> our

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
down then we'll take them we'll put our

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.520 
down then we'll take them we'll put our
post<00:03:53.219> on<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:54.000> then<00:03:54.750> we'll<00:03:54.870> start<00:03:55.109> to<00:03:55.200> assemble

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
post on and then we'll start to assemble

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.869 
post on and then we'll start to assemble
the<00:03:55.739> frame<00:03:55.950> we'll<00:03:56.219> pack<00:03:56.430> it<00:03:56.459> up<00:03:56.639> and<00:03:56.730> then

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
the frame we'll pack it up and then

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:03.440 
the frame we'll pack it up and then
finish<00:03:57.209> weld<00:03:57.450> me<00:04:01.459> it's<00:04:02.459> tagged<00:04:02.760> on<00:04:02.969> the<00:04:03.209> first

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
finish weld me it's tagged on the first

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.339 
finish weld me it's tagged on the first
post<00:04:04.790> goes<00:04:05.790> up<00:04:06.000> 34<00:04:06.510> inches<00:04:06.840> that'll<00:04:07.109> make<00:04:07.260> the

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
post goes up 34 inches that'll make the

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:08.030 
post goes up 34 inches that'll make the
whole<00:04:07.499> thing

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
whole thing

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.399 
whole thing
I<00:04:08.069> mean<00:04:08.969> 32<00:04:09.480> inches<00:04:09.719> that'll<00:04:10.049> make<00:04:10.169> the<00:04:10.290> whole

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
I mean 32 inches that'll make the whole

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:20.510 
I mean 32 inches that'll make the whole
thing<00:04:10.439> 34<00:04:11.250> inches

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:43.230 

but

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.870 

got<00:04:44.240> it<00:04:44.360> out<00:04:44.509> tactics<00:04:44.840> light<00:04:45.940> trap

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
got it out tactics light trap

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.379 
got it out tactics light trap
where

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.659 

it's<00:04:52.569> where<00:04:52.960> what<00:04:53.500> I'm<00:04:53.560> going<00:04:53.770> to<00:04:53.800> do<00:04:53.919> now<00:04:54.129> come

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
it's where what I'm going to do now come

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:55.400 
it's where what I'm going to do now come
around

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
around

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.430 
around
wailed<00:04:55.980> on<00:04:56.190> these<00:04:56.370> floors<00:04:56.870> just<00:04:57.870> gets<00:04:58.170> around

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
wailed on these floors just gets around

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.490 
wailed on these floors just gets around
everybody<00:04:59.570> don't<00:05:00.570> make<00:05:01.260> it<00:05:01.940> pretty<00:05:03.230> round<00:05:04.230> and

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
everybody don't make it pretty round and

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:12.060 
everybody don't make it pretty round and
take

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.730 

all<00:05:12.580> right<00:05:12.790> so<00:05:13.180> we're<00:05:14.020> going<00:05:14.200> from<00:05:14.350> corner<00:05:14.710> to

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
all right so we're going from corner to

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.970 
all right so we're going from corner to
corner<00:05:14.910> like<00:05:15.910> Steve<00:05:16.180> said<00:05:16.510> he's<00:05:17.230> skip<00:05:17.560> welding

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
corner like Steve said he's skip welding

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.550 
corner like Steve said he's skip welding
it<00:05:18.100> so<00:05:18.610> we<00:05:18.700> don't<00:05:18.790> warp<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.240> frame<00:05:19.540> we<00:05:20.290> got<00:05:20.440> it

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
it so we don't warp the frame we got it

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.320 
it so we don't warp the frame we got it
squared<00:05:20.890> up<00:05:21.100> we<00:05:21.370> measured<00:05:21.730> it<00:05:21.820> about<00:05:22.060> three

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
squared up we measured it about three

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.290 
squared up we measured it about three
times<00:05:22.600> we<00:05:22.840> got<00:05:22.990> a<00:05:23.020> strap<00:05:23.350> on<00:05:23.590> it<00:05:24.090> to<00:05:25.090> make<00:05:25.270> sure

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
times we got a strap on it to make sure

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.960 
times we got a strap on it to make sure
that<00:05:25.540> we've<00:05:25.810> got<00:05:25.840> it<00:05:26.080> square<00:05:26.550> and<00:05:27.550> so<00:05:27.820> he's

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
that we've got it square and so he's

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.490 
that we've got it square and so he's
going<00:05:28.180> from<00:05:28.450> corner<00:05:28.810> to<00:05:28.840> corner

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
going from corner to corner

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.070 
going from corner to corner
skip<00:05:30.340> welding<00:05:30.760> so<00:05:30.940> we<00:05:31.060> don't<00:05:31.240> warm<00:05:31.450> it<00:05:31.600> see

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
skip welding so we don't warm it see

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.250 
skip welding so we don't warm it see
there<00:05:32.320> we've<00:05:32.740> got<00:05:32.770> our<00:05:32.950> frame<00:05:33.370> built<00:05:34.170> you<00:05:35.170> can

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
there we've got our frame built you can

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.590 
there we've got our frame built you can
see<00:05:35.500> it's<00:05:36.330> 76<00:05:37.330> inches<00:05:37.540> high<00:05:37.870> 72<00:05:38.440> inches<00:05:38.860> wide

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
see it's 76 inches high 72 inches wide

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.490 
see it's 76 inches high 72 inches wide
34<00:05:40.600> inches<00:05:40.930> deep<00:05:41.260> and<00:05:42.900> next<00:05:43.900> we'll<00:05:44.080> be<00:05:44.200> using

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
34 inches deep and next we'll be using

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.090 
34 inches deep and next we'll be using
some<00:05:44.680> light<00:05:45.610> gauge<00:05:45.940> steel<00:05:46.300> tube<00:05:46.660> to<00:05:47.650> build<00:05:47.890> an

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
some light gauge steel tube to build an

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.270 
some light gauge steel tube to build an
inner<00:05:48.310> box<00:05:49.200> so<00:05:50.200> that<00:05:50.230> we<00:05:50.380> have<00:05:50.590> about<00:05:50.800> two<00:05:51.070> inch

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
inner box so that we have about two inch

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.690 
inner box so that we have about two inch
insulated<00:05:52.150> thick<00:05:52.390> walls
