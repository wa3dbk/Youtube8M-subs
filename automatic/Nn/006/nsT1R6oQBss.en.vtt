00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.380
 the vehicle assistance park 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.320
 on Sunday the pilots went 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.180
 confronted between France / breast is 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.369
 to deny brouzet-lès-alès between road 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.780
 atypical and exceptional decor for 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.350
 to finish on a super new specials 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.699
 in downtown Alès 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.699
 where the audience had moved a year 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.690
 event in the event their allies 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.730
 hosted this year a test of 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.270
 regularity on electric vehicles and 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.730
 hybrid 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.199
 one of the first in France this 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.879
 dimension today hybrid vehicles 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.960
 electric vehicles that is very 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.370
 important to us you know that the 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.509
 testing pioneers 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.979
 today in the communities 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.690
 French eco mobility 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.190
 it was very important to us 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.360
 today to have this dimension that 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.729
 I hope in the years to come 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.200
 take on a very great importance 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.300
 in motor sports 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.570
 for us it's a super super created 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.880
 because of modern and historical 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.800
 regularity vehicles and beautiful shot 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.259
 the bet won since I want to say that 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.690
 all our crews come back safe and sound 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.399
 on arrival of the rally you will take 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.380
 your party have arrived accepts one who 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.060
 has stopped this theme that even family 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.550
 of a person but the rally really 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.869
 a big success 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.270
 these crews were initially engaged 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.220
 of the electric rally 16 including two of elected 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.259
 and 5 territorial agents of alès and 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.850
 d'alès agglo driving vehicles from 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.890
 internal park that did not deserve 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.659
 since well placed in the general classification 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.190
 and especially proud to wear the colors 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.220
 of their community on a test 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.530
 like this one a great application 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.929
 it was prepared with mary I had 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.459
 really all work we had spotted 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.209
 special then as co pilot 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:03.759
 perfect 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:05.110
 so she assumes drive she assures me 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.129
 give the time it took so I 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.250
 think we've been pretty regular when 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:14.349
 even a challenge you have to do it because 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.150
 that it's jadida an opportunity that he 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:21.489
 should not miss universal if we had 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.750
 been selected his superiors must 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.040
 live it 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.840
 Friday at least once his record 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.220
 did the rally of the gard even though it's 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.200
 with small zoé electric it is 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.300
 civilians and engaged in the eure 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.340
 renewable energies 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.050
 the agglo too so here it was for 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.450
 to show everyone that we can 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.739
 we can do a rally 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.420
 an electric vehicle so that's 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.610
 still very interesting that's good 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.290
 it went very well we had a good 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.510
 welcome too so that's it's true that 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.280
 you see on the classic event rally 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.110
 again it's maurice dumas dad du 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.849
 romanian alesian champion dumas who 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.989
 wins the gard rally and for the 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.989
 first time in general 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.400
 no 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.430
 it makes the story to tell that is 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.850
 went well giving this first 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.760
 we suffered the plow still goes on 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.740
 only because there is no rooney 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.400
 however no known problem 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.940
 particular 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.090
 I spent well here satane complement 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.310
