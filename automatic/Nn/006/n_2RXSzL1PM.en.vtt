 They will say that it is difficult and not the truth is 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.410
 super simple you take 10 minutes in 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.840
 do it and the essential ingredient is 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.640
 Aloe vera is very important that others 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.670
 ingredients that we have in our house 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.230
 that is not going to have water that is not going to have 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.870
 stove that is going to have to be super 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.120
 simple and if you want to know how it 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.300

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.100
 I promise that it will serve you keep watching 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.440
 well let's start with this 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.739
 treatment that is super simple 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.970
 I swear 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.860
 we are going to need to sabilate water a pot 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.620
 to heat the water and the aloe and a 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.930
 palita to move him then the first good 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.300
 step is to rinse our aloe very well 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.520
 We must stop it as you clean appointment 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.520
 not perfect either but you have to focus it 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.979
 then we will start to chop the o 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.110
 breaking it into pieces does not have to be 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.600
 very large but not so small or 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.410
 be there as you see it in the video are 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.630
 like the little ones the cuts the 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.910
 bits after you have to stay 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.259
 something like I show you in the video 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.259
 it's super simple 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.150
 then let's boil it but first 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.040
 we have to add water in 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.530
 little star and we have to learn the 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.830
 medium flame this is going to help you to be 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.620
 boiling our then our aloe 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.320
 about 8 minutes 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.479
 it really takes a little bit too long 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.330
 turn a brown color then let's 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.640
 add our aloe and let's take 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.010
 our little stick to be removing a 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.760
 a little while 1 or 2 minutes later we leave it 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.760
 to boil 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.619
 already starts to boil and then you 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.410
 we turn it off, let it cool down for a 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.510
 side then empty or add it 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.010
 to a little boat that you want 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.140
 it has to be warm to be able 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.510
 add to your hair 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.459
 and so we have to stay is super 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.640

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:27.980
