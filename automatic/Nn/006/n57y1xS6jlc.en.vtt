that aren't definitely needed to play a
game<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.400> they<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.640> add<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.000> experience

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
game but they just add to the experience

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.640 
game but they just add to the experience
a<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.509> bit<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> rumble<00:01:28.259> pack

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.240 
a little bit like the rumble pack
starfox<00:01:29.400> 64<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:31.110> works<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> lot<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.950> games

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
starfox 64 it works with a lot of games

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.969 
starfox 64 it works with a lot of games
like<00:01:32.430> Paper<00:01:32.700> Mario<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.409> doesn't<00:01:34.829> really

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
like Paper Mario but it doesn't really

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.890 
like Paper Mario but it doesn't really
add<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.460> much<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:35.939> experience<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.810> you

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
add that much to your experience so you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.940 
add that much to your experience so you
might<00:01:37.170> want<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.530> careful<00:01:37.710> about

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
might want to be careful about

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.010 
might want to be careful about
collecting<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> lot<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.060> them<00:01:39.270> because<00:01:39.869> you

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
collecting a lot of them because you

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.190 
collecting a lot of them because you
don't<00:01:40.049> really<00:01:40.320> need<00:01:40.470> them<00:01:42.020> then<00:01:43.020> there's

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
don't really need them then there's

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.990 
don't really need them then there's
something<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.740> transfer<00:01:44.490> pack<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
something like the transfer pack on the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.819 
something like the transfer pack on the
Nintendo<00:01:45.299> 64<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.930> would<00:01:46.259> allow<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.560> to

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
clean the actual console and this is to

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.589 
clean the actual console and this is to
clean<00:02:20.609> out<00:02:21.480> your<00:02:21.959> memory<00:02:22.260> slot<00:02:23.150> really<00:02:24.150> stupid

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
clean out your memory slot really stupid

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.330 
clean out your memory slot really stupid
stuff<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.200> can<00:02:25.379> do<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.650> with<00:02:25.829> other<00:02:25.980> things

so<00:02:26.519> you<00:02:26.549> don't<00:02:26.640> really<00:02:27.000> need<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.450> bought<00:02:27.719> it

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
so you don't really need it I bought it

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.509 
so you don't really need it I bought it
because<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.049> was<00:02:28.170> five<00:02:28.439> dollars<00:02:28.859> and<00:02:29.310> that's

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
because it was five dollars and that's

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:30.860 
because it was five dollars and that's
the<00:02:29.700> only<00:02:30.000> reason<00:02:30.239> why<00:02:30.329> I<00:02:30.359> have<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.689> and<00:02:30.810> I'll

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the only reason why I have it and I'll

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.399 
the only reason why I have it and I'll
never<00:02:31.139> probably<00:02:31.349> use<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.769> actually<00:02:31.920> clean

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
never probably use it to actually clean

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.599 
never probably use it to actually clean

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
completely trivial is this is Mario

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.220 
completely trivial is this is Mario

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
required to play the game but you also

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.470 
required to play the game but you also
get<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:43.200> stupid<00:02:44.040> little<00:02:44.700> mat<00:02:45.030> it's<00:02:45.389> a

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
get that stupid little mat it's a

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.119 
get that stupid little mat it's a
mousepad<00:02:45.689> you<00:02:46.290> can<00:02:46.409> use<00:02:46.560> anything<00:02:46.889> as<00:02:47.099> a

mousepad you can use anything as a
mousepad<00:02:47.370> completely<00:02:48.090> useless<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:49.680> just<00:02:49.799> keep

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:49.919 
mousepad completely useless so just keep

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.050 
mousepad completely useless so just keep
in<00:02:50.040> mind<00:02:50.069> of<00:02:50.340> what's<00:02:50.489> required<00:02:50.669> and<00:02:50.970> what's

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:58.469 
if you're an NES collector I do think

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.990 
if you're an NES collector I do think
it's<00:02:58.620> almost<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:58.980> requirement<00:02:59.669> for<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.909> to

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000

have<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.419> light<00:03:00.689> gun<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.109> just<00:03:01.500> think<00:03:01.650> that's

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
have a light gun I just think that's

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.170 
have a light gun I just think that's
awesome<00:03:02.219> I<00:03:02.340> think<00:03:02.579> it's<00:03:02.700> cool

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
awesome I think it's cool

awesome I think it's cool
I<00:03:03.209> think<00:03:03.719> the<00:03:03.870> nostalgic<00:03:04.409> factor<00:03:04.799> out<00:03:04.980> ways

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
I think the nostalgic factor out ways

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.490 
I think the nostalgic factor out ways
how<00:03:05.819> useful<00:03:06.389> it<00:03:06.599> is<00:03:06.659> with<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.900> lot<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.049> games<00:03:07.319> but

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
how useful it is with a lot of games but
