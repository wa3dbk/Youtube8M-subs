00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
stone once we have those you can start

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.740 
stone once we have those you can start
making<00:00:35.040> them<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:36.030> i'll<00:00:36.210> show<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.450> for<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
making them so i'll show you for the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.660 
making them so i'll show you for the
first<00:00:37.020> way<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.290> do<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.190> click<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
first way to do it is you click on the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.400 
first way to do it is you click on the
mountain<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.120> your<00:00:39.480> town<00:00:39.629> map<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.260> they'll

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
mountain in your town map so they'll

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.610 
mountain in your town map so they'll
drop<00:00:40.649> off<00:00:41.129> some<00:00:41.780> some<00:00:42.780> bait<00:00:43.050> stones<00:00:43.350> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
drop off some some bait stones and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.290 
drop off some some bait stones and
pounds<00:00:43.739> moonstones<00:00:44.250> occasionally<00:00:44.820> but

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
pounds moonstones occasionally but

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.270 
pounds moonstones occasionally but
that's<00:00:45.510> also<00:00:45.719> slowest<00:00:46.260> way<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.500> go<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
that's also slowest way so go to the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.729 
that's also slowest way so go to the
fastest<00:00:47.640> way<00:00:47.700> go<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> your<00:00:48.420> quest<00:00:48.660> screen<00:00:48.960> go

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
fastest way go to your quest screen go

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.180 
fastest way go to your quest screen go
to<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.309> Second<00:00:50.879> World<00:00:50.910> Court<00:00:51.539> delica<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.190> go

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
to the Second World Court delica and go

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.689 
to the Second World Court delica and go
to<00:00:53.250> tower<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.730> light<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.770> voice<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:56.010> God<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
to tower of light and voice of God and

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.729 
to tower of light and voice of God and
this<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.910> probably<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.270> fastest<00:01:00.780> way<00:01:00.840> most

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
this is probably the fastest way most

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.759 
this is probably the fastest way most
efficient<00:01:02.609> way<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.170> will<00:01:04.170> definitely<00:01:04.589> get

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
efficient way and will definitely get

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.340 
efficient way and will definitely get
you<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.250> most<00:01:05.610> out<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.060> your<00:01:06.720> energy<00:01:06.930> as<00:01:07.320> well

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
you the most out of your energy as well

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.950 
you the most out of your energy as well
so<00:01:09.710> right<00:01:10.710> now<00:01:10.970> these<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.150> not<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.479> units<00:01:12.810> you

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
so right now these are not the units you

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
so right now these are not the units you
need<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:14.010> we'll<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.250> try<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.820> blast<00:01:15.090> through

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
need so we'll just try to blast through

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.560 
need so we'll just try to blast through
this<00:01:15.509> stage<00:01:16.259> right<00:01:16.560> here<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.970> let<00:01:18.360> me<00:01:18.390> explain

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
this stage right here but let me explain

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.200 
this stage right here but let me explain
what<00:01:19.080> why<00:01:19.619> or<00:01:19.950> as<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.460> seals<00:01:20.729> are<00:01:20.909> good<00:01:21.060> for

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
what why or as in seals are good for

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.690 
what why or as in seals are good for
battle<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.840> ores<00:01:22.369> they<00:01:23.369> give<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.670> a

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
battle so ores they give you a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.140 
battle so ores they give you a
50-percent<00:01:24.390> boost<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:25.530> your<00:01:25.560> attack<00:01:25.979> power

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
50-percent boost to your attack power

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the seal so you're a tech co works with

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.490 
the seal so you're a tech co works with
13<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:03.119> right<00:02:03.719> now<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:03.899> still

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
13 and so be it so right now we still

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.670 
13 and so be it so right now we still
don't<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.159> right<00:02:05.280> team<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.790> I'm<00:02:05.909> still

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
don't have the right team so I'm still

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.410 
don't have the right team so I'm still
just<00:02:07.680> blasting<00:02:08.190> through<00:02:08.429> these<00:02:08.610> probably

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
just blasting through these probably

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.830 
just blasting through these probably
drop<00:02:09.599> something<00:02:09.780> useful<00:02:10.349> these<00:02:10.530> guys<00:02:10.739> but

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
drop something useful these guys but

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.330 
drop something useful these guys but
why<00:02:11.989> not<00:02:12.200> what<00:02:12.349> we're<00:02:12.560> looking<00:02:12.590> for<00:02:12.920> we're

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
why not what we're looking for we're
