00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
allows it to have a lot better not

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.110 
allows it to have a lot better not
holding<00:00:47.370> ability<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.090> allows<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.079> be

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
holding ability it allows it to be

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.299 
holding ability it allows it to be
impervious<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.570> moisture<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.980> allows<00:00:53.280> it

impervious to moisture and it allows it

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.819 
impervious to moisture and it allows it
to<00:00:54.590> have<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.620> tar<00:00:56.130> on<00:00:56.790> the<00:00:57.829> cordage

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
to have the tar on the cordage

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.970 
to have the tar on the cordage
inherently<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.559> survival

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
inherently so that if in a survival

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.609 
inherently so that if in a survival
situation<00:01:02.250> if<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.360> need<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:04.020> melt<00:01:04.440> that

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
situation if I need to I can melt that

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.969 
situation if I need to I can melt that
now<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.220> use<00:01:05.789> that<00:01:05.820> tar<00:01:06.300> as<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:07.020> type<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.530> pitch

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
now and use that tar as a type of pitch

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.389 
now and use that tar as a type of pitch
or<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.369> could<00:01:09.030> use<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.590> sustain<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> fire<00:01:11.039> or<00:01:11.340> I

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
or I could use it to sustain a fire or I

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.200 
or I could use it to sustain a fire or I
could<00:01:11.820> use<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.229> as<00:01:13.229> an<00:01:13.680> added<00:01:14.520> accelerant

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
could use it to as an added accelerant

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.860 
could use it to as an added accelerant
to<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.479> fire<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.410> get<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.680> fire<00:01:17.009> started

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.570 

that's<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.870> sum<00:01:22.870> of<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.080> biggest<00:01:23.580> advantages

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
that's the sum of the biggest advantages

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.400 
that's the sum of the biggest advantages

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
to bank wine it is three plot because it

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.680

stop it's pretty thin but even even this
small<00:01:41.440> stuff<00:01:42.040> I<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:43.720> break<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.170> down<00:01:46.260> into

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
small stuff I can break it down into

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.490

almost<00:01:47.500> a<00:01:48.010> thread

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.260 

I<00:01:51.590> can<00:01:52.280> break<00:01:52.490> those<00:01:52.720> fibers<00:01:53.720> down<00:01:54.100> okay

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.840 

now<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:58.079> would<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.259> use<00:01:58.590> these<00:01:58.829> very<00:01:59.549> very

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
now what would I use these very very

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.419 
now what would I use these very very
small<00:02:00.179> fibers<00:02:00.689> form<00:02:00.960> while<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.740> would<00:02:02.009> probably

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
small fibers form while I would probably

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.959 
small fibers form while I would probably
use<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.759> for<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.179> thread<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.840> could<00:02:04.439> use<00:02:04.740> it

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
use it for like a thread I could use it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.550 
use it for like a thread I could use it
quite<00:02:05.969> honestly<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.539> could<00:02:06.810> use<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.350> very

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
quite honestly I could use it for a very

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.880 
quite honestly I could use it for a very

the higher 13 pound test of it you can
get<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.930> at<00:02:27.989> walmart<00:02:28.680> i<00:02:28.890> think<00:02:29.579> it<00:02:29.670> was<00:02:29.700> like

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
get this at walmart i think it was like

get this at walmart i think it was like
I<00:02:30.360> think<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.870> one<00:02:31.079> was<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:31.410> five<00:02:31.709> bucks<00:02:33.530> it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
I think this one was like five bucks it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.069 
I think this one was like five bucks it
has<00:02:34.709> roughly<00:02:35.130> 200<00:02:35.970> feet<00:02:36.360> on<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:37.290> real<00:02:39.079> they

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
has roughly 200 feet on this real they

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.630 
has roughly 200 feet on this real they
call<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.620> tart<00:02:40.860> drop<00:02:41.190> line<00:02:41.569> but<00:02:42.569> it's<00:02:43.640> you

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
call it a tart drop line but it's you

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.949 
call it a tart drop line but it's you
know<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:45.140> bank<00:02:46.140> line<00:02:46.349> ok<00:02:48.530> here<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.829> the

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
know it's bank line ok here is the

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.800 
know it's bank line ok here is the
250-pound<00:02:51.959> stuff<00:02:52.579> this<00:02:53.579> just<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.660> other

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
250-pound stuff this just like the other

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.160 
250-pound stuff this just like the other
can<00:02:55.290> be<00:02:55.319> broken<00:02:55.709> down<00:02:55.860> into<00:02:56.040> three<00:02:56.400> fibers<00:02:57.170> so

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
can be broken down into three fibers so

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.680 
can be broken down into three fibers so
it's<00:02:58.769> just<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.340> thicker<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.030> more<00:03:00.269> stout

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
it's just the thicker and more stout

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.130 
it's just the thicker and more stout
version

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
version

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.440 
version
the<00:03:03.140> third<00:03:03.380> version<00:03:03.739> i<00:03:04.099> have<00:03:04.400> came<00:03:05.150> from<00:03:05.390> a

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
the third version i have came from a

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.559 
the third version i have came from a
company<00:03:05.840> it's<00:03:06.770> called<00:03:07.010> mariner<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:07.730> they

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
company it's called mariner and they

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.320 
company it's called mariner and they
make<00:03:09.020> a<00:03:09.050> tard<00:03:09.440> twisted<00:03:09.950> bank<00:03:10.130> line<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.640> this

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
make a tard twisted bank line and this

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.740 
make a tard twisted bank line and this
is<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:12.709> thousand-pound<00:03:13.700> tensile<00:03:14.239> strength<00:03:14.540> and

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
is a thousand-pound tensile strength and

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.570 
is a thousand-pound tensile strength and
just<00:03:15.290> like<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.650> other<00:03:15.830> tool<00:03:16.099> it<00:03:16.340> can<00:03:16.370> be

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
just like the other tool it can be

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:23.740 
just like the other tool it can be
broken<00:03:16.730> down<00:03:17.030> into<00:03:17.209> three<00:03:19.390> fibers<00:03:20.390> oh<00:03:21.190> ok<00:03:22.750> the

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
broken down into three fibers oh ok the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.199 
broken down into three fibers oh ok the
great<00:03:23.959> thing<00:03:23.989> about<00:03:24.230> this<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.980> because<00:03:25.819> it<00:03:26.180> is

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
great thing about this is because it is

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.449 
great thing about this is because it is
hard<00:03:26.599> like<00:03:27.080> I<00:03:27.200> said<00:03:27.260> it's<00:03:27.680> impervious<00:03:28.099> to

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
hard like I said it's impervious to

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.290 
hard like I said it's impervious to
moisture<00:03:28.670> I<00:03:29.209> don't<00:03:29.750> have<00:03:29.989> to<00:03:30.170> worry<00:03:30.440> about<00:03:30.769> a

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
moisture I don't have to worry about a

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.020 
moisture I don't have to worry about a
whole<00:03:32.300> lot<00:03:32.510> of<00:03:32.690> things<00:03:32.930> getting<00:03:33.440> into<00:03:33.890> it<00:03:34.040> the

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
whole lot of things getting into it the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.330 
whole lot of things getting into it the
knots<00:03:35.299> hold<00:03:35.660> better<00:03:35.989> in<00:03:36.380> my<00:03:36.650> mind<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.280> then

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
knots hold better in my mind and then

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.520 
knots hold better in my mind and then
paracord<00:03:37.970> I<00:03:40.090> just<00:03:41.090> it's<00:03:41.360> easier<00:03:42.170> for<00:03:42.200> me<00:03:42.380> to

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
paracord I just it's easier for me to

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.590 
paracord I just it's easier for me to
get<00:03:42.709> a<00:03:42.769> hold<00:03:43.010> of<00:03:43.220> it's<00:03:43.519> what<00:03:43.760> I<00:03:43.790> train<00:03:44.150> with<00:03:44.180> its

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
get a hold of it's what I train with its

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.160 
get a hold of it's what I train with its
what<00:03:44.810> i<00:03:44.840> use<00:03:45.170> it's<00:03:45.470> why<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.709> life<00:03:47.170> nothing

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
what i use it's why I life nothing

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.940 
what i use it's why I life nothing

as for use as a trotline what that means
is<00:04:17.639> this<00:04:18.639> can<00:04:18.880> be<00:04:19.030> used<00:04:19.180> as<00:04:19.889> an<00:04:21.389> underwater

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
is this can be used as an underwater

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.409 
is this can be used as an underwater
trap<00:04:22.870> for<00:04:23.169> fish<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.740> can<00:04:24.340> be<00:04:24.490> using<00:04:24.910> it<00:04:25.060> for<00:04:25.389> a

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
trap for fish I can be using it for a

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.409 
trap for fish I can be using it for a
million<00:04:25.990> different<00:04:26.260> purposes<00:04:27.010> and<00:04:27.419> that's

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
million different purposes and that's

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.240 
million different purposes and that's
why<00:04:28.600> I<00:04:28.630> use<00:04:28.690> it<00:04:29.050> it's<00:04:29.320> also<00:04:29.530> smaller<00:04:30.039> in

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
why I use it it's also smaller in

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.460 
why I use it it's also smaller in
diameter<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:31.000> bank<00:04:31.240> line<00:04:31.479> or<00:04:32.580> paracord<00:04:33.580> sorry

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
diameter the bank line or paracord sorry

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.770 
diameter the bank line or paracord sorry
because<00:04:35.470> it's<00:04:35.740> smaller<00:04:36.070> in<00:04:36.280> diameter<00:04:36.490> I<00:04:37.150> don't

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
because it's smaller in diameter I don't

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.230 
because it's smaller in diameter I don't
really<00:04:37.960> have<00:04:38.080> to<00:04:38.380> worry<00:04:38.820> I'm<00:04:39.820> talking<00:04:40.210> about

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
really have to worry I'm talking about

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.180 
really have to worry I'm talking about
the<00:04:40.479> overall<00:04:42.150> size<00:04:43.530> because<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:44.710> is<00:04:44.860> smaller

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
the overall size because it is smaller

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.060 
the overall size because it is smaller
in<00:04:45.370> diameter<00:04:45.520> I<00:04:46.090> have<00:04:46.539> more<00:04:47.260> tensile<00:04:47.770> strength

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
in diameter I have more tensile strength

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.250 
in diameter I have more tensile strength
at<00:04:48.310> a<00:04:48.520> smaller<00:04:48.970> diameter<00:04:49.300> therefore<00:04:50.169> it's

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
at a smaller diameter therefore it's

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.320 
at a smaller diameter therefore it's
lighter<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:50.740> if<00:04:50.830> it's<00:04:51.039> lighter<00:04:51.310> I<00:04:51.610> can<00:04:52.120> carry

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
lighter and if it's lighter I can carry

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.810 
lighter and if it's lighter I can carry
more<00:04:52.570> of<00:04:52.630> it<00:04:54.960> so<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.620> know<00:04:56.740> that's<00:04:57.070> another

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
more of it so you know that's another

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.090 
more of it so you know that's another
reason<00:04:58.090> why<00:04:58.240> I<00:04:58.389> choose<00:04:58.690> to<00:04:59.289> have<00:04:59.500> that<00:04:59.770> in<00:04:59.949> my

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
reason why I choose to have that in my

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.690 
reason why I choose to have that in my
pack

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
pack

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.220

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
that's pretty much it there's you know
