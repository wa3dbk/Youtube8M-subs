00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.620
The time of the hunters has arrived.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.420
The animals retire to their night-time ride away.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.260
Life on the savannah offers no truces. And the night of Shaba fills with living shadows,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.580
prowling around in the eternal game of life and death.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.220
By the river, beneath the fallen trunk of an acacia,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.980
the leopard scans the night in search of prey.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.980
Its hearing and sense of smell receive the information of everything alive

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.500
and moving about under the cover of night.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.900
Another leopard emerges from the shadows,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.980
and the couple continues its silent round.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.820
From the river come messages of potential prey,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.420
but the water and the crocodiles place them beyond their reach.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.460
Then, the male detects a furtive movement in a tree alongside the Ewaso Ngiro,

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.700
and the hunt begins.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.860
The female waits at a certain distance.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.980
Only if the prey is large will she come to the aid of her companion.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.220
Silent as a ghost,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.340
the leopard approaches the base of the tree in which the prey hides.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.700
Its senses are alert, waiting for fresh signs. And then a new sound is heard.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.700
The leopard knows there is something alive in the tree,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.900
and that there is no escape for it.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.660
Beneath the branches runs a river full of dangers and to reach the ground

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.340
the prey has to reveal itself.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.820
It is now just a question of time,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.300
and beneath the attentive gaze of his companion, the hunter gets ready to attack.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.900
A last movement reveals a monitor lizard,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.020
provoking a reaction from the leopard. For the terrified lizard,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.740
this will be its last night on earth.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.780
Beneath the tree, the female waits, disappointed.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.140
The prey is small, and the male will keep it all for himself.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.940
In the harsh world of Shaba there is no place for any other attitude

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.540
but ensuring oneâ€™s own survival.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.020
And if it had been the female that had caught the monitor lizard,

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.140
she would not have allowed the male to come near.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.220
Having devoured his catch,

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.340
the males comes down from the tree to join his mate.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.740
And again two shadows melt into the night,

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.460
combining beauty and death beneath the starry sky of Shaba.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.060
Shaba is a fascinating land beyond the influence of man;

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.860
a world in which life is a series of stark contrasts;

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.340
where hardship gives rise to beauty and survival imposes constant tests.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.100
And it is precisely the harshness of its conditions that makes this land a world apart,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.180
an exclusive paradise for its survivors.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.220
With the return of the dry season,

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.580
Shaba goes back to the beginning.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.620
Little by little drought sets in.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.820
And again God and the devil alternate until they become one and the same,

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.540
with no beginning or end,

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.940
in the perpetual cycle of life.
