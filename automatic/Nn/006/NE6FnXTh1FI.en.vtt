00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.060
 5 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:18.630
 Why do you always have this aggressive idea when you meet someone? 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:24.180
 Now the trend has forced t lean concepts 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.810
 For a moment this little party today, which some have yet again taken this idea 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.720
 There is 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.160
 At the same time, Joe reveals a bit of experience in this new world of virtual reality. 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.030
 Can Virtual Reality 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.450
 For independence is getneunde virtual reality is a bit Cine-dimensional time now why I 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.840
 I do not know. 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.870
 Yes, this is really real. 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.870
 Ah 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.690
 woo that 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.790
 That's what this sort of headset Oculus Rift 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:58.909
 Ohkyul Russ sf This came out a lot now existing headset students be given why 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.720
 You're going to wear this and turn your head. 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.409
 Then, since the child is aware of it until that point of view, 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.670
 I will go in. 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:12.590
 Rattling the word I'm writing this video you are right that between Bob 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:17.090
 I am writing something like this 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:21.380
 Other than moving in the same way, the left and right eyes have different images 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:25.700
 So take control time itself is actually as seen in the right eye in the left eye 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.750
 Because it's so different, I am in a very shoulder game 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.259
 I can give you a sense of depth that you can use that kind of immersion. 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.280
 Now we get to what is virtual, so the host of the reality that you know 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.000
 It's different. Yes. That's what the lens itself is. It's a little easier. 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.450
 I have. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.869
 So, as you said, because these technologies are good so far 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.450
 Some examples of what we got out of sight in the upper IMAX 3d 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.319
 Same thing we do not have some sort of virtual synth 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.610
 Toka those things or what is virtual reality theme park experience something like this hanging 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:57.979
 Given the climate. 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:00.349
 And things like that is really a multi-dimensional cloth or examples that you see now on the YouTube 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:05.060
 Reaction has a lot of footage. 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:09.950
 But you see the reaction of people is outrageous that you really feel like a real 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:14.510
 To be afraid and to avoid Magi, it is very funny and so exciting 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:19.310
 See I should leave now quite expect it to have the report's contributing Yes 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.050
 Anyway, give this headset you have said, this dimension is different to experience virtual reality 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.170
 With this headset you can 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:29.390
 Will you enjoy the kind of content 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:34.580
 This is one example of new virtual circle headset has been created for the game 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:39.260
 The companies that actually participated in the investment are not 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.330
 The building was involved in the 3d games developed such that right now in Shooting games 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.340
 Development of the banks in the 4 to id Software 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:49.340
 Great buildings. The 3d game big guys have invested here. So here it is. 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.550
 In fact, now such a popular game was breathing 2 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.780
 In Oculus Rift is a new version developed and 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:01.760
 I think the people who are really fun to see what it is that example 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:06.050
 Larson Would you whether people really laugh at this, so this is just another 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.580
 There are people that video to Yes when u heard it that way Can any 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.430
 I have four. 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.240
 That you know is a 4 Stub 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:18.530
 I have the content . I can experience it. 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:22.370
 I do not actually cut it all the same. 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.480
 I 'm afraid that it's really burning, 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:30.170
 It's funny how our actions look at it but it's funny. 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.120
 If you have a new moment, talk to me. 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:38.960
 What I'm talking about going lotta good example Would be so now own 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:44.330
 What a precious experience you have in life by experiencing something fearful . 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.350
 Once the experience has really gone into the count, hey Sarah Hughes, 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.400
 We recommend 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:53.000
 He did not think anything great map that you require For example, the 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.110
 So now we have a little something happens that this was going to be released this foundation 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.489
 Can you experience it 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:02.780
 It is not for sale to the general consumer yet, but for developers 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:05.450
 I can apply and receive it . About $ 300. My neighborhood is about $ 30. 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:10.400
 We also have the amount that goes beyond KRW 300,000. 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:14.570
 So I think prices consumer who developed me try a little something first 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.270
 Maybe developers can actually apply and get it, 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:21.200
 It's a setup that you can develop with 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:25.940
 The world is wide and there are so many things that we have not experienced. 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:30.560
 It is this which the machine and fumes are due to actual experience, I try again 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:37.550
 I will give you some kind of role to do that. 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.850
 Is it a second version? Yes. The second is a web service called bubbling. 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.810
 is 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.810
 Bowling example 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:52.939
 tweet There are people who teach other languages ​​and learn languages. 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:58.009
 I love you. I want you to match these two . 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:05:02.389
 Such a service that can be learned through some web-based chat 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:05.689
 In a nutshell, if you look at video chat in English, just think about it 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:09.080
 But a little different is that when you enter the website, 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:14.270
 So for example I have a class that class stones also what 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:17.029
 Information about the instructors and also what the intermediate steps. What language is more time 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.899
 When the time is up from when these things by screening 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:21.710
 I'm on the list up . I'm going to introduce you to buy one ticket per hour. 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:26.479
 I have it 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:28.460
 But that interdental tickets for the price of one per post about how this $ 3 $ 3 today about 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:33.889
 Just over 3,000'm John 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.659
 $ 3 If the degree is much like English language telephone service Why Video English Division 1 hour 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.389
 Yes you can. 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:42.080
 Could this be us pain ? 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:44.449
 By doing one course in Korea is yiradeunji next PayPal What you join 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:49.219
 You can make purchases directly with credit card 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:53.209
 And now , the price is very cheap. 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:58.069
 The reason why I can operate it cheaply is that I am using some min 

00:05:53.209 --> 00:06:02.389
 How did I heard Beats For example, rather than its professional instructors 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:06.349
 Native Speaker 4 Whether you are a retired man in America or a vacation 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:09.919
 These college students who are using this kind of son 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:13.729
 Because there is something to do with the idea of ​​earnest money or pocket money , the lecturers 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:17.569
 Hanteneun those who do not see how so much money and yet easy 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:20.930
 That you can get good service now with little money 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:25.939
 Maybe the service that you get a little leverage to break 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:31.849
 It's not a very common, very hard atmosphere, it's a casual free talking atmosphere. 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:35.419
 So, for example, 8 people now have class and 2 other people . 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:39.289
 There are eight of them, and they talk very much 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:40.490
 And now I hear nothing now 0 English race is so diverse rattling 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:43.669
 It 's very fun. 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:47.479
 The accent can really be a diverse set 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:52.550
 Now beat that race very much a direct deal What was really talking moreugetgo 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:56.190
 Yes, I would. So I'm a little better than the body, so it's a fun one market cheaper 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:59.670
 You'll be able to squeeze a fun experience 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:03.990
 Oh, I 'll learn a foreign language like this. 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:08.910
 For those who would like to learn once at an affordable price, 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:14.070
 The thought that he would also try to cross a bad experience once the service reduces Here 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:14.700
 Hey today was troubled by the Foundation that I have seen two kinds of aggressive ideas 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.210
 50 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.210
 Thank you.
