00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.309 
of the comedy not too much though they
preserved<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.569> lot<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.110> there's<00:02:31.260> a

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
preserved a lot of it and there's a

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.420 
preserved a lot of it and there's a
situation<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.890> end<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.130> don't<00:02:32.310> want

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
situation in the end that I don't want

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.710 
situation in the end that I don't want
to<00:02:32.489> spoil<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.120> seemed<00:02:33.300> like<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.480> was<00:02:33.569> kind

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
to spoil that it seemed like it was kind

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.059 
to spoil that it seemed like it was kind
of<00:02:33.750> unnecessary<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.560> go<00:02:34.709> in<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.920> direction

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
of unnecessary to go in the direction

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.770 
of unnecessary to go in the direction
they<00:02:35.370> did<00:02:35.580> for<00:02:35.850> it<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.000> can't<00:02:36.180> really<00:02:36.270> spoil<00:02:36.630> it

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
they did for it I can't really spoil it

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.390 
they did for it I can't really spoil it
but<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.410> saw<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.620> movie<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:38.160> know<00:02:38.370> that

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
but if you saw the movie you know that

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.280 
but if you saw the movie you know that
there's<00:02:38.970> someone<00:02:39.360> there<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.959> seems<00:02:40.170> like

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
there's someone there and it seems like

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.479 
there's someone there and it seems like
they<00:02:40.410> just<00:02:40.440> didn't<00:02:40.770> really<00:02:40.860> handle<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.370> way<00:02:41.459> I

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
they just didn't really handle the way I

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.800 
they just didn't really handle the way I
would<00:02:41.730> have<00:02:41.819> liked<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.209> but<00:02:42.420> these<00:02:42.480> are<00:02:42.540> small

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
would have liked it but these are small

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.630 
would have liked it but these are small

better<00:02:46.410> comedies<00:02:46.860> I've<00:02:46.980> seen<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.340> while

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
better comedies I've seen in a while

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.680 
better comedies I've seen in a while
I'd<00:02:47.790> like<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.030> know<00:02:48.120> do<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.269> guys<00:02:48.420> have<00:02:48.630> a

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
I'd like to know do you guys have a

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.810 
I'd like to know do you guys have a
favorite<00:02:48.930> cop<00:02:49.350> film<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:50.040> any<00:02:50.220> kind<00:02:50.550> I'm

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
favorite cop film of any kind I'm

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.210 
favorite cop film of any kind I'm
thinking<00:02:51.450> mine<00:02:51.690> might<00:02:52.050> be<00:02:52.080> Lethal<00:02:52.650> Weapon<00:02:52.680> or

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
thinking mine might be Lethal Weapon or

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.009 
thinking mine might be Lethal Weapon or
if<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.430> count<00:02:53.700> diehard<00:02:54.269> maybe<00:02:54.510> but<00:02:54.720> Lethal

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
if you count diehard maybe but Lethal

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.690 
if you count diehard maybe but Lethal
Weapon<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.410> more<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.860> cop<00:02:56.100> film<00:02:56.400> than<00:02:56.580> die

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
Weapon is more of a cop film than die

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.130 
Weapon is more of a cop film than die
hard<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:57.300> might<00:02:57.510> go<00:02:57.690> with<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:57.959> one

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
hard is so I might go with that one

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.420 
hard is so I might go with that one
