00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.960
 let's make fried donuts from 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.890
 Butter and lemon for this we need 3 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.840
 eggs 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.660
 150 butter 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.840
 a quart of milk at one 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:30.430
 true lemon one teaspoon 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:33.910
 yeast three tablespoons anise 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:38.050
 a kilogram or so of flour 350 grams 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.290
 of sugar oil for frying and sugar 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.290
 glas 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.530
 in a bolero I've been children 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.010
 new point we add the return with a 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.010
 little sex 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.449
 to put it very well 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.449
 the gray 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.100
 the milk 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.960
 it mixes very well 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.960
 we add the leaves 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.860
 the lemon zest 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.050
 i 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.890
 and it's not going so well 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.159
 not mixed a good for the continuation 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.159
 add the flour 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.350
 and the teaspoon of yeast has arrived 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.450
 and then we add the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.480
 flour that admits to obtain a 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.480
 pasta 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.700
 we are mixing well 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.100
 more or less admit as a kilo of 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.100
 flour 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.000
 ah 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.380
 and now it 's on the countertop we're going to 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.690
 work well the stain we are adding 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.690
 in the flour and we're going to work 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.349
 and now we have worked well the dough 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.000
 and as you can see, the hands do not stick 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.269
 then now we are going to start 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.269
 make them 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.770
 and now we do not make the donuts 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.799
 we have put to heat in a pan 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.549
 enough oil while we go 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.549
 making them 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.420
 and now we already have the oil a 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.580
 a little warm 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.010
 and we are throwing the donuts and when 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.880
 they are going up we are going to 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.880
 stronger fire 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.690
 until they are well browned 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.690
 but without leaving the beds 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.270
 we are going around so that we do not know 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.270
 can 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.650
 with abundant oil 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.850
 and so on until they show 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.040
 so that they are well formed 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.880
 for esteban by donating and we're going to go 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.880
 taking out to make other little 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.799
 let's take them out 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:09.080
 and we put them to drain on paper 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.080
 kitchen to release all the fat 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.170
 and let it cool 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.530
 ah 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.110
 and once cold the icing sugar is thrown 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.110
 and this is the result
