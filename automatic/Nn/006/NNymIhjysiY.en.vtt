but I concur it's a bit it's a speedy a
speedy<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> great<00:00:54.750> first<00:00:55.590> purchase<00:00:56.190> and

speedy is a great first purchase and
it's<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.570> never<00:00:58.260> tire<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.219> definitely

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
it's one I never tire of I definitely

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.660 
it's one I never tire of I definitely
recommend<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.690> with<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.829> strap<00:01:02.160> dis<00:01:02.430> for

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
recommend it with the strap dis for

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.700 
recommend it with the strap dis for
versatility<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.110> think<00:01:04.379> when<00:01:04.559> it's

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
versatility and I think when it's

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.560 
versatility and I think when it's
without<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.549> added<00:01:05.970> piece<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> middle

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
without that added piece in the middle

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.600 
without that added piece in the middle
and<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.770> sits<00:01:07.950> down<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.400> looks

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and this just sits down that looks

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.160 
and this just sits down that looks
really<00:01:08.909> nice<00:01:09.619> great<00:01:10.820> over<00:01:11.820> my<00:01:11.970> shoulder<00:01:12.450> this

zippy and I would either choose it in
this<00:03:47.739> monogram<00:03:48.340> or<00:03:48.549> in<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.790> DA<00:03:48.970> meee<00:03:49.239> bean<00:03:49.569> and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
this monogram or in the DA meee bean and

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.580 
this monogram or in the DA meee bean and
probably<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.299> would<00:03:52.419> choose<00:03:52.780> it<00:03:52.989> over<00:03:53.079> all<00:03:53.319> in

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
probably I would choose it over all in

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.890 
probably I would choose it over all in
this<00:03:53.769> monogram<00:03:54.669> because<00:03:55.329> I<00:03:55.359> love<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:55.810> with

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
this monogram because I love it with

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.599 
this monogram because I love it with
black<00:03:56.230> bags<00:03:56.650> I<00:03:56.919> think<00:03:57.129> that<00:03:57.280> looks<00:03:57.370> really

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
black bags I think that looks really

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.569 
black bags I think that looks really
good<00:03:57.730> but<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.660> DA<00:03:58.780> maybe<00:03:58.989> anivia<00:03:59.410> toss<00:03:59.650> up<00:03:59.889> ok

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
good but the DA maybe anivia toss up ok

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.830 
good but the DA maybe anivia toss up ok

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
so now i am at i can't even count I've

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.900

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.379 
got my speedy and the mini Bichette and
the<00:04:07.720> neverfull<00:04:08.199> and<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.620> wallet<00:04:09.099> and<00:04:09.430> this<00:04:10.239> is

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
the neverfull and the wallet and this is

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.300 
the neverfull and the wallet and this is
really<00:04:10.780> really<00:04:11.139> really<00:04:11.379> tough<00:04:11.680> if<00:04:11.919> I<00:04:12.040> had<00:04:12.190> to

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
really really really tough if I had to

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.729 
really really really tough if I had to
pick<00:04:12.340> one<00:04:12.519> more<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.239> would<00:04:13.750> go<00:04:13.930> with<00:04:13.959> this<00:04:14.349> Mila

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
pick one more I would go with this Mila

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.509 
pick one more I would go with this Mila
clutch<00:04:15.010> I<00:04:15.370> think<00:04:15.910> it's<00:04:16.060> really<00:04:16.269> versatile<00:04:16.810> as

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
clutch I think it's really versatile as

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.759 
clutch I think it's really versatile as
far<00:04:18.519> as<00:04:18.669> what<00:04:18.910> print<00:04:19.329> to<00:04:19.510> get<00:04:19.690> this<00:04:19.870> in<00:04:20.109> I'm<00:04:20.409> at

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
far as what print to get this in I'm at

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.490 
far as what print to get this in I'm at
a<00:04:20.799> loss<00:04:21.099> I<00:04:21.519> think<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.270> monogram<00:04:22.840> is<00:04:23.020> probably

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
a loss I think the monogram is probably

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.970 
a loss I think the monogram is probably
the<00:04:23.680> most<00:04:23.710> practical

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
the most practical

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.460 
the most practical
has<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.190> smaller<00:04:25.640> plate<00:04:26.030> here<00:04:26.450> and<00:04:26.660> it's<00:04:27.320> not

has a smaller plate here and it's not

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.960 
has a smaller plate here and it's not
going<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.680> show<00:04:27.860> wear<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.130> tear<00:04:28.430> but<00:04:28.460> i<00:04:28.730> love
