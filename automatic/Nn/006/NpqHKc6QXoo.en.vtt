00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.630
 hello dear people are back today 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.330
 Let's make a kind of 15 minute menu and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.650
 we are doing one today 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.109
 Italian miracle pot is so called 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.100
 I just have an English 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.810
 Lagerraum found and thought so 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.760
 I change the recipe for you and 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.140
 make out my own not and if 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.480
 He let's see how I ready 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.800
 then just stay tuned and we will 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.239
 need a pot that 's pretty 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.829
 cool job actually would not need so 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.210
 a big pot but he needs one 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.180
 relatively large pot for two people 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.030
 is the recipe for what I do here and 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.910
 What are we going to do? 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.730
 Anyone double an onion and 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.899
 the cut at a fine onions 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.379
 peeled off 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.730
 here is an employee at schneidig 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.680
 probably out and then once 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.020
 the list several times from total and 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.600
 cut vertically so that we have the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:11.250
 then just dice finely 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.180
 then the rule and players and lay 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.930
 because in there 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.670
 I take three players total, the here 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.360
 ranges from whole and hesse again 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.750
 frozen 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.759
 then I have a clove of garlic now 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.259
 just gets into very thin slices 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.320
 cut down and these things 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.340
 will go down simply to then 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.220
 I still have a can of tomatoes 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.240
 These just grenades all in juice 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.920
 but I want to open it up 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.729
 and the gyms are in pieces 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.299
 so I go back and forth 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.909
 tomato knife i should not be there like that 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.290
 rabidly whom thou that the sword 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.210
 dull but there is also 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.430
 razor-sharp and therefore unnecessary 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.750
 that a bit and you too 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.079
 Do you see how that makes me go easy 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.610
 only a vacuum then the tomatoes 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.410
 then I go 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.530
 Just give everything as it is 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.400
 Here it looks like the head is still here 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.890
 a bit and then we can already 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.230
 sometimes logical 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.320
 I go for example in case 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.150
 but you can also dad beside or 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.800
 take the rail or whole times 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.360
 spaghetti 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.680
 they have a big surface because of that 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.430
 be pretty much liquid and 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:40.400
 does not like to have and come 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.500
 to the side nice color brown because 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.670
 wholegrain noodles i might like before i could 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.330
 Setting more stops aside 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.709
 then I have here now 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.930
 basil leaves form a windowsill 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.050
 I never thought that in winter now 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.580
 can survive in winter so long 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.260
 Tell me your version of the 100 pott 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.610
 have sent me your photos and 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.170
 Of course, tasty on the esch 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.390
 Braked example or pin farmer photo 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.550
 sony facebook, I'm always happy 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.050
 about when that has made so far and 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.880
 I think it's great I could go one time 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.050
 make video or before any video 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.600
 switch when you send pictures 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.519

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.880
 Let's go too, and I'll give it 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.269
 the beautiful here in the corner as green 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.890
 part 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:27.140
 and then we take something else 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:35.480
 take myrad marjoram for the club here 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:37.010
 we two teaspoons comes by side 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.440
 a little bit of chili powder 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:44.810
 Take cayenne pepper does not matter 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.720
 and that comes a quarter teaspoon 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.350
 also next to it 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.590
 then we need olive oil for this 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.170
 namely two tablespoons of olive oil 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:03.100
 should be enough 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:06.110
 and then I'll give you another tablespoon 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.180
 Then we'll cook it for you 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.750
 a little earlier and then 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.420
 we have equal a super recipe so 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.440
 a bit more noodles are there then 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.750
 Let's go, finally 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.590
 just in a vegetable broth and me 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.260
 have my dose where the tomatoes was in it 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.900
 I have her hot water and I give 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.290
 the hot water I am first 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.600
 two cans two full dose here and 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.330
 cant that for good at which first time 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.920
 simmer for a little ten minutes 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.850
 they only need the noodles about 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.060
 ten to twelve minutes after 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.340
 Packing instructions and depending on if I am 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.100
 I have to give something back now 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.990
 then of course everything a bit through 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.290
 and then I'll tell you in the end 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.330
 inflation because I am under kom9 foto 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.270
 you can see how beautiful you are 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.430
 that has become in the edge of the picture 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:02.330
 monument is good to see here fits 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:07.100
 then pretty creamy you see it yes and 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:11.200
 then he goes and gives this 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.200
 actually accident-free on the plate 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.020
 and maybe I would have a bit 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.710
 to take less liquid 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.750
 but I guess that's enough and 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.430
 then for you here from foto and 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.930

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.940
 minutes it took about for then 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.770
 just pour in as hot water and 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.750
