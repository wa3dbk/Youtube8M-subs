00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.219

 scale tv and give us your faithful tuning 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.390
 I was delighted because I find very 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.369
 good company of a rap exponent 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.140
 that has a super stuck in these 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.160
 moments a loud applause please 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.260
 for the r 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.120
 how is this my life for happy or for 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.810
 condemnations here preceding 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.600
 tell me who is good lr 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.930
 lr a project that has been working 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.000
 since 2007 and the first so will stick 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.980
 the audience was in 2010 with the song 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.840
 your welcome with you 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.850
 then another prayer was recorded with the poet 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.830
 street that is called small detail 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.000
 between the whole song so they have 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.480
 impacted the people one called 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.550
 denies that came out last year and also 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.900
 another that was with the new school that 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.940
 we said look 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.129
 and so we pretty much keep working 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.890
 torments and what is the meaning of 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.290
 these cycles lr lr has a double 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.420
 meaning because I have the gift of 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.600
 rapping and also makes commercial music 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.940
 when I find myself rapping lr comes from 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.530
 draft law although when the 45 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.030
 music as it pulls out next new background 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.280
 that the very simple program that I am 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.520
 working currently I use my name 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.070
 pile then you're singing from the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.200
 2007 did you tell me 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.180
 ok what themes have you peeled from 2007 to 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.880
 this date 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.190
 you can be a little bit good first 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.070
 it was that he says all 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.550
 I was blocked and who would say 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.620
 today I am a suffocated tiger I am in 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.230
 red beanie with you 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.500
 that was the first one another was ima me 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.950
 they deny they do not think they do not go with me 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.620
 and give him denies I said I'm your friend and 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.380
 let it live in the movie and let's go 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.610
 to keep playing hide and seek then 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.409
 another what was stuck was with nine 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.380
 strings that this one you want social that says 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.929
 that with me that she is going away that the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.989
 bald is the verse of mine then the 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.310
 prayer well ok too cool and that we 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.780
 you are promoting right now 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.790
 I'm currently working the simple 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.430
 which is called of programmed produced by 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.620
 james which the video was shot jarabacoa 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.870
 we are working this occasion okey 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.590
 when this video has closed this video 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.720
 it's about 32 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.280
 and how can we find it? 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.739
 enter youtube on any page 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.870
 internet google puts of programmed of 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.150
 read and when you are ready 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.769
 Full production in the production goes 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.120
 to leave next year because there 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.030
 collaborations that have not yet been 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.640
 finished to specify but we already have 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.980
 the free conscious we have among others 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.959
 speakers is cooking is if that month 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.120
 you had commenting that you have some 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.700
 collaborations another picture in that you're going to 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.480
 do with 15 we are working too 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.480
 one with the greatest 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.180
 and that you think about the new law that 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.569
 are about to change the 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.819
 letters 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.120
 if I am partly in favor of the change 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.099
 because I tell you all who makes music and 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.359
 already has some followers is a 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:21.159
 example maybe what one says computes and 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.530
 makes other people you see based on 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.849
 what one says then if one is 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.379
 saying things that in the end does not stop 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.030
 no message does not make any sense 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.260
 that 's what the youth that comes 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.239
 growing is going to stay with him are the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.099
 exact keys and the rest of you what 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.469
 they compose all the songs that I 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.540
 so much now towards my composer and what 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:40.719
 Type of letters are clean double meaning 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.639
 I do everything but always more 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:44.650
 including more a woman in a way 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.719
 that has not been said too very smooth 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.359
 but neither very very crude that is not 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:53.169
 can consume ok and already leaving us a 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:55.319
 A little bit of the normal, tell me 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:04:00.180
 they told you that you have a controversy 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.180
 pretty big with she- wolf 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:13.120
 but tell me what is happening 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:16.510
 with him what I tell you in this genre 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.590
 the rappers that if another speaker challenges you 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:24.120
 musically you throw songs 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.120
 of time 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.240
 to see what he's doing like that because he 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.520
 looked over there for you to know 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.620
 why 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.260
 but he threw me I answered them what 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.360
 material but he said he told you 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.789
 that hurt you so much that you decided to 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.639
 answer him not though I hurt nothing but 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.680
 you know that for example on facebook 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.870
 I am a traditional fan we respond 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.550
 we answer him and he does not do it anymore 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.060
 because the fans of the care not 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.060
 maybe why 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.110
 in that case it can be ignored but as 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.689
 who commanded he trusted 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.310
 and that you answered him 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:13.960
 and you can say here 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.520
 I recommend the people who seek it 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.680
 on youtube because that too long and 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.170
 a very explicit content in the 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.570
 program of big hands but fix it 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.570
 a little more or less of coral or 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.169
 how 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.070
 although he says if they do a building I do not 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.410
 I give you the volanta and I have the floor for 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.270
 the toad sneak in the end you sing dyke 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.040
 without 30000 it forces us to the throat you 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.440
 you are singing by romo la olla te 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.690
 They have tires, they can hold on, they're going 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.090
 of the drop is so little note that you give 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.980
 that are no longer pets as you want 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.130
 that I repeated a chota that before flames 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.440
 mocked was called the compote fleet m 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.690
 that with me is discovered follows as maya 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.400
 or throwing rocks at the moon I follow 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.320
 being the mommy's corner all 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.220
 an aspiring capo I saw that he does not even reach 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:07.740
 mule and there goes 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:10.520
 but strong a greeting sent me from 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.520
 his stuff 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:19.950

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:25.410

 socially again my life for 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.500
 end in its great violence that is what

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:14.309
 studying that I do what I already do 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:15.509
