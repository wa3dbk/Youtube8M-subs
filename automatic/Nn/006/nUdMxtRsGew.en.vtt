the<00:01:21.030> room<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:22.490> by<00:01:23.490> doing<00:01:23.550> that<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.420> doesn't

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the room so by doing that it doesn't

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.930 
the room so by doing that it doesn't
draw<00:01:24.990> attention<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.830> all<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.400> different

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
draw attention to all the different

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.690 
draw attention to all the different
bulkheads<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.050> minds<00:01:28.350> when<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> lot

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
bulkheads and minds when you have a lot

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.830 
bulkheads and minds when you have a lot
of<00:01:29.730> angles<00:01:30.690> and<00:01:30.960> lines<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.920> your<00:01:32.370> ceiling<00:01:32.840> so

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
of angles and lines in your ceiling so

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.220 
of angles and lines in your ceiling so
that<00:01:33.870> way<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:35.190> makes<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.670> all<00:01:35.820> looked

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
that way it it makes it all looked

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.320 
that way it it makes it all looked
really<00:01:37.230> cohesive<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.370> if<00:01:38.580> I<00:01:38.760> had<00:01:38.970> done<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
really cohesive and if I had done the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.750 
really cohesive and if I had done the
ceiling<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.320> white<00:01:41.040> then<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.550> would<00:01:41.730> have

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
ceiling in a white then you would have

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.700 
ceiling in a white then you would have
seen<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.120> lot<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> contrast<00:01:43.050> and<00:01:43.410> it<00:01:43.470> would<00:01:43.620> have

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
seen a lot of contrast and it would have

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.950 
seen a lot of contrast and it would have
really<00:01:44.430> brought<00:01:44.790> out<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:45.060> attention<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.660> all

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
really brought out of attention to all

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960 
really brought out of attention to all
the<00:01:45.990> all<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.770> bulkheads<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.550> lines<00:01:47.760> in

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
the all the bulkheads and the lines in

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.000 
the all the bulkheads and the lines in
that<00:01:48.120> so<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.630> was<00:01:48.810> again<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.380> alan<00:01:49.740> gray

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
that so this was again with alan gray

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.670 
that so this was again with alan gray
which<00:01:50.730> is<00:01:50.760> a<00:01:50.880> great<00:01:51.090> benjamin<00:01:51.540> more<00:01:51.690> color<00:01:51.960> on

was<00:03:07.299> a<00:03:07.359> perfect<00:03:07.950> perfect<00:03:08.950> figure<00:03:09.810> also<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
was a perfect perfect figure also the

fuse box and this is going to be the

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.479 
fuse box and this is going to be the
home<00:03:28.930> office<00:03:29.139> area<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.859> basement<00:03:30.010> so<00:03:30.459> I

wanted<00:03:30.849> it<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.060> be<00:03:31.150> functional<00:03:31.450> as<00:03:31.930> well<00:03:31.959> and

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
wanted it to be functional as well and

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.530 
wanted it to be functional as well and
still<00:03:33.190> different<00:03:33.519> purpose<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:34.000> what<00:03:34.269> we<00:03:34.389> did
