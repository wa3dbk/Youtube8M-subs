00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
pretty much just like android 4.2 but

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.440 
pretty much just like android 4.2 but
it's<00:00:31.980> what's<00:00:32.399> under<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> hood<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.059> baked

it's what's under the hood and baked
into<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.690> run<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.050> kind<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.260> makes<00:00:34.469> it

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
into the run that kind of makes it

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.850 
into the run that kind of makes it
