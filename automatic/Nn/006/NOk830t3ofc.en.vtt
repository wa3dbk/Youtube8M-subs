detecting on this conglomerate wall

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.259 
detecting on this conglomerate wall
where<00:00:25.210> I<00:00:25.239> got<00:00:25.480> a<00:00:25.509> signal<00:00:26.079> all<00:00:26.980> the<00:00:27.039> way<00:00:27.460> over<00:00:28.119> on

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:41.400 
where I got a signal all the way over on
this<00:00:28.390> end<00:00:39.570> let's<00:00:40.570> break<00:00:40.810> a<00:00:40.840> little<00:00:41.110> bit<00:00:41.290> of

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
this end let's break a little bit of

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.930 
this end let's break a little bit of
this<00:00:41.530> dirt<00:00:41.830> away<00:00:42.070> and<00:00:42.250> see<00:00:42.430> if<00:00:42.520> our<00:00:42.700> signal

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
this dirt away and see if our signal

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.590 
this dirt away and see if our signal
gets<00:00:43.330> any<00:00:43.570> louder<00:00:44.520> now<00:00:45.520> unless<00:00:45.820> a<00:00:45.850> bullet<00:00:46.390> was

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
gets any louder now unless a bullet was

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.020 
gets any louder now unless a bullet was
fired<00:00:46.810> directly<00:00:47.230> into<00:00:47.680> this<00:00:47.770> wall<00:00:48.100> I<00:00:48.400> like<00:00:48.850> our

fired directly into this wall I like our

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.750 
fired directly into this wall I like our
chances<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:50.200> conglomerate<00:00:50.830> material<00:00:51.520> here

chances the conglomerate material here

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.850 
chances the conglomerate material here
is<00:00:51.970> ancient<00:00:52.420> riverbed<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.200> not<00:00:53.440> likely<00:00:53.680> to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
is ancient riverbed and not likely to

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.730 
is ancient riverbed and not likely to
have<00:00:54.130> anything<00:00:54.579> man-made<00:00:54.880> in<00:00:55.090> it<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.530> as<00:00:56.650> I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
have anything man-made in it so as I

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.920 
have anything man-made in it so as I
continue<00:00:57.250> to<00:00:57.280> sweep<00:00:57.670> in<00:00:57.970> all<00:00:58.090> metal<00:00:58.450> mode<00:00:58.480> I

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
continue to sweep in all metal mode I

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.720 
continue to sweep in all metal mode I
take<00:00:59.410> a<00:00:59.440> look<00:00:59.740> at<00:00:59.829> the<00:00:59.950> ferrous<00:01:00.280> oxide

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
take a look at the ferrous oxide

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.990 
take a look at the ferrous oxide
indicator<00:01:01.380> it's<00:01:02.380> only<00:01:02.530> registering<00:01:03.190> one<00:01:03.700> bar

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
indicator it's only registering one bar

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.690 
indicator it's only registering one bar
out<00:01:04.299> of<00:01:04.329> five<00:01:04.720> so<00:01:05.560> I<00:01:05.590> know<00:01:05.770> this<00:01:06.100> is<00:01:06.280> not<00:01:06.460> likely

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
out of five so I know this is not likely

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.989 
out of five so I know this is not likely
to<00:01:06.850> be<00:01:06.969> an<00:01:07.179> iron<00:01:07.479> target<00:01:08.219> now<00:01:09.219> to<00:01:09.280> further<00:01:09.670> ID

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:09.999 
to be an iron target now to further ID

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:12.419 
to be an iron target now to further ID
the<00:01:10.270> target<00:01:10.689> I<00:01:10.749> put<00:01:10.960> myself<00:01:11.140> in<00:01:11.560> discriminate

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
the target I put myself in discriminate

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:14.870 
the target I put myself in discriminate
mode<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:12.999> crank<00:01:13.509> up<00:01:13.689> the<00:01:13.840> sensitivity<00:01:14.619> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
mode and crank up the sensitivity and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.169 
mode and crank up the sensitivity and
look<00:01:15.880> at<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.149> readout<00:01:16.859> fifty-five<00:01:18.869> nineteen

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
look at the readout fifty-five nineteen

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:27.239 
look at the readout fifty-five nineteen
forty<00:01:22.179> eight<00:01:23.310> fifty<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.630> sixty<00:01:25.630> one<00:01:26.170> I<00:01:26.439> like

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:27.249 
forty eight fifty to sixty one I like

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:29.069 
forty eight fifty to sixty one I like
the<00:01:27.429> fact<00:01:27.670> these<00:01:27.880> numbers<00:01:28.270> are<00:01:28.389> mostly<00:01:28.689> all

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
the fact these numbers are mostly all

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.340 
the fact these numbers are mostly all
over<00:01:29.409> 40<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:31.270> I'm<00:01:31.389> going<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.689> keep<00:01:31.869> picking

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
over 40 so I'm going to keep picking

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:54.930 
over 40 so I'm going to keep picking
away<00:01:32.679> at<00:01:32.859> this

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.460 

sixty<00:01:55.940> eighty<00:01:56.710> 64<00:01:58.660> so<00:01:59.660> I'm<00:01:59.780> going<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.050> go<00:02:00.200> back

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
sixty eighty 64 so I'm going to go back

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.650 
sixty eighty 64 so I'm going to go back
to<00:02:00.680> all<00:02:00.800> metal<00:02:01.190> mode<00:02:01.220> because<00:02:01.790> now<00:02:02.000> I'm<00:02:02.360> pretty

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
to all metal mode because now I'm pretty

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.320 
to all metal mode because now I'm pretty
sure<00:02:02.900> I<00:02:02.930> have<00:02:03.230> a<00:02:03.260> good<00:02:03.500> target<00:02:03.770> I<00:02:04.160> put<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.120> game

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
sure I have a good target I put the game

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:14.119 
sure I have a good target I put the game
back<00:02:05.360> down<00:02:05.900> so<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.040> threshold<00:02:07.310> runs<00:02:07.760> smooth

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.680 

it's<00:02:15.129> pretty<00:02:15.370> deep<00:02:15.580> in<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.849> wall<00:02:16.060> too

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
it's pretty deep in the wall too

00:02:16.690 --> 00:03:03.370 
it's pretty deep in the wall too
so<00:02:18.810> again<00:02:19.810> like<00:02:19.989> I<00:02:20.140> said<00:02:20.379> I<00:02:20.409> like<00:02:20.650> our<00:02:20.860> chances

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.260 

okay<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.440> now<00:03:04.830> we<00:03:04.890> have<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.220> good<00:03:05.520> idea<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:05.940> the

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
okay so now we have a good idea that the

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.240 
okay so now we have a good idea that the
target<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:06.900> right<00:03:07.170> here<00:03:07.440> in<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:07.650> big<00:03:07.920> chunk

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
target is right here in this big chunk

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.190 
target is right here in this big chunk
of<00:03:08.370> caliche<00:03:08.760> I'm<00:03:09.480> just<00:03:09.750> going<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.959> start

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
of caliche I'm just going to start

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.339 
of caliche I'm just going to start
breaking<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.770> in<00:03:10.920> half<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.959> getting<00:03:12.959> smaller

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
breaking it in half and getting smaller

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.530 
breaking it in half and getting smaller
and<00:03:13.620> smaller<00:03:13.920> pieces<00:03:14.280> until<00:03:14.880> we<00:03:15.209> have<00:03:15.390> the

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
and smaller pieces until we have the

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
and smaller pieces until we have the
target<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:16.110> hand<00:03:25.400> here<00:03:26.400> we<00:03:26.550> go<00:03:27.440> breaking<00:03:28.440> it

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
target in hand here we go breaking it

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.890 
target in hand here we go breaking it
down<00:03:28.709> smaller<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.459> smaller<00:03:29.819> we<00:03:30.510> want<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.780> be

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
down smaller and smaller we want to be

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.440 
down smaller and smaller we want to be
careful<00:03:31.350> not<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.920> lose<00:03:32.250> whatever<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:33.000> target

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
careful not to lose whatever the target

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.949 
careful not to lose whatever the target
is<00:03:34.310> if<00:03:35.310> this<00:03:35.519> were<00:03:35.670> mineralization<00:03:36.450> all<00:03:36.870> the

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
is if this were mineralization all the

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.979 
is if this were mineralization all the
pieces<00:03:37.230> would<00:03:37.980> be<00:03:38.130> giving<00:03:38.489> off<00:03:38.640> some<00:03:39.420> sound<00:03:39.780> or

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
pieces would be giving off some sound or

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:47.470 
pieces would be giving off some sound or
another

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.170 

now<00:03:48.020> this<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.349> kind<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:48.650> fun<00:03:48.950> like<00:03:49.190> opening<00:03:50.090> a

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
now this is kind of fun like opening a

00:03:50.180 --> 00:04:02.730 
now this is kind of fun like opening a
box<00:03:50.390> of<00:03:50.629> Cracker<00:03:50.930> Jacks<00:03:51.379> or<00:03:51.620> something

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.120 

aha

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
there you have it a nice little nugget

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.890 
there you have it a nice little nugget
covered<00:04:09.050> with<00:04:09.200> a<00:04:09.230> reddish<00:04:09.830> caliche<00:04:10.670> crust<00:04:11.209> so

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
covered with a reddish caliche crust so
