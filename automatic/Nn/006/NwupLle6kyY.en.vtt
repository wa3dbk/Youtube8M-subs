00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
and I don't know it's pretty cool um and

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.960 
and I don't know it's pretty cool um and
I<00:02:17.319> guess<00:02:17.379> it's<00:02:17.650> cuz<00:02:17.799> it's<00:02:17.980> family<00:02:18.310> genetics<00:02:18.760> to

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
I guess it's cuz it's family genetics to

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.229 
I guess it's cuz it's family genetics to
maybe<00:02:19.209> I<00:02:19.480> mean<00:02:19.810> my<00:02:20.110> my<00:02:20.500> family<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.909> men<00:02:22.090> in<00:02:22.209> my

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
maybe I mean my my family the men in my

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.899 
maybe I mean my my family the men in my
family<00:02:22.330> have<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.959> lot<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.230> hair<00:02:23.530> in<00:02:23.739> general<00:02:24.040> so

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
family have a lot of hair in general so

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.820 
family have a lot of hair in general so
maybe<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.299> could<00:02:25.510> be<00:02:25.629> genetics<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.379> guess

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
maybe it could be genetics and I guess

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.170 
maybe it could be genetics and I guess
it<00:02:27.010> probably<00:02:27.099> is<00:02:27.510> um<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:29.610> other<00:02:30.610> than<00:02:31.120> that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
it probably is um and other than that

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.140 
it probably is um and other than that
what<00:02:31.750> else<00:02:31.920> yeah<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.129> this<00:02:33.310> week<00:02:33.579> is<00:02:33.849> the<00:02:34.030> week
