00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
I talked with some of the biologists I

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.790 
I talked with some of the biologists I
like<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.840> they're<00:02:12.350> talking<00:02:12.590> about

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
like that and they're talking about

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.199 
like that and they're talking about
starting<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.340> saw<00:02:13.520> guys<00:02:13.760> they're<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.030> little

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
starting to saw guys they're a little

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.180 
starting to saw guys they're a little
more<00:02:14.480> resistant<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.320> that<00:02:15.440> hot<00:02:15.680> water<00:02:15.920> or

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
more resistant to that hot water or

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.160 
more resistant to that hot water or
hardware<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.970> little<00:02:17.330> harder<00:02:17.600> your<00:02:17.720> fish<00:02:17.930> so

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
hardware a little harder your fish so

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.449 
hardware a little harder your fish so
hopefully<00:02:18.530> we'll<00:02:18.680> be<00:02:18.770> able<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.950> get<00:02:19.100> them<00:02:19.310> in

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
hopefully we'll be able to get them in

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.250 
hopefully we'll be able to get them in
there<00:02:19.610> but<00:02:19.730> this<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.810> number<00:02:21.110> one

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
there but this is the number one

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.880 
there but this is the number one
smallmouth<00:02:21.830> fishery<00:02:22.250> in<00:02:22.430> mid<00:02:22.670> state<00:02:23.890> all

oh you win some you lose one of the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.720 
oh you win some you lose one of the
baits<00:02:39.440> out<00:02:39.620> here<00:02:39.860> there's<00:02:40.070> a<00:02:40.160> lot<00:02:40.489> of<00:02:40.610> people

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
baits out here there's a lot of people

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.240 
baits out here there's a lot of people
use<00:02:41.000> is<00:02:41.180> easy<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:42.049> use<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.590> just<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:43.040> white

use is easy to use is just a white
twister<00:02:43.700> tail<00:02:43.930> it's<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:45.019> simple<00:02:45.560> thing<00:02:45.590> to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
twister tail it's a simple thing to

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.620 
twister tail it's a simple thing to
throw<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.459> when<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:46.940> water<00:02:47.120> temperature<00:02:47.570> is

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
throw and when the water temperature is

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.270 
throw and when the water temperature is
right<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.080> fish<00:02:48.260> are<00:02:48.410> up<00:02:48.440> off<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.890> bottom

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
right and the fish are up off the bottom

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.390 
right and the fish are up off the bottom
it's<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:50.000> dynamite<00:02:50.450> bait<00:02:50.660> out<00:02:50.840> here<00:02:51.080> but<00:02:51.470> right

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
it's a dynamite bait out here but right

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.430 
it's a dynamite bait out here but right
now<00:02:52.610> as<00:02:53.330> we<00:02:53.480> started<00:02:53.780> out<00:02:53.900> this<00:02:54.049> morning<00:02:54.110> the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
now as we started out this morning the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.080 
now as we started out this morning the
water<00:02:54.590> conditions<00:02:55.130> are<00:02:55.250> have<00:02:55.610> cooled<00:02:55.880> down

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
water conditions are have cooled down

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.199 
water conditions are have cooled down
overnight<00:02:56.450> Dan's<00:02:57.380> going<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.620> take<00:02:57.799> us<00:02:57.920> out<00:02:58.209> a

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
overnight Dan's going to take us out a

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.110 
overnight Dan's going to take us out a
little<00:03:00.200> deeper<00:03:00.560> yeah<00:03:01.220> we've<00:03:01.670> been<00:03:01.820> running<00:03:02.000> a

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
little deeper yeah we've been running a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.400 
little deeper yeah we've been running a
little<00:03:02.239> bit<00:03:02.420> deeper<00:03:02.660> because<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.230> fish

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
little bit deeper because the fish

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.229 
little bit deeper because the fish
aren't<00:03:03.650> quiet<00:03:03.950> on<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.280> rocks<00:03:04.519> yet<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.090> day

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
aren't quiet on the rocks yet is the day

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.270 
aren't quiet on the rocks yet is the day
goes<00:03:05.450> on<00:03:05.570> it'll<00:03:05.870> warm<00:03:05.900> up<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.350> little<00:03:06.470> bit<00:03:06.620> right

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
goes on it'll warm up a little bit right

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.440 
goes on it'll warm up a little bit right
now<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.459> think<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.730> water<00:03:07.940> temperatures

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
now I think the water temperatures

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.610 
now I think the water temperatures
coming<00:03:08.660> up<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.930> little<00:03:09.110> bit<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:09.350> what<00:03:09.470> we've

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
coming up a little bit so what we've

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.229 
coming up a little bit so what we've
done<00:03:09.769> is<00:03:09.829> we<00:03:10.040> switched<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.459> a<00:03:10.519> hair<00:03:10.790> jig<00:03:11.090> and

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
done is we switched to a hair jig and

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.660 
done is we switched to a hair jig and
what<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:11.989> hair<00:03:12.200> jig<00:03:12.440> does<00:03:12.709> in<00:03:12.890> this<00:03:13.010> riprap<00:03:13.280> is

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
what a hair jig does in this riprap is

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.340 
what a hair jig does in this riprap is
allows<00:03:13.970> us<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.329> cast<00:03:14.570> right<00:03:14.810> up<00:03:14.989> into<00:03:15.170> the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
allows us to cast right up into the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.060 
allows us to cast right up into the
riprap<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:17.269> fall<00:03:17.690> is<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.320> lot<00:03:18.590> slower<00:03:18.890> than

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
riprap and the fall is a lot slower than

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.789 
riprap and the fall is a lot slower than
a<00:03:19.220> regular<00:03:19.310> twister<00:03:20.260> what<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:21.380> does<00:03:21.530> is<00:03:21.680> the

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
a regular twister what it does is the

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.940 
a regular twister what it does is the
hair<00:03:22.010> actually<00:03:22.489> catches<00:03:23.269> air<00:03:23.750> bubbles<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.739> it

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
hair actually catches air bubbles and it

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.289 
hair actually catches air bubbles and it
slows<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.400> descent<00:03:25.760> of<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:25.880> jig<00:03:26.120> and

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
slows the descent of the jig and

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.210 
slows the descent of the jig and
whenever<00:03:26.480> you're<00:03:26.780> fishing<00:03:27.140> heavy<00:03:27.620> rock<00:03:27.950> like

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
whenever you're fishing heavy rock like

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.580 
whenever you're fishing heavy rock like
this<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:29.360> puts<00:03:29.630> that<00:03:29.840> jig<00:03:30.079> in<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.290> strike<00:03:30.560> zone

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
this it puts that jig in the strike zone

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.940 
this it puts that jig in the strike zone
just<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:31.130> little<00:03:31.400> bit<00:03:31.549> longer

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.809
