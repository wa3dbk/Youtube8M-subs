00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.310
 they will be called batch écoeure diane the room the balthazar in two days 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.190
 one of these young alpaca angel mouths might be the attraction of the 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.639
 agricultural centre 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.740
 pet with the appearance of fluff the alpaca more is not 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.529
 wild 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.499
 it's the number of dice 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.499
 a presence very close to the man 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.380
 the announced early 2009 demand are familiar are unparalleled 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.319
 and we can go with the world 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:32.600
 in this breeding they are about sixty animals 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.600
 all were chosen housing ti-culs by their owners 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.220
 to get the animals 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.380
 he did a lot of traveling% and he made me come into the world 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.410
 from england i gave birth to 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.380
 from australia he went to fetch them very far 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.970
 and percent or because we really had a goal of finding a 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.710
 quality of life 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.920
 of really very particular and very specific really with him 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.059
 the fineness of the density 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.120
 e here are the primary qualities of the wilaya 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.370
 in his flock Frederic henry was keen to see both subspecies of alpacas 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.940
 sees it casillas which composes to 90% the race and the much more rare surrisque 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.580
 the hawk-eye installers 101 animal kiala wool that swells me common but 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.280
 what he finds in front of us 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.479
 % and tracking is an animal like the white girl who is here the man who 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.520
 had itself that makes dreadlocks 5% this approach is 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.420
 it's exactly the same animal but for him a young man who does that when 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.680
 even badly she's going to have fiber for what's going to be swimming and the other one that 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.730
 animates a comforting time in this affair 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.080
 from chile of peru alpacas presents a human quality 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.770
 greater than the amount 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.300
 warmer softer and more resistant it is also more expensive 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.330
 and still rare in the clothing of the supermarket 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.920
 we tried to make it very dense that my staff 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 it's something we'll be able to judge it so we take you 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.090
 no time like that fleece 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.700
 m news spread the German three points for the quality of the wool of 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.830
 the animal so we spread the wool and we will seek 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.780
 shine and crime so there if you see 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.659
 the crime that these natural modulations of the fiber 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:13.319
 so it's up to a friend, it's like embossing the sea, that's fine 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.970
 to amuse one will seek this quality so that this brilliance this sweetness 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:21.309
 of hate is that this success knows for the moment this density and we will not 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:24.209
 seek that this season these qualities there is found on the whole 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.349
 of the body of the animal 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.290
 anelka who produced an average of 3 lens captures a year and to get 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.930
 to the best that is 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.870
 frédéric aurier attach particular importance to these 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.829
 stallions 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.299
 it's really shameful 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.129
 it is he who has to improve the flock so it is not essential 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.349
 which dedicates exceptional quality% at the level of the conformation it is necessary that 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.900
 than 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.149
 that his morphology is perfect 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:51.779
 the country make that its very quality is really the but the best that can 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:54.269
 to be it's really essential 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.650
 present for the first time at the show of agriculture frédéric henry va 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.820
 to promote this species 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.250
 no doubt that tagab will be favored by the public
