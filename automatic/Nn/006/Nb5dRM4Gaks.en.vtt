keys with in it this is a little bit
more<00:00:11.000> of<00:00:12.000> an<00:00:12.150> advanced<00:00:12.660> tutorial

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
more of an advanced tutorial

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.169 
more of an advanced tutorial
when<00:00:13.679> first<00:00:13.830> creating<00:00:14.280> templates<00:00:14.790> you

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
when first creating templates you

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.590 
when first creating templates you
probably<00:00:15.630> will<00:00:15.809> not<00:00:15.990> use<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.619> but<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:18.029> when

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
probably will not use this but it when

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.269 
probably will not use this but it when
you<00:00:18.690> get<00:00:18.810> farther<00:00:19.320> into<00:00:19.590> advanced<00:00:20.010> scripting

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
you get farther into advanced scripting

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.130 
you get farther into advanced scripting
with<00:00:20.880> send<00:00:21.090> keys<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.750> want<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.990> have

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
with send keys and you want to have

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.019 
with send keys and you want to have
certain<00:00:22.680> things<00:00:22.920> happen<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.550> might<00:00:23.760> find

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
certain things happen you might find

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.310 
certain things happen you might find
this<00:00:24.180> useful<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.779> will<00:00:24.930> find<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.260> useful

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
this useful you will find this useful

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.060 
this useful you will find this useful
eventually<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:27.150> again<00:00:27.869> I've<00:00:28.019> created<00:00:28.680> a

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
eventually so again I've created a

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.040 
eventually so again I've created a
command<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.640> start<00:00:29.880> off<00:00:30.000> with<00:00:30.240> called<00:00:30.660> example

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
command to start off with called example

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.590 
command to start off with called example
of<00:00:31.140> writing<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.180> use<00:00:33.300> send

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
of writing and in this one we use send

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.600 
of writing and in this one we use send
keys<00:00:33.809> which<00:00:33.960> we've<00:00:34.110> made<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.590> tutorial<00:00:35.130> video

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
keys which we've made a tutorial video

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.670 
keys which we've made a tutorial video
on<00:00:35.850> before<00:00:36.239> using<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.840> double<00:00:37.140> quote<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.559> have

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
on before using a double quote to have

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.740 
on before using a double quote to have
put<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.100> hello<00:00:38.489> world<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.030> then<00:00:39.329> curly

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
put in hello world and then curly

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.540 
put in hello world and then curly
brackets<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.320> push<00:00:40.590> our<00:00:40.829> key<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.129> turn<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.430> move

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
brackets to push our key in turn to move

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.420 
brackets to push our key in turn to move
us<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> next<00:00:42.030> line<00:00:42.800> down<00:00:43.800> here<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> send

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
us to the next line down here is to send

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.060 
us to the next line down here is to send
dragon<00:00:44.820> keys<00:00:45.059> now<00:00:45.300> there's<00:00:45.809> these<00:00:46.410> two<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
dragon keys now there's these two do the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.069 
dragon keys now there's these two do the
same<00:00:47.280> thing<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:48.300> they<00:00:48.420> do<00:00:48.480> them<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> little<00:00:48.960> bit

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
same thing but they do them a little bit

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.619 
same thing but they do them a little bit
differently<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.850> direct<00:00:50.850> send<00:00:51.059> Dragon<00:00:51.420> keys

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
differently and direct send Dragon keys

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.479 
differently and direct send Dragon keys
is<00:00:51.870> along<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.260> dragon<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.219> part<00:00:53.460> of

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
is along with dragon and this is part of

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.229 
is along with dragon and this is part of
the<00:00:53.579> BB<00:00:53.940> script<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.480> send<00:00:54.780> keys<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:56.430> next

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the BB script this send keys so next

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.630 
the BB script this send keys so next
time<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.629> these<00:00:57.870> are<00:00:58.739> note<00:00:59.010> cards<00:00:59.460> that

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
time I have these are note cards that

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.790 
time I have these are note cards that
the<00:01:00.090> send<00:01:00.359> keys<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.780> least<00:01:01.050> compatible<00:01:01.410> in

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
the send keys is least compatible in

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.500 
the send keys is least compatible in
music<00:01:02.160> meaning<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.760> does<00:01:02.940> work<00:01:03.120> within

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
music meaning that it does work within

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.820 
music meaning that it does work within
word<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:03.989> there's<00:01:04.140> some<00:01:04.320> programs<00:01:04.530> you'll

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
word but there's some programs you'll

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.859 
word but there's some programs you'll
find<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.189> send<00:01:05.430> keys<00:01:05.610> doesn't<00:01:06.000> work<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.780> it

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
find that send keys doesn't work but it

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.020 
find that send keys doesn't work but it
is<00:01:07.080> faster<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.100> more<00:01:08.280> reliable<00:01:08.460> then

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
is faster and it is more reliable then

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.160 
is faster and it is more reliable then
we<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.210> want<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:09.479> more<00:01:09.600> reliable<00:01:10.049> because

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
we just want it's more reliable because

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.870 
we just want it's more reliable because
we<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.650> true<00:01:10.950> statement<00:01:11.490> after<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
we have this true statement after and

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.010 
we have this true statement after and
the<00:01:11.939> true<00:01:12.150> stable<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.659> make<00:01:12.780> sure<00:01:12.900> that

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
the true stable and make sure that

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.109 
the true stable and make sure that
everything<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.530> sent<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.100> before<00:01:15.000> it

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
everything is sent in here before it

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.460 
everything is sent in here before it
moves<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> next<00:01:15.990> line

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
moves on to the next line

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.320 
moves on to the next line
there's<00:01:17.070> only<00:01:17.159> I've<00:01:17.729> found<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.210> this

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
there's only I've found that this

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.840 
there's only I've found that this
becomes<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.869> problem<00:01:19.110> with<00:01:19.590> using<00:01:20.250> dialog

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
becomes a problem with using dialog

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.149 
becomes a problem with using dialog
boxes<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.990> dialog<00:01:22.290> box<00:01:22.560> will<00:01:22.770> start

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
boxes that the dialog box will start

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.460 
boxes that the dialog box will start
before<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.420> rest<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.720> hello<00:01:24.900> world<00:01:24.990> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
before the rest of hello world is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.120 
before the rest of hello world is
entered

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
entered

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.920 
entered
so<00:01:26.610> using<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> little<00:01:27.689> bit<00:01:27.780> more

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
so using this is a little bit more

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.050 
so using this is a little bit more
reliable<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.070> only<00:01:29.189> hold<00:01:29.400> under<00:01:29.670> 28

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
reliable and this can only hold under 28

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.910 
reliable and this can only hold under 28
characters<00:01:30.570> meaning<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.560> only<00:01:31.680> hold

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
characters meaning that it can only hold

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.670 
characters meaning that it can only hold
128<00:01:32.670> letters<00:01:32.970> or<00:01:33.270> under<00:01:33.720> 28<00:01:34.110> keys<00:01:34.409> within

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
128 letters or under 28 keys within

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.270 
128 letters or under 28 keys within
these<00:01:35.159> quotes<00:01:36.350> next<00:01:37.350> one<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> send<00:01:37.920> dragon

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
these quotes next one is to send dragon

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.399 
these quotes next one is to send dragon

you're using epics health connected
within<00:01:52.560> Kaiser<00:01:52.950> or<00:01:53.630> some<00:01:54.630> programs<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.079> are

within Kaiser or some programs that are
like<00:01:57.810> those<00:01:58.549> then<00:01:59.549> using<00:02:00.299> sent<00:02:00.899> keys<00:02:01.079> doesn't

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
like those then using sent keys doesn't

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.109 
like those then using sent keys doesn't
always<00:02:01.619> work<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.460> at<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.670> point<00:02:02.880> try

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
always work and so at that point try

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.819 
always work and so at that point try
setting<00:02:03.420> Dragon<00:02:03.899> keys<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.590> most

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
setting Dragon keys and this is most

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:05.959 
setting Dragon keys and this is most
compatible<00:02:05.159> through<00:02:05.579> everything<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
compatible through everything in the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.639 
compatible through everything in the
computer<00:02:06.299> but<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.659> slower<00:02:06.990> write<00:02:07.320> slower

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
computer but it is slower write slower

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.260 
computer but it is slower write slower
and<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.160> less<00:02:08.340> reliable<00:02:08.520> because<00:02:08.910> if<00:02:09.179> you

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
and it is less reliable because if you

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.390 
and it is less reliable because if you
use<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> dialog<00:02:09.810> box<00:02:09.989> after<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.500> this

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
use a dialog box after this this

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.399 
use a dialog box after this this
doesn't<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:12.269> true<00:02:12.569> statement<00:02:12.629> after<00:02:13.290> it

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
doesn't have a true statement after it

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.970 
doesn't have a true statement after it
so<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.680> may<00:02:13.860> overwrite<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:15.709> so<00:02:16.709> if<00:02:16.829> you're

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
so it may overwrite it so if you're

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.369 
so it may overwrite it so if you're
having<00:02:17.189> problems<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:18.150> should<00:02:18.360> be<00:02:18.540> used<00:02:18.989> for

we're<00:02:31.109> going<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.319> start<00:02:31.530> using<00:02:31.650> variables<00:02:32.340> and

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
we're going to start using variables and

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.740 
we're going to start using variables and
that's<00:02:32.609> pretty<00:02:32.849> much<00:02:32.970> what<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.299> tutorial

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
that's pretty much what this tutorial

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.809 
that's pretty much what this tutorial
video<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.989> gonna<00:02:34.079> be<00:02:34.170> about<00:02:34.319> is<00:02:34.769> that<00:02:35.549> we<00:02:35.670> can

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
video is gonna be about is that we can

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.309 
video is gonna be about is that we can
write<00:02:36.000> out<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.209> variable<00:02:36.780> here<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.079> we<00:02:37.170> can

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
write out a variable here and we can

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.920 
write out a variable here and we can
name<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.709> variable<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.819> a<00:02:38.879> block<00:02:39.359> of<00:02:39.569> memory

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
name a variable is a block of memory

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.199 
name a variable is a block of memory
that<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.290> being<00:02:40.379> used<00:02:40.859> by<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.099> computer<00:02:41.700> to

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
that is being used by the computer to

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.089 
that is being used by the computer to
store<00:02:42.510> information<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.500> be<00:02:43.590> used<00:02:43.799> multiple

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
store information to be used multiple

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.979 
store information to be used multiple
times<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.970> if<00:02:45.030> we<00:02:45.150> want<00:02:45.329> to<00:02:45.389> use<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.569> variable

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
times so if we want to use a variable

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.690 
times so if we want to use a variable
but<00:02:46.650> we<00:02:46.739> want<00:02:46.889> to<00:02:46.950> say<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.159> world<00:02:47.280> hello<00:02:47.549> world

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
but we want to say the world hello world

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.539 
but we want to say the world hello world
you<00:02:48.389> know<00:02:48.480> 10<00:02:48.780> times<00:02:48.989> in<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.379> document<00:02:49.859> or<00:02:50.069> more

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
you know 10 times in a document or more

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.280 
you know 10 times in a document or more
it<00:02:51.000> would<00:02:51.120> be<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.239> lot<00:02:51.450> easier<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.900> just<00:02:51.930> write

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
it would be a lot easier to just write

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.069 
it would be a lot easier to just write
in<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.709> variable<00:02:53.430> than<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.329> would<00:02:54.450> be<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.720> write

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
in a variable than it would be to write

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.890 
in a variable than it would be to write
out<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.409> whole<00:02:55.440> hello<00:02:55.889> world<00:02:56.189> inter<00:02:57.000> on<00:02:57.540> there

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
out the whole hello world inter on there

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.869 
out the whole hello world inter on there
so<00:02:58.139> it's<00:02:58.470> less<00:02:58.650> keystrokes<00:02:59.159> it<00:02:59.280> just<00:02:59.700> makes

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
so it's less keystrokes it just makes

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:00.860 
so it's less keystrokes it just makes
things<00:03:00.030> quicker<00:03:00.329> when<00:03:00.569> you<00:03:00.629> get<00:03:00.750> into

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
things quicker when you get into

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.220 
things quicker when you get into
commands<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.920> are<00:03:02.129> 100<00:03:02.939> lines<00:03:03.090> log<00:03:03.420> 600

the<00:03:20.010> variable<00:03:20.400> here<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:22.500> is<00:03:22.590> an<00:03:22.680> example<00:03:23.010> of

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
the variable here this is an example of

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.800 
the variable here this is an example of
how<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.190> using<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.609> string<00:03:24.000> with<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:24.389> with<00:03:24.629> its

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
how to using a string with so with its

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.330 
how to using a string with so with its
ending<00:03:25.019> two<00:03:25.109> double<00:03:25.590> quotes<00:03:25.799> it<00:03:26.010> writes<00:03:26.190> it

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
ending two double quotes it writes it

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.960 
ending two double quotes it writes it
out<00:03:26.430> as<00:03:26.609> a<00:03:26.669> string<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.840> string<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.379> a<00:03:28.440> sentence

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
out as a string a string is a sentence

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.189 
out as a string a string is a sentence
that<00:03:29.970> you're<00:03:30.120> looking<00:03:30.419> to<00:03:30.449> send<00:03:30.720> through<00:03:30.989> but

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:31.199 
that you're looking to send through but

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.140 
that you're looking to send through but
there's<00:03:31.500> no<00:03:31.680> quotes<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.310> will<00:03:32.489> hold<00:03:32.699> a<00:03:32.879> number

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
there's no quotes it will hold a number

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.689 
there's no quotes it will hold a number
such<00:03:33.569> as<00:03:33.599> this<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.560> this<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.889> number<00:03:35.340> variable

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699 
such as this so this a number variable

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:37.550 
such as this so this a number variable
again<00:03:36.359> these<00:03:36.480> can<00:03:36.629> be<00:03:36.690> named<00:03:37.049> whatever<00:03:37.319> we

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
again these can be named whatever we

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.170 
again these can be named whatever we
want<00:03:37.859> to<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.069> just<00:03:38.370> named<00:03:38.519> them<00:03:38.699> this<00:03:38.849> it<00:03:39.060> could

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
want to I just named them this it could

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.309 
want to I just named them this it could
be<00:03:39.299> named<00:03:40.109> number<00:03:41.629> there<00:03:42.629> is<00:03:42.750> one<00:03:42.959> exception

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
be named number there is one exception

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.399 
be named number there is one exception
or<00:03:43.859> there's<00:03:44.129> a<00:03:44.190> few<00:03:44.340> exceptions<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:44.819> are

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
or there's a few exceptions that are

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.469 
or there's a few exceptions that are
reserved<00:03:46.409> words<00:03:46.769> there<00:03:47.669> are<00:03:47.699> words<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.269> are

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
reserved words there are words that are

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.250 
reserved words there are words that are
reserved<00:03:48.930> for<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.970> language<00:03:51.389> itself<00:03:51.780> such<00:03:52.229> as

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
reserved for the language itself such as

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.020 
reserved for the language itself such as
send<00:03:52.620> keys<00:03:52.859> is<00:03:53.129> something<00:03:53.519> that's<00:03:53.669> reserved

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
send keys is something that's reserved

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.759 
send keys is something that's reserved
so<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.209> couldn't<00:03:54.569> name<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.780> variable<00:03:55.139> send<00:03:55.530> keys

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
so I couldn't name a variable send keys

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.319 
so I couldn't name a variable send keys
I<00:03:56.069> couldn't<00:03:56.639> name<00:03:56.879> it<00:03:57.150> count<00:03:57.510> or<00:03:57.810> go-to<00:03:59.329> and

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
I couldn't name it count or go-to and

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.849 
I couldn't name it count or go-to and
certainly<00:04:00.840> there's<00:04:01.139> very<00:04:01.379> few<00:04:01.470> of<00:04:01.769> these

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
certainly there's very few of these

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.009 
certainly there's very few of these
words<00:04:02.129> and<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.519> know<00:04:02.549> unlikely<00:04:03.180> they<00:04:03.359> come

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
words and you know unlikely they come

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.369 
words and you know unlikely they come
across<00:04:04.739> them<00:04:04.949> anyways<00:04:05.280> but<00:04:05.519> such<00:04:05.699> as<00:04:05.849> as<00:04:06.090> as<00:04:06.870> is

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
across them anyways but such as as as is

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.280 
across them anyways but such as as as is
also<00:04:07.799> reserved<00:04:08.129> key<00:04:08.430> or<00:04:08.909> and<00:04:09.540> those<00:04:10.139> are<00:04:10.260> a

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
also reserved key or and those are a

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.589 
also reserved key or and those are a
little<00:04:10.379> bit<00:04:10.560> more<00:04:10.739> likely<00:04:10.949> and<00:04:11.400> you'll<00:04:11.760> see

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
little bit more likely and you'll see

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.300 
little bit more likely and you'll see
that<00:04:12.720> those<00:04:12.900> will<00:04:13.079> pop<00:04:13.290> up<00:04:13.319> in<00:04:13.769> blue<00:04:14.099> if

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
that those will pop up in blue if

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.589 
that those will pop up in blue if
they're<00:04:14.489> already<00:04:14.699> reserved<00:04:15.120> so<00:04:15.269> look<00:04:15.389> at<00:04:15.479> this

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
they're already reserved so look at this

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.810 
they're already reserved so look at this
one<00:04:15.810> down<00:04:15.930> here<00:04:15.989> it<00:04:16.260> says<00:04:16.459> two<00:04:17.459> and

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
one down here it says two and

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.030 
one down here it says two and
-<00:04:18.970> is<00:04:19.270> a<00:04:19.330> reserved<00:04:19.900> word<00:04:20.020> and<00:04:20.440> that's<00:04:20.530> this<00:04:20.920> is

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
- is a reserved word and that's this is

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.770 
- is a reserved word and that's this is
actually<00:04:21.340> supposed<00:04:21.550> to<00:04:21.670> be<00:04:21.730> part<00:04:22.150> of<00:04:22.360> my

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.060 

sample<00:04:25.780> down<00:04:25.990> here<00:04:26.350> so<00:04:26.710> there's<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.890> good

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
sample down here so there's a good

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.590 
sample down here so there's a good
little<00:04:27.220> bit<00:04:27.370> of<00:04:27.460> video<00:04:27.790> editing<00:04:27.970> light<00:04:28.360> that

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
little bit of video editing light that

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.540 
little bit of video editing light that
might<00:04:28.960> throw<00:04:29.860> you<00:04:29.920> off<00:04:30.010> a<00:04:30.040> little<00:04:30.310> bit<00:04:30.430> but

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
might throw you off a little bit but

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.530 
might throw you off a little bit but
this<00:04:30.640> is<00:04:30.760> how<00:04:30.820> it<00:04:30.940> should<00:04:31.090> look

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
this is how it should look

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.560 
this is how it should look
so<00:04:32.350> here<00:04:32.680> we<00:04:32.800> have<00:04:32.980> another<00:04:33.310> number<00:04:33.760> which<00:04:34.450> is

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
so here we have another number which is

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.270 
so here we have another number which is
going<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:34.810> also<00:04:34.990> be<00:04:35.140> a<00:04:35.290> variable<00:04:35.800> but<00:04:35.950> here

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
going to also be a variable but here

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.490 
going to also be a variable but here
we're<00:04:36.400> going<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.580> use<00:04:36.640> the<00:04:37.180> variable<00:04:37.570> 3<00:04:38.230> a

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
we're going to use the variable 3 a

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.270 
we're going to use the variable 3 a
number<00:04:39.490> plus<00:04:40.060> 3<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:41.800> we're<00:04:42.010> going<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.160> use

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
number plus 3 so we're going to use

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.740 
number plus 3 so we're going to use
another<00:04:42.580> number<00:04:42.880> it's<00:04:43.120> going<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.330> call<00:04:43.510> both

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
another number it's going to call both

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.000 
another number it's going to call both
of<00:04:43.870> these<00:04:43.960> so<00:04:44.140> this<00:04:44.260> is<00:04:44.410> going<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.590> turn<00:04:44.740> into

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
of these so this is going to turn into

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.160 
of these so this is going to turn into
another<00:04:45.100> number<00:04:45.460> is<00:04:45.790> equal<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.120> 3<00:04:46.510> plus<00:04:46.690> 3

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
another number is equal to 3 plus 3

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.870 
another number is equal to 3 plus 3
because<00:04:47.740> it's<00:04:47.980> using<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.370> number<00:04:48.550> twice<00:04:48.700> so<00:04:48.850> you

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
because it's using a number twice so you

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.340 
because it's using a number twice so you
can<00:04:48.970> use<00:04:49.210> this<00:04:49.360> as<00:04:49.510> many<00:04:49.720> times<00:04:49.960> as<00:04:50.110> you<00:04:50.230> want

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
can use this as many times as you want

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.050 
can use this as many times as you want
you<00:04:50.590> can<00:04:50.710> also<00:04:50.830> use<00:04:51.070> multiple<00:04:51.220> subtraction

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
you can also use multiple subtraction

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.540 
you can also use multiple subtraction
division<00:04:52.210> this<00:04:53.170> is<00:04:53.410> this<00:04:53.680> add<00:04:53.920> sign<00:04:54.280> here

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
division this is this add sign here

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.550 
division this is this add sign here
since<00:04:54.820> it's<00:04:54.970> not<00:04:55.090> inside<00:04:55.480> quotes<00:04:55.780> is<00:04:56.050> called

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
since it's not inside quotes is called

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.290 
since it's not inside quotes is called
an<00:04:56.650> operator<00:04:57.160> and<00:04:57.430> then<00:04:57.580> we<00:04:57.700> can<00:04:57.850> do<00:04:58.000> less<00:04:58.270> than

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
an operator and then we can do less than

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.510 
an operator and then we can do less than
or<00:04:58.690> equal<00:04:58.750> then<00:04:59.170> science<00:04:59.650> those<00:05:00.160> are<00:05:00.370> all

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
or equal then science those are all

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.690 
or equal then science those are all
operators<00:05:01.380> that<00:05:02.380> will<00:05:02.530> work<00:05:02.680> for<00:05:02.920> this<00:05:03.070> so<00:05:03.610> if

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
operators that will work for this so if

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.970 
operators that will work for this so if
we<00:05:03.790> want<00:05:03.970> to<00:05:04.090> do<00:05:04.240> another<00:05:04.870> number<00:05:05.020> 3<00:05:05.710> is

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
we want to do another number 3 is

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.550 
we want to do another number 3 is
greater<00:05:06.940> than<00:05:07.030> another<00:05:07.450> number<00:05:07.510> we<00:05:08.230> can<00:05:08.410> use

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
greater than another number we can use

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.610 
greater than another number we can use
that<00:05:08.770> and<00:05:09.550> those<00:05:10.540> would<00:05:10.660> be<00:05:10.990> little<00:05:11.200> bit<00:05:11.320> dolls

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
that and those would be little bit dolls

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.200 
that and those would be little bit dolls
do<00:05:11.830> those<00:05:11.980> in<00:05:12.100> another<00:05:12.190> video<00:05:12.490> tutorial<00:05:12.820> it's

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
do those in another video tutorial it's

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.840 
do those in another video tutorial it's
a<00:05:13.270> little<00:05:13.420> bit<00:05:13.540> more<00:05:13.720> advanced<00:05:14.430> so<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.610> send

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
a little bit more advanced so the send

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.340 
a little bit more advanced so the send
keys<00:05:16.000> down<00:05:16.150> here<00:05:16.390> is<00:05:16.450> gonna<00:05:16.570> send<00:05:16.840> our<00:05:17.050> send

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
keys down here is gonna send our send

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.890 
keys down here is gonna send our send
Keys<00:05:17.530> a<00:05:17.710> bill<00:05:18.070> a<00:05:18.610> variable<00:05:19.300> which<00:05:19.510> is<00:05:19.630> gonna<00:05:19.750> be

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
Keys a bill a variable which is gonna be

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.630 
Keys a bill a variable which is gonna be
hello<00:05:20.080> world<00:05:20.410> enter<00:05:20.890> and<00:05:21.100> then<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.280> next<00:05:21.490> one

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
hello world enter and then the next one

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.890 
hello world enter and then the next one
is<00:05:21.730> going<00:05:21.850> to<00:05:21.910> send<00:05:22.120> our<00:05:22.210> send<00:05:22.390> keys<00:05:22.570> which<00:05:22.720> is

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
is going to send our send keys which is

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.570 
is going to send our send keys which is
gonna<00:05:23.020> be<00:05:23.080> a<00:05:23.110> number<00:05:23.650> which<00:05:23.800> is<00:05:23.920> gonna<00:05:24.070> be<00:05:24.220> 3

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
gonna be a number which is gonna be 3

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.030 
gonna be a number which is gonna be 3
and<00:05:24.820> then<00:05:25.420> oh<00:05:25.570> I<00:05:25.780> put<00:05:26.050> this<00:05:26.260> entering<00:05:26.710> so<00:05:26.950> it

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
and then oh I put this entering so it

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.830 
and then oh I put this entering so it
jumps<00:05:27.370> down<00:05:27.520> another<00:05:27.880> line<00:05:28.240> and<00:05:28.540> then<00:05:28.750> we're

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
jumps down another line and then we're

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.450 
jumps down another line and then we're
gonna<00:05:28.930> have<00:05:29.170> our<00:05:29.470> another<00:05:29.830> number<00:05:30.070> which<00:05:30.280> is

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
gonna have our another number which is

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.410 
gonna have our another number which is
going<00:05:30.610> to<00:05:30.670> be<00:05:30.820> 3<00:05:31.060> plus<00:05:31.090> 3<00:05:31.450> so<00:05:31.750> it's<00:05:31.870> gonna<00:05:31.960> be<00:05:32.140> 6

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
going to be 3 plus 3 so it's gonna be 6

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.850 
going to be 3 plus 3 so it's gonna be 6
so<00:05:34.420> we're<00:05:34.930> gonna<00:05:35.020> go<00:05:35.140> ahead<00:05:35.200> and<00:05:35.290> call<00:05:35.470> this<00:05:35.650> is

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
so we're gonna go ahead and call this is

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.220 
so we're gonna go ahead and call this is
this<00:05:35.980> example<00:05:36.580> of<00:05:36.700> writing<00:05:36.910> and<00:05:37.240> most<00:05:37.990> of<00:05:38.140> it

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
this example of writing and most of it

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:45.290 
this example of writing and most of it
does<00:05:39.090> example<00:05:40.090> of<00:05:40.150> writing<00:05:43.110> so

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
does example of writing so

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.360 
does example of writing so
and<00:05:45.900> bring<00:05:46.199> back<00:05:46.470> our<00:05:48.620> command<00:05:49.620> here<00:05:49.889> and<00:05:50.039> so

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
and bring back our command here and so

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.650 
and bring back our command here and so
we<00:05:50.460> can<00:05:50.580> see<00:05:50.699> that<00:05:50.849> the<00:05:50.940> send<00:05:51.150> Keys<00:05:51.330> hello

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
we can see that the send Keys hello

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.189 
we can see that the send Keys hello
world<00:05:52.199> enter<00:05:52.949> send<00:05:53.789> keys<00:05:54.000> dragon<00:05:54.569> Keys<00:05:54.780> hello

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
world enter send keys dragon Keys hello

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.850 
world enter send keys dragon Keys hello
world<00:05:55.590> enter<00:05:56.069> which<00:05:56.610> is<00:05:56.729> this<00:05:56.910> one<00:05:57.120> a<00:05:57.860> variable

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
world enter which is this one a variable

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.860 
world enter which is this one a variable
which<00:05:59.039> is<00:05:59.160> right<00:05:59.370> here<00:05:59.400> send<00:05:59.880> keys<00:06:00.060> a<00:06:00.090> variable

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
which is right here send keys a variable

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.499 
which is right here send keys a variable
which<00:06:01.110> is<00:06:01.259> hello<00:06:01.710> world<00:06:01.740> enter<00:06:02.460> it's<00:06:03.360> right

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
which is hello world enter it's right

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:03.890 
which is hello world enter it's right
here

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
here

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.339 
here
and<00:06:04.490> then<00:06:05.490> we<00:06:05.639> have<00:06:05.849> our<00:06:06.210> send<00:06:06.599> keys<00:06:06.810> inter

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
and then we have our send keys inter

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.270 
and then we have our send keys inter
which<00:06:07.560> drops<00:06:07.860> us<00:06:08.160> down<00:06:08.190> to<00:06:08.819> down<00:06:09.810> to<00:06:10.020> here<00:06:10.349> are

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
which drops us down to down to here are

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.990 
which drops us down to down to here are
the<00:06:12.050> sorry<00:06:13.050> this<00:06:13.440> part<00:06:13.710> calls<00:06:13.949> enter<00:06:14.430> and<00:06:14.880> then

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
the sorry this part calls enter and then

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.180 
the sorry this part calls enter and then
drops<00:06:15.330> us<00:06:15.509> down<00:06:15.539> to<00:06:15.870> this<00:06:15.960> 3<00:06:16.349> where<00:06:16.650> we<00:06:16.770> write<00:06:16.979> a

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
drops us down to this 3 where we write a

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.580 
drops us down to this 3 where we write a
number<00:06:17.430> which<00:06:18.389> is<00:06:18.569> this<00:06:18.750> number<00:06:19.259> right<00:06:19.440> here

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
number which is this number right here

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.260 
number which is this number right here
which<00:06:19.919> writes<00:06:20.130> three<00:06:20.400> and<00:06:20.639> then<00:06:20.729> inter-site

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
which writes three and then inter-site

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.969 
which writes three and then inter-site
number<00:06:21.509> gets<00:06:21.690> down<00:06:21.870> and<00:06:21.900> one<00:06:22.080> more<00:06:22.349> which<00:06:22.949> is

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
number gets down and one more which is

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:24.499 
number gets down and one more which is
right<00:06:23.340> another<00:06:23.639> number<00:06:23.909> which<00:06:24.180> is<00:06:24.330> right<00:06:24.479> here

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:24.509 
right another number which is right here

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.370 
right another number which is right here
which<00:06:24.720> is<00:06:24.990> three<00:06:25.229> plus<00:06:25.500> three<00:06:25.530> equals<00:06:25.919> six

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
which is three plus three equals six

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.260 
which is three plus three equals six
this<00:06:28.380> way<00:06:28.979> of<00:06:29.159> using<00:06:29.370> operators<00:06:30.030> and

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
this way of using operators and

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.219 
this way of using operators and
variables<00:06:30.440> this<00:06:31.440> is<00:06:31.770> a<00:06:32.130> little<00:06:32.460> complicated

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
variables this is a little complicated

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:35.180 
variables this is a little complicated
and<00:06:34.229> if<00:06:34.319> you're<00:06:34.440> just<00:06:34.470> making<00:06:34.889> basic

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
and if you're just making basic

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.309 
and if you're just making basic
templates<00:06:35.819> you<00:06:36.389> won't<00:06:36.539> really<00:06:36.780> need<00:06:37.050> to<00:06:37.169> see

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 
templates you won't really need to see

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:41.300 
templates you won't really need to see
this<00:06:37.470> yet<00:06:38.060> when<00:06:39.060> you<00:06:39.150> get<00:06:39.419> more<00:06:39.990> into<00:06:40.380> more

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
this yet when you get more into more

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.159 
this yet when you get more into more
advanced<00:06:41.580> scripting<00:06:41.880> or<00:06:42.389> you<00:06:42.509> make<00:06:42.690> commands

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
advanced scripting or you make commands

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.180 
advanced scripting or you make commands
that<00:06:43.470> are<00:06:43.620> more<00:06:43.770> complicated<00:06:44.190> and<00:06:44.699> are

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
that are more complicated and are

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.499 
that are more complicated and are
optional<00:06:47.190> things<00:06:47.580> that<00:06:47.759> go<00:06:47.909> into<00:06:48.090> it<00:06:48.180> that<00:06:48.449> you

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:48.509 
optional things that go into it that you

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.360 
optional things that go into it that you
want<00:06:48.750> to<00:06:48.810> have<00:06:48.930> other<00:06:49.169> things<00:06:49.469> happen<00:06:49.919> when

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
want to have other things happen when

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.890 
want to have other things happen when
certain<00:06:51.440> variables<00:06:52.440> are<00:06:52.590> different<00:06:53.900> sorry
