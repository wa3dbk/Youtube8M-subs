00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
difference between good quality and poor

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.240 
difference between good quality and poor
quality<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:21.170> know<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.319> can<00:02:21.530> try<00:02:21.799> it<00:02:21.859> on<00:02:22.040> you

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
quality you know you can try it on you

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.059

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
can feel it you can touch it and you can

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.440

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
actually tell the difference I think the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.199 
actually tell the difference I think the
customer<00:02:26.959> is<00:02:27.139> pretty<00:02:27.680> smart<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:28.969> think

that if clothing manufacturers of people

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.030 
that if clothing manufacturers of people
think<00:02:32.689> that<00:02:32.810> they're<00:02:32.930> stupid<00:02:33.170> they're<00:02:33.530> wrong

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
think that they're stupid they're wrong

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.369 
think that they're stupid they're wrong
because<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.790> customer<00:02:35.239> is<00:02:35.269> very<00:02:35.719> bright<00:02:36.079> and
