for a while
death<00:00:46.510> row<00:00:47.100> studios<00:00:48.100> all<00:00:48.309> the<00:00:48.489> artists<00:00:48.879> like

Snoop Dogg and to fact they did all
their<00:00:50.769> records<00:00:50.980> here<00:00:51.309> I<00:00:54.570> think<00:00:55.570> that<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.780> main

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
their records here I think that the main

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.410 
their records here I think that the main
difference<00:00:56.830> is<00:00:57.339> that<00:00:57.519> we<00:00:58.180> are<00:00:58.210> definitely

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
difference is that we are definitely

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.149 
difference is that we are definitely
more<00:00:58.750> confident<00:00:59.260> because<00:00:59.500> I<00:00:59.769> mean<00:00:59.920> we<00:01:00.040> already

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
more confident because I mean we already

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.270 
more confident because I mean we already
worked<00:01:00.549> with<00:01:00.729> Donnie<00:01:01.290> before<00:01:02.290> so<00:01:02.920> we<00:01:03.129> knew

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
worked with Donnie before so we knew

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.510 
worked with Donnie before so we knew
each<00:01:03.339> other<00:01:03.699> and<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.920> changes<00:01:05.920> things<00:01:06.100> because

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
each other and it changes things because

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.420 
each other and it changes things because
you<00:01:06.670> know<00:01:06.700> you<00:01:06.850> you<00:01:07.000> have<00:01:07.390> more<00:01:07.950> ability<00:01:08.950> to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
you know you you have more ability to

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.539 
you know you you have more ability to
work<00:01:09.790> better<00:01:10.060> in<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.630> more<00:01:10.920> confident<00:01:11.920> way<00:01:12.250> in<00:01:12.460> a

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
work better in a more confident way in a

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.940 
work better in a more confident way in a
more<00:01:12.729> relaxed<00:01:13.210> way<00:01:13.440> because<00:01:14.440> he<00:01:14.560> knows<00:01:14.740> what

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
more relaxed way because he knows what

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.060 
more relaxed way because he knows what
can<00:01:15.280> you<00:01:15.820> know<00:01:15.940> deliver<00:01:16.299> and<00:01:17.170> we<00:01:17.350> know<00:01:17.500> what<00:01:17.979> it

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
can deliver it's kind of a constant

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.730 
can deliver it's kind of a constant
challenge<00:01:19.630> you<00:01:19.960> know<00:01:20.080> between<00:01:20.260> each<00:01:20.590> other
