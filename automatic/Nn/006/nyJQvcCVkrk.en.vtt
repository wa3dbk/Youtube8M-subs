00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.950 

but<00:01:35.400> then<00:01:35.900> when<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.380> has<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.280> incorrect<00:01:38.580> sim

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
but then when it has the incorrect sim

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.410 
but then when it has the incorrect sim
