has been sitting for a while and it has

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.820 
has been sitting for a while and it has
no<00:01:00.699> winding<00:01:01.210> you're<00:01:02.019> gonna<00:01:02.140> have<00:01:02.350> two<00:01:02.470> window

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
no winding you're gonna have two window

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.770 
no winding you're gonna have two window
mechanism<00:01:03.430> up<00:01:03.549> there<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:03.970> tension<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.449> spring

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
mechanism up there to tension the spring

mechanism up there to tension the spring
two<00:01:05.680> fingers<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:06.280> always<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.729> best<00:01:06.939> way<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:07.119> do

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
two fingers is always the best way to do

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.090

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
it so you don't put unnecessary stress

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.730 
it so you don't put unnecessary stress
with<00:01:09.310> one<00:01:09.610> finger<00:01:10.090> two<00:01:10.540> fingers<00:01:10.619> you're<00:01:11.619> gonna

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
with one finger two fingers you're gonna

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.749 
with one finger two fingers you're gonna
do<00:01:11.950> 15<00:01:12.750> one<00:01:13.750> two<00:01:14.409> you<00:01:14.680> see<00:01:14.890> one<00:01:15.100> time<00:01:15.369> up<00:01:15.609> is

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
do 15 one two you see one time up is

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.810 
do 15 one two you see one time up is
what<00:01:15.909> I<00:01:15.939> call<00:01:16.240> one<00:01:16.479> so<00:01:16.750> 15<00:01:17.409> of<00:01:17.560> these<00:01:17.770> will<00:01:18.700> be

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
what I call one so 15 of these will be

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.819 
what I call one so 15 of these will be
more<00:01:19.060> than<00:01:19.179> enough<00:01:19.240> to<00:01:19.659> wind<00:01:19.840> it<00:01:20.020> up<00:01:20.140> correctly

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
more than enough to wind it up correctly

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.080 
more than enough to wind it up correctly
from<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:21.159> point<00:01:21.369> on<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.700> automatic

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
from that point on the automatic

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.749 
from that point on the automatic
function<00:01:22.630> will<00:01:22.780> take<00:01:22.960> over<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.609> lot<00:01:24.609> of

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
function will take over a lot of

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.849 
function will take over a lot of
questions<00:01:25.149> are<00:01:25.359> can<00:01:25.780> i<00:01:25.899> wine<00:01:26.109> my<00:01:26.320> watch

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
questions are can i wine my watch

questions are can i wine my watch
if<00:01:26.920> it<00:01:27.369> goes<00:01:27.520> backwards<00:01:27.850> when<00:01:28.299> you<00:01:28.420> turn<00:01:28.719> this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
if it goes backwards when you turn this

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.099 
if it goes backwards when you turn this
backwards<00:01:29.770> or<00:01:30.070> counterclockwise<00:01:30.899> it<00:01:31.899> does

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
backwards or counterclockwise it does

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.590 
backwards or counterclockwise it does
not<00:01:32.259> do<00:01:32.469> anything<00:01:32.740> only<00:01:33.670> when<00:01:34.119> you<00:01:34.240> turn<00:01:34.450> it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
not do anything only when you turn it

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.830 
not do anything only when you turn it
forward<00:01:35.020> or<00:01:35.409> clockwise<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.880> wanted<00:01:37.539> wines

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
forward or clockwise it wanted wines

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.109 
forward or clockwise it wanted wines
you'll<00:01:38.530> feel<00:01:38.829> the<00:01:38.979> tension<00:01:39.369> on<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.520> crown<00:01:39.850> and

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
you'll feel the tension on the crown and

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.050 
you'll feel the tension on the crown and
you'll<00:01:40.479> hear<00:01:40.689> it<00:01:40.780> as<00:01:40.899> well<00:01:41.909> once<00:01:42.909> that's

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
you'll hear it as well once that's

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.730 
you'll hear it as well once that's
already<00:01:43.359> done<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.780> next<00:01:43.960> step<00:01:44.200> is<00:01:44.380> let's<00:01:44.590> go

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
already done the next step is let's go

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.249 
already done the next step is let's go
ahead<00:01:44.859> and<00:01:45.039> let's<00:01:45.189> set<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.520> date<00:01:46.140> move<00:01:47.140> the

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
ahead and let's set the date move the

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.620 
ahead and let's set the date move the
crown<00:01:47.530> out<00:01:47.710> one<00:01:48.189> more<00:01:48.460> one<00:01:48.999> more<00:01:49.030> click<00:01:49.450> out

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
crown out one more one more click out

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.830 
crown out one more one more click out
and<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.979> got<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.280> date<00:01:51.490> function<00:01:51.729> again<00:01:52.509> if

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
and you got the date function again if

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.109 
and you got the date function again if
you<00:01:52.990> turn<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:53.409> crown<00:01:53.619> backwards<00:01:54.249> or

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
you turn the crown backwards or

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.480 
you turn the crown backwards or
counterclockwise<00:01:55.719> doesn't<00:01:56.590> do<00:01:56.649> anything<00:01:57.069> you

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
counterclockwise doesn't do anything you

let's<00:02:17.620> just<00:02:17.800> say<00:02:19.349> 8:30<00:02:20.370> right<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:22.019> push<00:02:23.019> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
let's just say 8:30 right so push the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.729 
let's just say 8:30 right so push the
crown<00:02:23.380> all<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.950> way<00:02:24.069> in<00:02:25.500> now<00:02:26.500> you're<00:02:26.650> gonna

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
crown all the way in now you're gonna

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.620 
crown all the way in now you're gonna
have<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.069> put<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.459> little<00:02:27.790> bit<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.090> pressure<00:02:28.300> in

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
have to put a little bit of pressure in

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.559 
have to put a little bit of pressure in
just<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.200> get<00:02:29.380> started<00:02:29.849> once<00:02:30.849> it<00:02:31.030> catches<00:02:31.420> on

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
just to get started once it catches on

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.000 
just to get started once it catches on
the<00:02:31.780> threads<00:02:32.080> we're<00:02:32.530> gonna<00:02:32.650> go<00:02:32.830> ahead<00:02:32.890> and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
the threads we're gonna go ahead and

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.580 
the threads we're gonna go ahead and
screw<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.340> all<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.819> way<00:02:33.940> down

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
screw it all the way down

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.020 
screw it all the way down
remember<00:02:35.590> not<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:35.920> over<00:02:36.250> tighten<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.700> just

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
remember not to over tighten it just

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.089 
remember not to over tighten it just
leave<00:02:37.239> it<00:02:37.390> snug<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:38.410> that's<00:02:38.739> some<00:02:38.890> quick

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
leave it snug and that's some quick

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.890 
leave it snug and that's some quick
simple<00:02:39.340> steps<00:02:39.700> on<00:02:39.849> how<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.060> set<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.480> time<00:02:40.690> and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
simple steps on how to set the time and

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.280 
simple steps on how to set the time and
the<00:02:41.140> date<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:43.000> next<00:02:43.150> model<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.630> discuss<00:02:44.019> is

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
the date the next model to discuss is

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.500 
the date the next model to discuss is
the<00:02:44.440> Rolex<00:02:44.769> Daytona<00:02:44.920> very<00:02:45.849> similar<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.420> the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
the Rolex Daytona very similar to the

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.900 
the Rolex Daytona very similar to the
previous<00:02:46.720> ones<00:02:47.190> except<00:02:48.190> it's<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.430> lot<00:02:48.610> simpler

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
previous ones except it's a lot simpler

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.130 
previous ones except it's a lot simpler
because<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.269> doesn't<00:02:49.480> have<00:02:49.599> a<00:02:49.630> date<00:02:49.840> function

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
because it doesn't have a date function

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.710 
because it doesn't have a date function
so<00:02:50.590> it's<00:02:50.709> very<00:02:50.950> straightforward<00:02:51.310> just<00:02:52.030> wind

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
so it's very straightforward just wind

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.100 
so it's very straightforward just wind
up<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.019> mechanism<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.890> set<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.519> time<00:02:55.049> now<00:02:56.049> to

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
up the mechanism and set the time now to

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.740 
up the mechanism and set the time now to
set<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.470> Daytona<00:02:57.000> it's<00:02:58.000> very<00:02:58.239> simple<00:02:58.630> and

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
set the Daytona it's very simple and

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.800 
set the Daytona it's very simple and
straightforward<00:02:59.049> all<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.040> requires<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.810> we're

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
straightforward all it requires is we're

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.199 
straightforward all it requires is we're
gonna<00:03:01.930> unscrew<00:03:02.349> the<00:03:02.590> crown<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:03.849> unscrew<00:03:04.180> the

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
gonna unscrew the crown to unscrew the

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.910 
gonna unscrew the crown to unscrew the
crown<00:03:04.420> we're<00:03:04.720> gonna<00:03:04.840> turn<00:03:05.079> it<00:03:05.230> backwards<00:03:05.440> or

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
crown we're gonna turn it backwards or

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.740 
crown we're gonna turn it backwards or
counterclockwise<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:08.970> few<00:03:09.970> turns<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.600> it's

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
counterclockwise a few turns and it's

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.319 
counterclockwise a few turns and it's
gonna<00:03:10.870> free<00:03:11.200> up<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.560> pop<00:03:11.739> out<00:03:12.030> once<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.150> pops

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
gonna free up and pop out once it pops

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.080 
gonna free up and pop out once it pops
out<00:03:13.540> we're<00:03:13.780> in<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.019> winding<00:03:14.410> position<00:03:15.090> and

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
out we're in the winding position and

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.580 
out we're in the winding position and
remember<00:03:16.480> although<00:03:16.630> it's<00:03:16.870> automatic<00:03:17.380> it

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
remember although it's automatic it

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.990 
remember although it's automatic it
still<00:03:17.829> needs<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.010> be<00:03:18.100> wound<00:03:18.370> up<00:03:18.579> if<00:03:18.790> there's

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
still needs to be wound up if there's

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.819 
still needs to be wound up if there's
been<00:03:19.090> sitting<00:03:19.450> in<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.630> safe<00:03:19.870> for<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.530> little

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
been sitting in the safe for a little

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.280 
been sitting in the safe for a little
while<00:03:21.690> we're<00:03:22.690> gonna<00:03:22.750> go<00:03:22.930> ahead<00:03:22.989> we're<00:03:23.170> going

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
while we're gonna go ahead we're going

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.729 
while we're gonna go ahead we're going
to<00:03:23.350> turn<00:03:23.560> this<00:03:23.769> forward<00:03:24.639> or<00:03:25.060> clockwise<00:03:25.739> two

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
to turn this forward or clockwise two

fingers on the crown at all times it's

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.479 
fingers on the crown at all times it's
gonna<00:03:28.870> help<00:03:29.109> save<00:03:29.319> any<00:03:29.590> stress<00:03:29.950> on<00:03:30.190> the

gonna help save any stress on the

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.960 
gonna help save any stress on the
mechanism<00:03:31.060> through<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.870> stem<00:03:32.519> 15<00:03:33.519> turns<00:03:33.760> is

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.759 
mechanism through the stem 15 turns is
more<00:03:34.180> than<00:03:34.329> plenty<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:35.139> get<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.410> going<00:03:35.620> from

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
more than plenty to get it going from

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.800 
more than plenty to get it going from
that<00:03:35.889> point<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.250> automatic<00:03:36.730> function<00:03:37.480> will

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
that point the automatic function will

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.140 
that point the automatic function will
take<00:03:37.989> over<00:03:38.220> once<00:03:39.220> we<00:03:39.340> have<00:03:39.459> wound<00:03:39.790> up<00:03:39.970> we're

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.920 
the obvious hands move clockwise when
you<00:03:55.420> turn<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:55.810> backwards<00:03:56.730> counterclockwise

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
you turn it backwards counterclockwise

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.500 
you turn it backwards counterclockwise
we<00:03:58.930> get<00:03:59.079> the<00:03:59.200> same<00:03:59.410> effect<00:03:59.739> on<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.519> dial<00:04:00.730> so

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
we get the same effect on the dial so

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.430 
we get the same effect on the dial so
we're<00:04:01.599> gonna<00:04:01.690> go<00:04:01.840> ahead<00:04:01.900> we're<00:04:02.049> gonna<00:04:02.139> set

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
we're gonna go ahead we're gonna set

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.039 
we're gonna go ahead we're gonna set
this<00:04:02.650> just<00:04:03.430> an<00:04:03.609> example<00:04:03.910> I<00:04:04.329> don't<00:04:04.840> know<00:04:04.989> two

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
this just an example I don't know two

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.809 
this just an example I don't know two
thirty<00:04:05.730> like<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.170> now<00:04:08.250> once<00:04:09.250> we're<00:04:09.430> done<00:04:09.579> we'll

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
thirty like so now once we're done we'll

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.550 
thirty like so now once we're done we'll
then<00:04:09.940> ready<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.209> seal<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.630> crown

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
then ready to seal the crown

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.800 
then ready to seal the crown
push<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.400> in<00:04:12.489> right<00:04:12.640> there<00:04:12.819> first<00:04:13.060> click<00:04:13.360> now

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
push it in right there first click now

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.170 
push it in right there first click now
to<00:04:14.080> seal<00:04:14.530> again<00:04:15.069> just<00:04:15.459> like<00:04:15.550> the<00:04:15.700> Submariner

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
to seal again just like the Submariner

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.039 
to seal again just like the Submariner
you<00:04:16.359> push<00:04:16.750> it<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.109> turn<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.410> little<00:04:17.650> bit<00:04:19.049> then

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
you push it and turn a little bit then

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.810 
you push it and turn a little bit then
just<00:04:20.350> go<00:04:20.500> ahead<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:20.859> turn<00:04:21.040> it<00:04:21.250> forward<00:04:21.519> or

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
just go ahead and turn it forward or

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.640 
just go ahead and turn it forward or
clockwise<00:04:21.880> on<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.660> crown<00:04:22.870> until<00:04:23.110> it<00:04:23.320> seals

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
clockwise on the crown until it seals

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.050 
clockwise on the crown until it seals
snug<00:04:24.190> no<00:04:24.580> need<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:24.910> over<00:04:25.270> tighten<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:27.060> and

snug no need to over tighten it and

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.750 
snug no need to over tighten it and
that's<00:04:28.270> it<00:04:28.419> for<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.630> Daytona<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:29.490> last<00:04:30.490> but

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
that's it for the Daytona and last but

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.920 
that's it for the Daytona and last but
not<00:04:30.850> least<00:04:31.120> we<00:04:31.810> have<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:32.350> GMT<00:04:33.450> very<00:04:34.450> similar

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
not least we have the GMT very similar

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.140 
not least we have the GMT very similar
overall<00:04:35.260> except<00:04:36.100> it<00:04:36.160> has<00:04:36.280> one<00:04:36.550> more<00:04:36.760> extra

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
time zone we have to adjust I'm gonna go

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:40.950 
time zone we have to adjust I'm gonna go
over<00:04:39.760> it<00:04:39.910> through<00:04:40.060> step<00:04:40.270> by<00:04:40.300> step<00:04:40.419> on<00:04:40.750> how<00:04:40.930> to

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
over it through step by step on how to

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.280 
over it through step by step on how to
adjust<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.470> GMT<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.970> GMT<00:04:43.360> master<00:04:43.690> 2<00:04:43.870> is<00:04:44.020> very

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
adjust the GMT the GMT master 2 is very

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.560 
adjust the GMT the GMT master 2 is very
similar<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:44.950> previous<00:04:45.100> watches<00:04:45.669> just<00:04:46.330> has

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
similar to the previous watches just has

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.940 
similar to the previous watches just has
a<00:04:46.600> little<00:04:46.960> bit<00:04:47.020> of<00:04:47.080> an<00:04:47.229> extra<00:04:47.470> function

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
a little bit of an extra function

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.610 
a little bit of an extra function
because<00:04:48.550> of<00:04:48.700> the<00:04:48.760> dual<00:04:48.940> time<00:04:49.240> feature<00:04:49.620> dual

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
because of the dual time feature dual

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.980 
because of the dual time feature dual
time<00:04:50.919> is<00:04:51.250> gonna<00:04:51.760> be<00:04:51.850> indicated<00:04:52.450> by<00:04:52.540> that<00:04:52.570> blue

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
time is gonna be indicated by that blue

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.620 
time is gonna be indicated by that blue
arrow<00:04:53.229> right<00:04:53.530> there<00:04:54.090> so<00:04:55.090> let's<00:04:55.300> start<00:04:55.510> off

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
arrow right there so let's start off

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.030 
arrow right there so let's start off
with<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:55.900> same<00:04:56.080> steps<00:04:56.410> as<00:04:56.560> before<00:04:56.590> we're

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
with the same steps as before we're

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.950 
with the same steps as before we're
gonna<00:04:57.130> unscrew<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.880> crown<00:04:58.000> backwards<00:04:58.750> or

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
gonna unscrew the crown backwards or

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.490 
gonna unscrew the crown backwards or
counterclockwise<00:04:59.880> to<00:05:00.880> open<00:05:01.270> up<00:05:01.419> the<00:05:02.260> crown

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
counterclockwise to open up the crown

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.790 
counterclockwise to open up the crown
right<00:05:03.490> there<00:05:04.050> again<00:05:05.050> if<00:05:05.229> it's<00:05:05.380> been<00:05:05.500> sitting

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
right there again if it's been sitting

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.500 
right there again if it's been sitting
in<00:05:05.889> the<00:05:06.010> safe<00:05:06.220> for<00:05:06.430> a<00:05:06.520> couple<00:05:06.790> weeks<00:05:06.820> months

gonna wind it forward or clockwise two
fingers<00:05:12.550> again<00:05:13.080> 15<00:05:14.080> turns<00:05:14.320> is<00:05:14.500> more<00:05:14.650> than

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
fingers again 15 turns is more than

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.730 
fingers again 15 turns is more than
enough<00:05:15.240> now<00:05:16.240> I<00:05:16.270> like<00:05:16.660> to<00:05:16.810> I<00:05:16.990> like<00:05:17.080> to<00:05:17.289> set<00:05:17.620> the
