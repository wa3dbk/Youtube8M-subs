windy day as usual or so good job the
getting<00:02:12.820> rocks<00:02:13.030> on<00:02:13.269> that<00:02:13.420> side<00:02:13.660> I'm<00:02:13.840> digging

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
getting rocks on that side I'm digging

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.190 
getting rocks on that side I'm digging
this<00:02:14.140> out<00:02:14.350> here<00:02:14.680> um<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:16.690> hopefully<00:02:17.050> we're

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
this out here um so hopefully we're

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.710 
this out here um so hopefully we're
looking<00:02:17.440> at<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:18.700> know<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:18.850> fairly<00:02:19.330> workable

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
looking at a you know a fairly workable

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.860 
looking at a you know a fairly workable
drainage<00:02:20.380> system<00:02:20.739> here<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.100> I<00:02:21.190> think<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.549> um

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
drainage system here and I think that um

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.970 
drainage system here and I think that um
it's<00:02:22.870> just<00:02:22.959> probably<00:02:23.230> not<00:02:23.560> going<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.769> be<00:02:23.860> much

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
it's just probably not going to be much

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.920 
it's just probably not going to be much

that in the next video but um originally
wanted<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.650> have<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.830> drain<00:03:24.100> be<00:03:24.310> 18<00:03:24.790> inches

wanted to have the drain be 18 inches
under<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.420> ground<00:03:25.660> that<00:03:26.590> was<00:03:26.680> my<00:03:26.800> original

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
under the ground that was my original

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.650 
under the ground that was my original
plan<00:03:27.340> but<00:03:27.370> you're<00:03:27.640> supposed<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:28.030> drain<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:28.510> to

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
plan but you're supposed to drain it to

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.020 
plan but you're supposed to drain it to
air<00:03:28.840> which<00:03:29.739> means<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.190> out<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.640> end<00:03:30.820> of<00:03:30.940> the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
air which means the out the end of the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.080 
air which means the out the end of the
drain<00:03:31.270> is<00:03:31.590> exposed<00:03:32.640> here's<00:03:33.640> an<00:03:33.760> example

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
drain is exposed here's an example

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.770 
drain is exposed here's an example
here's<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.510> an<00:03:35.260> old-time<00:03:35.709> drain<00:03:36.070> here<00:03:36.780> that

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
here's a an old-time drain here that

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.300 
here's a an old-time drain here that
runs<00:03:37.959> from<00:03:38.140> there's<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.530> lot<00:03:38.739> of<00:03:38.770> drains<00:03:39.130> of

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
runs from there's a lot of drains of

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.930 
runs from there's a lot of drains of
this<00:03:39.430> area<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.870> one's<00:03:41.110> from<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.410> house

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
this area this one's from the house

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.430 
this area this one's from the house
again<00:03:42.940> another<00:03:43.239> shot<00:03:43.570> a<00:03:43.600> second<00:03:44.080> of<00:03:44.140> a<00:03:44.200> drain

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
again another shot a second of a drain

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.650 
again another shot a second of a drain
in<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.680> pasture<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:46.180> drains<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.780> air<00:03:46.989> but<00:03:47.890> I

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
in the pasture that drains to air but I

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.090 
in the pasture that drains to air but I
realized<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:49.750> Hill<00:03:49.989> wasn't<00:03:50.350> didn't<00:03:50.950> have<00:03:51.070> a

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
realized that Hill wasn't didn't have a

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.030 
realized that Hill wasn't didn't have a
Steven<00:03:51.520> upslope<00:03:52.170> too<00:03:53.170> I<00:03:53.500> mean<00:03:53.709> I<00:03:53.739> would<00:03:53.769> dig

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
Steven upslope too I mean I would dig

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.000 
Steven upslope too I mean I would dig
all<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.280> way<00:03:54.340> down<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.670> compost<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:56.739> get<00:03:56.890> it

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
all the way down the compost to get it

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.500 
all the way down the compost to get it
low<00:03:57.160> enough<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:57.489> with<00:03:57.850> drain<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.420> then

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
low enough so with drain and then

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.080 
low enough so with drain and then
eventually<00:03:58.810> come<00:03:59.320> out<00:03:59.350> and<00:03:59.769> drain<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.160> air<00:04:00.370> so

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
eventually come out and drain to air so

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.030 
eventually come out and drain to air so
what<00:04:01.239> we<00:04:01.330> ended<00:04:01.600> up<00:04:01.780> doing<00:04:01.840> what<00:04:02.320> I'm<00:04:02.680> doing<00:04:02.709> is

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
what we ended up doing what I'm doing is

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.039 
what we ended up doing what I'm doing is
just<00:04:03.100> putting<00:04:03.459> this<00:04:03.660> couple<00:04:04.660> inches<00:04:04.780> below

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
just putting this couple inches below

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.640 
just putting this couple inches below
the<00:04:05.140> ground<00:04:06.360> this<00:04:07.360> is<00:04:07.540> on<00:04:07.720> 18<00:04:08.080> inches<00:04:08.350> of<00:04:08.470> rock

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
the ground this is on 18 inches of rock

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.039 
the ground this is on 18 inches of rock
and<00:04:09.610> when<00:04:09.700> this<00:04:09.820> fills<00:04:10.120> up<00:04:10.269> with<00:04:10.299> water<00:04:10.450> even

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
and when this fills up with water even

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.170 
and when this fills up with water even
though<00:04:11.140> it's<00:04:11.290> going<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.530> be<00:04:11.650> roofed<00:04:12.180> there's

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
though it's going to be roofed there's

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.570 
though it's going to be roofed there's
going<00:04:13.330> to<00:04:13.390> be<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:13.510> roof<00:04:13.690> over<00:04:14.049> it<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.410> it's<00:04:15.370> you

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
going to be a roof over it and it's you

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.009 
going to be a roof over it and it's you
know<00:04:15.700> it's<00:04:15.730> a<00:04:16.030> big<00:04:16.239> pit<00:04:16.570> so<00:04:16.870> if<00:04:16.989> that

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
know it's a big pit so if that

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.949 
know it's a big pit so if that
eventually<00:04:17.709> fills<00:04:17.919> up<00:04:18.070> with<00:04:18.100> water<00:04:18.959> then

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
eventually fills up with water then

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.479 
eventually fills up with water then
we'll<00:04:20.109> run<00:04:20.260> off<00:04:20.470> into<00:04:20.650> this<00:04:20.859> drain<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:21.430> then

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
we'll run off into this drain and then

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.610 
we'll run off into this drain and then
go<00:04:21.640> into<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.000> pasture<00:04:22.240> but<00:04:23.140> on<00:04:23.260> this<00:04:23.410> whole

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
go into the pasture but on this whole

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.880 
go into the pasture but on this whole
wall<00:04:23.890> I'm<00:04:24.250> going<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.700> build<00:04:25.030> a<00:04:25.300> drain<00:04:25.860> so<00:04:26.860> the

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
wall I'm going to build a drain so the

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.380 
wall I'm going to build a drain so the
water<00:04:27.160> doesn't<00:04:27.250> build<00:04:27.669> up<00:04:27.820> here<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.270> this

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
water doesn't build up here and this

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.409 
water doesn't build up here and this
will<00:04:29.320> be<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.530> garden<00:04:29.950> area<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.400> there'll<00:04:31.300> be<00:04:31.330> a

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
will be a garden area and there'll be a

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.110 
will be a garden area and there'll be a
fire<00:04:31.720> pit<00:04:31.960> here<00:04:32.169> with<00:04:32.290> a<00:04:32.320> rock<00:04:32.530> rocks<00:04:33.190> are<00:04:33.430> so

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
fire pit here with a rock rocks are so

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.330 
fire pit here with a rock rocks are so
that's<00:04:34.360> um<00:04:34.600> no<00:04:34.990> that<00:04:35.380> makes<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:35.919> more<00:04:36.040> clear

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
that's um no that makes it more clear

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.000 
that's um no that makes it more clear
was<00:04:36.810> trying<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.900> say<00:04:38.110> in<00:04:38.290> the<00:04:38.350> wind<00:04:38.560> whisks<00:04:38.860> or

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
was trying to say in the wind whisks or

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.310 
was trying to say in the wind whisks or
getting<00:04:39.280> in<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.430> way<00:04:39.550> of<00:04:39.580> of<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.600> project<00:04:41.140> but

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
getting in the way of of the project but

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.450 
getting in the way of of the project but
you<00:04:41.470> know<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:41.830> this<00:04:42.010> is<00:04:42.190> a<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:45.100> drain<00:04:45.340> is

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
you know so this is a the drain is

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.100 
you know so this is a the drain is
basically<00:04:45.820> done<00:04:46.000> now<00:04:46.240> we're<00:04:46.600> going<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.780> cover

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
basically done now we're going to cover

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.770 
basically done now we're going to cover
it<00:04:47.290> with<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:47.470> little<00:04:47.590> bit<00:04:47.740> more<00:04:47.860> rock<00:04:48.600> but<00:04:49.600> then

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
it with a little bit more rock but then

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.530 
it with a little bit more rock but then
it'll<00:04:50.400> keep<00:04:51.400> water<00:04:51.760> from<00:04:51.850> building<00:04:52.270> up<00:04:52.360> when

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
it'll keep water from building up when

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.260 
it'll keep water from building up when
we<00:04:52.630> finally<00:04:52.900> build<00:04:53.229> this<00:04:53.320> wall<00:04:53.530> over<00:04:53.590> here<00:04:54.270> so

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
we finally build this wall over here so

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.110 
we finally build this wall over here so
that<00:04:55.479> I<00:04:55.810> know<00:04:56.590> we<00:04:56.800> get<00:04:56.919> severe<00:04:57.280> rains<00:04:57.550> here<00:04:57.910> and

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
that I know we get severe rains here and

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.999 
that I know we get severe rains here and
we've<00:04:58.240> had<00:04:58.360> some<00:04:58.419> flash<00:04:58.840> floods

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
we've had some flash floods

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.059 
we've had some flash floods
so<00:05:01.849> what<00:05:02.539> I've<00:05:02.659> there's<00:05:03.439> a<00:05:03.499> lot<00:05:03.680> of<00:05:03.710> drains

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:04.069 
so what I've there's a lot of drains

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.829 
so what I've there's a lot of drains
around<00:05:04.490> this<00:05:04.580> whole<00:05:04.789> yard<00:05:05.059> and<00:05:05.389> I<00:05:05.479> think<00:05:05.689> that

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:05.839 
around this whole yard and I think that

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:08.200 
around this whole yard and I think that
um<00:05:06.249> there<00:05:07.249> must<00:05:07.430> have<00:05:07.460> been<00:05:07.550> pockets<00:05:07.969> of<00:05:08.089> water

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
um there must have been pockets of water

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.629 
um there must have been pockets of water
building<00:05:08.719> up<00:05:08.839> in<00:05:08.990> various<00:05:09.319> areas<00:05:09.469> this<00:05:10.339> some

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
building up in various areas this some

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.760 
building up in various areas this some
there's<00:05:11.300> a<00:05:11.389> sort<00:05:11.749> of<00:05:11.809> a<00:05:11.930> drain<00:05:12.139> pipe<00:05:12.349> going<00:05:12.589> in

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
there's a sort of a drain pipe going in

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.010 
there's a sort of a drain pipe going in
the<00:05:12.830> ground<00:05:13.069> from<00:05:13.369> the<00:05:13.430> the<00:05:14.360> gutter<00:05:14.629> as<00:05:14.869> it

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
the ground from the the gutter as it

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.670 
the ground from the the gutter as it
comes<00:05:15.229> down<00:05:15.469> from<00:05:15.499> the<00:05:15.800> roof<00:05:15.979> and<00:05:17.080> it<00:05:18.080> goes<00:05:18.379> all

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
comes down from the roof and it goes all

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.989 
comes down from the roof and it goes all
the<00:05:18.710> way<00:05:18.949> down<00:05:20.050> here<00:05:21.050> past<00:05:21.409> it<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:22.610> chicken

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:22.999 
the way down here past it the chicken

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:27.730 
the way down here past it the chicken
house<00:05:23.889> and<00:05:24.889> down<00:05:25.719> here<00:05:26.719> and<00:05:26.899> it<00:05:26.990> drains<00:05:27.259> to<00:05:27.559> air

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
house and down here and it drains to air

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.909 
house and down here and it drains to air
which<00:05:28.279> is<00:05:28.509> good<00:05:29.509> example<00:05:29.960> of<00:05:29.990> a<00:05:30.080> drain<00:05:30.319> pipe<00:05:30.589> so

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
which is good example of a drain pipe so

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:32.019 
which is good example of a drain pipe so
I<00:05:30.949> don't<00:05:31.399> really<00:05:31.430> know<00:05:31.669> all<00:05:31.789> that<00:05:31.879> much<00:05:31.939> about

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:32.029 
I don't really know all that much about

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:35.589 
I don't really know all that much about
drain<00:05:32.419> drainage<00:05:32.869> systems<00:05:34.120> but<00:05:35.120> diagnose<00:05:35.569> a

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
drain drainage systems but diagnose a

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.899 
drain drainage systems but diagnose a
metal<00:05:35.990> pipe<00:05:36.199> that<00:05:36.499> doesn't<00:05:36.860> have<00:05:36.979> any<00:05:37.099> holes

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
metal pipe that doesn't have any holes

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.290 
metal pipe that doesn't have any holes
in<00:05:38.120> its<00:05:38.240> not<00:05:38.389> them<00:05:38.830> perforated<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:40.029> PVC<00:05:41.029> pipe

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
in its not them perforated the PVC pipe

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.110 
in its not them perforated the PVC pipe
it<00:05:41.539> I'm<00:05:42.169> using<00:05:42.469> has<00:05:42.800> perforations<00:05:43.550> in<00:05:43.849> it<00:05:43.999> so

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
it I'm using has perforations in it so

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.420 
it I'm using has perforations in it so
it<00:05:44.180> allows<00:05:44.360> water<00:05:45.139> to<00:05:45.319> drain<00:05:45.680> from<00:05:45.979> anywhere

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
it allows water to drain from anywhere

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.920 
it allows water to drain from anywhere
the<00:05:46.849> pipe<00:05:47.149> runs<00:05:47.870> through<00:05:49.389> but<00:05:50.389> a<00:05:50.419> metal<00:05:50.779> pipe

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
the pipe runs through but a metal pipe

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.199 
the pipe runs through but a metal pipe
like<00:05:51.139> this<00:05:51.319> is<00:05:51.439> not<00:05:51.699> whatever<00:05:52.699> comes<00:05:52.909> off<00:05:53.059> the

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:53.209 
like this is not whatever comes off the

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:55.029 
like this is not whatever comes off the
roof<00:05:53.389> might<00:05:53.659> wait<00:05:53.990> might<00:05:54.229> stick<00:05:54.559> in<00:05:54.680> there<00:05:54.860> in

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
roof might wait might stick in there in

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.999 
roof might wait might stick in there in
the<00:05:55.159> roof<00:05:55.339> like<00:05:56.300> sticking<00:05:56.719> a<00:05:56.809> pipe<00:05:56.990> down<00:05:57.259> and

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
the roof like sticking a pipe down and

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.850 
the roof like sticking a pipe down and
clog<00:05:58.279> it<00:05:58.430> up<00:05:58.550> but<00:05:59.449> um<00:05:59.629> the<00:06:00.319> pipe<00:06:00.529> itself

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
clog it up but um the pipe itself

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.040 
clog it up but um the pipe itself
doesn't<00:06:01.129> allow<00:06:01.639> anything<00:06:02.330> to<00:06:02.449> get<00:06:02.629> in<00:06:02.689> there

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
doesn't allow anything to get in there

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.619 
doesn't allow anything to get in there
so<00:06:03.680> just<00:06:03.949> your<00:06:04.189> drains<00:06:04.490> directly<00:06:05.240> from<00:06:05.479> the

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:05.629 
so just your drains directly from the

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:08.739 
so just your drains directly from the
house<00:06:05.779> to<00:06:05.809> this<00:06:06.110> area<00:06:06.379> here<00:06:06.830> the<00:06:07.819> PVC<00:06:08.270> pipe<00:06:08.509> off

00:06:08.739 --> 00:06:08.749 
house to this area here the PVC pipe off

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:11.619 
house to this area here the PVC pipe off
it<00:06:08.930> has<00:06:09.459> perforations<00:06:10.459> in<00:06:10.789> it<00:06:10.969> builds<00:06:11.479> up

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629 
it has perforations in it builds up

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:21.969 
it has perforations in it builds up
sediment<00:06:16.120> so<00:06:19.959> that's<00:06:20.959> what<00:06:21.139> one<00:06:21.349> concern<00:06:21.769> but

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:21.979 
sediment so that's what one concern but

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:23.649 
sediment so that's what one concern but
that's<00:06:22.159> one<00:06:22.339> reason<00:06:22.490> I<00:06:22.639> didn't<00:06:22.819> want<00:06:22.939> to<00:06:23.389> put

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:23.659 
that's one reason I didn't want to put

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:25.449 
that's one reason I didn't want to put
the<00:06:23.749> pipe<00:06:23.930> in<00:06:24.110> the<00:06:24.229> and<00:06:24.709> the<00:06:24.800> earth<00:06:24.949> oven<00:06:25.159> so

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:25.459 
the pipe in the and the earth oven so

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:26.889 
the pipe in the and the earth oven so
far<00:06:25.669> in<00:06:25.789> the<00:06:25.879> ground<00:06:26.149> that<00:06:26.360> I<00:06:26.479> couldn't<00:06:26.809> be

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:26.899 
far in the ground that I couldn't be

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:30.009 
far in the ground that I couldn't be
able<00:06:27.139> to<00:06:27.849> reach<00:06:28.849> it<00:06:29.089> and<00:06:29.209> run<00:06:29.539> a<00:06:29.569> whole<00:06:29.749> suite

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:30.019 
able to reach it and run a whole suite

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:33.969 
able to reach it and run a whole suite
and<00:06:30.939> uncloudy<00:06:31.939> come<00:06:32.120> on<00:06:32.180> Lucy<00:06:32.800> so<00:06:33.800> here's

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
and uncloudy come on Lucy so here's

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.699 
and uncloudy come on Lucy so here's
another<00:06:34.189> example<00:06:34.309> of<00:06:34.759> a<00:06:34.879> pipe<00:06:35.389> the<00:06:35.569> drains<00:06:35.839> to

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:36.709 
another example of a pipe the drains to

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:39.489 
another example of a pipe the drains to
air<00:06:36.889> up<00:06:37.189> here<00:06:37.370> in<00:06:37.759> the<00:06:37.939> I<00:06:38.330> don't<00:06:39.259> know<00:06:39.319> where<00:06:39.439> it

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:39.499 
air up here in the I don't know where it

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:41.589 
air up here in the I don't know where it
comes<00:06:39.709> from<00:06:39.830> but<00:06:40.039> there's<00:06:40.909> a<00:06:40.969> lot<00:06:41.149> of<00:06:41.180> these<00:06:41.389> in

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 
comes from but there's a lot of these in

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:43.809 
comes from but there's a lot of these in
this<00:06:41.689> hill<00:06:41.959> a<00:06:42.199> lot<00:06:43.039> of<00:06:43.069> height<00:06:43.339> a<00:06:43.490> lot<00:06:43.699> of

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:43.819 
this hill a lot of height a lot of

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:46.809 
this hill a lot of height a lot of
drainage<00:06:44.029> pipes<00:06:44.569> around<00:06:44.809> this<00:06:45.110> this<00:06:45.949> yard<00:06:46.249> so

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:46.819 
drainage pipes around this this yard so

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:47.920 
drainage pipes around this this yard so
that's<00:06:47.180> basically<00:06:47.330> all<00:06:47.569> I<00:06:47.689> know<00:06:47.839> about

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
that's basically all I know about

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.230 
that's basically all I know about
drainage<00:06:48.379> systems<00:06:48.769> you<00:06:49.339> see<00:06:49.519> with<00:06:49.639> this<00:06:49.669> one<00:06:49.999> I

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
drainage systems you see with this one I

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.699 
drainage systems you see with this one I
you<00:06:50.599> know<00:06:50.629> the<00:06:50.930> kids<00:06:51.139> filled<00:06:51.499> it<00:06:51.589> in<00:06:51.649> with

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:51.709 
you know the kids filled it in with

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:54.759 
you know the kids filled it in with
rocks<00:06:52.809> here<00:06:53.809> and<00:06:53.990> we<00:06:54.139> could<00:06:54.229> just<00:06:54.409> dig<00:06:54.529> up<00:06:54.559> the

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:54.769 
rocks here and we could just dig up the

00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:57.040 
rocks here and we could just dig up the
rocks<00:06:54.979> and<00:06:55.189> then<00:06:55.459> get<00:06:55.610> to<00:06:55.639> the<00:06:55.759> pipe<00:06:56.059> if<00:06:56.839> it's

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
rocks and then get to the pipe if it's

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.279 
rocks and then get to the pipe if it's
clogged<00:06:57.319> up<00:06:57.559> we<00:06:57.769> can<00:06:57.919> you<00:06:58.039> know<00:06:58.189> run<00:06:59.050> a<00:07:00.050> hole

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289 
clogged up we can you know run a hole

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:02.489 
clogged up we can you know run a hole
through<00:07:00.589> it<00:07:00.620> or<00:07:00.800> whatever<00:07:01.189> clean<00:07:01.729> out<00:07:01.909> the

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:02.499 
through it or whatever clean out the

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:05.170 
through it or whatever clean out the
sediment<00:07:03.499> and<00:07:03.649> so<00:07:03.939> you<00:07:04.939> know<00:07:04.969> that's

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180 
sediment and so you know that's

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.619 
sediment and so you know that's
basically<00:07:05.629> the<00:07:05.749> drain<00:07:06.019> system<00:07:06.409> here<00:07:07.509> and<00:07:08.509> it

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:08.629 
basically the drain system here and it

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:10.920 
basically the drain system here and it
runs<00:07:08.839> out<00:07:09.019> in<00:07:09.139> the<00:07:09.199> field<00:07:09.409> to<00:07:09.589> rocks<00:07:09.800> and<00:07:10.189> so<00:07:10.370> on

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
runs out in the field to rocks and so on

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.149 
runs out in the field to rocks and so on
it's<00:07:11.930> fairly<00:07:12.169> simple<00:07:12.439> and<00:07:12.709> easy<00:07:12.860> and<00:07:13.009> that's

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:13.159 
it's fairly simple and easy and that's

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:14.439 
it's fairly simple and easy and that's
exactly<00:07:13.459> what<00:07:13.789> we're<00:07:13.849> going<00:07:13.999> to<00:07:14.089> do<00:07:14.149> with

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:14.449 
exactly what we're going to do with

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:16.629 
exactly what we're going to do with
for<00:07:14.599> one<00:07:14.779> in<00:07:15.439> each<00:07:15.590> of<00:07:15.770> these<00:07:15.860> sections<00:07:16.159> by<00:07:16.580> the

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 
for one in each of these sections by the

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.939 
for one in each of these sections by the
fence
