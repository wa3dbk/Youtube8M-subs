00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
and launch that tomahawk for the nice

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.499 
and launch that tomahawk for the nice
game<00:01:18.420> winning<00:01:18.659> killcam<00:01:18.960> you'll<00:01:19.470> see<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:20.509> the

reason that you don't want to be on the
palace<00:01:23.220> areas<00:01:23.430> because<00:01:23.640> even<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.030> you're

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
palace areas because even if you're

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.210 
palace areas because even if you're
slightly<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.720> pallets<00:01:25.170> you'll<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
slightly on the pallets you'll see the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.249 
slightly on the pallets you'll see the
combat<00:01:26.970> axe<00:01:27.090> actually<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.689> grazes

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
combat axe actually just grazes

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.859 
combat axe actually just grazes
underneath<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.340> tower<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.659> if<00:01:30.750> you're

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
underneath the tower here so if you're

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.690 
underneath the tower here so if you're
up<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.500> ledge<00:01:31.740> there<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.189> may<00:01:32.430> still

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
up on that ledge there you may still

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.340 
up on that ledge there you may still
possibly<00:01:33.119> hit<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.869> also<00:01:34.020> run<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
possibly hit it but you also run the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.140 
possibly hit it but you also run the
risk<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.740> hitting<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.250> tower<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:35.759> well<00:01:35.970> which

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
risk of hitting that tower as well which

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.980 
risk of hitting that tower as well which
will<00:01:36.299> throw<00:01:36.450> your<00:01:36.600> combat<00:01:36.990> axe<00:01:37.170> off<00:01:38.990> alright

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
