00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
yeah look at it was it was difficult but

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.859 
yeah look at it was it was difficult but
you<00:00:17.070> know<00:00:17.189> for<00:00:17.369> where<00:00:17.519> I<00:00:17.550> feel<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.420> I'm<00:00:18.570> at<00:00:18.720> in

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
you know for where I feel that I'm at in

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.960 
you know for where I feel that I'm at in
my<00:00:18.900> career<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.650> not<00:00:20.310> only<00:00:20.369> my<00:00:20.670> football

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
my career and not only my football

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.400 
my career and not only my football
career<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.420> my<00:00:21.510> life<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.929> think<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.320> was

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
career but in my life I think it was

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.560 
career but in my life I think it was
time<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.820> to<00:00:23.820> experience<00:00:24.359> something

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
time to to experience something

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.290 
time to to experience something
different<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.289> was<00:00:25.439> pretty<00:00:25.710> much<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
different and that was pretty much the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.490 
different and that was pretty much the
driving<00:00:27.300> force<00:00:27.539> behind<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.929> to<00:00:28.050> experience

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
driving force behind it to experience

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.109 
driving force behind it to experience
new<00:00:28.650> things<00:00:28.679> not<00:00:29.160> only<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.820> football

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
new things not only on the football

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.530 
new things not only on the football
field<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.480> offered<00:00:30.779> new<00:00:31.109> challenges<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.540> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
field but offered new challenges and you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.150 
field but offered new challenges and you
know<00:00:33.660> I've<00:00:33.840> always<00:00:34.230> had<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.470> desire<00:00:34.650> to<00:00:34.980> play

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
know I've always had a desire to play

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.370 
know I've always had a desire to play
rugby<00:00:35.670> overseas<00:00:36.150> from<00:00:36.360> when<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.510> started<00:00:36.570> you

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
rugby overseas from when I started you

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.810 
rugby overseas from when I started you
know<00:00:37.470> when<00:00:37.650> I<00:00:37.680> first<00:00:37.920> started<00:00:38.370> playing<00:00:38.490> rugby

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
know when I first started playing rugby

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.940 
know when I first started playing rugby
I<00:00:38.970> think<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.300> one<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> great<00:00:39.810> assets<00:00:40.770> of

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
I think it's one of the great assets of

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.710 
I think it's one of the great assets of
this<00:00:41.100> game<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> ability<00:00:41.880> of<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.330> it<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
this game is the ability of the it is a

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.170 
this game is the ability of the it is a
world<00:00:42.960> game<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:44.280> know<00:00:44.400> I<00:00:44.430> guess<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.970> sort

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
world game and you know I guess it sort

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.580 
world game and you know I guess it sort
of<00:00:45.240> came<00:00:45.390> down<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.870> at<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> end<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.470> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
of came down to that at the end of the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.280 
of came down to that at the end of the
day<00:00:46.770> looking<00:00:47.700> back<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.150> my<00:00:48.270> career<00:00:48.570> whenever

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
day looking back on my career whenever

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.260 
day looking back on my career whenever
that<00:00:49.470> may<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.650> I<00:00:50.100> feel<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.970> I<00:00:51.060> would<00:00:51.210> have

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
that may be I feel that I would have

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.150 
that may be I feel that I would have
regretted<00:00:51.480> not<00:00:52.020> taking<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.980> opportunity

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
regretted not taking this opportunity

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.700 
regretted not taking this opportunity
and<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:53.970> probably<00:00:54.150> what<00:00:54.450> sealed<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.960> for

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and that was probably what sealed it for

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.950 
and that was probably what sealed it for
me<00:00:56.190> at<00:00:56.310> the<00:00:56.400> end<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.700> day<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
me at the end of the day you know I

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.180 
me at the end of the day you know I
think<00:00:58.200> that<00:00:58.320> was<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.470> point<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.860> sorta<00:00:59.160> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
think that was the point of sorta I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.640 
think that was the point of sorta I
wanted<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.610> always<00:00:59.700> have<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.150> done<00:01:00.330> now<00:01:01.200> so

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
wanted to always have it done now so

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.080 
wanted to always have it done now so
that<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.830> don't<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.310> worry<00:01:02.580> about<00:01:02.700> it<00:01:02.940> next

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
that I don't have to worry about it next

about<00:01:19.530> our<00:01:19.679> super<00:01:19.979> rugby<00:01:20.249> campaign<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.820> not

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
about our super rugby campaign and not

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.660 
about our super rugby campaign and not
having<00:01:21.560> other<00:01:22.560> things<00:01:22.890> hanging<00:01:23.100> over<00:01:23.399> ahead

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
having other things hanging over ahead

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.219 
having other things hanging over ahead

to<00:01:25.320> me<00:01:25.499> that<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.770> go<00:01:26.009> into<00:01:26.039> next<00:01:26.340> year<00:01:26.789> with
