dissimilarity she was also interested in

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.020

art<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.870> my<00:02:34.380> character<00:02:35.040> came<00:02:35.730> from<00:02:35.880> a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
art and my character came from a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.660 
art and my character came from a
background<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:39.110> retail<00:02:40.110> store<00:02:40.640> where<00:02:41.640> he

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
background of a retail store where he

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.260 
background of a retail store where he
didn't<00:02:42.120> really<00:02:42.920> know<00:02:43.920> much<00:02:44.130> about<00:02:44.190> her<00:02:44.940> life

didn't really know much about her life
and<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.930> think<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:46.320> time<00:02:46.560> came<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.100> learn<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.340> lot

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
and I think in time came to learn a lot

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.670 
and I think in time came to learn a lot
about<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.660> that's<00:02:48.780> one<00:02:49.019> of<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.230> nice

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
about it but that's one of the nice

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.250 
about it but that's one of the nice
things<00:02:49.709> when<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.430> have<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.810> couple<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:52.080> can

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
things when you have a couple that can

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.990 
things when you have a couple that can
stick<00:02:52.530> with<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.070> they<00:02:53.400> can<00:02:53.550> learn<00:02:53.730> from

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
stick with it and they can learn from

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.490
