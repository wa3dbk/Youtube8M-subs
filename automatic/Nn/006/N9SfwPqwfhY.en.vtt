00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hi everyone, today I'll show you how 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.049
 prepare this cake which is fine either 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.940
 for the boys that for some 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.519
 sissies maybe changing if it is a 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.059
 pink boy choosing not 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.190
 I know an orange or another color of the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.820
 in short, another shade of green 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.310
 of the colors a little more masculine and it is not 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.230
 difficult decoration then you will see the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.670
 tutorials are all very simple things 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.740
 and they adapt both to a cake of this 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.640
 like but I also think they are fine 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.950
 for example muffins other decorations 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.489
 let's start with the tutorials to do 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.110
 the rainbow or colored gods 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.579
 balls of dough alone let's go to 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.780
 spread of doing so cords 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.210
 I did all the colors 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.820
 blue and purple sky blue rainbow 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.649
 wood business pretty thin looking 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.300
 to make them the same size as mine 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.579
 mind I stop 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.909
 the pasta under a sheet of parchment paper 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:11.479
 so later they will come off more easily 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.010
 let's go for yellow and orange 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.650
 obviously it doesn't matter which lengths 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.130
 be all precise because then 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.360
 we are going to cut and red 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.870
 ok 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.120
 now I go to apc carli with a 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.490
 bit of food glue for this reason the 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.830
 baking paper cn a little to help because 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.950
 otherwise they could be applied to 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:44.250
 work pin I'm going to give own 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:46.020
 a pass to very light we run a 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.270
 a little 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.370
 ok we give a typical shape and now with 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:57.810
 a knife we ​​can cut well 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:01.080
 now to make the whole thing uniform 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.940
 slightly the rolling pin without pressing 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:09.979
 too much we have at first if stimulated and 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.979
 the rainbow is practically how much 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:19.140
 now we can move to the stream that 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.060
 will go on the cake on both cakes 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.540
 therefore we await a bit of light blue pasta 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.580
 and will be slightly flared then in the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.490
 the upper part will be a little narrower 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.710
 in the lower one it will be just barely 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:37.480
 wide ok also in this case I have 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.930
 glued with glue 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.630
 now we are going to finish the dead with la 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.340
 sac à poche and now I don't remember the 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.480
 We will write you the number of the spout 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:53.850
 in the box we always glue the rainbow 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.850
 with a little bit of food glue 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.930
 we also finish the part above 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.610
 now we can move on to clouds 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.460
 three-dimensional so I'm doing some 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.400
 dough balls not of the same 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.110
 size must be proper of 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:18.340
 different sizes a little bigger a 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:20.709
 slightly smaller and will overlap and 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.110
 we are going to do two for the rainbow 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.110
 let's go then to the sides 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.440
 now I'm staring at the sun I have 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.739
 made simply by cutting with 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.280
 a round pastry-cutter a little bit of pasta 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.280
 yellow 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.280
 we also make the little cloud for the sun 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.970
 I forgot to say that for 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.070
 the sun 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.860
 I put one right then stick 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.680
 not too thick pasta 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.580
 thin 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.580
 ok fine a little cloud 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:07.180
 and we finish with another bit of cream of 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.180
 cream and equal butter 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.660
 let's go then to put a ribbon 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:16.190
 which color of ours you choose 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.470
 and let's go and make the ribbon of the 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.430
 upper part in the cake then on the 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:26.600
 cake on top of the smaller one 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.600
 to close the awards ok 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.009
 let's give a little touch to the sac à 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.330
 few ways to close everyone's problems 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.210
 how many holes 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.909
 now let's give the clouds a final touch 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.189
 a little bit of pearly powder passes 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:49.250
 this is the white one will give you a 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:51.680
 effect a little translucent and finally 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.439
 let's make the sun's rays so i'm 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.120
 making big drops in 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:57.560
 fixed with a toothpick a 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.000
 put everyone around the sun I have 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.620
