wonderful<00:00:28.460> wheatgrass<00:00:29.460> green<00:00:30.270> smoothie<00:00:31.050> we

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
wonderful wheatgrass green smoothie we

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.190 
wonderful wheatgrass green smoothie we
start<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> bowl<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.730> wheatgrass<00:00:33.120> which<00:00:34.020> we

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
start with a bowl of wheatgrass which we

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.170 
start with a bowl of wheatgrass which we
have<00:00:34.320> cut<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> good<00:00:35.280> pair<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.610> scissors

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
have cut with a good pair of scissors

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.750 
have cut with a good pair of scissors
and<00:00:37.079> we're<00:00:37.350> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.649> blend<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.280> Vitamix

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
and we're going to blend it in a Vitamix

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.169 
and we're going to blend it in a Vitamix
blender<00:00:39.210> with<00:00:39.480> some<00:00:39.510> water<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.230> some<00:00:40.410> ice<00:00:41.179> so

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:42.179 
blender with some water and some ice so

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.579 
blender with some water and some ice so
you<00:00:42.239> take<00:00:42.600> about<00:00:42.839> a<00:00:42.899> cup<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.409> water<00:00:45.320> put<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.440> in

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
you take about a cup of water put it in

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.669 
you take about a cup of water put it in
the<00:00:46.739> Vitamix<00:00:47.309> blender<00:00:47.870> take<00:00:48.870> some<00:00:49.109> ice<00:00:49.320> cubes

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:49.679 
the Vitamix blender take some ice cubes

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:58.880 
the Vitamix blender take some ice cubes
and<00:00:53.149> then<00:00:54.149> put<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.569> the<00:00:54.600> wheatgrass<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:58.559> then

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
and then put in the wheatgrass and then

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.439 
and then put in the wheatgrass and then
we're<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.159> blend<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.670> up<00:00:59.819> and<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
we're going to blend it up and the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:10.170 
we're going to blend it up and the
Vitamix<00:01:00.960> blender

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.720 

so<00:01:10.570> after<00:01:10.930> we<00:01:11.080> blend<00:01:11.380> grass<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:12.070> a<00:01:12.280> Vitamix

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
so after we blend grass and a Vitamix

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.780 
so after we blend grass and a Vitamix
blender<00:01:13.120> for<00:01:13.270> about<00:01:13.540> 45<00:01:14.170> seconds<00:01:14.680> we<00:01:15.340> pour<00:01:15.670> it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
blender for about 45 seconds we pour it

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:24.180 
blender for about 45 seconds we pour it
through<00:01:15.850> a<00:01:16.150> fine<00:01:16.750> mesh<00:01:17.050> bag<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.710> then<00:01:23.980> we

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
through a fine mesh bag so then we

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.010 
through a fine mesh bag so then we
strain<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.610> wheatgrass<00:01:25.120> through<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.630> fine

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
strain the wheatgrass through a fine

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.730 
strain the wheatgrass through a fine
mesh<00:01:26.050> bag<00:01:27.480> because<00:01:28.480> the<00:01:28.870> fiber<00:01:29.290> of<00:01:29.470> the

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
mesh bag because the fiber of the

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.720 
mesh bag because the fiber of the
wheatgrass<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:31.150> indigestible<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:32.710> humans<00:01:33.130> of

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
wheatgrass is indigestible for humans of

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.020 
wheatgrass is indigestible for humans of
course<00:01:34.170> cows<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.590> horses<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.340> chimpanzees

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
course cows and horses and chimpanzees

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.500 
course cows and horses and chimpanzees
can<00:01:37.420> digest<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.800> fiber<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.340> wheatgrass<00:01:40.000> but

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
can digest the fiber of wheatgrass but

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.440 
can digest the fiber of wheatgrass but
we<00:01:40.660> can't<00:01:40.990> so<00:01:41.290> we<00:01:41.440> strain<00:01:41.800> it<00:01:41.980> through<00:01:42.010> a<00:01:42.640> fine

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
we can't so we strain it through a fine

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.190 
we can't so we strain it through a fine
mesh<00:01:43.510> bag<00:01:44.350> or<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.710> strainer<00:01:45.660> so<00:01:46.660> we<00:01:46.780> take<00:01:47.020> this

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
mesh bag or a strainer so we take this

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.770 
mesh bag or a strainer so we take this
drain<00:01:47.530> wheatgrass<00:01:48.010> and<00:01:48.460> we<00:01:49.119> pour<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.510> in<00:01:49.630> the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
drain wheatgrass and we pour it in the

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
drain wheatgrass and we pour it in the
Vitamix<00:01:50.200> blender<00:01:52.080> now<00:01:53.080> we<00:01:53.140> add<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.650> other

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
Vitamix blender now we add the other

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.640 
Vitamix blender now we add the other
ingredients<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.119> juiced<00:01:55.390> wheatgrass<00:01:55.840> we

for a refreshing glass of wheatgrass
juice<00:02:35.580> wheatgrass<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:37.510> nutritious<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:39.550> has

about 70 percent chlorophyll two ounces
of<00:02:44.080> wheatgrass<00:02:44.380> is<00:02:44.950> equivalent<00:02:45.490> to<00:02:45.640> three<00:02:46.000> and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
of wheatgrass is equivalent to three and
