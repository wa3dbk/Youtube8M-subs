so

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
so

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.370 
so
there<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.740> go<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.190> then<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.780> can<00:02:15.930> just<00:02:16.110> start

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
there you go and then you can just start

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.820 
there you go and then you can just start
using<00:02:16.980> commands<00:02:17.640> like<00:02:17.820> fly<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.260> can<00:02:19.500> be

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
using commands like fly and you can be

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.650 
using commands like fly and you can be
flying<00:02:20.220> around<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.820> stuff<00:02:21.320> so<00:02:23.360> that's<00:02:24.360> pretty

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
flying around and stuff so that's pretty

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.830
