00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
to be reviewing the k2 sleigh blade

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.119 
to be reviewing the k2 sleigh blade
which<00:00:31.240> is<00:00:31.419> they're<00:00:31.660> all<00:00:32.110> mountain<00:00:32.590> freestyle

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
which is they're all mountain freestyle

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.610 
which is they're all mountain freestyle
board<00:00:33.600> quite<00:00:34.600> high<00:00:34.840> end<00:00:35.050> it's<00:00:35.290> got<00:00:35.410> a<00:00:35.440> lot<00:00:35.590> of

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
board quite high end it's got a lot of

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.820 
board quite high end it's got a lot of
technology<00:00:36.190> in<00:00:36.220> there<00:00:36.489> so<00:00:37.059> we've<00:00:37.180> got<00:00:37.330> a

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
technology in there so we've got a

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.049 
technology in there so we've got a
hybrid<00:00:38.830> light<00:00:38.949> construction<00:00:39.250> as<00:00:39.670> you<00:00:39.760> can<00:00:39.879> see

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
hybrid light construction as you can see

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.140 
hybrid light construction as you can see
they're<00:00:40.330> a<00:00:40.570> very<00:00:40.960> small<00:00:41.350> side<00:00:41.680> wall<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:43.000> this

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
they're a very small side wall and this

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.689 
they're a very small side wall and this
kind<00:00:43.629> of<00:00:43.780> makes<00:00:44.019> it<00:00:44.170> lighter<00:00:44.440> and<00:00:45.100> also<00:00:45.519> makes

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
kind of makes it lighter and also makes

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.670 
kind of makes it lighter and also makes
a<00:00:45.820> bit<00:00:45.970> more<00:00:46.000> poppy<00:00:46.390> we've<00:00:47.350> got<00:00:47.530> the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
a bit more poppy we've got the

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.340 
a bit more poppy we've got the
harshmellow<00:00:48.430> dampening<00:00:49.269> underfoot<00:00:49.780> which

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
harshmellow dampening underfoot which

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.770 
harshmellow dampening underfoot which
kind<00:00:50.559> of<00:00:50.650> dampens<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.129> ride<00:00:51.430> and<00:00:51.699> I've<00:00:52.600> also

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
kind of dampens the ride and I've also

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.700 
kind of dampens the ride and I've also
got<00:00:53.320> a<00:00:53.970> sintered<00:00:54.970> zero<00:00:55.269> base<00:00:55.659> which<00:00:56.409> is<00:00:56.589> the

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
got a sintered zero base which is the

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.619 
got a sintered zero base which is the
equivalent<00:00:56.799> of<00:00:57.129> a<00:00:57.220> sintered<00:00:57.580> 10,000<00:00:58.239> base<00:00:58.360> so

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
equivalent of a sintered 10,000 base so

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.090 
equivalent of a sintered 10,000 base so
pretty<00:00:59.019> much<00:00:59.199> one<00:00:59.409> of<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.589> quickest<00:00:59.949> on<00:01:00.070> the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
pretty much one of the quickest on the

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.950 
pretty much one of the quickest on the
market<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:02.260> we've<00:01:02.440> also<00:01:02.589> got<00:01:02.949> a<00:01:03.070> zero<00:01:03.489> camber

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
market and we've also got a zero camber

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.530 
market and we've also got a zero camber
katie's<00:01:04.960> flat<00:01:05.290> line<00:01:05.470> construction<00:01:06.299> I've<00:01:07.299> rode

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
katie's flat line construction I've rode

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.090 
katie's flat line construction I've rode
last<00:01:07.720> year's<00:01:08.049> board<00:01:08.290> but<00:01:08.530> I'm<00:01:08.619> really<00:01:08.860> looking

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
last year's board but I'm really looking

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.170 
last year's board but I'm really looking
forward<00:01:09.130> to<00:01:09.340> this<00:01:09.460> one<00:01:09.640> cuz<00:01:09.790> they<00:01:09.850> pumped<00:01:10.119> a

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
forward to this one cuz they pumped a

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.719 
forward to this one cuz they pumped a
bit<00:01:10.330> more<00:01:10.510> technology<00:01:11.439> into<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:11.860> and

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
bit more technology into it and

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:19.890 
bit more technology into it and
hopefully<00:01:13.119> I<00:01:13.540> like<00:01:14.260> it<00:01:14.409> as<00:01:14.500> much

stable running in these tours and forks
carving<00:02:45.080> tools<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.410> forks<00:02:45.680> in<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.799> top<00:02:46.069> and

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
carving tools and forks in the top and

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.610 
carving tools and forks in the top and
then<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.400> tail<00:02:46.670> works<00:02:47.299> perfectly<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.379> base

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
then the tail works perfectly the base

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.020 
then the tail works perfectly the base

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
and you want a board that will be able

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.869 
and you want a board that will be able
to<00:03:00.200> progress<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.769> on<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.129> the<00:03:01.160> bigger<00:03:01.430> jumps

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
to progress you on to the bigger jumps

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.640 
to progress you on to the bigger jumps
into<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.269> half<00:03:02.450> pipe<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:03.230> kind<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.470> thing

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
into the half pipe that kind of thing

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.199 
into the half pipe that kind of thing
then<00:03:03.890> can't<00:03:04.489> really<00:03:04.670> do<00:03:04.760> better<00:03:04.970> than<00:03:05.090> the

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
then can't really do better than the

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.660 
then can't really do better than the
