00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
turn off charms if you're in a mouse and

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.370 
turn off charms if you're in a mouse and
keyboard<00:02:01.579> type<00:02:02.030> of<00:02:02.209> environment<00:02:02.780> we've<00:02:03.259> made

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
keyboard type of environment we've made

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.709 
keyboard type of environment we've made
the<00:02:03.530> first<00:02:03.740> party<00:02:04.039> apps<00:02:04.189> even<00:02:05.000> easier<00:02:05.179> to<00:02:05.539> use

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
the first party apps even easier to use

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.080 
the first party apps even easier to use
with<00:02:06.229> with<00:02:06.890> mouse<00:02:07.219> and<00:02:07.429> keyboard<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:07.939> there's

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
with with mouse and keyboard so there's

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.309 
with with mouse and keyboard so there's
a<00:02:08.179> lot<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.509> innovation<00:02:09.319> coming<00:02:09.649> in<00:02:10.750> 8.1<00:02:11.750> and

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
a lot of innovation coming in 8.1 and

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.039 
a lot of innovation coming in 8.1 and
momentum<00:02:12.890> around<00:02:12.980> windows<00:02:13.610> 8<00:02:13.760> itself<00:02:14.150> yeah<00:02:14.720> so

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
momentum around windows 8 itself yeah so

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.059 
momentum around windows 8 itself yeah so
then<00:02:15.349> around<00:02:15.680> windows<00:02:16.040> 8<00:02:16.220> certainly<00:02:16.760> in

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
then around windows 8 certainly in

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.250 
then around windows 8 certainly in
August<00:02:19.069> there<00:02:19.250> was<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.549> netops<00:02:20.260> statistic

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
August there was the netops statistic

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.750 
August there was the netops statistic
out<00:02:21.410> which<00:02:21.650> talked<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.099> lot<00:02:22.250> about<00:02:22.310> some

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
out which talked a lot about some

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.729 
out which talked a lot about some
momentum<00:02:23.180> coming<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.720> we<00:02:23.959> saw<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.349> when<00:02:24.590> we

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
momentum coming and we saw that when we

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.100 
momentum coming and we saw that when we
saw<00:02:24.950> demand<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.760> we<00:02:26.030> are<00:02:26.239> seeing<00:02:26.480> demand<00:02:26.720> for

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
saw demand and we are seeing demand for

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.250 
saw demand and we are seeing demand for
windows<00:02:27.410> 8<00:02:27.590> devices<00:02:28.250> for<00:02:28.700> back<00:02:28.849> to<00:02:29.090> school<00:02:29.260> and

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
windows 8 devices for back to school and

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.460 
windows 8 devices for back to school and
