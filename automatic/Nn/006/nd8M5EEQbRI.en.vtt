going to show you today is a way of
strumming<00:00:34.040> with<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.430> plectrum<00:00:34.670> which<00:00:35.059> will

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
strumming with the plectrum which will

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.120 
strumming with the plectrum which will
make<00:00:35.390> your<00:00:35.480> plane<00:00:35.720> so<00:00:35.989> much<00:00:36.230> more<00:00:36.470> interesting

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
make your plane so much more interesting

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.040 
make your plane so much more interesting
because<00:00:37.670> here's<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.090> thing<00:00:38.120> when<00:00:39.020> people

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
because here's the thing when people

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.530 
because here's the thing when people
first<00:00:39.740> learn<00:00:39.980> guitar<00:00:40.160> usually<00:00:40.700> they<00:00:41.510> just

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
first learn guitar usually they just

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.330 
first learn guitar usually they just
strum<00:00:41.990> downwards<00:00:42.500> with<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.770> plectrum<00:00:42.980> like

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
strum downwards with the plectrum like

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:52.990 
strum downwards with the plectrum like
this

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.750 

and<00:00:53.720> that's<00:00:53.900> okay<00:00:54.290> but<00:00:54.500> after<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.800> while<00:00:55.040> you'll

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
and that's okay but after a while you'll

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.070 
and that's okay but after a while you'll
find<00:00:55.820> that<00:00:56.180> that<00:00:56.330> starts<00:00:56.660> to<00:00:56.780> sound<00:00:56.900> quite

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
find that that starts to sound quite

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.170 
find that that starts to sound quite
boring<00:00:57.650> so<00:00:57.920> what<00:00:58.310> I<00:00:58.340> want<00:00:58.550> to<00:00:58.610> do<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:58.910> give<00:00:59.060> you

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
boring so what I want to do is give you

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.940 
boring so what I want to do is give you
a<00:00:59.239> more<00:00:59.510> interesting<00:00:59.690> strumming<00:01:00.560> pattern

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
a more interesting strumming pattern

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.070 
a more interesting strumming pattern
that<00:01:01.100> will<00:01:01.220> make<00:01:01.430> it<00:01:01.670> sound<00:01:01.910> you<00:01:02.450> know<00:01:02.660> a<00:01:02.690> lot

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
that will make it sound you know a lot

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.830 
that will make it sound you know a lot
more<00:01:03.260> alive<00:01:03.590> and<00:01:03.950> also<00:01:04.580> horrid<00:01:04.970> today<00:01:05.390> is<00:01:05.600> the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
more alive and also horrid today is the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.100 
more alive and also horrid today is the
G<00:01:06.200> chord<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.520> this<00:01:07.940> strumming<00:01:08.390> pattern<00:01:08.780> is

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
G chord and so this strumming pattern is

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.410 
G chord and so this strumming pattern is
a<00:01:09.140> Down<00:01:09.440> stroke<00:01:10.119> an<00:01:11.119> upstroke<00:01:11.750> a<00:01:12.460> chop<00:01:13.460> I'll

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
a Down stroke an upstroke a chop I'll

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.490 
a Down stroke an upstroke a chop I'll
explain<00:01:14.840> that<00:01:14.990> in<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.200> minute

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
explain that in a minute

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.100 
explain that in a minute
and<00:01:15.680> an<00:01:15.979> upstroke<00:01:16.540> so<00:01:17.540> when<00:01:17.690> we<00:01:17.780> put<00:01:17.990> that

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
and an upstroke so when we put that

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:33.340 
and an upstroke so when we put that
together<00:01:18.320> it<00:01:18.680> sounds<00:01:18.830> like<00:01:19.040> this

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.800 

okay<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:34.520> can<00:01:34.670> see<00:01:34.939> that<00:01:35.150> it<00:01:35.299> gives<00:01:35.479> it<00:01:35.689> a

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
okay and you can see that it gives it a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.050 
okay and you can see that it gives it a
more<00:01:35.990> interesting<00:01:36.470> sound<00:01:37.220> because<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.640> chart

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
more interesting sound because the chart

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.960 
more interesting sound because the chart
is<00:01:38.450> quite<00:01:39.080> percussive<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:39.979> to<00:01:40.280> me<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:40.640> sounds<00:01:40.909> a

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
is quite percussive it to me it sounds a

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.280 
is quite percussive it to me it sounds a
little<00:01:41.060> bit<00:01:41.270> like<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.479> drum<00:01:41.780> kit<00:01:42.020> when<00:01:42.200> the

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
little bit like a drum kit when the

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.770 
little bit like a drum kit when the
drummer<00:01:42.500> hits<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.950> snare<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.580> especially<00:01:44.540> if

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
drummer hits the snare and especially if

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.600 
drummer hits the snare and especially if
you're<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.259> sort<00:01:45.409> of<00:01:45.500> person<00:01:45.920> that<00:01:45.950> might<00:01:46.399> be

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
you're the sort of person that might be

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.760 
you're the sort of person that might be
you<00:01:46.850> know<00:01:46.880> busking<00:01:47.450> on<00:01:47.570> your<00:01:47.750> own<00:01:47.930> or<00:01:48.259> playing

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
you know busking on your own or playing

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.130 
you know busking on your own or playing
acoustic<00:01:49.369> guitar<00:01:49.399> and<00:01:50.030> it's<00:01:50.570> really<00:01:50.930> going<00:01:51.049> to

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
acoustic guitar and it's really going to

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.690 
acoustic guitar and it's really going to
be<00:01:51.200> useful<00:01:51.409> for<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:51.830> to<00:01:51.890> get<00:01:52.159> used<00:01:52.399> to<00:01:52.520> this

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
be useful for you to get used to this

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.430 
be useful for you to get used to this
strumming<00:01:53.149> pattern<00:01:53.539> and<00:01:53.810> it<00:01:53.899> will<00:01:54.020> make<00:01:54.289> your

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
strumming pattern and it will make your

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.950 
strumming pattern and it will make your
plane<00:01:54.649> sound<00:01:54.979> much<00:01:55.369> better<00:01:55.580> okay<00:01:56.509> so<00:01:56.570> let's

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
plane sound much better okay so let's

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.480 
plane sound much better okay so let's
begin<00:01:57.080> now<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.500> first<00:01:57.860> thing<00:01:58.039> I<00:01:58.130> want<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.340> show

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
begin now the first thing I want to show

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.609 
begin now the first thing I want to show
you<00:01:58.549> is<00:01:58.820> this<00:01:58.970> new<00:01:59.240> core<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.840> G<00:02:00.080> chord<00:02:00.350> I

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
you is this new core of the G chord I

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.560 
you is this new core of the G chord I
think<00:02:01.369> you'll<00:02:01.490> find<00:02:01.640> it<00:02:01.820> straightforward

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
think you'll find it straightforward

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.060 
think you'll find it straightforward
it's<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.960> middle<00:02:03.229> finger<00:02:03.440> on<00:02:03.649> the<00:02:03.770> sixth

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
it's the middle finger on the sixth

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.910 
it's the middle finger on the sixth
string<00:02:04.130> at<00:02:04.340> fret<00:02:04.369> three<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:06.229> first<00:02:06.440> finger<00:02:06.740> on

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
string at fret three the first finger on

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.520 
string at fret three the first finger on
the<00:02:07.280> fifth<00:02:07.550> string<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:08.149> fret<00:02:08.420> two<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:09.050> then

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
the fifth string of fret two and then

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.790 
the fifth string of fret two and then
these<00:02:09.709> two<00:02:09.979> fingers<00:02:10.930> the<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.350> third<00:02:12.590> finger

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
these two fingers the the third finger

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.470 
these two fingers the the third finger
goes<00:02:12.950> on<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.280> second<00:02:13.730> string<00:02:13.880> at<00:02:14.000> fret<00:02:14.030> three

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
goes on the second string at fret three

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.660 
goes on the second string at fret three
and<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:15.170> little<00:02:15.440> finger<00:02:15.620> goes<00:02:15.890> right<00:02:16.160> next<00:02:16.550> to

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
and the little finger goes right next to

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.940 
and the little finger goes right next to
it<00:02:16.700> on<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.269> first<00:02:17.540> string<00:02:17.720> at<00:02:17.840> fret<00:02:17.870> three<00:02:18.319> so

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
it on the first string at fret three so

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.229 
it on the first string at fret three so
if<00:02:19.069> you<00:02:19.160> just<00:02:19.340> want<00:02:19.519> to<00:02:19.580> look<00:02:19.700> at<00:02:19.819> that<00:02:19.940> chord

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
if you just want to look at that chord

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.540 
if you just want to look at that chord
diagram<00:02:20.690> next<00:02:20.989> to<00:02:21.080> me<00:02:21.170> just<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.500> clarify<00:02:22.010> what

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
diagram next to me just to clarify what

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.130 
diagram next to me just to clarify what
those<00:02:22.730> notes<00:02:23.000> are<00:02:23.269> and<00:02:23.600> you're<00:02:23.840> going<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.019> use

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
those notes are and you're going to use

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.430 
those notes are and you're going to use
the<00:02:24.290> plectrum<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.860> strum<00:02:25.130> all<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.400> strings

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
the plectrum to strum all the strings

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.470 
the plectrum to strum all the strings
now<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.100> should<00:02:28.490> know<00:02:28.700> by<00:02:28.940> now<00:02:29.150> if<00:02:29.360> you

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
now you should know by now if you

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.850 
now you should know by now if you
remember<00:02:29.870> me<00:02:30.020> telling<00:02:30.200> you<00:02:30.440> in<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.680> last

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
remember me telling you in the last

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.830 
remember me telling you in the last
lesson<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:31.970> should<00:02:32.150> be<00:02:32.270> arching<00:02:32.690> these

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
lesson that you should be arching these

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.540 
lesson that you should be arching these
fingers<00:02:33.290> up<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.650> there<00:02:33.830> should<00:02:34.010> be<00:02:34.040> plenty<00:02:34.340> of

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
fingers up and there should be plenty of

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.000 
fingers up and there should be plenty of
space<00:02:34.940> underneath<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.590> know<00:02:36.710> you<00:02:36.770> should

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
space underneath and you know you should

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.260 
space underneath and you know you should
be<00:02:37.040> holding<00:02:37.430> down<00:02:37.460> with<00:02:37.700> lots<00:02:37.850> of<00:02:38.000> pressure

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
be holding down with lots of pressure

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.600 
be holding down with lots of pressure
and<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.020> back<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.440> finger<00:02:39.980> shouldn't<00:02:40.460> be

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
and the back of the finger shouldn't be

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.640 
and the back of the finger shouldn't be
accidentally<00:02:41.540> touching<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.170> string<00:02:42.470> behind

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
accidentally touching the string behind

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.160 
accidentally touching the string behind
it<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:43.610> that<00:02:43.640> when<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.120> strum<00:02:44.510> all<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.720> all

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
it so that when you strum all the all

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.220 
it so that when you strum all the all
the<00:02:45.320> notes<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.890> should<00:02:46.070> sound<00:02:46.250> like<00:02:46.430> this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.430 

nice<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.220> clean<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.790> clear<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:52.110> if<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.290> need

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
nice and clean and clear so if you need

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.930 
nice and clean and clear so if you need
to<00:02:52.470> practice<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.099> for<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.340> second<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:53.910> know

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
to practice that for a second you know

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.729 
to practice that for a second you know
by<00:02:54.180> all<00:02:54.330> means<00:02:54.569> pause<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.140> video<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.709> just

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
by all means pause the video and just

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.320 
by all means pause the video and just
make<00:02:56.250> sure<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.519> got<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.819> right

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
make sure you got that right

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.080 
make sure you got that right
so<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:58.110> strumming<00:02:58.560> pattern<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.879> we're<00:03:00.000> going

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
so this strumming pattern so we're going

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.610 
so this strumming pattern so we're going
to<00:03:00.180> strum<00:03:00.420> downwards<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:02.489> then<00:03:02.730> upwards<00:03:03.620> and

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
to strum downwards and then upwards and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.620 
to strum downwards and then upwards and
then<00:03:04.800> we're<00:03:04.920> going<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.069> do<00:03:05.250> this<00:03:05.400> chop<00:03:05.760> right

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
then we're going to do this chop right

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.690 
then we're going to do this chop right
so<00:03:06.870> let<00:03:07.019> me<00:03:07.140> explain<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.769> now<00:03:07.980> now<00:03:08.400> what<00:03:08.580> the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
so let me explain that now now what the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.059 
so let me explain that now now what the
chop<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.209> is<00:03:09.480> we're<00:03:10.290> going<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.470> use<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.800> palm

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
chop is is we're going to use the palm

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.580 
chop is is we're going to use the palm
of<00:03:11.310> our<00:03:11.430> hand<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:12.300> touch<00:03:12.660> all<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.290> strings

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
of our hand to touch all the strings

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.729 
of our hand to touch all the strings
like<00:03:13.860> this<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.790> what<00:03:14.940> happens<00:03:15.360> is<00:03:15.569> our<00:03:15.870> hand

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
like this and what happens is our hand

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.740 
like this and what happens is our hand
comes<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.580> palm<00:03:17.819> touches<00:03:18.239> all<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.450> strings

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
comes the palm touches all the strings

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.380 
comes the palm touches all the strings
and<00:03:18.989> then<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.040> plectrum<00:03:20.280> follows<00:03:20.849> through

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
and then the plectrum follows through

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.089 
and then the plectrum follows through
but<00:03:21.540> because<00:03:22.170> we're<00:03:22.380> touching<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.769> strings

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
but because we're touching the strings

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.930 
but because we're touching the strings
all<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.519> notes<00:03:23.730> are<00:03:23.940> muted<00:03:24.709> like<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:25.940> now

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
all the notes are muted like that now

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.309 
all the notes are muted like that now
you<00:03:27.000> shouldn't<00:03:27.299> be<00:03:27.390> able<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.630> hear<00:03:27.870> any<00:03:28.019> notes

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
you shouldn't be able to hear any notes

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.039 
you shouldn't be able to hear any notes
at<00:03:28.560> all<00:03:28.739> if<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.099> can<00:03:29.130> hear<00:03:29.489> anything<00:03:30.049> like

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
at all if you can hear anything like

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.960 
at all if you can hear anything like
that<00:03:31.110> then<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:32.040> need<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.340> make<00:03:32.640> sure<00:03:32.670> you're

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
that then you need to make sure you're

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.610 
that then you need to make sure you're
holding<00:03:33.390> down<00:03:33.569> on<00:03:33.750> those<00:03:33.930> strings<00:03:34.290> with<00:03:34.470> more

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
holding down on those strings with more

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.039 
holding down on those strings with more
pressure<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.280> they<00:03:36.030> should<00:03:36.209> be<00:03:36.329> totally<00:03:36.810> dead

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
pressure and they should be totally dead

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.600 
pressure and they should be totally dead
so<00:03:40.049> that'll<00:03:40.410> take<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.620> little<00:03:40.860> bit<00:03:41.010> of<00:03:41.069> practice

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
so that'll take a little bit of practice

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.940 
so that'll take a little bit of practice
and<00:03:41.880> eventually<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:43.140> can<00:03:43.349> bring<00:03:43.560> your<00:03:43.709> hand

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
and eventually you can bring your hand

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.270 
and eventually you can bring your hand
down<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:45.019> chop<00:03:46.019> all<00:03:46.260> in<00:03:46.470> one<00:03:46.650> motion<00:03:46.890> like

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
down and chop all in one motion like

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.690 
down and chop all in one motion like
that<00:03:50.690> okay<00:03:51.690> so<00:03:52.200> just<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.650> clarify<00:03:52.860> I'll<00:03:53.489> tell

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
that okay so just to clarify I'll tell

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.460 
that okay so just to clarify I'll tell
you<00:03:53.819> again<00:03:54.030> make<00:03:54.359> sure<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.079> palm<00:03:55.290> of

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
you again make sure that the palm of

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.080 
you again make sure that the palm of
your<00:03:55.500> hand<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:55.950> laying<00:03:56.340> across<00:03:56.549> all<00:03:56.850> those

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
your hand is laying across all those

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.330 
your hand is laying across all those
strings<00:03:57.389> and<00:03:57.690> effectively<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.950> know<00:03:59.010> killing

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
strings and effectively you know killing

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.129 
strings and effectively you know killing
the<00:03:59.579> notes<00:03:59.930> okay

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
the notes okay

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.309 
the notes okay
so<00:04:01.410> what<00:04:01.590> happens<00:04:01.980> is<00:04:03.109> you're<00:04:04.109> going<00:04:04.230> to

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
so what happens is you're going to

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.930 
so what happens is you're going to
practice<00:04:04.500> it<00:04:04.950> until<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.459> can<00:04:05.609> do<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:05.850> like

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
practice it until you can do it like

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.410 
practice it until you can do it like
that<00:04:06.000> nice<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.389> smooth<00:04:06.900> all<00:04:07.350> in<00:04:07.620> one<00:04:07.769> motion

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.879 

okay<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:12.480> that's<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.989> Chop<00:04:13.260> that's<00:04:13.590> how<00:04:13.709> it

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
okay so that's the Chop that's how it

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.710 
okay so that's the Chop that's how it
works<00:04:14.100> so<00:04:14.459> when<00:04:14.910> we<00:04:15.030> put<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.329> into<00:04:15.510> the

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
works so when we put that into the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.949 
works so when we put that into the
strumming<00:04:16.079> pattern<00:04:16.109> we're<00:04:16.799> going<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:16.979> go<00:04:17.070> down

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:43.159 

chop<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.200> then<00:04:21.650> up<00:04:21.800> again<00:04:22.450> sound<00:04:23.450> like<00:04:23.600> this

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.770 

okay<00:04:43.979> now<00:04:44.430> it's<00:04:44.729> easier<00:04:45.120> said<00:04:45.360> than<00:04:45.509> done<00:04:45.569> I

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
okay now it's easier said than done I

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.749 
okay now it's easier said than done I
expect<00:04:46.199> that<00:04:46.889> I'll<00:04:47.009> take<00:04:47.159> you<00:04:47.280> quite<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.490> bit<00:04:47.550> of

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
expect that I'll take you quite a bit of

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.760 
expect that I'll take you quite a bit of
time<00:04:47.909> to<00:04:48.090> practice<00:04:48.330> that<00:04:48.749> I<00:04:48.960> mean<00:04:49.319> I<00:04:49.439> know<00:04:49.530> it

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
time to practice that I mean I know it

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.409 
time to practice that I mean I know it
takes<00:04:49.949> my<00:04:50.159> students<00:04:50.639> quite<00:04:50.819> a<00:04:50.849> while<00:04:51.120> before

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
takes my students quite a while before

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.969 
takes my students quite a while before
they<00:04:51.719> really<00:04:52.080> get<00:04:52.259> the<00:04:52.289> hang<00:04:52.499> of<00:04:52.650> it

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
they really get the hang of it

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.529 
they really get the hang of it
so<00:04:53.189> that's<00:04:53.400> brilliant<00:04:53.610> so<00:04:53.939> go<00:04:54.090> easy<00:04:54.120> on
