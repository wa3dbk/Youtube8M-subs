00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:09.890 

I<00:00:07.280> think<00:00:08.280> for<00:00:08.460> Charles<00:00:08.790> Schultz<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.330> was<00:00:09.509> his

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
I think for Charles Schultz it was his

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.980 
I think for Charles Schultz it was his
best<00:00:10.710> way<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.429> expressing<00:00:11.910> himself<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:12.750> all

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
best way of expressing himself we all

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.680 
best way of expressing himself we all
express<00:00:13.650> ourselves<00:00:13.910> heart<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.059> soul<00:00:15.330> through

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
express ourselves heart and soul through

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.269 
express ourselves heart and soul through
the<00:00:15.719> work<00:00:15.959> that<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.320> do<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.740> no<00:00:16.859> matter<00:00:17.010> how

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
the work that we do and no matter how

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.480 
the work that we do and no matter how
bizarre<00:00:17.760> absurd<00:00:18.720> or<00:00:19.019> silly<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.710> there's

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
bizarre absurd or silly it is there's

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.000 
bizarre absurd or silly it is there's
still<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.760> tremendous<00:00:20.939> amount<00:00:21.599> of<00:00:21.869> us<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.890> you

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
still a tremendous amount of us that you

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.650 
still a tremendous amount of us that you
see<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.369> what<00:00:23.580> we<00:00:23.699> do<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.179> way<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.449> draw

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
see in what we do and the way we draw

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.929 
see in what we do and the way we draw
and<00:00:24.929> I<00:00:24.990> think<00:00:25.260> he<00:00:25.800> needed<00:00:26.099> each<00:00:26.400> one<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.820> those

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
and I think he needed each one of those

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.330 
and I think he needed each one of those
characters<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.599> express<00:00:28.199> himself<00:00:28.380> wholly<00:00:28.980> I

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
characters to express himself wholly I

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.669 
characters to express himself wholly I
don't<00:00:29.939> think<00:00:30.119> he<00:00:30.300> was<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.750> don't<00:00:31.289> think<00:00:31.500> he

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
don't think he was I don't think he

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.889 
don't think he was I don't think he
expressed<00:00:32.099> himself<00:00:32.340> entirely<00:00:33.270> when<00:00:33.719> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
expressed himself entirely when you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.750 
expressed himself entirely when you
interviewed<00:00:34.559> him<00:00:34.680> for<00:00:34.860> example<00:00:35.190> or<00:00:35.430> even<00:00:35.460> if

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
interviewed him for example or even if

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.479 
interviewed him for example or even if
you<00:00:35.879> were<00:00:35.969> his<00:00:36.149> best<00:00:36.420> friend<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.110> think<00:00:37.980> he<00:00:38.309> was

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
you were his best friend I think he was

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.250 
you were his best friend I think he was
still<00:00:38.789> much<00:00:39.090> more<00:00:39.300> comfortable<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:40.020> saying

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
still much more comfortable just saying

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.900 
still much more comfortable just saying
what<00:00:40.500> he<00:00:40.590> felt<00:00:40.800> through<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> characters<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
what he felt through the characters and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.729 
what he felt through the characters and
a<00:00:42.360> number<00:00:42.539> of<00:00:42.660> us<00:00:42.809> are<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
a number of us are like that and a

a number of us are like that and a
number<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.129> his<00:00:44.250> whole<00:00:44.460> work<00:00:44.700> till<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.149> just
