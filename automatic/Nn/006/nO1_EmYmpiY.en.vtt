this<00:00:00.570> it<00:00:00.989> gets<00:00:01.140> bigger<00:00:01.469> but<00:00:01.770> then<00:00:01.979> we<00:00:02.370> still

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
this it gets bigger but then we still

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.530 
this it gets bigger but then we still
have<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:03.060> go<00:00:03.179> beyond<00:00:05.180> in<00:00:06.180> my<00:00:06.330> group<00:00:06.509> we

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
have to go beyond in my group we

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.570 
have to go beyond in my group we
developed<00:00:07.290> new<00:00:07.440> ways<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.620> make<00:00:07.950> compounds

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
developed new ways to make compounds

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.459 
developed new ways to make compounds
that<00:00:08.730> will<00:00:09.030> hopefully<00:00:09.630> be<00:00:09.960> useful<00:00:10.320> for

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
that will hopefully be useful for

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.499 
that will hopefully be useful for
renewable<00:00:10.889> energy<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.940> main<00:00:12.090> areas<00:00:12.389> we

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
renewable energy so the main areas we

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.850 
renewable energy so the main areas we
work<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.870> our<00:00:13.049> lithium-ion<00:00:13.740> rechargeable

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
work in our lithium-ion rechargeable

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.340 
work in our lithium-ion rechargeable
batteries<00:00:14.700> solar<00:00:15.450> cells<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.109> hydrogen

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
batteries solar cells and hydrogen

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.140 
batteries solar cells and hydrogen
storage<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.490> it's<00:00:18.770> we<00:00:19.770> hope<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.369> figure<00:00:20.939> out

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
storage so it's we hope to figure out

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.689 
storage so it's we hope to figure out
how<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.420> make<00:00:21.720> either<00:00:22.680> new<00:00:23.039> materials<00:00:23.550> with

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
how to make either new materials with

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.279 
how to make either new materials with
good<00:00:23.850> properties<00:00:24.300> or<00:00:24.660> figure<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.140> how<00:00:25.230> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
good properties or figure out how to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.320 
good properties or figure out how to
make<00:00:25.470> known<00:00:26.099> materials<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.699> new<00:00:26.789> ways<00:00:26.970> that

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
make known materials and new ways that

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.590 
make known materials and new ways that
will<00:00:27.510> let<00:00:27.750> us<00:00:27.869> put<00:00:28.199> them<00:00:28.349> into<00:00:28.529> useful<00:00:28.740> devices

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.230 

we<00:00:32.600> figured<00:00:33.140> out<00:00:33.440> how<00:00:33.500> to<00:00:33.830> make<00:00:34.310> some<00:00:34.670> useful

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.240 
we figured out how to make some useful

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.850 
we figured out how to make some useful
battery<00:00:35.510> materials<00:00:35.960> by<00:00:36.080> electroplating

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
battery materials by electroplating

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.100 
battery materials by electroplating
so<00:00:37.370> because<00:00:37.670> of<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.210> way<00:00:38.330> we<00:00:38.480> electroplated

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
so because of the way we electroplated

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.560 
so because of the way we electroplated
we<00:00:39.680> put<00:00:39.890> these<00:00:40.010> materials<00:00:40.460> on<00:00:40.610> to<00:00:40.970> a<00:00:41.000> current

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
we put these materials on to a current

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.780 
we put these materials on to a current
collector<00:00:41.990> which<00:00:42.200> we<00:00:42.410> can<00:00:42.560> then<00:00:42.590> just<00:00:43.010> slide

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
collector which we can then just slide

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.640 
collector which we can then just slide
right<00:00:43.820> into<00:00:44.180> a<00:00:44.330> battery<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.020> then<00:00:45.200> cycle<00:00:45.560> it

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
right into a battery and then cycle it

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.670 
right into a battery and then cycle it
and<00:00:45.770> see<00:00:45.860> if<00:00:45.980> it<00:00:46.070> works<00:00:46.600> in<00:00:47.600> theory<00:00:48.050> you<00:00:48.380> will

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
and see if it works in theory you will

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.650 
and see if it works in theory you will
have<00:00:48.890> an<00:00:49.190> electric<00:00:49.580> car<00:00:49.760> with<00:00:49.790> a<00:00:49.970> battery<00:00:50.210> that

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
have an electric car with a battery that

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.780 
have an electric car with a battery that
will<00:00:50.840> let<00:00:51.080> you<00:00:51.260> drive<00:00:51.559> more<00:00:52.160> miles<00:00:52.460> on<00:00:52.760> a

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
will let you drive more miles on a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.010 
will let you drive more miles on a
single<00:00:52.880> charge<00:00:53.180> than<00:00:53.630> what<00:00:53.720> we<00:00:53.840> have<00:00:53.989> today

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
single charge than what we have today

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.260 
single charge than what we have today
it'll<00:00:54.890> let<00:00:55.130> you<00:00:55.160> charge<00:00:55.610> and<00:00:55.790> discharge<00:00:55.910> it

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
it'll let you charge and discharge it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.150 
it'll let you charge and discharge it
faster<00:00:56.989> which<00:00:57.200> means<00:00:57.230> you'll<00:00:57.650> get<00:00:57.770> to<00:00:57.890> charge

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
faster which means you'll get to charge

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.670 
faster which means you'll get to charge
your<00:00:58.309> battery<00:00:58.370> faster<00:00:59.090> that<00:00:59.720> battery<00:01:00.350> will

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
your battery faster that battery will

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.920 
your battery faster that battery will
occupy<00:01:00.980> is<00:01:01.190> slightly<00:01:01.970> smaller<00:01:02.120> volume<00:01:02.780> in

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
occupy is slightly smaller volume in

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.960 
occupy is slightly smaller volume in
your<00:01:03.050> car<00:01:03.260> than<00:01:03.620> current<00:01:03.980> electric<00:01:04.610> batteries

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
your car than current electric batteries

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.500 
your car than current electric batteries
and<00:01:05.500> it'll<00:01:06.500> be<00:01:06.620> a<00:01:06.650> lot<00:01:06.770> safer<00:01:07.150> so<00:01:08.150> you<00:01:08.210> won't

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
and it'll be a lot safer so you won't

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.660 
and it'll be a lot safer so you won't
have<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.840> same<00:01:09.050> danger<00:01:09.470> of<00:01:09.590> fires<00:01:09.860> as<00:01:10.310> we<00:01:10.520> have

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
have the same danger of fires as we have

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.120 
have the same danger of fires as we have
now<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:11.330> more<00:01:12.080> importantly<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:12.650> think<00:01:12.800> in

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
now and more importantly I think in

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.370 
now and more importantly I think in
terms<00:01:13.340> of<00:01:13.520> actually<00:01:14.090> having<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.630> lot<00:01:15.050> of<00:01:15.140> people

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
terms of actually having a lot of people

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.600 
terms of actually having a lot of people
use<00:01:15.530> this<00:01:15.680> battery<00:01:16.010> it's<00:01:16.159> gonna<00:01:16.280> be<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.490> lot

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
use this battery it's gonna be a lot

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.020 
use this battery it's gonna be a lot
cheaper<00:01:16.640> I<00:01:17.500> was<00:01:18.500> very<00:01:18.950> fortunate<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.640> win<00:01:19.970> a

the teaching part I love is in the lab I

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.219 
the teaching part I love is in the lab I
like<00:01:44.469> classroom<00:01:45.039> teaching<00:01:45.250> a<00:01:45.490> lot<00:01:45.700> but<00:01:46.539> I<00:01:46.570> love

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229
