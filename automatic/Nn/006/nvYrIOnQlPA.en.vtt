00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.779 

what<00:00:20.330> I<00:00:20.359> have<00:00:20.750> here<00:00:21.109> is<00:00:21.380> another<00:00:21.740> small<00:00:22.220> motor

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
what I have here is another small motor

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.470 
what I have here is another small motor
that<00:00:23.210> I<00:00:23.240> took<00:00:23.689> out<00:00:23.930> from<00:00:24.140> my<00:00:24.349> Epson<00:00:24.859> printer

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
that I took out from my Epson printer

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.580 
that I took out from my Epson printer
this<00:00:26.480> one<00:00:26.779> is<00:00:26.930> a<00:00:26.960> DC<00:00:27.500> motor<00:00:27.770> and<00:00:29.169> I'm<00:00:30.169> trying<00:00:30.529> to

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
this one is a DC motor and I'm trying to

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.520 
this one is a DC motor and I'm trying to
see<00:00:30.890> what<00:00:31.279> kind<00:00:31.310> of<00:00:31.669> voltage<00:00:32.629> I<00:00:33.020> can<00:00:33.050> get<00:00:33.410> out

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
see what kind of voltage I can get out

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.990 
see what kind of voltage I can get out
of<00:00:33.559> this<00:00:34.210> apparently<00:00:35.210> it's<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:35.960> very<00:00:36.830> high<00:00:37.100> rpm

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
of this apparently it's a very high rpm

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.310 
of this apparently it's a very high rpm
motor<00:00:38.360> so<00:00:39.350> it<00:00:39.589> needs<00:00:39.829> to<00:00:40.540> be<00:00:41.540> turning<00:00:42.079> very

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
motor so it needs to be turning very

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.390 
motor so it needs to be turning very
fast<00:00:42.739> but<00:00:43.640> I<00:00:43.850> was<00:00:44.150> thinking<00:00:44.650> just<00:00:45.650> using<00:00:46.220> this

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
fast but I was thinking just using this

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.760 
fast but I was thinking just using this
motor<00:00:46.790> to<00:00:47.290> charge<00:00:48.290> a<00:00:48.739> small<00:00:50.170> maybe<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.289> set<00:00:51.649> of

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
motor to charge a small maybe a set of

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.209 
motor to charge a small maybe a set of
double<00:00:52.100> A<00:00:52.460> batteries<00:00:52.510> in<00:00:53.510> parallel<00:00:53.840> so<00:00:54.649> I

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
double A batteries in parallel so I

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.529 
double A batteries in parallel so I
would<00:00:55.789> need<00:00:56.000> no<00:00:56.780> more<00:00:57.079> than<00:00:57.489> 1.6<00:00:58.489> spokes<00:00:59.030> or<00:00:59.269> so

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
would need no more than 1.6 spokes or so

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.169 
would need no more than 1.6 spokes or so
I<00:01:01.239> would<00:01:02.239> have<00:01:02.390> to<00:01:02.539> get<00:01:02.960> a<00:01:02.989> small<00:01:03.410> dial<00:01:03.769> and<00:01:04.280> I

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:05.179 
I would have to get a small dial and I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:07.810 
I would have to get a small dial and I
just<00:01:05.449> happen<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.929> have<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.229> Schottky<00:01:07.100> diode

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
just happen to have a Schottky diode

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.540 
just happen to have a Schottky diode
that<00:01:08.240> I<00:01:08.270> can<00:01:08.570> use<00:01:08.929> also<00:01:09.470> taken<00:01:10.130> out<00:01:10.280> from<00:01:10.460> the

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
that I can use also taken out from the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.359 
that I can use also taken out from the
Epson<00:01:11.149> printer<00:01:11.630> actually<00:01:12.350> I<00:01:12.380> tested<00:01:12.890> before

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
Epson printer actually I tested before

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.389 
Epson printer actually I tested before
and<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.149> was<00:01:14.300> getting<00:01:14.539> about<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.899> 1.5<00:01:15.320> bolt<00:01:16.130> and

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
and I was getting about a 1.5 bolt and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.380 
and I was getting about a 1.5 bolt and
you<00:01:16.929> see<00:01:17.929> the<00:01:18.140> shape<00:01:18.410> of<00:01:18.679> these<00:01:19.490> blades<00:01:19.970> that<00:01:20.360> I

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
you see the shape of these blades that I

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.999 
you see the shape of these blades that I
just<00:01:21.039> made<00:01:22.039> for<00:01:22.549> testing<00:01:23.000> purpose<00:01:23.979> when<00:01:24.979> I

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
just made for testing purpose when I

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.990 
just made for testing purpose when I
flattened<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.000> blades<00:01:26.869> it<00:01:27.500> goes<00:01:27.799> a<00:01:28.159> little

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
flattened the blades it goes a little

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.940 
flattened the blades it goes a little
bit<00:01:29.360> faster<00:01:29.689> so<00:01:30.229> that's<00:01:30.380> what<00:01:30.619> I'm<00:01:30.710> going<00:01:30.920> to

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
bit faster so that's what I'm going to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.580 
bit faster so that's what I'm going to
do<00:01:31.159> I'm<00:01:31.340> going<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.549> flatten<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:32.270> some<00:01:32.540> more

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:50.899 

than<00:01:36.590> before<00:01:36.829> okay<00:01:37.310> let's<00:01:38.030> try<00:01:38.240> it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.810 

of<00:01:51.390> course<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.140> gear<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.680> up<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.130> that

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
of course I can gear it up but that

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.749 
of course I can gear it up but that
complicates<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.229> process<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:59.430> would<00:01:59.579> have

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
complicates the process you would have

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.700 
complicates the process you would have
to<00:01:59.909> engineered<00:02:00.570> quite<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> bit<00:02:01.560> more<00:02:03.649> right<00:02:04.649> now

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
to engineered quite a bit more right now

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.420 
to engineered quite a bit more right now
it's<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.610> 1.7<00:02:06.360> three<00:02:07.140> volts<00:02:09.349> so<00:02:10.349> I

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
it's going up to 1.7 three volts so I

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.750 
it's going up to 1.7 three volts so I
modify<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:12.420> blades<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.989> little<00:02:13.290> bit<00:02:13.489> making<00:02:14.489> it

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
modify the blades a little bit making it

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.290 
modify the blades a little bit making it
a<00:02:14.819> bit<00:02:15.180> more<00:02:16.519> aerodynamic<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.880> voltage

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
a bit more aerodynamic and the voltage

00:02:21.300 --> 00:03:00.699 
a bit more aerodynamic and the voltage
has<00:02:21.510> gone<00:02:22.110> up<00:02:57.319> making<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.650> blades<00:02:58.980> more

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
has gone up making the blades more

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.170 
has gone up making the blades more
aerodynamic<00:03:02.120> more<00:03:03.120> airfoil<00:03:03.750> shape<00:03:04.079> thus<00:03:04.410> help

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
aerodynamic more airfoil shape thus help

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.140 
aerodynamic more airfoil shape thus help
the<00:03:06.180> voltage<00:03:06.600> went<00:03:06.870> up<00:03:07.019> from<00:03:07.430> two<00:03:08.430> folks<00:03:08.790> -

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
the voltage went up from two folks -

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.610 
the voltage went up from two folks -
four<00:03:09.510> volts<00:03:12.139> so<00:03:13.139> this<00:03:13.650> is<00:03:13.859> how<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.190> looks<00:03:15.620> maybe

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
four volts so this is how it looks maybe

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:26.440 
four volts so this is how it looks maybe
if<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.280> make<00:03:17.579> a<00:03:17.910> blades<00:03:18.750> thinner<00:03:20.959> it<00:03:21.959> would<00:03:22.170> help

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.530 

maybe<00:03:27.080> I<00:03:27.260> cut<00:03:27.740> off<00:03:27.890> this<00:03:28.430> part<00:03:28.490> here<00:03:29.180> that

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
maybe I cut off this part here that

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:41.980 
maybe I cut off this part here that
would<00:03:30.260> help<00:03:30.470> too<00:03:31.090> I'm<00:03:32.090> sure

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.050 

you
