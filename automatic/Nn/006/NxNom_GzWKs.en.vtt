00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.060
 take advantage of the benefits of the coast 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.370
 equine queen

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.050
 chainsaw has rolled him into the house 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.410
 we were strong we made entertaining the 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.480
 old and there I learned how to cut how to measure 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.610
 with the winter how can you match with 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.140
 the squads 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.060

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.350
 polishing ages I'm perfecting 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.330
 later I had to dedicate myself to work 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.950
 to be able to feed the brothers who 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.510

 when the boy we were by 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.210
 now we have something but not before 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.210
 I had 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.890

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.780
 if you go out 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.130
 what I want for the future for this 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.850
 community that is maintained and that 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.930
 keep quiet clean as you 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.670
 has always maintained 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.330
 if people stuck in between are the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.110
 passing black dots and traffickers 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:12.320
 the young people who walk for bad people 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:13.640
 drunk what we keep kids boys 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.450
 they can go wherever they want 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.660
 care 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.450
 we teach the children how to plant how 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.650
 cook as everything as a chick is born 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.400
 of the eggs how it grows 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.409
 that is our duty to teach to 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.840
 people to people playing that already 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.470
 old no longer 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.440
 not to learn about the gulf is a man 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.790
 rather away from civilization 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.160
 rejects the use of technology although 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.590
 account that the majority of those who live 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.019
 Here are ordinary people who 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.209
 works during the day but they opt 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.870
 for a different time when the clock 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.730
 marks the enemy exit time of the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.370
 media who brand it 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.379
 as a hippie community rodolfo 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.870
 prefers to stay out of the 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.340
 declared national event tells you 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.829
 something in journalism but the planet what 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.350
 he puts his form then goes out to the 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.120
 hippies for example 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.740
 we have for everyone how the hits 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.480
 of the hippie community but here in the 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.610
 civic community 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.040
 ecological and there all have to pay 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.040

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.140

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.030

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.150

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.450

 discovery a different look at the 

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:51.529
 society that a small group of 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:55.119
 families can convey us with their 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:55.119
 particular way of life
