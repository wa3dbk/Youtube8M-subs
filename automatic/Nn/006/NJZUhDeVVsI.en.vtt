00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.430
 two 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.309
 Y 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.809
 today what we are going to make is an ornament 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.719
 for halloween night with some 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.680
 pumpkins we will obviously need 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.580
 a pumpkin a few straws for example the 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.640
 black color better 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.930
 painting although I previously have 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.570
 painted because they had to take out a 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.900
 bit hard has used paint 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.370
 acrylic 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.910
 Brushes 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:34.730
 a peeler that is to do those 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.090
 holes to put the straws and 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.100
 little bit more let's start is 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.160
 zucchini I painted it in color 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.370
 orange 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.500
 we have caught 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.940
 a pencil and we have marked what is the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.649
 eye drawing of the other eye 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.129
 or remarking is a little more with a 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.129
 marker pen 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:04.060
 we will have finished a garlic 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.060
 and we will continue with the other 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.640
 Y 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.590
 well after painting the eyes 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.590
 we are going to make some fangs 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.210
 I will fill them 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.770
 as you can see some fangs 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.780
 We have finished reviewing the picture 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.380
 now as you can see 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.530
 we have here an ugly face with the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.790
 fangs and now we will continue going to 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.430
 put what are the legs 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.610
 what are the straws we will mold a 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.060
 little bit we have picked up about 8 straws for 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.040
 the spiders have four legs at each 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.840
 side 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.879
 44 and it 's the end of molding 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.720
 you can do it open and closed as 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:24.680
 you want to be flexible and now 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.959
 we will mark the tip with a peeler 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.080
 to be able to put what is the straw 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:34.480
 we will cut them because they are very long 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.459
 Ok we will mark in four points 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.150
 a bit to put what is the 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.150
 base of the straw 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.020
 we perform the last hole 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.930
 we try again 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:27.410
 in part of here we will tell you 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.410
 what are the legs 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.500
 Y 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:21.769
 and once the legs are finished we are going to 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.100
 touch up a bit because of playing with the 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.100
 fingers 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.780
 the paint has slipped a bit 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.460
 here and you 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:41.680
 Once you have done this because we will have 

00:04:38.829 --> 00:04:45.090
 finished what is 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.090
 decorate this pumpkin 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.110
 and we have it 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.110
