00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
and everything will be good because it

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.780 
and everything will be good because it

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.060 
might be a bit confusing for you right
now<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:14.049> once<00:01:14.259> you've<00:01:14.409> got<00:01:14.560> all<00:01:14.590> your<00:01:14.829> blocks

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
now so once you've got all your blocks

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.789 
now so once you've got all your blocks
placed<00:01:15.640> down<00:01:16.240> in<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.659> right<00:01:16.840> areas<00:01:17.409> and<00:01:17.649> stuff

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799

placed down in the right areas and stuff
you<00:01:18.640> want<00:01:18.789> to<00:01:18.820> start<00:01:19.030> putting<00:01:19.149> your<00:01:19.360> rails

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
you want to start putting your rails

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.480 
you want to start putting your rails
down<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.140> you<00:01:20.710> probably<00:01:20.829> want<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.130> test<00:01:21.250> drive

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
down and you probably want to test drive

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.830 
down and you probably want to test drive
it<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.789> make<00:01:21.909> sure<00:01:21.939> all<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.329> powered<00:01:22.630> rails

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
it to make sure all the powered rails

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.870 
it to make sure all the powered rails
work<00:01:23.079> or<00:01:23.439> the<00:01:23.619> corners<00:01:24.039> work<00:01:24.219> and<00:01:24.579> everything

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
work or the corners work and everything

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.889 
work or the corners work and everything
is<00:01:25.030> good<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:27.219> word<00:01:27.640> of<00:01:27.820> mention<00:01:28.299> do<00:01:28.719> not

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
is good just a word of mention do not

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.499 
is good just a word of mention do not
use<00:01:29.340> detector<00:01:30.340> rails<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.820> you'll<00:01:31.000> see<00:01:31.270> why

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
use detector rails and you'll see why

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.260 
use detector rails and you'll see why
towards<00:01:32.049> the<00:01:32.109> end<00:01:32.259> of<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.500> video<00:01:32.909> why<00:01:33.909> their

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
towards the end of the video why their

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.029 
towards the end of the video why their
reason<00:01:34.960> is<00:01:35.049> because<00:01:35.439> it<00:01:35.560> gives<00:01:35.649> it<00:01:35.799> a<00:01:35.829> block

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
reason is because it gives it a block

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.730 
reason is because it gives it a block
update<00:01:36.219> but<00:01:36.969> you'll<00:01:37.060> see<00:01:37.210> that<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.560> once

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
update but you'll see that so once

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.889 
update but you'll see that so once
you've<00:01:38.950> got<00:01:39.340> all<00:01:39.369> your<00:01:39.609> blocks<00:01:39.850> placed<00:01:40.119> in

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
you've got all your blocks placed in

this version so and you can see that the
rails<00:02:01.929> are<00:02:02.200> floating<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:02.799> can<00:02:03.009> ride<00:02:03.249> on<00:02:03.490> them

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
rails are floating you can ride on them

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.270 
rails are floating you can ride on them
in<00:02:03.789> a<00:02:03.820> minecart<00:02:04.299> you<00:02:04.570> can<00:02:04.719> go<00:02:04.840> through<00:02:05.170> them<00:02:05.350> up

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
in a minecart you can go through them up

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.719 
in a minecart you can go through them up
and<00:02:06.520> down<00:02:06.670> edge<00:02:06.969> do<00:02:07.719> not<00:02:07.929> give<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.429> rails<00:02:09.429> a

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.040 
and down edge do not give the rails a
block<00:02:09.970> update<00:02:10.209> or<00:02:10.569> else<00:02:10.720> they'll<00:02:10.899> all

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
block update or else they'll all

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.020 
block update or else they'll all
collapse<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.709> they'll<00:02:11.920> just<00:02:12.190> fall<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.819> the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
collapse and they'll just fall to the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.930 
collapse and they'll just fall to the
floor<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.450> won't<00:02:13.629> work<00:02:13.840> anymore<00:02:14.140> so

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
floor it won't work anymore so

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.390 
floor it won't work anymore so
inclines<00:02:15.810> declines<00:02:16.110> all<00:02:16.740> work<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:16.980> can<00:02:17.370> make

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
and I'm about to show that what happens

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.220 
and I'm about to show that what happens
if<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:22.920> use<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.250> texture<00:02:23.580> rails<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.140> just<00:02:25.140> be

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
if you use the texture rails so just be

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.990 
if you use the texture rails so just be
careful<00:02:25.380> when<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.710> do<00:02:25.830> use<00:02:26.070> detects<00:02:26.820> rail

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
careful when you do use detects rail

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.760 
careful when you do use detects rail
actually<00:02:27.300> don't<00:02:27.600> use<00:02:27.660> detector<00:02:28.260> rails<00:02:28.470> also

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
actually don't use detector rails also

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.370 
actually don't use detector rails also
yeah<00:02:29.160> but<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.300> basically<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.260> can

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380
