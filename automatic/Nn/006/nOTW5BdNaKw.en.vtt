00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:34.000
 using hard stop do not shoot 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.519
 preferably here is the emphasis when fired 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 rifle here throws up and bullets 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:46.059
 accordingly go up too when 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.149
 sniper position is located in high 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.239
 grass and shoot lying down is not necessary 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.730
 apply the method of shooting from the knee when

 upper body arrow is working 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.739
 just as when lying down 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.220
 elbow rests on the knee and elbow 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.350
 there is a building under the rifle 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.070
 heel is strictly under the knee all 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.619
 it forms a straight line draw 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.750

 straight line 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.680
 is it not impossible to break the rifle otherwise 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.680
 will flood right-left 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:59.150
 the belt is taut it allows the arrow 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.150
 shoot standing for quite a long time 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.340

 for tabular source data taken 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.400
 wind speed of 46 meters per second is
