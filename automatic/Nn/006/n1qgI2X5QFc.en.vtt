which<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:33.959> great<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.440> can<00:03:34.620> do<00:03:35.340> that

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
which is great that you can do that

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.580 
which is great that you can do that
hopefully<00:03:35.730> they<00:03:35.910> do<00:03:36.060> not<00:03:36.390> get<00:03:37.019> rid<00:03:37.200> of<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:37.410> in

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
hopefully they do not get rid of this in

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.470 
hopefully they do not get rid of this in
the<00:03:37.680> official<00:03:38.010> build<00:03:38.220> another<00:03:38.730> thing<00:03:39.060> signal

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
the official build another thing signal

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.050 
the official build another thing signal
bars<00:03:39.630> are<00:03:39.900> still<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:40.230> little<00:03:40.440> goofy<00:03:40.890> they<00:03:41.370> kind

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
bars are still a little goofy they kind

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.720 
bars are still a little goofy they kind
of<00:03:42.180> don't<00:03:42.570> go<00:03:42.840> away<00:03:42.959> show<00:03:43.560> up<00:03:43.799> sometimes<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.579> it

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
of don't go away show up sometimes so it

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.099 
of don't go away show up sometimes so it
seems<00:03:44.970> like<00:03:45.120> they<00:03:45.239> haven't<00:03:45.480> really<00:03:45.720> fixed

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
seems like they haven't really fixed

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.680 
seems like they haven't really fixed
that<00:03:46.320> yet<00:03:46.350> I'm<00:03:47.310> sure<00:03:47.640> my<00:03:47.970> guess<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.329> this<00:03:48.480> isn't

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
that yet I'm sure my guess is this isn't

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.420 
that yet I'm sure my guess is this isn't
an<00:03:48.870> official<00:03:49.079> build<00:03:49.410> my<00:03:49.560> guess<00:03:49.799> is<00:03:49.980> official

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
an official build my guess is official

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.390 
an official build my guess is official
will<00:03:50.579> come<00:03:50.760> either<00:03:51.079> mid-march<00:03:52.079> between<00:03:53.040> March

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
will come either mid-march between March

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.240 
will come either mid-march between March
fifteenth<00:03:53.640> is<00:03:54.209> in<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.930> end<00:03:55.079> of<00:03:55.230> March<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:55.739> my

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
fifteenth is in the end of March so my

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.490 
fifteenth is in the end of March so my
guess<00:03:56.310> is<00:03:56.489> that's<00:03:56.790> when<00:03:57.060> they<00:03:57.209> will<00:03:57.540> plan<00:03:58.170> to

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
guess is that's when they will plan to

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.920 
guess is that's when they will plan to
roll<00:03:59.310> out<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.150> official<00:04:00.510> ice<00:04:00.900> cream

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
roll out to the the official ice cream

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.199 
roll out to the the official ice cream
sandwich<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:02.160> epic<00:04:02.370> 4g<00:04:02.400> touch<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:03.030> that's

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
sandwich the epic 4g touch so that's

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.449 
sandwich the epic 4g touch so that's
just<00:04:03.299> a<00:04:03.510> guess<00:04:03.690> though<00:04:04.049> so<00:04:04.410> some<00:04:05.040> other<00:04:05.069> things

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
just a guess though so some other things

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.620 
just a guess though so some other things
with<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:05.670> battery<00:04:06.090> percentage<00:04:06.269> you

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
with that battery percentage you

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.020 
with that battery percentage you
actually<00:04:07.140> can<00:04:07.410> edit<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:07.890> just<00:04:08.850> go<00:04:08.970> to

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
actually can edit that just go to

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.330 
actually can edit that just go to
display<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.139> can<00:04:10.319> change<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.859> actually

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
display and you can change it actually

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.360 
display and you can change it actually
just<00:04:11.489> scroll<00:04:11.850> down<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:12.500> I<00:04:13.500> believe<00:04:13.889> where<00:04:14.160> is

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
just scroll down and I believe where is

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.219 
just scroll down and I believe where is
it<00:04:14.549> there<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:14.970> somewhere<00:04:15.359> you<00:04:15.480> can<00:04:15.600> change<00:04:15.930> it

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
it there is somewhere you can change it

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.860 
it there is somewhere you can change it
I<00:04:16.470> think<00:04:17.430> it's<00:04:17.549> under<00:04:17.760> display<00:04:18.150> there<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.810> is

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
I think it's under display there it is

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.750 
I think it's under display there it is
this<00:04:19.079> play<00:04:19.260> I'm<00:04:19.500> just<00:04:20.039> looked<00:04:20.370> right<00:04:20.519> over

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
this play I'm just looked right over

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.039 
this play I'm just looked right over
display<00:04:21.090> battery<00:04:21.299> percentage<00:04:21.630> you<00:04:21.930> can

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
display battery percentage you can

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.810 
display battery percentage you can
uncheck<00:04:22.200> that<00:04:22.470> if<00:04:23.159> you<00:04:23.220> guys<00:04:23.340> noticed<00:04:23.729> that

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
uncheck that if you guys noticed that

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.219 
uncheck that if you guys noticed that
battery<00:04:24.120> percentage<00:04:24.300> up<00:04:24.659> at<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.810> top<00:04:24.990> one

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
battery percentage up at the top one

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.500 
battery percentage up at the top one
away<00:04:25.409> let's<00:04:25.620> try<00:04:25.830> it<00:04:25.890> again<00:04:25.979> so<00:04:26.370> display

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
away let's try it again so display

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.570 
away let's try it again so display
so<00:04:28.050> as<00:04:28.170> you<00:04:28.260> can<00:04:28.350> see<00:04:28.560> it's<00:04:28.710> it's<00:04:29.010> going<00:04:29.280> and

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
so as you can see it's it's going and

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.920 
so as you can see it's it's going and
coming<00:04:29.730> so<00:04:30.060> that's<00:04:30.210> really<00:04:30.480> great<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:30.840> you

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
coming so that's really great that you

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.570 
coming so that's really great that you
can<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.500> can<00:04:31.680> edit<00:04:31.860> that<00:04:32.010> if<00:04:32.190> you<00:04:32.280> don't<00:04:32.370> want

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
can you can edit that if you don't want

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.010 
can you can edit that if you don't want
the<00:04:32.610> percentage<00:04:33.060> there<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.270> think<00:04:33.780> it's<00:04:33.900> kind

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
the percentage there I think it's kind

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.510 
the percentage there I think it's kind
of<00:04:34.110> nice<00:04:34.230> having<00:04:34.290> it<00:04:34.680> there<00:04:34.710> so<00:04:35.010> I<00:04:35.040> will<00:04:35.250> keep

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
of nice having it there so I will keep

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.760 
of nice having it there so I will keep
it<00:04:35.700> there<00:04:36.000> some<00:04:36.660> other<00:04:36.750> things<00:04:37.140> you've<00:04:37.470> got

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
it there some other things you've got

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.030 
it there some other things you've got
you<00:04:38.700> can<00:04:38.730> actually<00:04:39.360> add<00:04:39.660> whether<00:04:40.320> to<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.830> lock

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
you can actually add whether to the lock

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.550 
you can actually add whether to the lock
screen<00:04:41.190> so<00:04:41.730> add<00:04:42.060> whether<00:04:42.780> it's<00:04:43.110> as<00:04:43.230> networks

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
screen so add whether it's as networks

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.820 
screen so add whether it's as networks
not<00:04:43.770> available<00:04:44.340> whatever<00:04:45.170> but<00:04:46.170> you'll<00:04:46.620> see

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
not available whatever but you'll see

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.590 
not available whatever but you'll see
there<00:04:47.010> you<00:04:47.130> have<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.850> get<00:04:48.030> weather<00:04:48.300> right

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
there you have it you get weather right

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.850 
there you have it you get weather right
there<00:04:48.780> I'm<00:04:48.870> sure<00:04:49.080> you<00:04:49.230> should<00:04:49.500> be<00:04:49.530> able<00:04:49.710> to

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
there I'm sure you should be able to

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.800 
there I'm sure you should be able to
edit<00:04:50.010> it<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.880> lock<00:04:51.060> screens<00:04:51.390> are<00:04:51.510> saying<00:04:51.720> we

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
edit it the lock screens are saying we

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.960 
edit it the lock screens are saying we
do<00:04:51.900> have<00:04:52.050> face<00:04:52.260> unlock<00:04:52.590> as<00:04:52.830> well<00:04:53.010> press

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
do have face unlock as well press

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.090 
do have face unlock as well press
anywhere<00:04:54.420> brings<00:04:54.750> this<00:04:54.900> up<00:04:54.960> I<00:04:55.410> don't<00:04:55.860> remember

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
anywhere brings this up I don't remember

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.190 
anywhere brings this up I don't remember
those<00:04:56.460> three<00:04:56.730> arrows<00:04:57.120> being<00:04:57.420> there<00:04:57.630> before<00:04:57.990> so

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
those three arrows being there before so

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.290 
those three arrows being there before so
that's<00:04:58.380> kind<00:04:58.590> of<00:04:58.650> seems<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.700> be<00:04:59.790> different<00:05:00.180> i

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
that's kind of seems to be different i

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.820 
that's kind of seems to be different i
believe<00:05:00.750> so<00:05:00.780> that's<00:05:01.290> kind<00:05:01.590> of<00:05:01.620> different

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
believe so that's kind of different

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.220 
believe so that's kind of different
there<00:05:02.130> you<00:05:02.160> just<00:05:02.370> go<00:05:02.520> outside<00:05:02.670> unlock<00:05:03.210> it<00:05:03.420> but

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
there you just go outside unlock it but

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.780 
there you just go outside unlock it but
yeah<00:05:04.380> you<00:05:04.440> can<00:05:04.560> have<00:05:04.710> whether<00:05:05.100> I<00:05:05.400> believe<00:05:05.490> that

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
yeah you can have whether I believe that

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.180
