pretty dry so the way you do that is you

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.589 
pretty dry so the way you do that is you
just<00:02:06.980> kind<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.280> keep<00:02:07.490> taking<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.119> water<00:02:08.330> off

a<00:04:10.640> little<00:04:10.850> bit<00:04:11.000> on<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.420> bowl<00:04:12.340> you<00:04:13.340> can<00:04:13.520> see<00:04:13.730> how

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
a little bit on the bowl you can see how

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.820 
a little bit on the bowl you can see how
very<00:04:14.180> little<00:04:14.390> this<00:04:14.690> takes<00:04:16.150> and<00:04:17.290> of<00:04:18.290> course<00:04:18.530> I'd

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
very little this takes and of course I'd

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.979 
very little this takes and of course I'd
probably<00:04:19.160> put<00:04:19.730> my<00:04:19.910> head<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.239> little<00:04:20.450> bit<00:04:20.570> closer

here there we go and now she has some
some<00:05:29.750> skin<00:05:30.080> tones<00:05:30.319> course<00:05:30.590> those<00:05:30.770> can<00:05:30.979> be<00:05:31.009> made

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
some skin tones course those can be made

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.040 
some skin tones course those can be made
darker<00:05:31.759> or<00:05:31.849> lighter<00:05:31.879> depending<00:05:32.210> on<00:05:32.779> the<00:05:32.870> type

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
darker or lighter depending on the type
