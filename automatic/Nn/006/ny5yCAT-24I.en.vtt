00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.509
 Hello everyone and joy with you 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:11.130
 hi guys and this is the third part 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.389
 our cost about computer map we 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.590
 go to our computer and 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.820
 continue to write a program sota 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.070
 think earthly program which 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.820
 we call it gtr2 so I called it 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.029
 cut to so here today we will analyze 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.550
 function is a very useful thing and all 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.540
 understand why functions are also called under 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.520
 programs, that is, the function is such a unit 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.989
 code that runs when my 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.890
 the function call performs that is 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.660
 declares well yes so for example 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.600
 there fankshn we write the keyword 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.350
 then the name of the functions such as Well 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.350
 let me mark it 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.440
 opening and closing brackets afterwards 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.390
 that is, between the function level and the code 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.810
 will be executed and not 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.650
 and don't forget the brackets to brace 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.689
 round brackets 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:22.950
 By the way of this bracket 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.009
 write arguments on until you and we here 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.850
 let's say this function well I don't know need 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:34.079
 something interesting to example let 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:39.329
 it displays 10 here after we 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:41.189
 call this function she on exit on 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.610
 display a conscience that is, it does not 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.460
 interesting feature said but this is already 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.680
 started if we leave our program 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.299
 just such that nothing will happen then 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.290
 there is nothing going to happen because we 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:02:00.360
 only it refunds but we didn’t call it that way 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.740
 here let us have it yourself so that 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.780
 call the functions we just need 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.039
 write the name of the function opens 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.970
 the garage at the bracket and we are all in the fuke room 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.520
 execute this code which is located 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.360
 functions and the most important thing is that functions 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.360
 need to declare 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.230
 before we call a function that is 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.720
 family writing a function call up 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.470
 ads then nothing with job such 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.470
 let's check it out 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.220
 r2 here that is, everything is wrong 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.260
 roll 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.180
 this is not an interesting feature anymore 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.489
 interesting function can be done using 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.349
 arguments arguments are variables 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.319
 which functions are passed that is 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.530
 I 'll explain now 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:52.790
 let's say we betray the function argument 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.560
 page all the arguments we will have 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.959
 let's get listed more garlic we 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.940
 decorate on can change be called as 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:08.370
 wish i just was understandable so here we are 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:11.159
 we transfer function of value and it means 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.440
 Now I'm so happy that the dream is not and 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.060
 often explain not just say it is clear 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:23.459
 and from printing these values ​​enter through 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:25.769
 punched you look what it know 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.569
 when we call the function we can 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:32.430
 pass an argument to it for example that is 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.459
 The first is to set it up, as it were. 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.739
 no data types that is not important 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.099
 stand for 1 line or number 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:45.180
 but let's be honest and lead 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:48.110
 build as glazunov let's say 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.110
 fellow 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.650
 next argument separated by commas 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.650
 let's say 10 but that's just what i'm 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.739
 has gone 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:06.819
 so here let us and anal turned 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:11.560
 hawala 10 i mean i handed straka hellow 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:17.079
 and the number 10 and she brought me too since 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.880
 I asked it you will be now 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.959
 very confusing thing at least 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.050
 it confused me 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:28.690
 before I ran into this script languages and 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:32.889
 i.e. second function declaration method 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.550
 for example, I never used it 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:38.139
 first honest i think i'm all right 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:50.970
 you can all so fan is the name 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:54.550
 functions equals brackets and and 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.949
 here we are our function let's check 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.610
 come here in the kitchen 10 she just 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.770
 by the way 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.360
 function arguments can sit let's 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.360
 consider it we can write 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.360
 argument 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:16.810
 that is, it is our variable that is our 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:18.479
 the function has the name of fan dokorma this 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.400
 we call the function as usual 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.199
 fan clubs brackets let's all it 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:30.220
 check this i'm not sure what it is 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:33.340
 earn yes did not earn without 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:42.970
 arguments she earned prostate 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:57.550
 thanks him i just by the way let's go on 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:06:00.040
 any case we'll see line 10 to 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:11.080
 the movie was gone I just forgot without 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:15.270
 and the spring principle argument is all 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:18.400
 functions this is a very simple thing so here 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.340
 I think this is all ours did 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.780
 ends with guitar tops or we 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.410
 finally we will sort something very 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.200
 interesting 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.300
 we will write our calculator the easiest 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:32.620
 calculator which will just be 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.090
 add two meanings which we conduct 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.200
 from the keyboard, by the way about entering with 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:40.410
 keyboard say too why so with 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.620
 you were happy 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.620
 bye everyone
