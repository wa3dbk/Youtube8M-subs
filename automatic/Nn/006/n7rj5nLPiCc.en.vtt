lightly
just<00:01:18.270> about<00:01:18.540> as<00:01:18.750> good<00:01:18.930> as<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.140> gets<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.680> terms

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
just about as good as it gets in terms

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
you can even actually just put it in D

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.940 
you can even actually just put it in D
and<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.570> drive<00:01:42.810> along<00:01:42.929> like<00:01:43.229> an<00:01:43.380> automatic

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and just drive along like an automatic

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
which case it just slurs along and it

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.740 
which case it just slurs along and it
really<00:01:47.429> does<00:01:47.609> for<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> normal<00:01:48.090> Auto<00:01:48.390> when

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
changes and I love it I really do they

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.029 
changes and I love it I really do they
also<00:01:59.250> change<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.759> steering<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.420> car

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
also change the steering on this car

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.160 
also change the steering on this car
they've<00:02:02.039> made<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.369> rack<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> bit<00:02:02.909> quicker<00:02:03.209> not

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
they've made the rack a bit quicker not

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.839 
they've made the rack a bit quicker not
to<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> point<00:02:04.679> where<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.979> feels<00:02:05.189> neurotic

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
to the point where it feels neurotic

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.479 
to the point where it feels neurotic
that<00:02:06.360> would<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.599> a<00:02:06.630> mistake<00:02:06.810> but<00:02:07.489> it

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
that would be a mistake but it

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.059 
that would be a mistake but it
definitely<00:02:08.729> feels<00:02:09.209> more<00:02:09.329> alert<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.590> turning

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
definitely feels more alert the turning

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.539 
definitely feels more alert the turning
is<00:02:11.220> sharper<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:13.769> steering<00:02:14.190> overall

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
is sharper just the steering overall

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.729 
is sharper just the steering overall
feels<00:02:14.849> better<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.900> always<00:02:16.049> did<00:02:16.349> have<00:02:16.500> very

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
feels better it always did have very

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.009 
feels better it always did have very
nice<00:02:16.950> for<00:02:17.190> you

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.860 

the<00:02:22.680> brakes<00:02:23.010> are<00:02:23.250> better<00:02:23.430> -<00:02:23.760> they're<00:02:24.720> not

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
the brakes are better - they're not

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.750 
the brakes are better - they're not
carbon<00:02:25.290> ceramic<00:02:25.470> they're<00:02:25.920> still<00:02:26.129> steel

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
carbon ceramic they're still steel

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.150 
carbon ceramic they're still steel
but<00:02:28.330> there's<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.540> bit<00:02:28.689> of<00:02:28.720> aluminium<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.409> there

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
but there's a bit of aluminium in there

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.950 
but there's a bit of aluminium in there
in<00:02:31.220> there<00:02:31.730> as<00:02:31.880> well<00:02:32.090> just<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.480> make<00:02:32.510> them<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.810> bit

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
in there as well just to make them a bit

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.540 
in there as well just to make them a bit
lighter<00:02:33.200> but<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.590> disks<00:02:34.040> are<00:02:34.130> much<00:02:34.280> bigger

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
lighter but the disks are much bigger

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:43.360 
lighter but the disks are much bigger
and<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.820> really<00:02:35.120> stops<00:02:35.540> properly<00:02:42.190> this<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.340> a

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
and it really stops properly this is a
