00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.240
 let's look 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.350
 now we turn left and 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.580
 then we look at the right one 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.670
 come out side 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.130
 of these proposals traffic signs 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.130
 we see that street like in a hofer 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.970
 we are we want then right 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.110
 turn 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.720
 we are still in one 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.060
 forestry road but we do have a 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.680
 shoulder view make us pedestrian 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.380
 can recognize should have priority 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.980
 we do not want intersections again right 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:40.380
 turn again, they are in a phase 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:43.080
 Nevertheless , shoulder vision parried too 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.540
 important and now we come to the first 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.760
 right before left crossing here no 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.790
 contracts the traffic sign stands 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.140
 this car right of way does not allow 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.750
 the impression that this is right of us 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.830
 here would be nothing of a 30s 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.410
 Zone 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.330
 high right these will be police 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.270
 small street right at the ginsheim 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.010
 parking 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.220
 Anyone who comes to us for a practical experience is everyone 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.100
 case important and this crossing here 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.360
 looks like this 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.810
 we want to turn left here and 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.970
 that's why we have to do it from the right too 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.820
 Allow the right of way and 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.210
 The opposite of course has on the spot 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.300
 was like left turn are finished the 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:31.370
 priority is given to oncoming traffic 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:35.180
 if now two ex girlfriends once 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.180
 vorrang have oncoming traffic 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.800
 next right from left vérité 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.180
 right before left crossing 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.500
 fifth right before left crossing 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.699
 here we have the sixth right 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.699
 Left 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:30.860
 now the result would be six 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:35.349
 right before left crossings and once 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.349
 the oncoming traffic had priority
