00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
pellet head but the truth is that you

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
very clever engineer who I will keep

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.400 
very clever engineer who I will keep
anonymous<00:04:11.980> for<00:04:12.550> the<00:04:12.640> time<00:04:12.820> being<00:04:13.090> I<00:04:13.300> have<00:04:14.200> this

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
anonymous for the time being I have this

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.199 
anonymous for the time being I have this
device<00:04:14.860> and<00:04:15.280> it's<00:04:15.610> something<00:04:15.760> I'm<00:04:15.940> going<00:04:16.120> to

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
device and it's something I'm going to

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.259 
device and it's something I'm going to
use<00:04:16.450> in<00:04:16.750> upcoming<00:04:17.380> episodes<00:04:18.000> this<00:04:19.000> is<00:04:19.180> a

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
use in upcoming episodes this is a

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.930 
use in upcoming episodes this is a
pellet<00:04:19.660> sizer<00:04:20.010> so<00:04:21.010> what<00:04:21.130> we<00:04:21.250> essentially<00:04:21.640> have

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
pellet sizer so what we essentially have

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.990 
pellet sizer so what we essentially have
here<00:04:22.210> is<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:22.870> very<00:04:23.230> sensitive<00:04:23.800> digital<00:04:24.580> caliper

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
here is a very sensitive digital caliper

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.780 
here is a very sensitive digital caliper

we<00:04:33.370> have<00:04:33.570> some<00:04:34.570> very<00:04:34.810> very<00:04:35.260> clever

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
we have some very very clever

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.830 
we have some very very clever
engineering<00:04:36.310> here<00:04:36.540> specifically<00:04:37.540> how<00:04:37.660> this

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
engineering here specifically how this

works is with the aid of a couple

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.320 
works is with the aid of a couple
adjustment<00:04:41.620> screws<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:42.100> can<00:04:42.730> place<00:04:42.910> a<00:04:42.940> pellet

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
adjustment screws I can place a pellet

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.290 
adjustment screws I can place a pellet
in<00:04:43.360> there<00:04:43.600> and<00:04:43.870> get<00:04:44.440> an<00:04:44.590> exact<00:04:44.980> readout<00:04:45.430> on<00:04:45.700> the

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
in there and get an exact readout on the

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.420 
in there and get an exact readout on the
diameter<00:04:46.570> of<00:04:46.750> that<00:04:46.840> pellet<00:04:47.290> so<00:04:47.770> in<00:04:47.980> the<00:04:48.100> future

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
diameter of that pellet so in the future

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.960

tin I'm going to do this very

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.540 
tin I'm going to do this very
scientifically<00:05:09.970> to<00:05:10.630> make<00:05:10.780> sure<00:05:10.960> that<00:05:11.110> I<00:05:11.350> don't

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
scientifically to make sure that I don't

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.120 
scientifically to make sure that I don't
create<00:05:12.550> any<00:05:12.730> bias<00:05:12.970> when<00:05:13.900> I'm<00:05:14.020> shooting<00:05:14.260> so

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
create any bias when I'm shooting so

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.040 
create any bias when I'm shooting so
this<00:05:15.550> is<00:05:15.670> going<00:05:15.790> to<00:05:15.850> take<00:05:16.090> a<00:05:16.120> while<00:05:16.390> I<00:05:16.660> ask<00:05:16.930> to

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
this is going to take a while I ask to

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.650 
this is going to take a while I ask to
be<00:05:17.110> patient<00:05:17.620> with<00:05:17.740> me<00:05:17.890> I<00:05:18.130> want<00:05:18.700> to<00:05:18.790> do<00:05:18.880> this<00:05:19.060> by
