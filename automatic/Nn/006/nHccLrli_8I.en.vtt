unfortunately<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> key<00:00:41.790> my<00:00:41.940> idea<00:00:42.840> too<00:00:43.020> late<00:00:43.260> it

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
unfortunately a key my idea too late it

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.760 
unfortunately a key my idea too late it
actually<00:00:43.710> came<00:00:44.010> today<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.289> then<00:00:46.289> he<00:00:46.559> died

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
actually came today and then he died

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.369 
actually came today and then he died
yesterday<00:00:47.390> even<00:00:48.390> if<00:00:48.480> i<00:00:48.570> had<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.899> treated<00:00:49.260> them

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
yesterday even if i had it treated them

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.380 
yesterday even if i had it treated them
I<00:00:49.559> don't<00:00:49.829> think<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.100> would<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.250> made<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.700> and

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.819 

so<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.480> believe<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:54.960> because<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.559> piece

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
so I believe it's because of this piece

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.979 
so I believe it's because of this piece
of<00:00:55.980> wood<00:00:56.010> which<00:00:56.610> i<00:00:56.760> got<00:00:56.940> from<00:00:56.969> outside<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.750> did

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
of wood which i got from outside I did

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.779 
of wood which i got from outside I did
boil<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.949> think<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.460> brought

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
boil it but I think it's brought

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.219 
boil it but I think it's brought
something<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:02.090> so<00:01:03.090> yeah<00:01:03.329> I'm<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
something in and so yeah I'm going to

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.200 
something in and so yeah I'm going to
learn<00:01:04.350> from<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.710> experience<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.790> next<00:01:06.090> time

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
learn from this experience and next time

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.850 
learn from this experience and next time
I'm<00:01:06.630> going<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:07.580> boil<00:01:08.580> boil<00:01:09.150> them<00:01:09.860> foreign

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
he loves enum just swimming around first

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.950 
he loves enum just swimming around first
of<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.610> had<00:01:32.850> them<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.090> tank<00:01:33.360> down<00:01:33.630> there

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
of all I had them in the tank down there

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.980 
of all I had them in the tank down there
underneath<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.770> 15<00:01:35.250> gallon<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.840> had

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
underneath the 15 gallon and then I had

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.520 
underneath the 15 gallon and then I had
them<00:01:37.170> out<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.740> back<00:01:38.119> downstairs<00:01:39.229> and<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.380> had

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
them out the back downstairs and I had

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.230 
them out the back downstairs and I had
them<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> living<00:01:41.130> room<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.909> was<00:01:42.119> his

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
them in the living room and this was his

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.109 
them in the living room and this was his
final<00:01:42.479> tank<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> don't<00:01:44.729> think<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.909> was<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
final tank so I don't think it was the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.569 
final tank so I don't think it was the
stress<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.600> movement<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.340> think<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.430> was<00:01:47.520> just

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
stress of movement I think it was just

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.830 
stress of movement I think it was just
something<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.479> came<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:50.450> into<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> tank

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
something that came in and into the tank

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.310 
something that came in and into the tank
something<00:01:52.770> on<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.040> piece<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.399> wood<00:01:54.079> in<00:01:55.079> my

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
something on this piece of wood in my

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.499 
something on this piece of wood in my
ear<00:01:55.500> quarters<00:01:56.130> steel<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.090> piece<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.360> wood

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
ear quarters steel on this piece of wood

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.490 
ear quarters steel on this piece of wood
maybe<00:01:57.990> something's<00:01:58.530> got<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.420> but<00:02:00.439> yet<00:02:01.439> a

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
maybe something's got in there but yet a

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.480 
maybe something's got in there but yet a
real<00:02:01.860> shame<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.310> see<00:02:02.460> him<00:02:02.640> go<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:04.490> especially

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490
