 giulio forte director of the monthly photo of the piero vacanze offers some advice 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.220
 for photographers who will participate in the Italian post office competition 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.800
 a good panorama photo does not require a good light 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.800
 because the light is the secret of photography and therefore seek the position 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.119
 better against 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.009
 of the scenario is important so avoid backlighting for example 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.490
 found the way of footer to observe the landscape you see doing through the 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.320
 camera viewfinder 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.030
 because in this way you will find the right framing more easily 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.760
 important that the 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.190
 Panorama photographs like all things especially in this case must 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.920
 be very sharp so you have to be very careful 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.870
 to use a very short shutter speed 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.080
 if possible use a tripod 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.580
 goodies 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.650
 a support in case you didn't have a wall tree, whatever 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.380
 one of the most interesting secrets - follow or maybe because they are not 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.370
 known and to photograph the panoramas 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.260
 after a thunderstorm after a storm what happens the cleanest air because it is 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.920
 been washed by water 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.130
 the second sometimes the clouds open they pass the rays of the sun that 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.210
 illuminates an extraordinary man 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.940
 the scenario 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.280
 trees plains also case palaces as if you were a city 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.180
 to make photographic winnings 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.750
 things the rules are almost the same as what matters light always counts 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.260
 instead in a particular way the knowledge of the city if our city were 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.970
 a soul city to visit as tourists our city we know it e 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.700
 therefore we will be able to show Latin with the less known foreshortenings in the case 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.550
 of the city we are going to visit we should try to avoid the shots 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.320
 that everyone does
