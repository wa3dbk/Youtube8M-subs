00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
it or anything like that

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.180 
it or anything like that
close-up<00:00:45.210> text<00:00:46.050> might<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> little<00:00:47.010> blurred

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
close-up text might be a little blurred

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.069 
close-up text might be a little blurred
you<00:00:47.579> might<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:47.969> some<00:00:48.149> pixels<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.840> but

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
you might see some pixels in it but

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.500 
you might see some pixels in it but
other<00:00:49.620> than<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.250> think<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.910> display<00:00:51.329> is

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
other than that I think the display is

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.299 
other than that I think the display is
really<00:00:51.660> nice<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.070> let's<00:00:53.190> go

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
really nice and with that so let's go

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.290 
really nice and with that so let's go
ahead<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.550> take<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> look<00:00:53.789> around<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.090> phone

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300
