00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.350
 and just there is nothing written there are people 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.910
 that he would like to harvest another 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.620
 who would like to enlarge the piece is 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.950
 because it feels more like one way or 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.110
 another here the question was simple this 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.300
 person who arrives feels uncomfortable and 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.340
 narrow and wants to enlarge wants to join 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.950
 these two pieces then we have to 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.869
 see who we can vote 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.779
 this wall there are walls that are 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.849
 structural and there are walls that are like 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.399
 of euphoric ornaments to make simple 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.230
 divisions I asked that normal as we 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.120
 we realize your first realization 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.359
 the planes now if we do not have the 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.230
 plans we have to investigate because it 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:47.570
 it's about the universe and it has chains 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.329
 chain ends up the chains no 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.699
 I know how many are part of the structure 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.699
 well here we can clearly see that 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.339
 this tambourine brick wall that is 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.049
 the series with thus stopped has not cost and 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.879
 that has a good stucco coating for the 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:03.620
 two sides we can perfectly vote 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.260
 this world so now it's going to define 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.480
 as centaurs 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.580
 I'm marking what you're going to do 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.560
 final the space that we are going to leave for 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.050
 move here in one piece another one more 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.610
 distance of 13 centimeters here and one 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.920
 macheta of 40 because who what happens 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.560
 when all the charges tremble , 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.400
 they begin to distribute by the walls and by 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.010
 ceiling 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.740
 in this case the roof is concrete if 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.620
 we take out this piece those same 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.990
 charges are going to go bounce in other 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.020
 parts that obviously are not designed 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.650
 for that carried out at level and we see that 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.650
 it's perfect 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.120
 so now with this brand we step on and 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.120
 we have the vertical line on this side 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.810
 we repeat another side and start 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:01.710
 return the beam is 10 centimeters and 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.310
 work 13 because because here that speaks 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.979
 the 3 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.570
 centimeters we are going to fill with 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.569
 concrete so you have a good 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.760
 culture with the roof we leave this 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.489
 space from here 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.090
 that for the vega to settle in the 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.610
 Mocheta with the cookie we are going to mark 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.040
 here when we are under the walls I do not know 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.400
 give us this part of a foot 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.400
 straight 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.700
 let's now break that wall piece 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.099
 up there to put the beam that 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.650
 will sign the structure if we 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.420
 we vote the entire wall now we leave the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.950
 structure exposed to anything 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.810
 because it is very weak and you can 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.810
 we have some problem in between 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.720
 when I tell you I have you there in the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.730
 hammer glove is produced I do not know 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.409
 protection for face 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.440
 let's play it as evenly as possible 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:01.440
 thing that the villa between justito 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.440
 Y 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.090
 projected in life then that 's the 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:12.050
 position that the villa will have that 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.270
 now it is artisan to call lintels here 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.459
 up we're going to release a few pieces of 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.500
 iron to all the long then that's going to 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.160
 make the cement grip well and it 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.990
 incorporate the lintel well with the mixture and 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.890
 with the roof 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.890
 although here 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.890
 Hello 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:43.300
 after this we are going to have a super 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.910
 good let's use a vega mortar 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:50.180
 which is specially prepared for 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.100
 all kinds of masonry but we're 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.960
 getting into cement there 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.940
 it is important that on the other hand 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.590
 there is also someone to help push 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.590
 to one 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.240
 as always we have questions that 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.250
 answer our friend guillermo of 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.750
 use it tells us that a long time ago 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.920
 the event the patio of the house and the 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.959
 entry the car and now you are 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.000
 enlarging the cement has stone in the 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.320
 program orchards clearly part the 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.840
 problem is that the mixture of the bad 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.430
 has two possible one accepted two new 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.040
 the other possibility that is the cheapest 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.380
 with a water mesh and on top five 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.250
 centimeters of good concrete is the best 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.690
 solution two people ask us 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.240
 very similar things 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.160
 donald 2 rocha and do침a m칩nica arias us 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.320
 they ask how to cover the cracks in 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.840
 pieces of wood that later they want 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.670
 paralyze and have told nicol치s here 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.100
 you have to use the old trick of the serious 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.260
 Virgin is what wax works best 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.560
 virgin softens a little with heat 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.320
 cover either the slot or the slit that 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.750
 you want to disguise and then when 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.940
 is that it lasted the sanding and the same dust 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.340
 that is taking the wood goes dyeing 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.020
 the wax and at the end you can varnish 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.390
 is what they want second already silva 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.610
 navega wants to make a brick inn 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:14.330
 that divides the kitchen from the dining room and the 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.000
 teacher recommended beach sand 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.689
 the segment also sand beaches and 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.030
 smart beach never because the salt goes 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:24.740
 to run the cement and that at the end you 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.599
 take off and it will not serve what you 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.969
 did the teacher mean that we have a 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.159
 fine sand and the best thing for that is the 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:31.849
 black sand on the shore of 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:33.949
 some rivers 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.350
 I usually think it's called sand 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.570
 levanto is the best solution 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.640
 At this time we have to wait for the 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.890
 cement because if we start to 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.960
 put like the hammer here with the 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.850
 vibration scares us from the cement and the 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.800
 thing is going to be super bad or be order 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.450
 to do it again and do not worry 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.070
 that the termination of this is going to be 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.960
 same as the one of the piece or we are going to 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.090
 give it a good ending with with 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.580
 paint with paste the wall that was given 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.410
 everything has been perfect so now 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.970
 we give a break to work and we 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.970
 We see you next week ch치vez
