00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:13.469
 so welcome to the review 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:16.550
 protect the helm and hands from bork masters in 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.279
 In general, someone has already ordered this 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:24.359
 someone is waiting someone ordered from negligent 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:28.590
 suppliers and waiting for three months which 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.439
 I already got my protection, so I want 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.239
 they tell a little bit so for bikers 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.129
 for motorcyclists interested in data 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.399
 products and there turing improvement 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.730
 their motorcycles is a kit for 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.739
 kawasaki versys 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:53.420
 2010 2012 so let's go 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:59.809
 open the package on that so all 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:01.739
 decently here here are these bones they 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.220
 xander motorcycle is written here 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:11.840
 kawasaki versys 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.840
 box I have nothing to postpone 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.159
 instructions let's see what's behind 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.450
 everything is clear what shows how 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.960
 collect pictures in English 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.960
 language can be sorted out 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:52.320
 Looks that there is a set of bolts on 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:02:06.460
 one side 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:12.790
 form the race side of the family with the public this 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:17.550
 two lines on the court bracket 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.550
 And certainly 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:32.550
 here it is and therefore the arc itself'm 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:37.380
 baby brides easy 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.780
 not heavyweight but specifically in general 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.170
 she is bent for kawasaki versys for 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.410
 steering kawasaki on version with like on 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.370
 many other universal motorcycles 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.840
 defenses become askew 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.390
 clumsy there it is necessary how do you redo it in 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.090
 in general here everything will be clear 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:03.800
 serve 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:08.130
 product quality is very good not great 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:11.780
 will take something not to find fault but not bad 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.780
 let's see how it will become 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.650
 here we have written yes barbus tires 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.870
 it says here you are specific 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.630
 specially written for the motorcycle then 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.470
 what else should you choose 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.350
 nladochki protection against wind and 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.600
 optionally, you can choose some here 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.870
 skid plate sliding so she rosettes and 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.690
 additional weight still seems to me 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:48.920
 that these cartoons are here 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:53.959
 go already should be clear enough 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:56.480
 so move on to lining packing 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.980
 side and the storm i chose side 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:06.810
 because they give the maximum 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:11.970
 wind protection that is relevant to me protection 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:19.430
 from all that flies here it is written 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:19.430
 that fincher put like reveal 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:51.020
 boxes 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:56.199
 some plastic stuff brackets 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.199
 mount. 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:10.009
 Here is the burdock principle, he 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.830
 looks like a big enough 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:15.169
 but on the motorcycle I applied the size 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.229
 its fairly proportional 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:22.659
 gave a normal look to the store 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.659
 gives full protection on let's try it out 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.970
 before the fit is perfect i want to say 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.300
 the fit is perfect everything is clear 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.229
 two planochki will recover here 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.229
 secured 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:54.450
 in the next video, see how we will 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.620
 install it all on versys hope 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:01.280
 I will have time I will shoot a good video 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.280
 give everyone thanks
