00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.600

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.600

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.000
Hi, I'm Samuel Sánchez. Since the Orca was launched in 2003, I've been racing on it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This bike has taken me to the podium and made me win stages in big races like the Vuelta a España or the Tour de France.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And it took me to the top of the Olympic Games podium in Beijing in 2008.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now I'd like to introduce to you the latest Orca, in a very special version: the Black Edition.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It's an inspiring model that Orbea made especially for me to compete in the toughest races in 2013.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The Orca is a bike for top-level sport racing, with an Orbea Monocoque Race frame and fork.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This is the highest carbon fiber quality from Orbea, which provides the best stiffness to weight ratio.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The monocoque frame offers a compact structure and superb performance over a long, long time.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Which is really important, as one of Orbea's main values is its lifetime warranty.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Pros of monocoque:

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
1- Preservation of properties over time.
2- Stiffness.
3- Freedom for design.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Orbea has come up with a frame that is 10% lighter and 8% stiffer.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It redesigned the new Orca using the Stack and Reach concept for perfect fit for all users.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
As a result, the Orca comes in seven sizes: 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57 and 60cm.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And it has two forks with different rakes. Small sizes -- 47, 49 and 51 -- have a 53mm rake, and big sizes -- 53, 55 and 57 --60 have a 43mm rake.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Orbea introduced this change for an utmost bike experience, no matter your size.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.000
In the fork, chainstays and seatstays, you'll find the names of the fans who supported me via the Million Name Bike site and stood by me throughout the season

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The new Orca has improved aerodynamic features and its fork has been redesigned. It has evolved to have a 1:3 fork, which makes a more aero bike.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
On the whole, it saves you 10 watts as compared to the old model.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The fork and the rear triangle of the new Orca are designed with improved shaping -- this is what the Attraction technology is about

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.500
It absorbs road vibration, increases traction and enhances your performance on the bike.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The Press Fit pedalier system of the new Orca delivers extra rigidity and lighter weight.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Compatible with most modern chainrings, it ensures optimal transfer of power to the pedals.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
All the cables in the new Orca run inside the frame. What's more, the cabling is compatible with electronic or mechanical systems.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Hope you like the new Orbea Orca Black Edition. See you on the road!
