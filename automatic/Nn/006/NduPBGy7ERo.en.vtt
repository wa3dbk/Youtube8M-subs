00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:15.719
 and here it is not a star 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.719
 easydisk 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.420
 and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.830
 hi all this is a country of lakes and here I am 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.990
 I will risk after all though this tool 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.320
 absolutely what is called not in my 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.780
 style and format before telecaster has 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.480
 very remote relation but here on 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.550
 in fact, I really want a little bit about 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.610
 amplifier means two channel amplifiers 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.860
 and the clean channel is made apparently 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.240
 fundamentally not at all adjustable 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.280
 that is, there is only one volume knob 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:15.100
 and further there is a boost and all-all-all 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.930
 timbre and there all sorts of vois and and 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.880
 other 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.010
 they only work they have written the crane 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.940
 xenon that is drive you channel and 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.580
 this volume knob is clean 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.890
 channel becomes handle gain like so 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.990
 did well and in another channel tap of course 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.470
 fully revealed that is, there is only 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.920
 grabs a fool there cod shine fishing line and 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.920
 other things 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.140
 but 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.540
 but 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.950
 Yes 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.550
 here 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.580
 but 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.580
 but 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.180
 but 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.180
 but 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.780
 but 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.730
 but 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.730
 but 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.030
 but 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.730
 but 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.730
 but 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.810
 at 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.349
 at 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.050
 but 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.209
 and 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.530
 can 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:52.599
 but
