00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.120 
sense my answer to that conundrum is
that<00:01:56.969> words<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.479> time<00:01:57.960> are<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.770> same<00:01:58.979> as

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that words like time are the same as

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.340 
that words like time are the same as
words<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.579> up<00:01:59.759> or<00:02:00.119> forward<00:02:00.600> they<00:02:01.140> represent

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
words like up or forward they represent

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.700 
words like up or forward they represent
directions<00:02:02.250> not<00:02:02.700> specific<00:02:03.420> dimensions<00:02:03.990> time

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
directions not specific dimensions time

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.709 
directions not specific dimensions time
is<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> way<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.310> describing<00:02:05.700> change<00:02:06.180> from<00:02:06.450> state

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
is a way of describing change from state

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.139 
is a way of describing change from state
to<00:02:06.869> state<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.320> those<00:02:07.890> changes<00:02:08.489> make<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:09.030> as

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
to state and those changes make just as

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.729 
to state and those changes make just as
much<00:02:09.179> sense<00:02:09.629> whether<00:02:09.989> they're<00:02:10.289> viewed<00:02:10.560> from

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
much sense whether they're viewed from

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.030 
much sense whether they're viewed from
the<00:02:10.920> direction<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.430> time

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
the direction of time

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.880 
the direction of time
or<00:02:12.099> anti<00:02:12.760> time<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.420> up<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:14.170> direction<00:02:14.560> in<00:02:14.799> the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
or anti time is up a direction in the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.490 
or anti time is up a direction in the
third<00:02:15.069> dimension<00:02:15.280> or<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.299> it<00:02:16.329> forward<00:02:16.870> either

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
third dimension or is it forward either

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.920 
third dimension or is it forward either
could<00:02:17.920> be<00:02:18.040> true<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.489> depends<00:02:19.150> upon<00:02:19.239> your<00:02:19.480> frame

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
could be true it depends upon your frame
