00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.490
 nintendo consoles the distribution of 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.139
 what's happening calendar 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.150
 in some stores in são paulo 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.970
 content transfer from read to listen 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:25.289
 plate 3 gigantic number of subscribers 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:27.029
 playstation plus a recent meeting 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.189
 of investors is the government making a 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.140
 question for the act I'm going to read this 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.520
 party will be able to say exactly what 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.050
 The text is written in 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.520
 accident consideration has been translated into 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.440
 of English and not the official text 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.989
 provided by nintendo 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.120
 the question was one moment hardware games 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.719
 of your company make use of the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.940
 region 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.739
 the method by which games bought in 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.420
 region can not be played in the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.300
 another there are plans to develop this 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.219
 restriction and the actor responds the market 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.050
 games has a history of taking a lot 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.090
 time with location among others 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.160
 things like having to deal with various 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.350
 marketing issues in each country. 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.329
 games that have content whose license does not 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.220
 applies globally every mother-in- 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.330
 circumstance then let's say that the lock 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.070
 region has existed for 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.510
 most circumstances because of the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.310
 seller than for the good of his 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.380
 consumers in the history of consoles 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.610
 this is the current situation about what 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.350
 be done from now on 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.659
 they blocked benefits to 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.759
 consumers may also be for us. 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.680
 on the other hand unlocked there several 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.119
 problems that jesus solved then 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.340
 I still can not say today if 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.320
 We do not intend to unlock admit 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.610
 which is something we will need to consider 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.100
 while looking to the future 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.689
 xix was an imitation of Chinese huawei 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.210
 basically they said it was 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.680
 the following the question was oab this lock 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.299
 region that is generally 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.369
 play the game already to leave and he 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.890

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.470
 to carry out a gesture of water and after 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.970

 take a copy of Pokémon x or y to 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.130
 to get the pokémon has the most 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.750
 Instead, the address of the stores is 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.120
 video description who spent tens 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.430

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.110
 generous and cleide 1 and 2 may be 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.750
 happy because they will all be 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.580

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.290

 playstation plus to play 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.690
 because it was not so in the 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.100
 Playstation 3 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.110
 this has meant that the current number of 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.739
 playstation plus subscribers 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.900
 from 7.9 million users in the 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.970
 world and I still do not know how many of the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.730
 people own only playstation 4 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.010

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.049
 I already learned on Sunday morning. 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.060
 probably will not get that mills 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.910
 because I owe it to a friend's house then 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.290
 may have to program there but on the second 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.600
