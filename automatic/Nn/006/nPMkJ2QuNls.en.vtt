00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:13.729
 on a naval ship, we went to our meeting 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:16.999
 undisclosed location on the coast of rio de janeiro 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:20.239
 It is dawn even though debt problems 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.050
 one of the five currently in operation 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.499
 nor the surface 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.179
 I had the best of the Tupi class. 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.460
 built in brazil 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.119
 in 1996 from a German project 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.220
 by far it seems it is small 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.970
 but it is 61 meters long and weighs over one thousand and one hundred tons 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.410
 It's still dark because we left death for who will stay in the team 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.120
 boarding is a complicated task. 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.340
 we win by the hatch and we are received by the commander 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.239
 the captain was soon to commence service and that life aboard a 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.239
 machines like those that require sacrifices 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:05.990
 creeped out 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.230
 about half 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.480
 in accommodation 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.340
 the older ones have to sign up in the bunk beds another small church dove but 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.260
 It's comfortable the amnesty can get close. 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.950
 a lady who did not commit 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.190
 our physical space here 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.290
 these plans 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.300
 and that counts a lot 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.900
 it is even good that bearers of a victory not to fall in blows against 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.390
 he 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.420
 no one has been injured reformed attack and has more 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.790
 he criticized the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.790
 no protection 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.850
 no, it's not fear 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.850
 maybe as never was in km 38 of the anchieta 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.280
 work without life 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.280
 well thirteen dwarves dp durbidge 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.940
 in barcarena viana 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.150
 in the back and this morning that already has eight years that 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.590
 I did not mark the biological testament 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.330
 the kitchen barely behaved people who has the task of feeding the 42 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.449
 crew 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.679
 I did not imagine what it's like to grow up 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:12.769
 muscle 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.179
 with all this people we have two goalkeepers 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.179
 among Brazilians began to be charged officers 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.739
 last week work 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.979
 the state 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:25.539
 the shapes 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.169
 the rest of the world 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:28.809
 was enough 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:30.009
 in this area 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.429
 however it propagated per cent 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.479
 she must pass the space after the operation 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.359
 but nobody here will have comfort this is a war machine before the 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:42.989
 submarine impresses 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.829
 the models currently in use in Brazil have diesel-electric propulsion this 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.499
 means that a group of diesel engines assume no generator and recharge 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:56.349
 the batteries of the ship 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.609
 are they that provide energy for the operation of the submarine 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:05.249
 this model can reach 40 kilometers per hour 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:10.199
 and up to 250 meters deep the silent course 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.839
 very difficult I think this is impossible to be treated 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.229
 and when we have to charge without batteries that are large capacity 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.459
 we moved away from that sales force back then it turns into a driver 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.579
 combustion 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.599
 and recharge your batteries it goes back next searches short 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.729
 telescope 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.729
 a placement 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.609
 the desired water 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.609
 and start over to see the photos after the cia ltda 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:49.999
 next week, the lisbon trade 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.859
 admit the ball 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.449
 burning photos 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.619
 to recharge batteries 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:04:00.169
 the communication systems of arms 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.080
 According to the commander 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.710
 compatible with the main naval forces of the planet 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.779
 by the way 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.929
 when we think of the submarine 

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:12.399
 the first thing that comes to mind are singles right 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:17.289
 on the day of the inauguration of 16 of them of eight throwing tournaments 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.409
 the submarine 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:19.559
 conventional 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:21.139
 he lives 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.139
 the consultant created 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:27.840
 protests 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.430
 no roll 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.460
 two projectiles 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.939
 yes they have it 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:36.889
 the owner's authorization 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:37.909
 defeated 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.639
 where today is the target was the target 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.460
 I'm against karol wojtyla on paper. 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.249
 on top of it is the very ignorance of demand 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:50.110
 and because we also have minors 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.110
 the agency adding up the similar capacity 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.039
 is an area the access 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.039
 a door 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:04.069
 are modern equipment 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.939
 this afternoon 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:11.159
 to be really effective it is not enough to carry guns the submarine has to be 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:12.789
 able to locate 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.880
 Surprise the enemy 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.260
 another detail is that the navigation on the submarine is made by means of 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.740
 Nautical charts there is no view of the external environment 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:28.279
 only exception is the true telescope after this type of ship 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:33.179
 although the periscope still has its usefulness today which makes the 

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:35.819
 The same difference is in electronics 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:38.629
 no sonares aia psd 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:40.790
 and all types of sensors 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.070
 allow the journal to know exactly the location of the 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.580
 vessel and the enemy 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.380
 only other services 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.380
 This is the great advantage is that you 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.879
 a sales force 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:00.309
 you 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.259
 the unknown enemy fears that we have a new area that can 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:07.610
 was going to be attacked 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.939
 so somalia 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:11.770
 sometimes a summary 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:12.949
 more fragile 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.039
 how much colder 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.930
 this Tuesday in its website
