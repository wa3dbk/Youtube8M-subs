00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
at this video and get some ideas for

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.800 
at this video and get some ideas for
some<00:02:33.590> some<00:02:33.920> future<00:02:34.400> mashup<00:02:34.760> XO<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.600> could<00:02:35.780> be

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
some some future mashup XO that could be

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.580 
some some future mashup XO that could be
a<00:02:35.900> possibility<00:02:36.080> but<00:02:36.910> my<00:02:37.910> top<00:02:38.270> five<00:02:38.540> just<00:02:39.440> get

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
a possibility but my top five just get

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.070 
a possibility but my top five just get
this<00:02:39.710> out<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.040> way<00:02:40.570> obviously<00:02:41.570> number<00:02:41.900> one

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
this out the way obviously number one

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.960 
this out the way obviously number one
would<00:02:42.290> be<00:02:42.320> Skyrim<00:02:42.830> cuz<00:02:43.040> everybody<00:02:43.520> wants<00:02:43.760> sky

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
would be Skyrim cuz everybody wants sky

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.730 
would be Skyrim cuz everybody wants sky
room<00:02:44.240> and<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.690> think<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:44.990> really<00:02:45.020> amazing<00:02:45.620> what

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
room and I think it really amazing what

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.440 
room and I think it really amazing what
they<00:02:45.830> did<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.250> even<00:02:46.760> they<00:02:47.030> said<00:02:47.270> they<00:02:47.360> would

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
they did and even they said they would

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.780 
they did and even they said they would
possibly<00:02:48.020> do<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.560> number<00:02:49.190> two<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.400> think<00:02:49.700> would

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
possibly do it number two I think would

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.430 
possibly do it number two I think would
be<00:02:49.910> borderland<00:02:50.450> because<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:50.960> think<00:02:51.140> mortal

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
be borderland because I think mortal

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.630 
be borderland because I think mortal
hands<00:02:51.560> would<00:02:51.680> be<00:02:51.800> really<00:02:52.130> interesting

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
hands would be really interesting

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.190 
hands would be really interesting
especially<00:02:52.880> with<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.210> whole<00:02:53.330> cartoony<00:02:53.960> feel

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
especially with the whole cartoony feel

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.080 
especially with the whole cartoony feel
and<00:02:54.440> then<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:54.950> get<00:02:55.040> like<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.400> soundtrack<00:02:55.910> and

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
and then you get like the soundtrack and

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.730 
and then you get like the soundtrack and
stuff<00:02:56.210> I<00:02:56.300> think<00:02:56.330> it'd<00:02:56.540> be<00:02:56.570> pretty<00:02:56.720> cool<00:02:56.840> number

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
stuff I think it'd be pretty cool number

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.260 
stuff I think it'd be pretty cool number
three<00:02:58.130> I<00:02:58.160> would<00:02:58.460> actually<00:02:58.550> like<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.820> fallout

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
three I would actually like a fallout

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.430 
three I would actually like a fallout
sort<00:03:00.260> of<00:03:00.350> steamed<00:03:00.710> and<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.540> would<00:03:03.230> be

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
sort of steamed and that it would be

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.250 
sort of steamed and that it would be
like<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.490> like<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.700> post<00:03:05.300> nuclear<00:03:05.600> war<00:03:06.110> I

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
like it you like a post nuclear war I

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.060 
like it you like a post nuclear war I
think<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:06.590> would<00:03:06.680> look<00:03:06.710> really<00:03:06.830> cool

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
think that would look really cool

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.410 
think that would look really cool
especially<00:03:07.370> for<00:03:07.760> some<00:03:07.880> Machinima's<00:03:08.300> and

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
especially for some Machinima's and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.630 
especially for some Machinima's and
stuff<00:03:08.600> seen<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.380> number<00:03:09.680> four<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.130> five<00:03:10.400> this

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
stuff seen the number four and five this

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.160 
stuff seen the number four and five this
is<00:03:10.760> where<00:03:10.940> I<00:03:10.970> can't<00:03:11.360> really<00:03:11.540> decide<00:03:11.960> that's

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
is where I can't really decide that's

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.830 
is where I can't really decide that's
why<00:03:12.410> I<00:03:12.440> sort<00:03:12.860> of<00:03:12.890> need<00:03:13.040> your<00:03:13.220> guy's<00:03:13.370> help<00:03:13.400> so<00:03:14.180> or

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
why I sort of need your guy's help so or

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.260 
why I sort of need your guy's help so or
I<00:03:15.410> almost<00:03:16.040> want<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.310> say<00:03:16.370> Assassin's<00:03:17.000> Creed

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
I almost want to say Assassin's Creed

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.910 
I almost want to say Assassin's Creed
but<00:03:17.510> I'm<00:03:17.990> not<00:03:18.230> too<00:03:18.380> sure<00:03:18.590> how<00:03:18.740> that<00:03:18.860> would

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
but I'm not too sure how that would

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.230 
but I'm not too sure how that would
really<00:03:19.070> work<00:03:19.160> out<00:03:19.520> you<00:03:19.790> know<00:03:19.850> I<00:03:19.910> don't<00:03:20.120> really

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
really work out you know I don't really

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.670 
really work out you know I don't really
know<00:03:20.390> what<00:03:20.570> they<00:03:20.660> could<00:03:20.840> do<00:03:20.990> you<00:03:21.380> see<00:03:21.560> I'm

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
know what they could do you see I'm

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.200 
know what they could do you see I'm
trying<00:03:21.710> to<00:03:21.950> just<00:03:22.010> think<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.430> not<00:03:22.580> just<00:03:22.970> games

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
trying to just think of not just games

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.610 
trying to just think of not just games
that<00:03:23.360> are<00:03:23.450> cool<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:23.960> stuff<00:03:24.170> but<00:03:24.380> i'm<00:03:24.470> trying

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
that are cool and stuff but i'm trying

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.110 
that are cool and stuff but i'm trying
to<00:03:24.709> think<00:03:24.739> games<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.220> are<00:03:25.310> logical<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.030> that

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
to think games that are logical and that

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.150 
to think games that are logical and that
they<00:03:26.209> could<00:03:26.450> easily<00:03:26.930> do<00:03:27.410> something<00:03:27.770> obviously

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
they could easily do something obviously

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160 
they could easily do something obviously
Skyrim<00:03:28.670> they<00:03:28.820> can<00:03:28.970> make<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:29.780> know<00:03:29.900> the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
Skyrim they can make it you know the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.440 
Skyrim they can make it you know the
it's<00:03:31.130> sort<00:03:31.370> of<00:03:31.459> based<00:03:31.700> doing<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.090> same<00:03:32.239> thing

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
it's sort of based doing the same thing

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.850 
it's sort of based doing the same thing
weapons<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.110> stuff<00:03:33.260> they<00:03:33.560> just<00:03:33.739> make<00:03:33.830> a

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
weapons and stuff they just make a

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.530 
weapons and stuff they just make a
pictured<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.370> little<00:03:34.550> bit<00:03:34.640> different<00:03:34.880> but<00:03:35.360> I

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
pictured a little bit different but I

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.479 
pictured a little bit different but I
but<00:03:36.020> yeah<00:03:36.140> I<00:03:36.170> don't<00:03:36.500> really<00:03:36.680> know<00:03:36.890> before<00:03:37.280> five

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489

but like I said I'm a incorporate
everybody's<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.770> know<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:46.130> decision<00:03:46.670> their

everybody's you know the decision their

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.390 
everybody's you know the decision their
comments<00:03:47.900> into<00:03:48.080> one<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.650> make<00:03:48.950> a<00:03:48.980> top<00:03:49.220> five

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
comments into one and make a top five

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.830 
comments into one and make a top five
and<00:03:49.580> I'm<00:03:49.640> gonna<00:03:49.730> go<00:03:49.880> in<00:03:50.090> depth<00:03:50.510> I'm<00:03:50.660> gonna<00:03:50.780> do

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
and I'm gonna go in depth I'm gonna do

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.080 
and I'm gonna go in depth I'm gonna do
like<00:03:50.989> I<00:03:51.380> think<00:03:52.190> some<00:03:52.400> other<00:03:52.430> games<00:03:52.850> actually

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
like I think some other games actually

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.490 
like I think some other games actually
have<00:03:53.330> some<00:03:53.480> stuff<00:03:53.600> on<00:03:53.750> pc<00:03:54.170> i<00:03:54.200> think<00:03:54.410> they're

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
have some stuff on pc i think they're

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.990 
have some stuff on pc i think they're
called<00:03:54.530> resource<00:03:55.010> packs<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:55.430> i'll<00:03:55.700> look<00:03:55.850> into

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
called resource packs so i'll look into

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.120 
called resource packs so i'll look into
that<00:03:56.239> i<00:03:56.450> might<00:03:56.870> do<00:03:57.020> some<00:03:57.260> footage<00:03:57.770> from<00:03:57.920> there

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
that i might do some footage from there

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.620 
that i might do some footage from there
just<00:03:58.340> give<00:03:58.489> you<00:03:58.580> guys<00:03:58.730> an<00:03:58.880> example<00:03:59.000> of<00:03:59.390> what<00:03:59.510> it

obviously<00:04:01.070> some<00:04:01.640> examples<00:04:02.060> of<00:04:02.120> what<00:04:02.180> they

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
obviously some examples of what they

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.690 
obviously some examples of what they
could<00:04:02.570> build<00:04:02.810> up<00:04:03.050> that<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.440> future<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:04.459> world

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
could build up that the future the world

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.460 
could build up that the future the world
saves<00:04:05.060> and<00:04:05.270> stuff<00:04:05.420> like<00:04:05.480> that<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:05.810> it's<00:04:06.410> a

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
saves and stuff like that so it's a
