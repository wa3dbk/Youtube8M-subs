00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the concrete section and then the dust

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.630 
the concrete section and then the dust
coming<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.140> not<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.500> much<00:00:37.559> I'd<00:00:37.829> right<00:00:38.070> now<00:00:38.250> so

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
three hard to drive now I mean that is

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.700 
three hard to drive now I mean that is
point<00:00:41.579> every<00:00:42.390> time<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.660> go<00:00:42.809> out<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.410> tracks

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
point every time you go out the tracks

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.440 
point every time you go out the tracks
very<00:00:43.920> very<00:00:44.190> different<00:00:44.399> how<00:00:44.670> do<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.910> learn<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
very very different how do you learn the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.500 
very very different how do you learn the
track<00:00:45.890> for<00:00:46.890> every<00:00:47.160> heat<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.270> four

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
track for every heat we have four

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.790 
track for every heat we have four
minutes<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.469> deal<00:00:49.620> with<00:00:49.739> that

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
minutes and we have to deal with that

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.189 
minutes and we have to deal with that
it's<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> same<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:50.670> anybody<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.600> managed

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
it's the same for anybody but I managed

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.220

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.619 
to make to clear rounds the last two
rounds<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.860> I'm<00:00:56.129> really<00:00:56.280> happy<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.910> but

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
rounds so I'm really happy with that but

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.170 
rounds so I'm really happy with that but
we<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.859> deal<00:00:59.010> with<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.940> don't

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.029 
we have to deal with that and I don't
take<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.510> many<00:01:00.629> risks<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.379> that's<00:01:01.739> why<00:01:01.920> i

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
take so many risks so that's why i

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.649 
take so many risks so that's why i
