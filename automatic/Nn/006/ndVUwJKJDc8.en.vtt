00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.969
 hello I will explain how 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.059
 make a breakfast tray for 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.520
 your doll to make a tray of 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.740
 breakfast to your doll there you 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.630
 takes dough that dries 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:28.160
 the era of painting a big box 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:33.100
 of matches a pair of scissors from 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:37.280
 cotton embroidery glue beads 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.920
 a paper towel a little piece 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.150
 white paper tissue paper 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.150
 packing for butter 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.120
 first to make the plateau we take 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:57.850
 a box of matches 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:59.620
 we put the glasses on the bottom 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:14.260
 of the matchbox leaving a 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:17.200
 very small edge we put a small point 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.090
 glue is there in general the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:27.220
 matchboxes otherwise she will undo 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:30.720
 a small dot of glue on each side to 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:39.610
 the interior is still better but 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:46.560
 not required then we take two 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:50.790
 little sons a year ago here is another 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.790
 to make the wrists of the board 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.090
 here is a handful 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:20.959
 a second wrist that's for the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:26.750
 platter let's go to the cake we take the 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:29.860
 modeling clay that dries in the air and 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.860
 will make a pie 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:42.080
 I 'm doing a little dumpling and I 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:44.319
 crush it's going to make me the bottom of the 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.319
 pie 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:54.440
 here I am going to let dry I'm going 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.620
 to make a wand we make a little 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.980
 pudding like that with the scissors I'm going 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:05.140
 do small strokes and I do 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:09.320
 to dry the nun 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.650
 these are two dumplings one over 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.650
 the other 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.490
 but a little bit of water to assemble 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:25.490
 the modeling clay that's for the 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:29.150
 religious not the crescent for the 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:34.600
 growing we take a little bit of dough 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:39.170
 to model they are crushed 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.940
 and we're going to cut a triangle you could 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.610
 no scissors you take a toothpick 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:50.930
 or a knife here but a little bit 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:57.260
 of water and turn from the big side towards the 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:04:01.970
 short side and fold inwards 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.690
 it makes you a croissant and that's it 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.690
 wait for it to dry 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.189
 let's go to painting 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:27.130
 so I paint in beige the bottom of the 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.130
 pie 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.690
 It makes me hungry 

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:52.469
 good good dark on my nun at 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:52.469
 chocolate 

00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:02.589
 now I cut a small square of 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:20.169
 tissue paper to wrap the baguette 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:20.879
 like at baker's flat for my 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.439
 pie 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.949
 I will put raspberries I take 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.949
 pearls 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:32.369
 I'm going to put glue in the bottom 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.369
 from my pie 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:42.819
 so that my nun is 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:48.999
 perfect I'll stick him a little 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:53.369
 pearl on the hat 1 small point of 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:55.809
 glue and a little pearl 

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:58.569
 here 

00:05:55.809 --> 00:06:00.429
 and to make sandwiches for the little one 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:02.829
 have lunch with my baguette 

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:09.159
 butter I retrieve an old paper from 

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:14.429
 butter I cut a small square I 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:18.119
 cut out a small square of modeling clay 

00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:18.119
 and I lamballe 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.890
 and for the meal to be perfect we will 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.900
 put a small paper towel 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.970
 for the doll 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:36.680
 I cut in the center of a towel in 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:39.010
 paper a square is a little thick 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:43.720
 then I remove a thickness 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.720
 it'll make me two paper towels 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:52.769
