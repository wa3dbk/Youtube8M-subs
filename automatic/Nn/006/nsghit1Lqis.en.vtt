00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
this design is frickin hot look at that

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.980 
this design is frickin hot look at that
so<00:01:41.549> I'm<00:01:42.549> gonna<00:01:42.700> go<00:01:42.820> through<00:01:43.060> with<00:01:43.509> that

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
so I'm gonna go through with that

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.539 
so I'm gonna go through with that
and<00:01:44.530> then<00:01:45.250> we<00:01:45.310> do<00:01:45.400> one<00:01:45.549> more<00:01:45.700> see<00:01:46.600> okay<00:01:47.049> that

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
and then we do one more see okay that

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.889 
and then we do one more see okay that
this<00:01:48.549> is<00:01:48.790> why<00:01:49.299> pigment<00:01:50.229> glue<00:01:50.470> is<00:01:50.860> so<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:52.600> hard

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
this is why pigment glue is so it's hard

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.080 
this is why pigment glue is so it's hard
to<00:01:52.960> find<00:01:53.259> but<00:01:53.560> it's<00:01:53.680> worth<00:01:53.979> it<00:01:54.190> because<00:01:54.430> every

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
to find but it's worth it because every

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.870 
to find but it's worth it because every
single<00:01:55.420> place<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:56.680> this<00:01:56.920> pigment<00:01:57.220> this<00:01:57.610> this

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
single place that this pigment this this

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.660 
single place that this pigment this this
really<00:01:58.299> thin<00:01:58.659> pigment<00:01:59.170> hits<00:01:59.380> it<00:01:59.590> it<00:02:00.159> sticks

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
really thin pigment hits it it sticks

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.950 
really thin pigment hits it it sticks
really<00:02:01.000> well<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.380> I<00:02:02.710> can<00:02:03.100> go<00:02:03.189> like<00:02:03.369> this<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
really well so I can go like this and

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.810 
really well so I can go like this and
take<00:02:05.259> all<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.619> pigment<00:02:05.979> off<00:02:06.070> but<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.399> stays

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
take all the pigment off but it stays

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.109 
take all the pigment off but it stays
right<00:02:07.299> where<00:02:07.509> it's<00:02:07.810> supposed<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.970> I'm

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
right where it's supposed to and so I'm

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.979 
right where it's supposed to and so I'm
gonna<00:02:10.209> go<00:02:10.390> like<00:02:10.600> that<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:12.600> finish<00:02:13.600> all<00:02:13.870> of

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
gonna go like that and finish all of

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
black and I'm going to go down in and

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.410 
black and I'm going to go down in and
make<00:02:37.480> like<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.989> little<00:02:38.260> cracks<00:02:38.860> in<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.220> glass

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
make like the little cracks in the glass

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.440 
make like the little cracks in the glass
so<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.660> looks<00:02:40.870> like<00:02:40.930> they're<00:02:41.230> shards

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
so that it looks like they're shards

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.710 
so that it looks like they're shards
like<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.519> almost<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:46.060> almost<00:02:46.090> looks

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
like that and it almost it almost looks

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.430 
like that and it almost it almost looks
like<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:48.070> graffiti<00:02:48.720> polish<00:02:49.720> that's<00:02:49.959> coming

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
like that graffiti polish that's coming

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.800 
like that graffiti polish that's coming
out<00:02:50.560> right<00:02:50.739> now<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.820> doesn't<00:02:52.540> look<00:02:52.750> exactly

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
out right now it doesn't look exactly

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.780 
out right now it doesn't look exactly
like<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.500> but<00:02:53.680> it's<00:02:53.829> another<00:02:54.070> alternative

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
like that but it's another alternative

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.050 
like that but it's another alternative
and<00:02:55.359> I<00:02:55.540> think<00:02:55.900> it's<00:02:56.140> easier<00:02:56.590> actually<00:02:57.549> than

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
and I think it's easier actually than

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.550 
and I think it's easier actually than
the<00:02:58.090> graffiti<00:02:58.570> polished<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.200> graffiti

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560
