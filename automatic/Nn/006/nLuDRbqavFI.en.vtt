00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
gonna go into it so that's why I got

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.770 
gonna go into it so that's why I got
this<00:02:18.170> one<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:19.130> kind<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.790> make<00:02:19.940> up<00:02:20.120> for<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.540> it's

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
this one to kind of make up for it it's

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.490 
this one to kind of make up for it it's
actually<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.200> master<00:02:21.770> series<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:23.630> didn't<00:02:24.350> see

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
actually a master series I didn't see

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.880 
actually a master series I didn't see
there's<00:02:24.940> really<00:02:26.110> hardly<00:02:27.110> any<00:02:27.410> difference

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
there's really hardly any difference

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.310 
there's really hardly any difference
between<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.460> two<00:02:28.490> because<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.360> bottom<00:02:29.900> one

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
between the two because the bottom one

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.220 
between the two because the bottom one
is<00:02:30.350> I<00:02:32.800> believe<00:02:33.800> it's<00:02:34.010> an<00:02:34.130> ultra<00:02:34.430> deluxe<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:35.230> paid

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
is I believe it's an ultra deluxe I paid

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.930 
is I believe it's an ultra deluxe I paid
five<00:02:36.500> hundred<00:02:36.530> dollars<00:02:37.160> for<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:37.790> it's

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
five hundred dollars for it so it's

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.250 
five hundred dollars for it so it's
probably<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.300> deluxe<00:02:38.630> or<00:02:38.900> an<00:02:39.020> ultra<00:02:39.320> deluxe<00:02:39.970> and

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
probably a deluxe or an ultra deluxe and

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.380 
probably a deluxe or an ultra deluxe and
then<00:02:43.300> this<00:02:44.300> one<00:02:44.600> is<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.380> master<00:02:45.830> series<00:02:46.390> I'll

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
then this one is the master series I'll

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.120 
then this one is the master series I'll
explain<00:02:47.840> how<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:48.110> got<00:02:48.140> this<00:02:48.500> any<00:02:48.709> different
