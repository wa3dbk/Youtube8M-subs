00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.709 
hardly get back to you all on about
casting<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.830> gear<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.220> tackle<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.000> why

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
casting and gear and tackle and why

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.810 
casting and gear and tackle and why
can't<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.080> cast<00:00:10.349> far<00:00:10.650> enough<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.219> what<00:00:11.400> lure

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
can't I cast far enough and what lure

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.209 
can't I cast far enough and what lure
and<00:00:12.179> reel<00:00:12.450> or<00:00:12.809> rod<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.530> reel<00:00:13.740> are<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.009> using

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
and reel or rod and reel are you using

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.750 
and reel or rod and reel are you using
so<00:00:14.639> I'm<00:00:15.269> gonna<00:00:15.420> try<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.199> do<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> quick<00:00:17.430> series

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
so I'm gonna try and do a quick series

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.759 
so I'm gonna try and do a quick series
on<00:00:18.350> tackle<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:20.210> rods<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.570> reels<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.170> what

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
on tackle and rods and reels and what

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.560 
on tackle and rods and reels and what
matters<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.580> not<00:00:23.730> necessarily<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.330> game

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
matters and not necessarily in the game

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.880 
matters and not necessarily in the game
but<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.050> based<00:00:25.260> off<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> real<00:00:25.590> life

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
but this is based off a real life

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.740 
but this is based off a real life
experience<00:00:26.039> which<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> simulator<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
experience which this is a simulator and

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.540 
experience which this is a simulator and
most<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.050> stuff<00:00:28.800> should<00:00:28.830> apply<00:00:29.250> if<00:00:29.429> it

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
most of this stuff should apply if it

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.179 
most of this stuff should apply if it
already<00:00:29.730> doesn't<00:00:30.830> according<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.920> what<00:00:32.070> I've

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
already doesn't according to what I've

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.120 
already doesn't according to what I've
read<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:33.180> here's<00:00:33.989> kind<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.380> breakdown<00:00:34.620> for

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
read so here's kind of a breakdown for

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.139 
read so here's kind of a breakdown for
you<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.899> in<00:00:36.899> general<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.800> longer<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.309> rod<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
you so in general the longer the rod the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.560 
you so in general the longer the rod the
further<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.660> cast<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.450> before<00:00:42.450> we

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
further the cast you get so before we

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.360 
further the cast you get so before we
get<00:00:42.660> into<00:00:43.050> all<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> specifics<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:44.160> how<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
get into all the specifics of how the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.680 
get into all the specifics of how the
game<00:00:44.610> works<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.090> how<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.300> functions

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
game works and how it functions

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.440 
game works and how it functions
everything<00:00:45.989> let's<00:00:46.620> go<00:00:46.860> into<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.969> taking

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
everything let's go into just taking

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.750 
everything let's go into just taking
this<00:00:48.570> rod<00:00:48.809> for<00:00:49.079> example<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
this rod for example so you can see the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.459 
this rod for example so you can see the
length<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.120> its<00:00:51.270> six<00:00:51.510> foot<00:00:51.690> ten<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.199> lure

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
length of its six foot ten the lure

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.740 
length of its six foot ten the lure
weight<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> ideal<00:00:53.879> range<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
weight this is the ideal range of the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.650 
weight this is the ideal range of the
lure<00:00:54.930> weight<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.530> want<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.860> use<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.360> rod

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
lure weight you want to use for this rod

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.510 
lure weight you want to use for this rod
have<00:00:58.170> used<00:00:58.410> something<00:00:58.680> heavier<00:00:59.129> you're<00:00:59.399> gonna

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
have used something heavier you're gonna

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.430 
have used something heavier you're gonna
get<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.760> poor<00:01:00.030> cast<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.780> something<00:01:01.199> lighter

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
get a poor cast if you something lighter

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.770 
get a poor cast if you something lighter
same<00:01:01.829> thing<00:01:02.039> applies<00:01:02.420> then<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
same thing applies then you have the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.080 
same thing applies then you have the
power<00:01:04.019> which<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.589> known<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.309> L<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.760> what's

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
power which is known I or L is what's

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.120 
power which is known I or L is what's
called<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> action<00:01:07.040> basically<00:01:08.040> you

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
called the action basically you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.630 
called the action basically you
typically<00:01:08.490> want<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.820> pick<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.560> rod<00:01:10.560> based<00:01:11.280> off

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
typically want to pick a rod based off

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.210 
typically want to pick a rod based off
of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.450> weight<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.960> flight<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> species

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
of the weight and flight of the species

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.160 
of the weight and flight of the species
you're<00:01:14.520> gonna<00:01:14.640> tackle<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.299> ultra<00:01:15.720> light<00:01:15.930> is

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
you're gonna tackle so ultra light is

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.570 
you're gonna tackle so ultra light is
usually<00:01:16.590> designed<00:01:16.950> around<00:01:17.159> pan<00:01:17.549> fish<00:01:18.439> crappie

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
usually designed around pan fish crappie

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.609 
usually designed around pan fish crappie
sunfish<00:01:20.750> bluegill<00:01:21.750> those<00:01:22.080> types<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.439> things

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
sunfish bluegill those types of things

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.170 
sunfish bluegill those types of things
are<00:01:22.740> typically<00:01:23.159> what<00:01:23.310> you're<00:01:23.430> gonna<00:01:23.670> want<00:01:24.119> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
are typically what you're gonna want to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.359 
are typically what you're gonna want to
use<00:01:24.299> an<00:01:24.450> ultra<00:01:24.750> light<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.110> however<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.799> can

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
use an ultra light for however you can

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.969 
use an ultra light for however you can
land<00:01:26.610> largemouth<00:01:27.450> smallmouth<00:01:28.140> those<00:01:28.619> smaller

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
land largemouth smallmouth those smaller

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.740 
land largemouth smallmouth those smaller
species<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.579> fish<00:01:29.729> even<00:01:29.909> walleye<00:01:30.270> are

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
species of fish even walleye are

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.560 
species of fish even walleye are
typically<00:01:31.500> targeted<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.420> ultralights

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
typically targeted on ultralights

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.730 
typically targeted on ultralights
depending<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.170> how<00:01:35.070> you're<00:01:35.280> fishing<00:01:36.740> ultra

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
depending on how you're fishing ultra

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.840 
depending on how you're fishing ultra
lights<00:01:37.950> would<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.130> used<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:38.490> things<00:01:38.700> like

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
lights would be used for things like

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.960 
lights would be used for things like
jigs<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:40.020> weight<00:01:40.500> range<00:01:40.970> and

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
jigs in this this weight range and

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.969 
jigs in this this weight range and
probably<00:01:42.540> really<00:01:42.810> small<00:01:43.079> spoons<00:01:43.409> or<00:01:43.590> spinners

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
probably really small spoons or spinners

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.460 
probably really small spoons or spinners
so<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.659> next<00:01:45.869> thing<00:01:45.990> you'll<00:01:46.110> see<00:01:46.229> there<00:01:46.380> is

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
so the next thing you'll see there is

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.310 
so the next thing you'll see there is
line<00:01:46.770> weight<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:48.180> line<00:01:48.509> weight<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
line weight and the line weight is the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.109 
line weight and the line weight is the
weight<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.159> line<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.729> pretty<00:01:50.939> basic

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
weight of the line it's pretty basic

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.310 
weight of the line it's pretty basic
that<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.630> want<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.930> utilize<00:01:52.250> so<00:01:53.960> when<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.079> see

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
that you want to utilize so when you see

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
when you see that line weight and often

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.530 
when you see that line weight and often
you're<00:01:58.350> putting<00:01:58.740> on<00:01:58.979> lines<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> game<00:02:00.329> that

you're putting on lines in the game that

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.179 
you're putting on lines in the game that
say<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.049> too<00:02:01.229> heavy<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.799> may<00:02:01.950> cause

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
say this is too heavy it may cause

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.160 
say this is too heavy it may cause
damage<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.850> rod<00:02:03.090> that's<00:02:03.390> cuz<00:02:03.630> you're<00:02:03.780> over

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
damage to the rod that's cuz you're over

much with a two-piece rod versus one
piece<00:02:57.260> then<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.350> have<00:02:58.470> how<00:02:58.590> many<00:02:58.650> guides

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130

which<00:02:59.550> are<00:02:59.700> these<00:02:59.850> little<00:03:00.090> guys<00:03:00.209> here<00:03:00.780> that

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
which are these little guys here that

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.009 
which are these little guys here that
will<00:03:01.709> come<00:03:01.950> on<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.190> rod<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:03.360> what<00:03:03.810> we're

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
will come on the rod so what we're

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.320 
will come on the rod so what we're
looking<00:03:04.050> at<00:03:04.530> is<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.860> spinning<00:03:05.730> rod<00:03:05.910> now<00:03:06.300> a

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
looking at is a spinning rod now a

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.870 
looking at is a spinning rod now a
spinning<00:03:06.900> rod<00:03:07.080> are<00:03:07.470> used<00:03:07.800> for<00:03:08.100> spinning<00:03:08.670> reels

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
spinning rod are used for spinning reels

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.059 
spinning rod are used for spinning reels
like<00:03:09.540> this<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:10.440> also<00:03:10.709> have<00:03:11.370> casting<00:03:12.330> rods

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
like this you also have casting rods

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.759 
like this you also have casting rods
which<00:03:14.069> are<00:03:14.220> used<00:03:14.519> for<00:03:14.900> casting<00:03:15.900> reels<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.650> you

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
which are used for casting reels and you

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.319 
which are used for casting reels and you
can<00:03:16.920> see<00:03:17.130> we<00:03:17.519> don't<00:03:17.579> have<00:03:17.760> access<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.180> any<00:03:18.299> of

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
can see we don't have access to any of

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.270 
can see we don't have access to any of
those<00:03:18.450> were<00:03:18.630> fishing<00:03:19.079> but<00:03:19.440> casting<00:03:20.040> reels

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
those were fishing but casting reels

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.740 
those were fishing but casting reels
will<00:03:20.459> have<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.730> hook<00:03:20.910> on<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.150> back<00:03:21.329> side<00:03:21.600> of

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
will have the hook on the back side of

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.160 
will have the hook on the back side of
them<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.760> those<00:03:23.760> are<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.209> little<00:03:24.900> different

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
them and those are a little different

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.490 
them and those are a little different
from<00:03:25.380> spinning<00:03:25.860> rods<00:03:26.160> so<00:03:27.049> I'll<00:03:28.049> kind<00:03:28.380> of

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
from spinning rods so I'll kind of

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.259 
from spinning rods so I'll kind of
switch<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.370> screen<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.640> little<00:03:29.820> bit<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.180> you

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
switch the screen a little bit so you

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.410 
switch the screen a little bit so you
guys<00:03:30.450> can<00:03:30.720> see<00:03:31.310> if<00:03:32.310> you're<00:03:32.549> using<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.970> casting

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
guys can see if you're using a casting

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.509 
guys can see if you're using a casting
rod<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:33.780> usually<00:03:34.260> can<00:03:34.440> get<00:03:34.590> further<00:03:34.829> casts

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
rod you usually can get further casts

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.020 
rod you usually can get further casts
heavier<00:03:36.209> hook<00:03:36.510> sets<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.310> most<00:03:38.790> people

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
heavier hook sets and you most people

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.150 
heavier hook sets and you most people
use<00:03:39.329> a<00:03:39.360> little<00:03:39.540> bit<00:03:39.780> heavier<00:03:40.049> line<00:03:40.410> with

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
use a little bit heavier line with

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.440 
use a little bit heavier line with
casting<00:03:42.120> rod<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.510> casting<00:03:42.930> reel<00:03:43.109> combo

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
casting rod and a casting reel combo

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.970 
casting rod and a casting reel combo
this<00:03:45.450> again<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:45.959> mostly<00:03:46.290> real<00:03:46.769> life
