00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 with luck, march will bring new ones 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.049
 identified maxwell generation of nvidia 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.610
 but before that comes keppler again 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.320
 right in ride and therefore warm 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.710
 Welcome to the walk of the calendar week 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.450
 4 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.280
 my name is raffael and that is 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.740
 our top news is the talk of one 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.420
 gtx 790 and a month ago in the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.640
 been talk since going ex titan 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.250
 black edition the gtx 790 should 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.810
 known to be equipped with 210 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.369
 more detailed information whether this as 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.930
 fully upgradeable be soldered on the map 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.820
 but there are not yet 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.990
 An online retailer from Russia listed 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.579
 a map of abo 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.440
 Accordingly, the card is not ten or 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.210
 twelve gigabytes but only 64 gbytes 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.950
 Graphics memory also own the gtx 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.260
 shared black edition was one of 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.250
 Traders also listed by asus as well 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.290
 here were six gigabytes 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.210
 graphics memory also advertised 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.000
 it is assumed that the gtx title black 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.980
 edition like the gtx 780 de with a 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.660
 opponent 110 should come in full expansion 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.410
 however the double physical again 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.000
 higher fails 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.649
 apparently the black edition of the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.539
 shares with her predecessor replace model 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.920
 because in many shops is the GTX times 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.840
 certainly no longer available 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.489
 it should all be so true 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.870
 will be the black edition of the times 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.700
 king under the pixel accelerator 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.920
 we will stay with the topic 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.170
 graphics cards are finally available 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.689
 and at moderate prices the guest in the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.060
 design graphic cards with hawaii against by 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.740
 Amd because already in december these were 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.710
 orderable but with surcharge of around 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.840
 the 90 euro a cash card of the he 1990 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.970
 is already available for around 380 euros 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.009
 and comes in terms of performance nvidias gtx 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.420
 780 the dangerously close 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.460
 probably the cheapest at the moment 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.020
 card comes as always from gigabyte and 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.180
 relies on the well-known windforce 3x 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.310
 cooler and standard on one 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.720
 Factory overclocking for around 170 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.970
 euro is this card to have 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.860
 just under 15 euros more expensive and thanks to the three 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.159
 slot cooling is a bit cooler and quieter 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.829
 the celebration of 1990 he got so tough on the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.899
 a little better sapphire he 1990 extreme 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.579
 Xp uses the Trubel slot cooler and is 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.320
 available for just under 500 euros 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.040
 asus also offers box designs 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.290
 hawaii cdu on so is the 1990 direct cu 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.119
 to have chi for around 400 euros 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.320
 Lead your sister with iks in the name 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.060
 540 euros 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.730
 We also take the listed offer 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.550
 other manufacturers the powercolor 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.040
 xfx and other guest in the designs of the high 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.860
 end graphics cards from amd to ours 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.840
 Purchase recommendation is the sapphire he 1990 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.210
 This is very quiet and cool 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.950
 and to have for about 400 euros 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.600
 other graphics card recommendations 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.860
 See below in the video description 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.480
 definitely looked over 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.520

 or a 290 x6 down in the 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.740
 Comments 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.960
 In 2014 there will be many interesting games 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.070
 the market two of them are full and 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.050
 the elder scrolls online 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.600
 and these were recently at the 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.370
 Usk in the exam but this time is 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.990
 In the case of these two games, everything is fine 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.460
 gone out after the elder scrolls 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.390
 online from the entertainment software rating 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.910
 board shortly 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.830
 as albi 1 received pesos for 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.420
 it is suitable players from 17 years 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.880
 keeps it in this country from the usk one 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.380
 release from 16 years the elder scrolls 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.210
 online is changed accordingly 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.190
 Germany also became of times the 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.500
 usk examination and receives as to 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.840
 do not expect youth clearance as well 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.340
 usk 18 known thus comes also the 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.350
 respawn online shooter from home 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.360
 entertainment without changes and 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.100
 cuts to germany recently gave 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.660
 it's a beta weekend to the elder 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.709
 It actually could be scrolls online 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.390
 everyone is gambling 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.950
 did you fancy it if so how 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.670
 Do you think the game seems down in it? 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.580
 the comments 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.290
 All of us sit in the nsa espionage scandal 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.120
 still pretty deep in the bones though 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.550
 not only the spies but rum 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.380
 Also many televisions manufacturers in the 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.270
 last year lgv caused a stir as 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.800
 it became known that their television set the 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.750
 have a connection to the internet 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.830
 certain data over the internet to the 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.510
 ship manufacturer 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.310
 Lately, the topic is rather 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.959
 has moved into the background now has the 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.910
 magazine ct the topic again 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.620
 accepted and found out that not 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.790
 only televisions from lg but also from 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.860
 other manufacturers like panasonic 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.970
 toshiba and samsung the activities of 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.010
 log users 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.870
 This is how the smarties are supposed to store cookies 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.430
 and forward data to 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.209
 tv channels and google redirected 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.100
 have been 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.470
 in addition, the studies of 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.360
 the tt that TV channels at the tv occupancy 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.610
 Listen and senders are interested 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.590
 this is done, inter alia, by means of sbb 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.180
 Enhancements although not exactly sure 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.310
 is and therefore the data of third 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.380
 can be diverted accordingly 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.180
 those who are not concerned about espionage 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.790
 make our recommendation is the 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.500
 extension to your television or 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.489
 but does not close TV at all 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.959
 to the internet 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.780
 if in the next time yours 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.040
 bank account is cleared and everything up 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.750
 any Chinese could 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.060
 that lands you are not surprised 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.020
 when many ATMs are still running 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.300
 windows xp 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.640
 it is known that microsoft from the 8 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.470
 april 2014 windows xp no longer with 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.270
 will provide security updates from 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.520
 a report flies from the web pages 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.990
 dot com states that over 95 percent 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.940
 the world's about three million 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.130
 ATMs still with windows xp as 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.960
 Operating system are equipped by 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.030
 8 april should be estimated straight 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.340
 times 15 percent of all the usa 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.440
 devices to be upgraded to windows 7 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.030
 playing the new operating system 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.560
 works though network however 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.570
 Many vending machines are outdated 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.550
 hardware equipped to play that 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.500
 prevent a new operating system 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.090
 But there are most of them 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.889
 However, financial institutions use one 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.840
 windows xp version with the addition 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.870
 steals some until the year 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.100
 2016 will be updated as well 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.240
 hang the ATMs in Germany 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.830
 not on the internet 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.540
 Thus, only the well-known come again 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.070
 methods in question to clear accounts 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.330
 anyway independent of 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.730
 operating system on the cash machine 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.830
 work there we have luck again 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.710
 have and are not so in germany 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.260
 really affected but attacks 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.050
 a man in the bag 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:35.150
 nothing to bring the rumor mill simmering 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.020
 who google his nexus devices about 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.910
 einstampfen 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.570
 google's nexus smartphones are enjoying themselves 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.370
 thanks to very good price 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.810
 Performance ratio of great popularity 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.639
 now wants the russian tech blogger 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.990
 eliot asia have experienced that only 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.770
 this year google new devices 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.150
 wants to introduce 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.740
 in the next year then only should 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.780
 google player dischen smartphones and 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.520
 which are then sold 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.170
 be offered under a new name 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.310
 if google really should take this step 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.020
 is going to go is uncertain 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.490
 the sales figures of the lexus devices 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.350
 speak for themselves, however, are the 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.880
 profit margins on the equipment very low 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.440
 a focus on other devices 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.270
 manufacturer does not sound accordingly 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.710
 The wrong question is how far you are 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.360
 to believe in this rumor 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.830
 parents did not lay in the 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.660
 past with a few rumors 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.120
 but also wrong with a few 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.840
 what do you think is the rumored thing 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.730
 tuned 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.440
 much speaks for shatner yours 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.330
 opinion below in the comments 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.620
 otherwise it was with this view 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.350
 I hope by me like if 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.790
 You give us a thumbs up
