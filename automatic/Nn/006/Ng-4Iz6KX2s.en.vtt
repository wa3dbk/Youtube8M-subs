00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.920
 good afternoon and welcome again 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.540
 and this time I bring surprise what 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.730
 I told you that I was going to bring new to the channel 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.239
 an improvement and very important and here is 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.670
 There is the beast and an authentic machine 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.770
 that I have prepared but before 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.750
 Take her out of her classroom before releasing her 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.210
 I want to teach all the components 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.360
 everything that the one by one form of 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.360
 agreement 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.170
 or not 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.170
 ah 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.590
 yes no 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.840
 ah 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.180
 today you have seen everything that forms this 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.640
 machine to season a little too 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.560
 we have this 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.560
 here you see me more 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.990
 a 24- inch bench monitor 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.600
 to access 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.140
 your tickets and everything else comes all perfect 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.560
 and it's not just one there are two there behind that 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.390
 little black face of the background is another one already when 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.549
 everything is assembled and I will show you a 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.020
 day but for now we are going to what 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.020
 account not to the machine 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:06.000
 what does not smell new to power something something 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.000
 strong for salt 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.679
 yes 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.730
 my mother is worth 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.150
 what happened could I put it a little more 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.330
 down we're going to open it to remove the 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.030
 plastics inside 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.450
 look how wonderful it is that he has a 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.890
 finishing one way is brutal 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.890
 I love it 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.010
 let's see inside what we give 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.230
 Oh 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.290
 it's a pass 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.280
 now what I'm going to do is record with the 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:21.190
 mobile and I'm going to teach it closely to 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.190
 inside because it's incredible incredible 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.500
 Well, here, as you can see, we have the 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:33.980
 frontal two ports 3.0 two normal the 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.670
 micro audio inputs 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.160
 we open the lid and we have the recorder 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.890
 and all grate good the truth that is is 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.390
 One last 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.190
 because above we can put another 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.750
 fan that at the moment it is not going to 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.650
 I need to because I think I'm left over 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.530
 of refrigeration 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.460
 and inside as you can see there is 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.210
 there you see liquid refrigeration 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.250
 it's a pass 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.400
 8 gigas of ram although expanding it is 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.700
 surely in the future 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.819
 this is a bestiality of the 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.380
 Graphic card 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.740
 Let's see if we can see it better 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.740
 there 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:20.620
 and there is a gtx 970 ms and those that you 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.560
 come with the presentation that special 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.910
 they have them with a pass the plate 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.610
 also table and as you have already seen 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.040
 it was a fountain and the nice ones that comes 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.660
 there the SSD disk hidden there in the 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.760
 side is where I put the hard drive 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.740
 same apart that I'll have to ride it 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.180
 now before doing that 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:43.180
 and we're going here back here 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:46.340
 and as you see on the plate, it comes with 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.490
 7.1 that is another wonder also of 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.639
 this is very good for some 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.430
 things since you 'll see 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:58.240
 and with all its plugs comes a lot 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.759
 of ports are 2,486 usb plus 4 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.889
 frontal a 12 in total and good that I 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:05.390
 there are conditions right now 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.930
 and nothing 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:12.580
 this is the machine I hope that I have 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.410
 liked and you already know how to comment 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.940
