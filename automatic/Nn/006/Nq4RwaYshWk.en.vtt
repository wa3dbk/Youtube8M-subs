00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
you just have one of those days where

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.770 
you just have one of those days where
you<00:01:43.740> cannot<00:01:44.189> cook<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.880> was<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.210> easy<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
you cannot cook it was so easy and I

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.389 
you cannot cook it was so easy and I
thought<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.049> tasted<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.560> good<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.040> wanted<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
thought it tasted so good so I wanted to

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.249 
thought it tasted so good so I wanted to
get<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.579> again<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.720> forgot<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.079> bring<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
get it again but I forgot to bring the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.410 
get it again but I forgot to bring the
package<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.520> was<00:01:50.640> trying<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.850> guess<00:01:51.030> and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
package and so I was trying to guess and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.090 
package and so I was trying to guess and
I<00:01:51.570> guess<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.380> was<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.920> worked

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
I guess that this was it that worked

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.020 
I guess that this was it that worked

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.850 
Bertolli chicken margherita penne it
doesn't<00:01:57.630> look<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.200> has<00:01:58.229> nearly<00:01:58.649> as<00:01:58.740> many

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
doesn't look like it has nearly as many

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.590 
doesn't look like it has nearly as many
vegetables<00:01:59.399> but<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.820> was<00:01:59.909> quite<00:02:00.090> expensive<00:02:00.299> so

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
vegetables but it was quite expensive so

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.350 
vegetables but it was quite expensive so
I<00:02:00.719> hope<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.259> tasty<00:02:01.860> at<00:02:01.950> least<00:02:02.210> we<00:02:03.210> also

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and then we always add different sauces

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.920
