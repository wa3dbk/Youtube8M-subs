00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.189
 space simulators be it arcade 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.830
 Does it claim to be hardcore and 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.200
 realistic thing is quite curious 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.279
 especially now that this topic can be 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.380
 say on horseback 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.619
 because everything is in anticipation of the great and 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.880
 terrible star citizen 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.190
 hence it makes sense to pay 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.720
 attention to at least some significant 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.420
 releases of games about space 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.610
 especially from domestic developers 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.020
 yes as you might guess from 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.350
 the names are about star conflict and 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.750
 ladies know that she came out in 2011 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.870
 but our old channel review has been removed 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.670
 in the rebranding process so it has 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.370
 sense to speak about this 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.399
 project again, especially since 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.220
 early builds have flowed a lot of water and much 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.360
 exchanged and so pretty pour over 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.460
 empty sieve 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.570
 behind the scenes for you today Dmitri is broadcasting 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.570
 Zubarev and this review on star conflict 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.570
 look 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.189
 if you try to describe the star conflict 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.820
 In short, in priests you can say something 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.399
 like 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.520
 tanks in space or the same war thunder 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.590
 only in zero gravity to describe 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.720
 the basic mechanics of this in general thats 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.979
 enough 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.259
 we have before ourselves quite 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.570
 session fights with mandatory respite 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.149
 in the hangar and with the purchase of fresh ships for 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.130
 exp and so forth on the thumb for 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.880
 Experienced at all times session 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.310
 postrelushek 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.030
 from different techniques will not be here 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.700
 some 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.679
 revelations at first glance of course but 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.440
 as usual with the games in which I 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:59.549
 stayed a little longer than one 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.190
 evening devil is in the details the whole thing 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.929
 the fact is that though fights and sessional but 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.220
 gameplay has a number of very important 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.640
 features 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.739
 central of which is the gameplay 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.540
 damn it reminds almost that cult 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.590
 freelancer about the same level 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.290
 arcade 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.810
 about the same set of maneuvers and ships 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.260
 I feel about the same I do not know how 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.930
 for you 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.390
 but for me it is a huge plus all 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.670
 it is played quite dynamically cheerfully 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.489
 much more fun and easier than the same 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.799
 tanks or plane as in this regard 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.320
 star conflict is much more suitable 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.640
 for those who just want to relax and 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.470
 don't think about flying projectile armor 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.859
 despite the fact that the depth of the star conflict 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.319
 not sags from battle to battle getting 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.310
 our share of fun we are pumping and 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.500
 getting into the hangar 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.950
 free to arrange on their iron 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.350
 aggregates brand new guns shields and other 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.150
 goodies that will facilitate you 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.519
 play and promote easy 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.739
 penetration of your lasers into the gap 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.600
 enemy armored ships that are available 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.850
 the player is divided into several major 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.130
 classes each of which has its own 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.680
 branch of development and each of which can 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.359
 pump over among other things even 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.209
 scored pilot can be installed 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.810
 various magnifying implants 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.940
 speed 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.250
 power maneuverability and so on 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.410
 like in general once the main 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.870
 the concept of all this joy I already give you 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.290
 outlined it's time to move on to raisins 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.900
 and the spoons are gone first 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.970
 nice visual catches 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.500
 The component is not that straight 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.560
 amazing imagination 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.900
 but the eye is happy though in many ways here 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.410
 merit rather nedvizhka and technical 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.640
 component of a very nice design 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.100
 creating the right atmosphere 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.350
 various parts missing hangar 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.840
 It really seems alive and everything in it 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.180
 time something happens a going out 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.080
 space of the planet amaze with its 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.270
 huge 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.100
 the next pleasant moment is 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.560
 recently screwed 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.720
 open world mode in which you can 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.150
 travel to different locations 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.880
 perform quests to beat the alien 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.250
 adversaries and generally in every way creative 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.400
 express yourself robbing caravans and 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.959
 making raids well or be good and 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.590
 protect the innocent 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.690
 then who really like it anyway 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.470
 upon closer inspection all these advantages 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.800
 seem a bit different 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.919
 would 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.080
 Now take the least design to location 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.240
 beautifully drawn painfully 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.090
 standard for space issues 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.980
 itâ€™s understandable that space is everywhere alone 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.510
 but I remembered it was a toy under 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.980
 the name of the chronicle tarr 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.919
 in which the developers have managed 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.260
 create the most beautiful cosmos of 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.630
 seen but also open world which was 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.660
 introduced relatively recently and at all 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.910
 with more thorough acquaintance with him 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.740
 raises a number of questions the fact is that 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.530
 open and can be called very 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.720
 conditionally we move from location to 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.730
 location for the paths that we 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.070
 drew the developer and at the same time 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.960
 absolutely not felt the vitality of this 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.090
 of the world itself that is to 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.730
 in the same freelancers was something like 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.430
 there we also traveled from sectors 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:18.070
 sector through the gate and the feeling that 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.370
 developers the concept of their open 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.770
 world have a freelancer and looked but these 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.610
 most sectors in star conflict on 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.260
 the checks are very close 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.419
 literally like a room in a communal flat 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.080
 only unlike communal in 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.409
 sectors 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.970
 occurs at times less events 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:39.729
 from time to time someone fights with someone 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:42.669
 and someone is attacking but no 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.280
 even life simulations if freelancing and 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.050
 I could trace the traders coming with 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.819
 one end of the galaxy to the other with 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.550
 specific trade missions 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:53.979
 here through the gate travel unless 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.530
 what lonely mercenaries who performs 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:06:00.669
 quests to get faster without 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:03.129
 Donata who are here too with one 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:05.409
 parties like well but on the other somehow 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.940
 I really want to fly in really 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:10.030
 living open world 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.400
 but with and the whole peak everything is fine with 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.430
 more recently, battles have been added to the game 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.259
 dreadnought burped 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.300
 huge mother ships which 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:21.729
 build corporations and which can 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.699
 move between sectors in order 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:27.340
 engage in battles and so on for wars 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:30.250
 corporations this item is one 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.529
 of key players for ordinary players 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.710
 he is able to bring in the necessary 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:38.560
 share a variety of already established 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:41.379
 gameplay as you might have noticed 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.810
 almost all my claims to the game 

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:46.300
 from the category and hotelok the thing is that 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.639
 the project has a huge potential 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.310
 potential and describing all your expectations 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:54.159
 from the game you do not warm tiny 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:57.069
 hope that developed ear such 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:59.289
 hear these lines and hear the wisdom 

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:02.229
 my words anyway project already 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:04.900
 now compares favorably with the main 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:06.750
 the masses of frituple games in the incentive and if 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.039
 already that he is also from domestic 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.440
 developers can be so 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:13.750
 I'm happy for the guys , I will choose 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.240
 come back time after time and yet 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:19.060
 I will take the liberty to advise and and 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.830
 to those who, like me, love space 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.469
 well, or just those who like 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.569
 Session games like aircraft tanks 

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:27.940
 and others like them, that's all 

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:29.819
 more frags to you always with you 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:33.210
 team time video game

 scriptwriter and montage alexander 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:38.090
 voiceover Dmitry Zubarev 

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:40.669
 don't live one life 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:43.220
 live many play games see 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:45.020
 film and listen to good music and not
