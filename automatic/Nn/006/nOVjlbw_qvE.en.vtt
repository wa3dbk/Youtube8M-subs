00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
hammer ons when we make the shift so I'm

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.550 
hammer ons when we make the shift so I'm
going<00:00:18.500> to<00:00:18.530> start<00:00:18.830> with<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.130> C<00:00:19.340> chord<00:00:19.670> and<00:00:20.560> then

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
going to start with the C chord and then

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.590 
going to start with the C chord and then
you<00:00:21.950> notice<00:00:22.160> I<00:00:22.400> have<00:00:22.580> my<00:00:22.730> third<00:00:22.940> finger<00:00:23.240> on<00:00:23.480> the

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
five on the bottom G is another step of

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.470 
five on the bottom G is another step of
that<00:00:29.600> scale<00:00:30.160> instead<00:00:31.160> of<00:00:31.310> an<00:00:31.430> e<00:00:31.610> the<00:00:32.090> e<00:00:32.119> just

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
the timing isn't but it's just nice and

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.949 
the timing isn't but it's just nice and
easy

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:21.580 

one<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.890> two<00:02:13.159> and<00:02:13.370> three

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.740 

now<00:02:22.160> my<00:02:22.310> right<00:02:22.459> hand<00:02:22.520> still<00:02:23.030> keeps<00:02:23.270> going<00:02:23.540> past

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
now my right hand still keeps going past

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.630 
now my right hand still keeps going past
the<00:02:23.930> strings<00:02:24.230> doesn't<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:24.800> it's<00:02:25.220> just<00:02:25.459> on<00:02:25.610> the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
the strings doesn't it it's just on the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.510 
the strings doesn't it it's just on the
way<00:02:25.880> up<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.390> don't<00:02:26.690> touch<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.110> strings<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:28.160> one

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
way up I don't touch the strings so one

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.070 
way up I don't touch the strings so one
of<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.670> reasons<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.120> advocate<00:02:29.630> moving<00:02:29.959> your

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
of the reasons I advocate moving your

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.410 
of the reasons I advocate moving your
hand<00:02:30.260> all<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.590> time<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.130> helps<00:02:31.370> timing<00:02:31.940> it

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
hand all the time is it helps timing it

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.120 
hand all the time is it helps timing it
acts<00:02:32.630> like<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.930> governor<00:02:33.349> on<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.530> car<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.950> keep

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
acts like a governor on a car to keep

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.830 
acts like a governor on a car to keep
you<00:02:34.250> from<00:02:34.400> going<00:02:34.580> too<00:02:34.849> fast<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.450> keeps<00:02:35.660> your

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
you from going too fast it keeps your

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.839 
you from going too fast it keeps your
timing<00:02:36.200> nice<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.590> steady<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:37.069> lot<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.640> people

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
timing nice and steady a lot of people

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.400 
timing nice and steady a lot of people
tell<00:02:38.060> me<00:02:38.180> they<00:02:38.300> struggle<00:02:38.780> with<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.260> this
