in<00:02:11.760> cricket<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.930> just<00:02:13.230> because

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
in cricket that just because

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.880 
in cricket that just because
you're<00:02:13.700> on<00:02:13.790> top<00:02:14.060> one<00:02:14.330> day<00:02:14.590> doesn't<00:02:15.590> mean<00:02:15.740> you

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
you're on top one day doesn't mean you

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.660 
you're on top one day doesn't mean you
always<00:02:16.070> will<00:02:16.460> be

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
always will be

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.120 
always will be
and<00:02:16.910> just<00:02:17.390> because<00:02:17.540> you're<00:02:17.780> down<00:02:18.130> doesn't

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
and just because you're down doesn't

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.830 
and just because you're down doesn't
mean<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.430> can't<00:02:19.700> turn<00:02:20.030> things<00:02:20.270> around<00:02:20.420> again

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
mean you can't turn things around again

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.660 
mean you can't turn things around again
I<00:02:21.230> think<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:21.680> Creed<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.160> teaches<00:02:22.580> you

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
I think of that Creed is it teaches you

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.870 
I think of that Creed is it teaches you
a<00:02:22.700> lot<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:24.680> teaches<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:25.520> you<00:02:25.580> can<00:02:25.790> be

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
a lot and it teaches you that you can be

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.520 
a lot and it teaches you that you can be
a<00:02:25.910> star<00:02:26.210> one<00:02:26.240> day<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:27.050> can<00:02:27.230> remember<00:02:27.350> a
