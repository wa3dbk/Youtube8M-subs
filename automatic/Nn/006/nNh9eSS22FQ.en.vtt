00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:26.619
 so hello people dear hunter nature lovers 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.070
 the trend of the other video that 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.320
 is a so-called pocket oven there 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.070
 you ignite something and do it in the 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.000
 bag or a sleeping bag and sleeping bag 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.150
 now then a little longer 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.129
 outside so sit by or 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.949
 were we were really cold 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.390
 so he knows and I 'm looking for 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.340
 then, of course, still 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.300
 have any alternatives and there 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.690
 a little something again 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.690
 found 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:24.730
 and that's when I picked myself up as 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:28.040
 replacement man fixed fuel bags oven 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.100
 Although this thing yes that works with 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.100
 white spirit or in the description 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.900
 was first only gasoline this thing 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.670
 I now find personal absolute 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.570
 shit I've taken the thing out 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.850
 yesterday at the start 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.590
 if it is made out because it is so 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.220
 no one stunk 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.080
 imagine 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.550
 I did not want that part either 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.470
 down in the sleeping bag rows of weimar 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.490
 otherwise and not poisoned in there 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.770
 So that was high ceiling was then off 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.150
 stood in the description five to 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.430
 ten seconds to stop a flame here 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:12.230
 because he spent five to ten minutes until that 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:14.950
 starts to glow yes i can do this 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.880
 Part not recommend I think shit 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.010
 simply because it stinks leaking 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.480
 here is over the petrol lawn mower is 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.480
 it then in the hand today 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.740
 started burning 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.830
 I looked then from the second head 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.480
 brought as a substitute but no idea that 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.890
 Will we disappear somewhere this 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.900
 Although some we warm but not now 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.130
 really hot or what you get 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.630
 so while you can maybe 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.410
 warm your hands up a bit rough 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.610
 but that 's it 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:52.580
 You have to be careful to share that 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:54.560
 which goes out if you do yes for need or 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.090
 Serwe situation I can do that thing 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.650
 Neatly recommend that says good 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.330
 So I pack a part in the car and 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.650
 when one is what I can to order 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.410
 we only have that works with 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.000
 pure gasoline so with the gasoline 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.340
 the vehicle that could forget 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.040
 then it's not going to happen again 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.480
 dragging lighters last 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.290
 with it around or pure gasoline no 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.270
 So human, as I said, hunting 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.430
 absolute mist therefore likely 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.500
 Yesterday also the creatures expelled 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.670
 as well as the part has stunk that will 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.030
 I will no longer take the 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.030
 now away 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.830
 Now I believe from the company music 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.959
 or what no idea must always look 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.510
 So this thing is absolute shit 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:39.610
 let it stay stinky works 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:42.360
 not really mist thanks a lot 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.360
