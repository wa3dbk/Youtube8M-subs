then<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.160> school<00:00:32.490> was<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.240> was<00:00:33.390> smaller<00:00:33.690> one

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
then the school was it was smaller one

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.230 
then the school was it was smaller one
because<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.620> were<00:00:34.740> down<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.040> street<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:36.090> was<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.240 
because we were down the street it was a

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.580 
because we were down the street it was a
smaller<00:00:36.480> venue<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.780> think<00:00:36.990> it's<00:00:37.110> currently<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
something that's what it is and that's a

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.770

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.800 

I<00:03:21.010> think<00:03:22.010> because<00:03:22.130> of<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.520> how<00:03:23.209> popular<00:03:23.660> is

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
I think because of the how popular is

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.990 
I think because of the how popular is
within<00:03:23.959> media<00:03:24.350> now<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.830> think<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.670> helps<00:03:25.910> the

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
within media now I think it helps the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.210 
within media now I think it helps the
school<00:03:26.270> because<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:26.900> gives<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:27.230> place<00:03:27.709> for<00:03:28.040> kids

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
school because it gives a place for kids

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.980 
school because it gives a place for kids
