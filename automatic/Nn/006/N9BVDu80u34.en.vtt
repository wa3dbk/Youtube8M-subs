that<00:00:38.500> you<00:00:38.650> can<00:00:38.769> get<00:00:38.980> your<00:00:39.129> rope<00:00:39.340> back<00:00:39.550> you

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
that you can get your rope back you

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.100 
that you can get your rope back you
don't<00:00:39.940> just<00:00:40.120> leave<00:00:40.330> it<00:00:40.449> over<00:00:40.660> the<00:00:40.750> tree<00:00:41.019> I

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
don't just leave it over the tree I

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.990 
don't just leave it over the tree I
pulled<00:00:41.410> the<00:00:41.530> one<00:00:41.710> side<00:00:42.010> that's<00:00:42.340> hanging<00:00:42.820> down

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
pulled the one side that's hanging down

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.210 
pulled the one side that's hanging down
so<00:00:43.239> it<00:00:43.420> goes<00:00:43.449> all<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.780> way<00:00:43.900> up<00:00:44.199> so<00:00:44.440> I've<00:00:45.070> got

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
so it goes all the way up so I've got

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.500 
so it goes all the way up so I've got
enough<00:00:45.460> going<00:00:45.670> to<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:45.910> ground<00:00:46.090> of<00:00:46.300> course

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
enough going to the ground of course

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.910 
enough going to the ground of course
this<00:00:46.690> is<00:00:46.840> not<00:00:46.989> very<00:00:47.199> good<00:00:47.410> for<00:00:47.470> your<00:00:47.739> actual

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
this is not very good for your actual

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.490 
this is not very good for your actual
rope<00:00:48.370> so<00:00:48.940> keep<00:00:49.300> that<00:00:49.480> in<00:00:49.540> mind<00:00:49.660> once<00:00:50.110> you<00:00:50.230> get

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
rope so keep that in mind once you get

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.139 
rope so keep that in mind once you get
it<00:00:50.620> pulled<00:00:50.860> around<00:00:51.070> so<00:00:51.550> that<00:00:51.580> you<00:00:51.820> have<00:00:52.000> it

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
it pulled around so that you have it

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.720 
it pulled around so that you have it
going<00:00:52.329> far<00:00:52.750> enough<00:00:52.960> down<00:00:53.290> below<00:00:54.070> you<00:00:54.129> then

going far enough down below you then

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.369 
going far enough down below you then
what<00:00:54.940> you<00:00:55.059> can<00:00:55.210> do<00:00:55.360> is<00:00:55.510> you<00:00:55.629> take<00:00:55.809> the<00:00:56.050> short
