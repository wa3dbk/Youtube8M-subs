okay so this joint is completely welded
after<00:00:28.490> it<00:00:28.609> cools<00:00:28.880> I'll<00:00:29.240> sand<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:29.840> weld<00:00:30.050> plat

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
after it cools I'll sand the weld plat

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.069 
after it cools I'll sand the weld plat
work<00:00:31.189> it<00:00:31.340> with<00:00:31.489> a<00:00:31.520> hammer<00:00:31.789> and<00:00:31.910> Dolly<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:32.480> then

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
work it with a hammer and Dolly and then

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.170 
work it with a hammer and Dolly and then
we'll<00:00:33.199> get<00:00:33.320> on<00:00:33.500> to<00:00:33.620> the<00:00:33.739> next<00:00:34.010> step<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:34.519> it's

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
we'll get on to the next step so it's

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.819 
we'll get on to the next step so it's
taken<00:00:35.480> a<00:00:35.540> little<00:00:35.690> hammer<00:00:35.989> and<00:00:36.110> Dolly<00:00:36.410> work<00:00:36.620> to

position<00:00:50.000> where<00:00:50.149> it<00:00:50.239> really<00:00:50.480> fits<00:00:50.839> the<00:00:51.079> buck

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
position where it really fits the buck

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.219 
position where it really fits the buck
best<00:00:51.710> don't<00:00:52.129> get<00:00:52.280> this<00:00:52.460> kind<00:00:52.760> of<00:00:52.989> nestled<00:00:53.989> into

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:54.229 
best don't get this kind of nestled into

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:59.349 
best don't get this kind of nestled into
position<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.010> then<00:00:55.820> I'll<00:00:55.940> clamp<00:00:56.420> it<00:00:56.859> and<00:00:58.359> now

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
position and then I'll clamp it and now

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.000 
position and then I'll clamp it and now
I'm<00:00:59.539> going<00:00:59.719> to<00:00:59.840> check<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:00.379> fit<00:01:00.559> against<00:01:00.829> the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
I'm going to check the fit against the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.700 
I'm going to check the fit against the
buck<00:01:01.160> very<00:01:01.429> carefully<00:01:02.030> it<00:01:02.989> looks<00:01:03.260> like<00:01:03.410> I<00:01:03.440> have

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
buck very carefully it looks like I have

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.710 
buck very carefully it looks like I have
an<00:01:03.829> excellent<00:01:04.129> fit<00:01:04.640> so<00:01:05.269> just<00:01:05.539> like<00:01:05.690> before

an excellent fit so just like before

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.139 
an excellent fit so just like before
we'll<00:01:06.560> drill<00:01:06.860> alignment<00:01:07.520> holes<00:01:07.670> in<00:01:08.030> this

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
we'll drill alignment holes in this

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.120 
we'll drill alignment holes in this
panel<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:08.780> use<00:01:08.960> drywall<00:01:09.380> screws<00:01:09.679> to<00:01:09.860> keep<00:01:09.890> it

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
panel and use drywall screws to keep it

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.790 
panel and use drywall screws to keep it
from<00:01:10.250> shifting<00:01:10.460> we'll<00:01:11.390> scribe<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.899> edge<00:01:12.080> trim

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
from shifting we'll scribe the edge trim

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.600 
from shifting we'll scribe the edge trim
it<00:01:13.039> and<00:01:13.160> weld<00:01:14.030> them<00:01:14.179> together<00:01:15.310> I'm<00:01:16.310> really

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
it and weld them together I'm really

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.010 
it and weld them together I'm really
pleased<00:01:16.880> with<00:01:17.030> how<00:01:17.090> this<00:01:17.330> fender<00:01:17.660> is<00:01:17.780> shaping

pleased with how this fender is shaping

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.770 
pleased with how this fender is shaping
up<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:19.190> this<00:01:19.610> is<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:19.910> last<00:01:20.119> piece<00:01:20.420> we'll<00:01:20.659> be

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
up so this is the last piece we'll be

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.870 
up so this is the last piece we'll be
fitting<00:01:20.990> onto<00:01:21.289> the<00:01:21.470> buck<00:01:21.679> so<00:01:22.369> let's<00:01:22.550> get<00:01:22.700> it

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
fitting onto the buck so let's get it

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.380 
fitting onto the buck so let's get it
slipped<00:01:23.179> into<00:01:23.360> place<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:25.310> just<00:01:25.880> like<00:01:26.030> before

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.600 
slipped into place and just like before
I'll<00:01:26.569> find<00:01:26.810> where<00:01:27.200> it<00:01:27.319> positions<00:01:27.920> itself<00:01:28.069> best

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
I'll find where it positions itself best

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.120 
I'll find where it positions itself best
on<00:01:28.849> the<00:01:29.030> buck<00:01:29.380> then<00:01:30.380> we'll<00:01:30.560> clamp<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:30.979> into

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
on the buck then we'll clamp it into

intervals around the wheel well opening

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.100 
intervals around the wheel well opening
and<00:01:46.610> I'll<00:01:46.670> start<00:01:46.970> working<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.569> metal<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:48.020> the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
and I'll start working the metal and the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.859 
and I'll start working the metal and the
windows<00:01:48.500> between<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.130> clamps<00:01:49.459> I'm<00:01:50.390> using<00:01:50.660> a

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
windows between the clamps I'm using a

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.839 
windows between the clamps I'm using a
hammer<00:01:51.080> with<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.440> slightly<00:01:51.770> rounded<00:01:52.340> face<00:01:52.550> on

it

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.199 

it<00:02:07.770> was<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> big<00:02:08.190> production<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.759> make<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.060> buck

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
it was a big production to make the buck

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.029 
it was a big production to make the buck
for<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.569> fender<00:02:09.959> but<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.739> really<00:02:10.920> see

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
for this fender but you can really see

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.550 
for this fender but you can really see
the<00:02:11.310> benefits<00:02:11.730> now<00:02:11.970> by<00:02:12.690> hammering<00:02:13.170> over<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the benefits now by hammering over the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.650 
the benefits now by hammering over the
rounded<00:02:13.920> edge<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.310> buck<00:02:14.520> I've<00:02:14.819> created<00:02:15.450> a

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
rounded edge of the buck I've created a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.540 
rounded edge of the buck I've created a
beautiful<00:02:15.930> uniform<00:02:16.770> wheel<00:02:17.280> well<00:02:17.520> opening

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
beautiful uniform wheel well opening

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.790 
beautiful uniform wheel well opening
that<00:02:18.420> would<00:02:18.540> be<00:02:18.690> very<00:02:18.930> difficult<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.440> do<00:02:19.590> any

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
that would be very difficult to do any

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.190 
that would be very difficult to do any
other<00:02:20.010> way<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.580> pulled<00:02:21.239> out<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.390> piece<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.750> 5/8

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.309 
other way I pulled out a piece of 5/8
solid<00:02:22.650> round<00:02:22.860> bar<00:02:23.220> onto<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:24.000> heavyweight<00:02:24.420> now

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
solid round bar onto a heavyweight now

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.470 
solid round bar onto a heavyweight now
I'll<00:02:25.440> use<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:25.920> behind<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.610> flange<00:02:26.910> as<00:02:27.330> I

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
I'll use this behind the flange as I

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:47.540 
I'll use this behind the flange as I
hammer<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.930> edge<00:02:28.110> over<00:02:46.280> we're<00:02:47.280> into<00:02:47.459> the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
homestretch on the fender there's a lot

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.229 
homestretch on the fender there's a lot
of<00:02:49.769> welding<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.220> has<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.640> be<00:02:50.730> done<00:02:50.940> on<00:02:51.120> these

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239

of welding that has to be done on these
long<00:02:51.480> seams<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.350> then<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.799> welds<00:02:53.100> need<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.340> be

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
long seams and then the welds need to be

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.240 
long seams and then the welds need to be
tuned<00:02:53.760> up<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.140> shaping<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.830> metal<00:02:56.130> is

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
tuned up but the shaping of the metal is

pretty much a done deal now it's time to

long weld the first is that consistency
is<00:03:07.140> very<00:03:07.200> important<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.220> want<00:03:08.579> to<00:03:08.910> keep<00:03:09.060> the

the panel will be when I finish the
welding<00:03:21.930> on<00:03:22.109> some<00:03:22.980> panels<00:03:23.400> it's<00:03:23.609> important<00:03:24.030> to

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
welding on some panels it's important to

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.210 
welding on some panels it's important to
skip<00:03:24.390> around<00:03:24.570> as<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.049> will<00:03:25.260> on<00:03:25.620> very<00:03:25.920> flat

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
skip around as you will on very flat

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.880 
skip around as you will on very flat
panels<00:03:26.700> skipping<00:03:27.570> around<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:28.019> bit<00:03:28.200> helps<00:03:28.650> keep

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
panels skipping around a bit helps keep

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.250 
panels skipping around a bit helps keep
the<00:03:29.040> heat<00:03:29.190> down<00:03:29.430> so<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.120> get<00:03:30.359> less<00:03:30.540> distortion

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
the heat down so you get less distortion

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.280 
the heat down so you get less distortion
on<00:03:31.470> this<00:03:32.250> panel<00:03:32.790> everything<00:03:33.630> has<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.140> much

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
on this panel everything has so much

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.560 
on this panel everything has so much
curvature<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:35.400> distortion<00:03:36.030> won't<00:03:36.209> be<00:03:36.390> much

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
curvature that distortion won't be much

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.870 
curvature that distortion won't be much
of<00:03:36.600> an<00:03:36.810> issue<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.680> can<00:03:37.950> simply<00:03:38.340> start<00:03:38.609> at<00:03:38.700> one

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
of an issue so I can simply start at one

a degreaser before I make the finish

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.890 
a degreaser before I make the finish
wells<00:03:53.070> that<00:03:53.910> way<00:03:54.060> I'll<00:03:54.180> be<00:03:54.209> doing<00:03:54.570> everything

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
wells that way I'll be doing everything

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.020 
wells that way I'll be doing everything
I<00:03:55.140> can<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.440> ensure<00:03:55.739> that<00:03:56.070> my<00:03:56.400> welds<00:03:56.760> are<00:03:56.880> very

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
I can to ensure that my welds are very

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.120 
I can to ensure that my welds are very
consistent<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.840> makes<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.560> cleanup<00:03:58.829> of

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
consistent and that makes the cleanup of

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.790 
consistent and that makes the cleanup of
the<00:03:59.220> weld<00:03:59.400> easier<00:03:59.819> as<00:03:59.970> well

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.740 

okay<00:04:04.800> so<00:04:05.580> I've<00:04:05.700> welded<00:04:05.940> all<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.450> fender

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
okay so I've welded all of the fender

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.780 
okay so I've welded all of the fender
now<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.230> all<00:04:07.650> we<00:04:07.680> have<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:07.920> do<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.370> was<00:04:08.460> clean

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
now and all we have to do it I was clean

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.310 
now and all we have to do it I was clean
up<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.120> weld<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:09.510> we'll<00:04:09.660> be<00:04:09.780> done

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
up the weld and we'll be done

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.620 
up the weld and we'll be done
so<00:04:10.980> I<00:04:11.010> was<00:04:11.280> able<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.550> make<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.790> very<00:04:12.090> consistent

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
so I was able to make a very consistent

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.690 
so I was able to make a very consistent
very<00:04:13.020> small<00:04:13.440> weld<00:04:13.740> bead<00:04:14.010> because<00:04:14.220> they<00:04:14.460> had<00:04:14.580> an

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
very small weld bead because they had an

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.910 
very small weld bead because they had an
excellent<00:04:15.090> fit<00:04:15.360> of<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.540> joint<00:04:15.870> I<00:04:16.170> had<00:04:16.769> an

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
excellent fit of the joint I had an

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.590 
excellent fit of the joint I had an
excellent<00:04:17.250> fit<00:04:17.519> of<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.700> joint<00:04:18.000> because<00:04:18.209> I<00:04:18.359> was

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
excellent fit of the joint because I was

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.960 
excellent fit of the joint because I was
careful<00:04:19.019> when<00:04:19.140> I<00:04:19.230> trimmed<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.709> panels<00:04:20.100> it<00:04:20.760> was

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
careful when I trimmed the panels it was

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.550 
careful when I trimmed the panels it was
easy<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.269> trim<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.720> edges<00:04:21.870> accurately

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
easy to trim the edges accurately

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.290 
easy to trim the edges accurately
because<00:04:22.920> I<00:04:22.950> had<00:04:23.160> shaped<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.610> panels<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.120> fit

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
because I had shaped the panels to fit

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.390 
because I had shaped the panels to fit
the<00:04:24.420> buck<00:04:24.630> very<00:04:24.870> carefully<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:26.010> if<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.250> do

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
the buck very carefully so if you do

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.940 
the buck very carefully so if you do
every<00:04:26.760> step<00:04:27.090> as<00:04:27.300> well<00:04:27.480> as<00:04:27.660> you<00:04:27.780> can<00:04:28.140> it<00:04:28.680> makes

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
every step as well as you can it makes

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.670 
every step as well as you can it makes
the<00:04:29.160> next<00:04:29.340> step<00:04:29.640> down<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:30.000> road<00:04:30.030> easier<00:04:30.680> so

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
the next step down the road easier so

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.620 
the next step down the road easier so
let's<00:04:32.010> get<00:04:32.220> on<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.640> finish<00:04:33.030> work<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.510> it

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
let's get on to the finish work and it

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.030 
let's get on to the finish work and it
won't<00:04:33.780> be<00:04:33.900> long<00:04:34.110> until<00:04:34.140> we<00:04:34.560> have<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.740> complete

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
won't be long until we have a complete

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.990 
won't be long until we have a complete
fender

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.430 

okay<00:04:39.000> so<00:04:39.060> I've<00:04:39.390> gone<00:04:39.540> over<00:04:39.600> all<00:04:39.990> of<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.260> weld

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
okay so I've gone over all of the weld

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.890 
okay so I've gone over all of the weld
area<00:04:40.830> with<00:04:41.010> 80<00:04:41.220> grit<00:04:41.340> first<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:42.600> I've<00:04:42.720> just

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
area with 80 grit first and I've just

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.020 
area with 80 grit first and I've just
now<00:04:43.080> gone<00:04:43.350> over<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:43.740> with<00:04:43.950> 180<00:04:44.430> grit<00:04:44.670> just<00:04:44.940> to

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
now gone over that with 180 grit just to

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.760 
now gone over that with 180 grit just to
give<00:04:45.180> it<00:04:45.270> a<00:04:45.330> bit<00:04:45.510> more<00:04:45.720> shine<00:04:45.960> for<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.260> camera

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
give it a bit more shine for the camera

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.880 
give it a bit more shine for the camera
so<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.520> fender<00:04:47.910> is<00:04:48.090> just<00:04:48.510> about<00:04:48.840> done<00:04:48.900> the

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
so the fender is just about done the

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.770 
so the fender is just about done the
last<00:04:50.130> step<00:04:50.460> is<00:04:50.640> to<00:04:50.670> lay<00:04:50.970> out<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.420> drill<00:04:51.630> the

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
last step is to lay out and drill the

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.870 
last step is to lay out and drill the
mounting<00:04:52.140> holes<00:04:52.410> and<00:04:52.830> once<00:04:53.430> that's<00:04:53.670> done

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
mounting holes and once that's done

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.370 
mounting holes and once that's done
we'll<00:04:54.060> compare<00:04:54.480> our<00:04:54.630> new<00:04:54.780> fender<00:04:55.110> with<00:04:55.260> the

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
we'll compare our new fender with the

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.740 
we'll compare our new fender with the
original<00:04:55.800> fender<00:04:56.160> so<00:04:57.120> here's<00:04:57.419> what<00:04:57.630> we

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
original fender so here's what we

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.080 
original fender so here's what we
started<00:04:58.080> with<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.440> original<00:04:58.830> fender<00:04:59.220> and

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
started with the original fender and

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.720 
started with the original fender and
after<00:05:00.390> a<00:05:00.419> bit<00:05:00.630> of<00:05:00.660> work<00:05:01.070> we<00:05:02.070> have<00:05:02.160> arrived<00:05:02.490> at<00:05:02.669> a

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
after a bit of work we have arrived at a

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.300 
after a bit of work we have arrived at a
beautiful<00:05:03.180> recreation<00:05:04.110> of<00:05:04.290> a<00:05:04.830> mirrored<00:05:05.220> image

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
beautiful recreation of a mirrored image

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.510 
beautiful recreation of a mirrored image
of<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:05.700> fender<00:05:06.590> and<00:05:07.590> I<00:05:07.860> think<00:05:08.100> you<00:05:08.220> can<00:05:08.340> see

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
of the fender and I think you can see

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.890 
of the fender and I think you can see
from<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.820> reflected<00:05:09.330> light<00:05:09.480> that<00:05:09.780> the

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
from the reflected light that the

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.080 
from the reflected light that the
contours<00:05:10.440> on<00:05:10.620> this<00:05:10.830> are<00:05:11.010> really<00:05:11.400> excellent

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
contours on this are really excellent

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.750 
contours on this are really excellent
it's<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:13.080> spitting<00:05:13.620> image<00:05:13.770> of<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.280> original

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
it's the spitting image of the original

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.600 
it's the spitting image of the original
fender<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:15.410> again<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:16.590> reason<00:05:16.800> we<00:05:17.220> were<00:05:17.340> able

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
fender and again the reason we were able

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.090 
fender and again the reason we were able
to<00:05:17.640> capture<00:05:17.970> the<00:05:18.210> details<00:05:18.720> so<00:05:19.440> well<00:05:19.740> is

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
to capture the details so well is

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.040 
to capture the details so well is
because<00:05:20.790> of<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.060> careful<00:05:21.510> fitting<00:05:21.810> of<00:05:21.930> the

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
because of the careful fitting of the

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.469 
because of the careful fitting of the
buck<00:05:22.260> that<00:05:22.500> we<00:05:22.620> did<00:05:22.860> so<00:05:23.610> all<00:05:23.820> in<00:05:23.970> all<00:05:24.090> this<00:05:24.270> is<00:05:24.330> a

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
buck that we did so all in all this is a

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.870 
buck that we did so all in all this is a
very<00:05:24.600> challenging<00:05:25.050> project<00:05:25.650> that<00:05:26.460> might<00:05:26.669> be<00:05:26.850> a

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
very challenging project that might be a

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.450 
very challenging project that might be a
bit<00:05:27.150> much<00:05:27.419> for<00:05:27.450> a<00:05:27.720> novice<00:05:28.200> metal<00:05:28.560> worker<00:05:28.770> but

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
bit much for a novice metal worker but

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.370 
bit much for a novice metal worker but
on<00:05:29.580> the<00:05:29.700> other<00:05:29.820> hand<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:30.780> techniques<00:05:31.320> that

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
on the other hand the techniques that

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.500 
on the other hand the techniques that
I've<00:05:31.590> been<00:05:31.770> showing<00:05:32.040> today<00:05:32.460> our<00:05:32.729> time-honored

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
I've been showing today our time-honored

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.870 
I've been showing today our time-honored
techniques<00:05:34.260> and<00:05:34.650> you<00:05:35.190> can<00:05:35.340> use<00:05:35.520> them<00:05:35.700> to<00:05:35.850> make

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
techniques and you can use them to make

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.550 
techniques and you can use them to make
parts<00:05:36.330> of<00:05:36.479> any<00:05:36.630> size<00:05:36.960> and<00:05:37.260> with<00:05:37.350> any

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
parts of any size and with any

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.920 
parts of any size and with any
complexity<00:05:38.100> so<00:05:38.970> I<00:05:39.000> hope<00:05:39.240> you're<00:05:39.419> eager<00:05:39.540> to<00:05:39.690> get

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
complexity so I hope you're eager to get

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.630 
complexity so I hope you're eager to get
into<00:05:40.140> doing<00:05:40.260> metal<00:05:40.560> shaping<00:05:40.979> of<00:05:41.100> this<00:05:41.220> nature

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
into doing metal shaping of this nature

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.120 
into doing metal shaping of this nature
it's<00:05:41.910> really<00:05:42.030> a<00:05:42.300> lot<00:05:42.510> of<00:05:42.660> fun<00:05:42.870> so<00:05:43.650> until<00:05:43.979> next

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130
