at 14 for to get the math right to make
the<00:04:26.950> shadow<00:04:27.190> so<00:04:28.140> we<00:04:29.140> also<00:04:29.290> cut<00:04:29.740> through<00:04:29.980> those

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
the shadow so we also cut through those

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.400 
the shadow so we also cut through those
concrete<00:04:30.610> poles<00:04:31.030> there's<00:04:31.690> two<00:04:31.900> poles<00:04:32.200> they

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
concrete poles there's two poles they

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.370 
concrete poles there's two poles they
take<00:04:32.770> out<00:04:33.010> so<00:04:33.580> he<00:04:33.700> raised<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:34.150> box<00:04:34.420> up<00:04:34.720> here<00:04:34.990> but

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
take out so he raised a box up here but
