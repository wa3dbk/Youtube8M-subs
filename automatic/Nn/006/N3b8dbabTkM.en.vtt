00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
it and what I mean by that is if you was

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.670 
it and what I mean by that is if you was
to<00:01:08.189> copy<00:01:08.850> all<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.390> code<00:01:09.630> from<00:01:10.170> code<00:01:10.470> view

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
to copy all of the code from code view

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.580 
to copy all of the code from code view
into<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> blank<00:01:11.520> HTML<00:01:11.760> document<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:13.260> didn't

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
into a blank HTML document that didn't

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.620 
into a blank HTML document that didn't
have<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> CSS<00:01:14.280> attributes<00:01:14.880> applied<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.479> it

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
have the CSS attributes applied to it

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.719 
have the CSS attributes applied to it
then<00:01:16.110> all<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.590> dibs<00:01:16.860> tanks<00:01:17.549> would

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
then all of the dibs tanks would

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.230 
then all of the dibs tanks would
collapse<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:20.189> what<00:01:20.490> I'm<00:01:20.640> going<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.119> open

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
collapse so what I'm going to do is open

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.280 
collapse so what I'm going to do is open
up<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.689> copy<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.369> this<00:01:23.369> web<00:01:24.060> page<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.750> it's

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
already got the attributes applied to it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.350

for<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.930> CSS<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.860> when<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.009> copy<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.579> all<00:01:29.880> of

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
for the CSS so when I copy it in all of

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.690 
for the CSS so when I copy it in all of
the<00:01:30.479> attributes<00:01:30.600> hopefully<00:01:31.530> we'll<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.280> align

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the attributes hopefully we'll all align

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.560 
the attributes hopefully we'll all align
and<00:01:33.299> all<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> boxes<00:01:34.380> will<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> same<00:01:34.979> way

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
and all the boxes will be the same way

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
and all the boxes will be the same way

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
okay so let's work out what part of the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.200 
okay so let's work out what part of the
code<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.970> need<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.450> copy<00:01:40.159> from<00:01:41.159> code<00:01:41.549> view<00:01:41.820> in
