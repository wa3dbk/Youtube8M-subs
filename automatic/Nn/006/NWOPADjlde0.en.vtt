podcasting sound effects app so you can
right<00:00:23.160> now<00:00:23.189> I'm<00:00:24.180> probably<00:00:25.019> gonna<00:00:25.350> limit<00:00:25.590> to

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
right now I'm probably gonna limit to

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.220 
right now I'm probably gonna limit to
about<00:00:26.010> 20<00:00:26.519> sounds<00:00:26.730> depending<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.869> depending

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
about 20 sounds depending on depending

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.870 
about 20 sounds depending on depending
on<00:00:28.590> how<00:00:28.710> many<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.920> can<00:00:29.099> find<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.519> got<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.730> make

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
on how many I can find I got to make

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.669

uh I've been able to find a good amount
I<00:00:38.250> should<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.520> able<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.670> get<00:00:38.760> 20<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.300> here<00:00:39.510> maybe

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
I should be able to get 20 in here maybe

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.619 
I should be able to get 20 in here maybe
40<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.550> version<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.090> first<00:00:42.360> version

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629

another version I have as navigation on

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.049 
another version I have as navigation on
the<00:00:50.010> bottom<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.370> lets<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.730> go<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the bottom that lets you go to the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.410 
the bottom that lets you go to the
second<00:00:51.390> page<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.809> has<00:00:52.590> more<00:00:53.070> icons<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:54.390> uh

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.560 
second page and has more icons but uh
until<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.500> actually<00:00:55.879> get<00:00:56.879> enough<00:00:57.120> sounds<00:00:57.480> I

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
until I can actually get enough sounds I

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.299 
until I can actually get enough sounds I
might<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:58.050> push<00:00:58.199> out<00:00:58.320> version<00:00:58.559> 1<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.129> only

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
might just push out version 1 with only

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.790 
might just push out version 1 with only
20<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.059> most<00:01:00.840> importantly<00:01:01.230> really<00:01:01.530> all<00:01:01.770> I

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
20 and most importantly really all I

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.850 
20 and most importantly really all I
wanted<00:01:02.129> was<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.309> cowbell<00:01:02.760> I'm<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
wanted was a cowbell I'm going and you

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.899 
wanted was a cowbell I'm going and you
know<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:07.740> maybe<00:01:07.890> some<00:01:08.100> clapping

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.980 

generic<00:01:11.909> silence<00:01:12.210> though<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.420> kind<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.600> cool

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
generic silence though it's kind of cool

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.950 
generic silence though it's kind of cool
so<00:01:13.590> basically<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.189> do<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.490> plug<00:01:14.670> it

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
so basically what you do is you plug it

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.070 
so basically what you do is you plug it
you<00:01:15.960> plug<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:17.009> your<00:01:17.189> mixer<00:01:18.180> which<00:01:18.360> going

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
you plug in to your mixer which going

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.960 
you plug in to your mixer which going
into<00:01:19.350> your<00:01:19.439> mixer<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.070> then<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.670> goes<00:01:20.790> into

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
into your mixer and then it goes into

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.679 
into your mixer and then it goes into
your<00:01:21.150> computer<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.720> you're<00:01:21.960> able<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
your computer and you're able to

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.350 
your computer and you're able to
basically<00:01:24.689> uh<00:01:25.640> hear<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.670> sounds<00:01:27.180> while

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
basically uh hear the sounds while

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.539 
basically uh hear the sounds while
you're<00:01:27.479> recording<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.280> do<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.520> a

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
you're recording so you can do like a

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.190 
you're recording so you can do like a
morning<00:01:29.880> show<00:01:30.090> type<00:01:30.390> thing<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.020> kind<00:01:31.170> of

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
morning show type thing so it's kind of

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.179 
morning show type thing so it's kind of
cool<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:33.829> sound<00:01:34.829> effects

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
cool you can you can do a sound effects

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.770 
cool you can you can do a sound effects
and<00:01:35.340> stuff<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.970> unfortunately<00:01:36.540> my

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
and stuff like that unfortunately my

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.690 
and stuff like that unfortunately my
coding<00:01:37.290> skills<00:01:37.439> are<00:01:37.619> not<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.890> great<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.189> I

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
coding skills are not that great so I

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.210 
coding skills are not that great so I
don't<00:01:39.509> know<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:39.960> could<00:01:40.590> actually<00:01:40.740> make<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
don't know that I could actually make it

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.130 
don't know that I could actually make it
where<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.430> could<00:01:41.579> enter<00:01:42.119> your<00:01:42.450> own<00:01:42.570> sounds<00:01:43.020> in

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
where you could enter your own sounds in

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.950 
where you could enter your own sounds in
here<00:01:43.729> but<00:01:44.729> I'd<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.240> willing<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.840> know

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
here but I'd be willing that you know

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.289 
here but I'd be willing that you know
take<00:01:46.619> requests<00:01:47.070> for<00:01:47.340> future<00:01:47.700> versions<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.210> if

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
take requests for future versions so if

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.999 
take requests for future versions so if
you<00:01:48.360> want<00:01:48.509> some<00:01:48.630> sounds<00:01:48.930> let<00:01:49.049> me<00:01:49.110> know<00:01:49.290> and

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
you want some sounds let me know and

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.280 
you want some sounds let me know and
also<00:01:50.610> uh<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:53.670> limitations<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.750> iPad<00:01:55.140> of

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
also uh the limitations of the iPad of

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.819 
also uh the limitations of the iPad of
getting<00:01:55.590> files<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.469> might<00:01:58.469> be<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.710> little

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
getting files in to it might be a little

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.789 
getting files in to it might be a little
bit<00:01:59.009> too<00:01:59.159> tricky<00:01:59.520> for<00:02:00.350> for<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.619> worth

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
bit too tricky for for it to be worth

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.219 
bit too tricky for for it to be worth
its<00:02:02.009> while<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.640> figured<00:02:02.939> just<00:02:02.969> put<00:02:03.810> twenty

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
its while so I figured just put twenty

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.469 
its while so I figured just put twenty
