all right so the first thing I'm going
to<00:00:01.760> do<00:00:01.880> is<00:00:02.060> I'm<00:00:02.210> going<00:00:02.360> to<00:00:02.480> do<00:00:02.659> take<00:00:02.870> the<00:00:02.990> mask

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:03.199 
to do is I'm going to do take the mask

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:05.170 
to do is I'm going to do take the mask
and<00:00:03.709> take<00:00:04.520> it<00:00:04.609> out<00:00:04.700> and<00:00:04.790> see<00:00:04.940> how<00:00:05.060> it<00:00:05.150> actually

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:05.180 
and take it out and see how it actually

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.160 
and take it out and see how it actually
fits<00:00:05.710> I<00:00:07.030> tried<00:00:08.030> it<00:00:08.180> on<00:00:08.240> at<00:00:08.390> the<00:00:08.450> store<00:00:08.720> actually

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
fits I tried it on at the store actually

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.770 
fits I tried it on at the store actually
I<00:00:09.200> tried<00:00:09.290> a<00:00:09.440> different<00:00:09.620> one<00:00:09.830> on<00:00:09.890> at<00:00:10.100> the<00:00:10.160> store

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
I tried a different one on at the store

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.910 
I tried a different one on at the store
but<00:00:11.780> and<00:00:12.440> I<00:00:12.530> noticed<00:00:13.070> that<00:00:13.190> it<00:00:13.280> was<00:00:14.740> the<00:00:15.740> mouth

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
but and I noticed that it was the mouth

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.760 
but and I noticed that it was the mouth
kind<00:00:16.280> of<00:00:16.430> wasn't<00:00:16.700> in<00:00:16.970> the<00:00:17.090> right<00:00:17.240> spot<00:00:17.540> but<00:00:17.840> and

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
kind of wasn't in the right spot but and

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.050 
kind of wasn't in the right spot but and
so<00:00:18.920> I<00:00:18.950> might<00:00:19.130> have<00:00:19.160> to<00:00:19.340> adjust<00:00:19.400> things<00:00:19.790> I<00:00:19.910> need

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
so I might have to adjust things I need

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.900 
so I might have to adjust things I need
to<00:00:20.090> take<00:00:20.480> this<00:00:20.690> off<00:00:20.870> first<00:00:21.260> and<00:00:21.680> I'll<00:00:22.490> take<00:00:22.760> my

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
to take this off first and I'll take my

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.880 
to take this off first and I'll take my
glasses<00:00:23.150> off<00:00:23.480> to<00:00:23.690> actually<00:00:24.050> put<00:00:24.380> it<00:00:24.500> on<00:00:26.890> let's

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
glasses off to actually put it on let's

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:38.020 
glasses off to actually put it on let's
see<00:00:30.850> how<00:00:31.850> it<00:00:32.000> looks<00:00:32.800> now<00:00:35.140> you<00:00:36.140> can<00:00:36.350> use<00:00:37.030> other

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
see how it looks now you can use other

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.970 
see how it looks now you can use other
masks<00:00:39.040> like<00:00:40.040> there's<00:00:40.310> something<00:00:40.610> that

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
masks like there's something that

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.940 
masks like there's something that
basically<00:00:43.120> go<00:00:44.120> down<00:00:44.149> to<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.570> jaw<00:00:44.809> here<00:00:45.590> or

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
basically go down to the jaw here or

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.580 
basically go down to the jaw here or
just<00:00:46.160> around<00:00:46.430> here<00:00:46.760> don't<00:00:47.270> have<00:00:47.450> a<00:00:47.480> mouth<00:00:47.720> I

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
just around here don't have a mouth I

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.190 
just around here don't have a mouth I
wanted<00:00:49.399> to<00:00:49.520> get<00:00:49.670> one<00:00:49.820> like<00:00:49.970> this<00:00:50.000> mainly<00:00:50.989> so

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
wanted to get one like this mainly so

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.100 
wanted to get one like this mainly so
that<00:00:51.230> I<00:00:51.380> can<00:00:51.910> glue<00:00:52.910> foam<00:00:53.149> across<00:00:53.570> here<00:00:53.870> it

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
that I can glue foam across here it

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.200 
that I can glue foam across here it
gives<00:00:54.230> me<00:00:54.410> a<00:00:54.440> surface<00:00:54.860> to<00:00:54.980> glue<00:00:55.130> all<00:00:55.460> that

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
gives me a surface to glue all that

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.840 
gives me a surface to glue all that
across<00:00:56.480> that's<00:00:56.750> basically<00:00:57.079> my<00:00:57.290> thought<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.370> as

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
across that's basically my thought so as

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.100 
across that's basically my thought so as
you<00:00:59.660> can<00:00:59.780> see<00:01:00.550> when<00:01:01.550> I<00:01:01.670> open<00:01:01.700> my<00:01:01.910> mouth<00:01:02.210> it

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
you can see when I open my mouth it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.719 
you can see when I open my mouth it
doesn't<00:01:03.260> move<00:01:03.469> with<00:01:03.680> it<00:01:04.869> so<00:01:05.869> I<00:01:06.609> think<00:01:07.609> I'm

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
doesn't move with it so I think I'm

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.050 
doesn't move with it so I think I'm
gonna<00:01:07.850> have<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.179> cut<00:01:08.450> it<00:01:08.600> just<00:01:09.729> here<00:01:10.729> I<00:01:10.759> guess

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
gonna have to cut it just here I guess

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.919 
gonna have to cut it just here I guess
start<00:01:12.049> a<00:01:12.670> little<00:01:13.670> bit<00:01:13.909> there<00:01:14.149> and<00:01:14.630> if<00:01:14.749> you<00:01:14.810> can

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
start a little bit there and if you can

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:26.070 
start a little bit there and if you can
even<00:01:14.959> see<00:01:15.520> cut<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.549> little<00:01:16.819> bit<00:01:16.969> I

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.790 

all<00:01:26.680> right<00:01:26.830> I<00:01:27.010> guess<00:01:27.310> that'll<00:01:27.640> work<00:01:28.620> good<00:01:29.620> not

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
all right I guess that'll work good not

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:37.890 
all right I guess that'll work good not
right<00:01:32.100> all<00:01:33.100> right<00:01:34.410> so<00:01:36.360> next<00:01:37.360> thing<00:01:37.510> I<00:01:37.660> got<00:01:37.690> to

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
right all right so next thing I got to

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:46.500 
right all right so next thing I got to
do<00:01:38.080> I'll<00:01:38.860> show<00:01:42.360> since<00:01:43.360> we<00:01:43.600> got<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:44.280> well<00:01:45.510> this

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
do I'll show since we got it well this

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.830 
do I'll show since we got it well this
little<00:01:46.750> phrase<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:48.100> edges<00:01:48.400> here<00:01:48.840> I'm

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
little phrase and the edges here I'm

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.320 
little phrase and the edges here I'm
actually<00:01:50.080> gonna<00:01:50.550> sew<00:01:52.650> these<00:01:53.650> back<00:01:53.950> together

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
actually gonna sew these back together

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.110 
actually gonna sew these back together
around<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.450> edges<00:01:56.820> hopefully<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:58.030> will

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
around the edges hopefully that will

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.080 
around the edges hopefully that will
turn<00:01:58.330> out<00:01:58.540> this<00:01:59.400> this<00:02:00.400> is<00:02:00.640> kind<00:02:00.910> of<00:02:00.970> an

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
turn out this this is kind of an

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.240 
turn out this this is kind of an
experiment<00:02:01.450> but<00:02:01.920> we'll<00:02:02.920> see<00:02:03.220> if<00:02:03.310> it<00:02:03.400> works

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
experiment but we'll see if it works

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.130 
experiment but we'll see if it works
suppose<00:02:06.250> anything<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.610> do<00:02:06.760> is<00:02:07.240> I'm<00:02:07.840> gonna<00:02:07.960> be

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
suppose anything to do is I'm gonna be

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:17.450 
suppose anything to do is I'm gonna be
using<00:02:10.170> what's<00:02:11.170> called<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:14.070> blanket<00:02:15.070> stitch

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.040 

it's<00:02:18.460> not<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.760> prettiest<00:02:19.180> stitch<00:02:19.450> job<00:02:19.750> in<00:02:19.960> the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
it's not the prettiest stitch job in the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:37.000 
it's not the prettiest stitch job in the
world<00:02:20.230> but<00:02:21.030> hopefully<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.090> will<00:02:22.150> hold

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.140 

all<00:02:38.010> right<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:38.520> this<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.240> what<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.630> looks<00:02:39.780> like

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
all right so this is what it looks like

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.590 
all right so this is what it looks like
you<00:02:42.150> can<00:02:42.270> see<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.780> straps<00:02:43.110> move<00:02:44.480> with<00:02:45.480> the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
you can see the straps move with the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.710 
you can see the straps move with the
Joel<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.500> hopefully<00:02:46.800> this<00:02:47.040> works<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:48.240> was<00:02:48.420> kind

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
Joel so hopefully this works it was kind

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.920 
Joel so hopefully this works it was kind
of<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.870> pain<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.080> do<00:02:49.940> but<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.630> know<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.750> guess

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
of a pain to do but you know I guess

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.470 
of a pain to do but you know I guess
we'll<00:02:52.080> find<00:02:52.290> out<00:02:52.410> later<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.790> can't<00:02:54.390> really

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
we'll find out later and I can't really

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.750 
we'll find out later and I can't really
wear<00:02:54.660> my<00:02:54.840> glasses<00:02:55.070> with<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.220> mask<00:02:56.400> on<00:02:56.610> either

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
wear my glasses with the mask on either

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.580 
wear my glasses with the mask on either
so<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.330> don't<00:02:57.810> know<00:02:57.870> what<00:02:58.020> I'll<00:02:58.110> do<00:02:58.200> about<00:02:58.410> that

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
so I don't know what I'll do about that
