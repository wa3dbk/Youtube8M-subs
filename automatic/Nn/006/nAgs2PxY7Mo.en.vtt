00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.340
 at least she's completely wrong 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.720
 the rope from the country 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.370
 little things that does not leave us 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.870
 now hold the rope in his speech he's long been all 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.880
 ranges 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.960
 and fx who played too short 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.260
 how do you judge the tunnel 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.449
 michel granger the accordion europe 1 which revealed the limits of our friends 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.449
 israel 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.200
 firefighters have come out of jail after all the work of a company of 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.790
 political theater and so power 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.750
 for shows 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.310
 jérôme out of granted years I had forgotten everything that play but I 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.370
 have not forgotten so far been the fingers just about everything 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.500
 so I started to confess that I started playing things that there 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.910
 had things that did not interest me 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.680
 to say that I have more than ever while the kids 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.820
 end clap meanwhile a discovery 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.950
 the four editorial teams 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.950
 I pulled fraud corruption but it's good and I like it 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.970
 this gift that will emerge during the research started to play as 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.590
 it 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.460
 among them were agree and expressions like what the rope 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.530
 Bravo 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.470
 ah yes csn source 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.550
 it was unexpected was right 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.850
 insults 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.669
 of course of course where to let life rot 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.619
 it's the gift of the street 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:14.619
 it's the duck 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:24.569
 but then we have a low point 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:25.909
 November 30 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.919
 as regards the market agenda 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.509
 in hat 3 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:31.610
 today 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.249
 not great but that's the name of this storm 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:35.839
 three accessits 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.839
 it is necessary for his passes it is 10 o'clock in the morning 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.159
 between 5 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.669
 sarr cheyen little on the legs to know 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:48.029
 it allows me to be allowed to do my market is closed 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.789
 but it's a pretty good life to make music on the street or 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:54.439
 make shows in the street 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.869
 but whether it works or not it's a pretty nice city in the 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:58.789
 downtown these pretty girls 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:00.499
 and the world 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:03.309
 a lot of luck to stay for some time to do shows 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:05.839
 merchants are respected 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:08.839
 I have never had any problem with traders 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.459
 I was engaged by downstream businesses 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.909
 rather positive so people will be happy to 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.889
 to hear music in order to have ideas 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.889
 live performance music though 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:37.049
 we will end up paying income 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.719
 I think we will eventually come back even if Deschamps prefers to stay at home 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.930
 them or their loved ones of the points we will end up coming back precisely because 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.230
 read 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.999
 to note the most remote 28% 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:48.999
 all political parties 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:54.089
 people they all went home but they were already 300 channels and 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:55.939
 more and more sure 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.779
 it's not really interesting so I think you have 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:00.919
 I think we could see more and more fresh
