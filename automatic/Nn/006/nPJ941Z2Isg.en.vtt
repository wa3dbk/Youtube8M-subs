00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.880
 this is a drinking fountain 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.880
 automatic 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.000
 It's done 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:19.740
 of a water inlet valve of a 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.410
 normal bath tank with his cock 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.640
 a tub where 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.250
 is also in the water 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.780
 a plastic grid 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.660
 it's just the level 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.240
 just tailored as to 42 from 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.270
 depth so that the chicks 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.950
 the smallest if they get to put 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.190
 have the possibility of 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.739
 to go out again 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.739
 because the bucket is more or less deep 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.620
 and three bricks that injure the 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.920
 stands I do not have for animals 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.920
 do not 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.630
 and the water also and keep 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.760
 in all its origins at the same level 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.760
 is fed if it is a 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.080
 this is a water intake valve 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:20.080
 for bathroom water tank 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.030
 of seven eighths if I do not remember 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.400
 you have to use a supply tube to 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.230
 that feed but seven serial medias 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.090
 more easily use only 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.390
 with hector like the one near the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.590
 branch I entrust to the flag 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.590
 in half an inch 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.690
 directly connect faces 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.430
 the advantage also but the advantage 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.560
 additional to using a glass tube is that 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.000
 one can screw and unscrew without 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.720
 major problem 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.160
 the valve with the tub and so go back to 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.160
 do a cleaning every so often 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.610
 chicken swept with the carioca hen 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.610
 fear man 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.400
 and to the extent that they consume the 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.400
 water very down 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.519
 water income becomes warmer 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.870
 refills it to the level 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.569
 indicated 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.090
 right now and it is saved again once 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.620
 again returns to buoy this 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.620
 way one forgets completely 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.110
 to be ex providing water to these 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.110
 animals 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.470
 in this chicken coop 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.470
 the young 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.599
 to carry today I give myself two chickens that 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.599
 they are playing 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.850
 and there are other children 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.090
 the funds of two more hens that are 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:59.780
 incubating 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.780
 under that bench there is another drinking fountain 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.880
 more artisan much much simpler and 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:12.200
 economic where are two bottles 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.990
 inverted sharp of the peak I do not know if 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.400
 of that they approach to know they supported with the 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.510
 peak by two tubes two pieces of tubes 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.000
 bored just at the level at which one 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.370
 he wants the water to come and at the same time 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.120
 level at which the peaks should be 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.120
 of these bottles 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.300
 that the water is going down 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.610
 up to the level indicated by the peak 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.320
 and it stays there until the animals 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:48.250
 they are still living as they go 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:50.020
 drinking water working from the bottle 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.380
 the disadvantages of this system from 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.380
 what 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.849
 say water container not 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.560
 keeps very clean we use here is 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.760
 keeps cleaner because apart from being 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.760
 more water 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.510
 with the grid somehow it 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.459
 insert 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.479
 that is to say that a little the particles 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.479
 thick in the background 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.640
 The advantage of the day is that 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.620
 much less water is spent because it 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.620
 prevents more breathing 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.180
 the disadvantage is that every so often 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.669
 that women change 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.039
 but are these days or seconds 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.669
 bottles for our chickens last longer 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.669
 or less 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.170
 about four days 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.840
 I do want this to be personally or 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.300
 until the bottom of the latina is given 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.770
 following much much earth much mud 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.770
 very dirty rating 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.270
 and now he wants more investment like that 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:13.260
 It is not equal costs more than two bottles 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.780
 and the hose with the connectors for their 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.380
 partners 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.380
 no way
