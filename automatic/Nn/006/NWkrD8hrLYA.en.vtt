00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.980
 hello how are you and welcome 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.329
 again to my channel and in this video 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.000
 what we are going to do in pointing out a 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.279
 little turtle that I bought makes me 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.590
 it seems that about three years ago 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.260
 months or four that I have it and I'm going to 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.900
 teach the turtle and what it takes 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.610
 to take care of her then what are we going to 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.420
 do is here what I have are about 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.640
 little boats that are those of food and 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.110
 as you see, sorry to move the camera and 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.079
 As you can see, there are two products that are 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.129
 pretty good from a well-known brand 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.620
 now you see here is the same as 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.230
 teach this that I have here back that is 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.109
 of water because it is the same as these 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.519
 marks this in stores what happens 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.399
 that many times what they are going to sell are 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.750
 rather you're here that we're going to see 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.610
 if they go with signal 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.270
 they're kind of mega you're me 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.640
 here it looks good 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.170
 here you see are the small areas that 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.960
 this tells us that what you have to give 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.360
 when they are little but this does not have 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.479
 the necessary vitamins like this one 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.829
 here that also puts it is to focus what 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.960
 complete food for all 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.310
 aquatic turtles clear this case is 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.819
 an aquatic turtle that by the way I 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:35.289
 have said is a Chinese of my backhand and a 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:37.899
 Chinese pond turtle and it's three loins now 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.969
 I will teach more ahead and some here 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.399
 I'll let you see where you put it if 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.500
 I can focus it if you want for the 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.899
 video and you can read for what it takes 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.429
 but it is very complete especially 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.530
 vitamin that this is very good for 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.450
 turtles because of the edema issue 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.939
 eyelid and all these diseases 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.950
 what do they do that the turtle 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.020
 sick and we do not have to spend 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.939
 money on products that are more expensive 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.450
 for not buying this that seems to me 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.729
 cost 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.490
 well if you put it around here I do not think 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.619
 that cost me three euros or so 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.060
 that this is the most what would be needed 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.800
 to feed them 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.480
 next question then what would make us 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.430
 lack is what I already did in a video 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.750
 above if not if you have not seen you 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.370
 I encourage you to see that I also have it 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.020
 in the channel in this product that what 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.480
 is to eliminate the chlorine and leave the 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.920
 perfect post water for both fish 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.920
 as for turtles we go animals 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.650
 aquatic so this very good is very 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.780
 advisable to have it and the following would be 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.580
 Well, here you see it, although I'm going to try 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.780
 expand it to see if we're not going to see if 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.989
 I'm going to lose a little bit of quality but 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.540
 good good here you see basically this 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.180
 it's a thermometer that what it does is 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.010
 measuring the temperature of the water is obvious and 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.299
 the next thing that is needed would be a 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.860
 thermos heated what happens that like 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.170
 right now it's very hot 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.840
 I do not have what it does is regulate the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.970
 temperature to water at the temperature that 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.410
 you want we are going to put 28 then more or 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.690
 least I would have to give about 28 here in the 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.849
 thermometer and the following thing would be a 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.319
 filter that what we would be worth is for 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.420
 keep the water clean this is a 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.140
 very basic filter 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.540
 it's a marina of 25 teams already when 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.940
 you go to tend to put you see keeps the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.810
 crystal clear water and here you can see it 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:23.349
 puts the liters that is capable of cleaning 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.459
 this filter and here it takes everything 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.560
 what it would take to maintain it 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.120
 clean that not next put you look what 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.130
 that cost me 612 euros is not very expensive 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.190
 but it's not very expensive for everything 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.720
 take because look here put three in one 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.970
 this filter is very well the truth that 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.739
 for what it cost me and well there are also 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.170
 spare parts that are very cheap that already 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.180
 each one this waterfall and since by 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.980
 here the water of the catch here I'm going 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.739
 to pull up and so making a 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.989
 cycle a cleaning cycle so let's go 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.870
 to leave it here and I'm going to teach the 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.430
 little turtle that what interests not good 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.530
 and here we can see little turtles and 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.530
 I get to focus achieved 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.120
 here you have here are the eyes is 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.860
 tiny little measure more or less 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.810
 we have half 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.569
 about 45 centimeters the level of the heart 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.549
 is well focused 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.340
 is obviously hidden from fear 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.109
 like all the little turtles we know and 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.990
 here we see to see if with that if 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.160
 I can teach it, you can see it concretely 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.880
 the three loins are going to see 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.550
 good here they look 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.900
 more or less we can see the turtle how 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.910
 is 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.710
 and one thing that is inhabited say before 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.630
 is that the turtles also like 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.539
 food have eat live food already 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.880
 be crickets have drunk another honey 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.610
 because you look, he eats everything and 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.320
 well here you can see that it has 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.150
 managed to focus a little more already 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.820
 you see that it is super active and that 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.110
 means health, so if you do not see it 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.530
 that moves a lot and nothing that is that 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.390
 there is a little problem so it is now 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.360
 you can see here 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.100
 and here I leave you with your new habitat that 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.820
 As you can see, it's a lot bigger 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.340
 that the one who was 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.040
 when I made the video then it happens that 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.900
 I just had to make the change 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.810
 all equipment then look to explain the 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.280
 video what I was going to do is that 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.920
 had space let's say for the area 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.420
 I was here because they left him free before 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.240
 to put the new tortuguera but as 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.010
 You see, I already have the waterfall filter here 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.110
 working perfectly the water is 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.180
 super clean this for the crap that 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.370
 there is a little bit of the very filthy look 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.280
 here we have it 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.680
 for me 2a and good up here the video 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.080
