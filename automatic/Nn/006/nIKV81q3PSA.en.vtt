00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
who's really the purest winger that they

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.160 
who's really the purest winger that they
have<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.699> they<00:00:56.969> could<00:00:57.180> use<00:00:57.360> these<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.960> could

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
have so they could use these you could

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.810 
have so they could use these you could
they<00:00:58.469> could<00:00:58.620> use<00:00:58.770> help<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.489> think<00:00:59.699> both

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
they could use help and I think both

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.630 
they could use help and I think both
these<00:01:00.000> players<00:01:00.300> could<00:01:01.230> fit<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.770> nicely<00:01:01.980> at<00:01:02.219> the

potentially more big names to come I

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.679 
potentially more big names to come I
don't<00:01:11.189> think<00:01:11.340> these<00:01:11.520> are<00:01:11.790> necessarily<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
don't think these are necessarily the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.620 
don't think these are necessarily the

big names but which of these two players
do<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.619> think<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.220> more<00:01:17.250> serviceable<00:01:17.939> for

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
do you think is more serviceable for

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.310 
do you think is more serviceable for
Toronto<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.570> they<00:01:18.659> had<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.840> pick<00:01:18.990> between<00:01:19.020> the

Toronto if they had to pick between the
two<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.680> think<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.369> pick<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.700> take
