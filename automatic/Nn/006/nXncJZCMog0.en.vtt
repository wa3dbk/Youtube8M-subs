if<00:00:00.390> you've<00:00:00.599> got<00:00:00.810> an<00:00:00.930> x<00:00:01.110> and<00:00:01.350> y<00:00:01.500> chromosome<00:00:02.250> with

if you've got an x and y chromosome with
the<00:00:02.820> resultant<00:00:03.300> hairy<00:00:03.600> chest<00:00:04.049> it's<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.620> pretty

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
the resultant hairy chest it's a pretty

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.559 
the resultant hairy chest it's a pretty
good<00:00:04.980> bet<00:00:05.220> that<00:00:05.250> you<00:00:05.520> fancied<00:00:06.060> yourself<00:00:06.180> at

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
good bet that you fancied yourself at

good bet that you fancied yourself at
the<00:00:06.660> controls<00:00:07.049> of<00:00:07.230> one<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.589> these<00:00:07.799> things<00:00:08.130> and

the controls of one of these things and

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.970 
the controls of one of these things and
it's<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.300> pretty<00:00:09.510> safe<00:00:09.750> bet<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.620> closest

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
it's a pretty safe bet that the closest

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.890 
it's a pretty safe bet that the closest
you'll<00:00:11.160> ever<00:00:11.280> get<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.150> computer<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:12.840> a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
tissue from the rats cortex so if you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.380 
tissue from the rats cortex so if you

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
bit of that tissue and we digest it with

bit of that tissue and we digest it with
an<00:01:20.939> enzyme<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.720> essentially<00:01:22.380> give<00:01:22.590> us<00:01:22.740> the

computer<00:02:08.030> if<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:09.180> send<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> wrong<00:02:09.660> signals

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
computer if they send the wrong signals

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.930 
computer if they send the wrong signals
then<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.460> happens<00:02:12.770> but<00:02:13.770> with<00:02:13.950> time<00:02:14.220> the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
then this happens but with time the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.090 
then this happens but with time the
neurons<00:02:15.390> manage<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.930> form<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.230> network<00:02:16.500> that

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
neurons manage to form a network that

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.070 
neurons manage to form a network that
will<00:02:17.160> react<00:02:17.580> correctly<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.600> incoming

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
will react correctly to the incoming

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.270 
will react correctly to the incoming
signals<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.580> keep<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.060> plane<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.690> air

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
signals and so keep the plane in the air

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.260 
signals and so keep the plane in the air
I<00:02:23.280> can<00:02:23.640> fly

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
I can fly

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.290 
I can fly
in<00:02:24.960> fact<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.800> mini<00:02:26.100> brain<00:02:26.370> can<00:02:26.580> get<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:27.060> good

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
in fact this mini brain can get so good

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.540 
in fact this mini brain can get so good
that<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.959> can<00:02:28.110> negotiate<00:02:28.380> mountain<00:02:29.130> ranges

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
that it can negotiate mountain ranges

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.550 
that it can negotiate mountain ranges
and<00:02:29.760> thunderstorms<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.690> best<00:02:30.990> top<00:02:31.320> guns

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
and thunderstorms like the best top guns

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.280 
and thunderstorms like the best top guns
around<00:02:32.330> they<00:02:33.330> think<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.690> most<00:02:33.900> enjoyable

part<00:02:34.770> about<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.880> particular<00:02:36.630> experiment

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
part about that particular experiment

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.170 
part about that particular experiment
was<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.040> fact<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.750> could<00:02:39.959> take<00:02:41.180> you

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
was the fact that you could take you

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.199 
was the fact that you could take you
know<00:02:42.209> collection<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.990> neurons<00:02:43.380> who<00:02:44.340> didn't

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
know collection of neurons who didn't

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.690 
know collection of neurons who didn't
know<00:02:45.270> how<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.420> do<00:02:45.630> anything<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.380> then<00:02:47.190> provide

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
know how to do anything and then provide

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.420 
know how to do anything and then provide
inputs<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.870> over<00:02:49.140> time<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.950> could<00:02:50.160> learn

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
inputs so that over time it could learn

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.360 
inputs so that over time it could learn
to<00:02:50.700> do<00:02:50.850> something<00:02:51.300> right<00:02:52.020> so<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.680> end<00:02:52.860> you

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
to do something right so in the end you

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.479 
to do something right so in the end you

at a cellular level

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.820 
at a cellular level
so<00:03:15.209> perhaps<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.810> future<00:03:16.380> when<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> real

so perhaps in the future when a real

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.370 
so perhaps in the future when a real
pilot<00:03:17.190> does<00:03:17.489> this<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.450> gets<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.870> dunk<00:03:19.110> on<00:03:19.260> the
