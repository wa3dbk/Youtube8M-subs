through August and everything and I was
approached<00:00:48.149> by<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:49.289> Timberwolves<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.010> started

approached by the Timberwolves I started

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.040 
approached by the Timberwolves I started

the<00:00:52.170> situation<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.070> thought<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.670> it's

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
the situation and I just thought it it's

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.389 
the situation and I just thought it it's
a<00:00:54.270> good<00:00:54.480> young<00:00:54.660> team<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.500> thought<00:00:56.219> it'd<00:00:56.309> be

a good young team and I thought it'd be

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.549 
a good young team and I thought it'd be
a<00:00:56.430> good<00:00:56.579> opportunity<00:00:57.079> what<00:00:58.079> excites<00:00:58.440> you

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
about this team looking at obviously the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.770 
about this team looking at obviously the
the<00:01:01.530> owner<00:01:01.859> Glen<00:01:02.219> Taylor<00:01:02.489> David<00:01:03.030> Kahn<00:01:03.239> also<00:01:03.660> in

town<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.970> got<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.810> think<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.080> some<00:01:07.260> things<00:01:07.290> that

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590

philosophy<00:01:49.470> with<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.189> team<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.790> has<00:01:51.060> that

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
philosophy with the team that has that

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.359 
philosophy with the team that has that
talent<00:01:51.600> there<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:52.560> needs<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:52.950> extra

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
talent there but just needs that extra

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.060 
talent there but just needs that extra
step<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.270> take<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.689> next<00:01:54.930> level<00:01:55.070> well

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
step to take it to that next level well

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.789 
step to take it to that next level well
we<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.460> find<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.759> way<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.869> figure<00:01:58.409> out<00:01:58.619> how

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
we have to find a way to figure out how

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.249 
we have to find a way to figure out how
we're<00:01:58.979> going<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.250> succeed<00:01:59.610> as<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.880> team<00:02:00.079> at<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
we're going to succeed as a team at the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.810 
we're going to succeed as a team at the
offensive<00:02:01.770> end<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.009> think<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.399> they<00:02:02.549> showed

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
offensive end I think that they showed

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.130 
offensive end I think that they showed
last<00:02:03.060> year<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.540> they<00:02:03.659> can<00:02:03.840> score<00:02:04.110> points

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
last year that they can score points

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.039 
last year that they can score points
they've<00:02:04.920> got<00:02:05.130> some<00:02:06.090> good<00:02:06.299> offensive<00:02:06.659> players

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
they've got some good offensive players

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.859 
they've got some good offensive players
they<00:02:07.500> they<00:02:07.890> were<00:02:07.970> they<00:02:08.970> got<00:02:09.149> better<00:02:09.390> as<00:02:09.599> year

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
they they were they got better as year

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.350 
they they were they got better as year
went<00:02:10.080> on<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.069> defensive<00:02:11.790> end<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.120> we<00:02:12.209> got

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
went on it's a defensive end that we got

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.619 
went on it's a defensive end that we got
to<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.599> more<00:02:12.780> consistent

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
to be more consistent

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.619 
to be more consistent
we<00:02:13.840> have<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.170> find<00:02:14.409> a<00:02:14.530> way<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.709> defend<00:02:15.219> better

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
we have to find a way to defend better

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.569 
we have to find a way to defend better
cut<00:02:16.629> down<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.019> easy<00:02:17.170> baskets<00:02:17.859> and<00:02:18.129> it's<00:02:18.400> just

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
cut down the easy baskets and it's just

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.129 
cut down the easy baskets and it's just
going<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.819> take<00:02:19.030> hard<00:02:19.299> work<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.719> I<00:02:19.780> think<00:02:19.840> each

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:20.139 
going to take hard work and I think each

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.470 
going to take hard work and I think each
one<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.590> players<00:02:20.829> I<00:02:21.219> really<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.329> make

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
one of the players I really have to make

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.869 
one of the players I really have to make
it<00:02:22.540> commitment<00:02:23.230> not<00:02:23.349> only<00:02:23.409> to<00:02:23.739> guard<00:02:24.700> their

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
it commitment not only to guard their

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.179 
it commitment not only to guard their
own<00:02:25.030> guy<00:02:25.239> but<00:02:25.569> be<00:02:25.840> part<00:02:26.139> of<00:02:26.260> five<00:02:26.620> guys<00:02:26.889> out

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
own guy but be part of five guys out

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.190 
own guy but be part of five guys out
there<00:02:27.219> working<00:02:27.579> together<00:02:27.849> you<00:02:28.840> don't<00:02:28.989> win

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
there working together you don't win

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.750 
there working together you don't win
this<00:02:29.379> league<00:02:29.590> unless<00:02:29.859> you<00:02:30.010> make<00:02:30.189> stops<00:02:30.519> down

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
this league unless you make stops down

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.339 
this league unless you make stops down
the<00:02:30.909> stretch<00:02:31.180> when<00:02:31.480> they<00:02:31.629> keep<00:02:31.870> time<00:02:32.079> to<00:02:32.260> the

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
the stretch when they keep time to the

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.289 
the stretch when they keep time to the
game<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.859> they<00:02:33.370> struggle<00:02:33.819> with<00:02:33.909> that<00:02:34.030> last

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
game and they struggle with that last

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.479

year<00:02:34.599> looking<00:02:35.290> back<00:02:35.500> also<00:02:35.709> at<00:02:36.129> some<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.430> the

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
year looking back also at some of the

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.559 
year looking back also at some of the
teams<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:36.819> you've<00:02:36.939> coach<00:02:37.150> you've<00:02:37.420> had

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
teams that you've coach you've had

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.110

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
players in that post position and moved

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.789 
players in that post position and moved

up to the high posts and helped that

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.129 
up to the high posts and helped that
offense<00:02:42.280> really<00:02:42.519> move<00:02:42.819> smoothly<00:02:43.209> that's

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:44.139 
offense really move smoothly that's

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:45.449 
offense really move smoothly that's
something<00:02:44.560> that<00:02:44.680> probably<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.099> Timberwolves

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
something that probably the Timberwolves

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.369 
something that probably the Timberwolves
fans<00:02:45.639> can<00:02:45.879> look<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.329> this<00:02:46.540> upcoming<00:02:47.019> season

well<00:02:47.980> we've<00:02:48.700> developed<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.239> system<00:02:49.629> I<00:02:49.719> think

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
well we've developed the system I think

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.069 
well we've developed the system I think
that<00:02:50.310> we<00:02:51.310> use<00:02:51.549> we<00:02:51.969> use<00:02:52.000> our<00:02:52.329> big<00:02:52.510> guys<00:02:52.689> a<00:02:52.750> lot

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
that we use we use our big guys a lot

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.009 
that we use we use our big guys a lot
around<00:02:53.199> the<00:02:53.530> elbow<00:02:53.889> we<00:02:54.159> use<00:02:54.340> in<00:02:54.549> as<00:02:55.209> you<00:02:55.900> know

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
around the elbow we use in as you know

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.679 
around the elbow we use in as you know
people<00:02:56.500> that<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.650> can<00:02:56.859> go<00:02:57.040> through<00:02:57.400> but<00:02:58.389> you

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
people that you can go through but you

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.599 
people that you can go through but you
have<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.989> tweak<00:02:59.260> with<00:02:59.560> each<00:02:59.739> team<00:03:00.069> and<00:03:00.340> within

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
have to tweak with each team and within

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.179 
have to tweak with each team and within
until<00:03:01.299> we<00:03:01.480> get<00:03:01.629> these<00:03:01.840> guys<00:03:02.019> in<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.349> court<00:03:02.620> we

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
until we get these guys in the court we

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.220 
until we get these guys in the court we
have<00:03:03.430> ideas<00:03:03.669> on<00:03:04.090> what<00:03:04.239> we<00:03:04.299> think<00:03:04.659> we<00:03:04.870> can<00:03:05.049> do

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
have ideas on what we think we can do

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.080 
have ideas on what we think we can do
it's<00:03:05.769> a<00:03:05.889> matter<00:03:06.099> of<00:03:06.189> finding<00:03:06.579> out<00:03:06.699> what<00:03:06.909> they

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
it's a matter of finding out what they

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.179 
it's a matter of finding out what they
really<00:03:07.120> can<00:03:07.599> do<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:07.959> then<00:03:08.079> when<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.709> find<00:03:08.980> out

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
really can do and then when you find out

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.890 
really can do and then when you find out
where<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.519> skills<00:03:09.849> are<00:03:10.120> then<00:03:10.419> you<00:03:10.540> have<00:03:10.750> to

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
where the skills are then you have to

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.929 
where the skills are then you have to
try<00:03:11.139> to<00:03:11.169> develop<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.829> system<00:03:12.069> that<00:03:12.430> takes

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
try to develop the system that takes

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.610 
try to develop the system that takes
advantage<00:03:13.419> of<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:13.569> where<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.049> players<00:03:14.290> see

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
advantage of that where the players see

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.439 
advantage of that where the players see
you<00:03:14.799> know<00:03:14.919> they<00:03:15.099> can<00:03:15.250> be<00:03:15.280> successful<00:03:16.000> in<00:03:16.389> your

the philosophy that I don't know what
went<00:03:42.220> on<00:03:42.310> in<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.609> past<00:03:42.879> with<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.180> player<00:03:43.509> or

another coach or another team I'm only
concerned<00:03:47.799> with<00:03:47.919> what<00:03:48.129> happens<00:03:48.430> day<00:03:48.639> one

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849

between<00:03:49.239> us<00:03:49.449> and<00:03:50.109> I<00:03:50.169> think<00:03:50.290> that's<00:03:50.620> the

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
between us and I think that's the

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.619 
between us and I think that's the
philosophy<00:03:50.919> I've<00:03:51.370> always<00:03:51.639> tried<00:03:51.849> to<00:03:51.909> use<00:03:52.299> and

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
philosophy I've always tried to use and

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.110 
philosophy I've always tried to use and
again<00:03:53.109> and<00:03:53.560> you<00:03:53.979> have<00:03:54.009> to<00:03:54.340> find<00:03:54.579> a<00:03:54.729> way<00:03:54.909> for

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
again and you have to find a way for

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.089 
again and you have to find a way for
those<00:03:55.239> players<00:03:55.629> to<00:03:55.810> believe<00:03:56.199> that<00:03:56.650> they<00:03:56.889> can

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
those players to believe that they can

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.129 
those players to believe that they can
be<00:03:57.129> successful<00:03:57.430> not<00:03:58.000> only<00:03:58.060> individually<00:03:58.810> as<00:03:59.109> a
