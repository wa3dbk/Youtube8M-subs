 and let it be a 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.069
 turning women into objects we have created two dimensions 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.069
 inna in objects in perspective 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:13.249

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:54.779
 detachments and how we want them 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.900

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.089

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.479
 dragging then we go to create 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:47.769
 normally wing this star and you will see that automatically 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:54.019
 but it was created inna in perspective so we didn't need to 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.059
 distort or otherwise act on this pin 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:01.099
 now let's select the tool 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.809

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:06.029
 che aum 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:11.589
 but it will allow us to be able to move to this object we see created 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:15.909
 in making itself anyway that this remains in perspective 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.340
 in fact if you see if mine but move becomes smaller 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.759
 as we move to the left 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.870
 and for sale it will become bigger hahaha 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.730
 then we will bring it now 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.479
 omitted right 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.729

 and of the abruzzi a 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.499
 another possible to go to add a window that does not cast anyway 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:19.060
 I call it already drawn or simply with object mar a2 dimensions 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.339
 IDEAM 

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:25.369

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:29.199
 select the connaught windjet 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.409
 to which the face on which we want to go to work in this case 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:34.689
 pacciani between 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:37.990
 panama select this shape 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.969
 always with 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.330
 to with this new selection tool we go along with it 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.219
 sorel no elite object 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:50.219
 helping with we are with the grids 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:51.670
 to the position I love 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.839
 you want to learn verbal we want

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.949
 perspective yeah 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:13.710
 who and therefore as you see anal was say very simple 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.370
 to realize this however this design use these tools 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:22.200
 d therefore with a little practice 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.290
 it will also be possible to make very complex drawings 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.000
 anna like the one you see l
