ground<00:00:07.460> I<00:00:08.090> found<00:00:09.050> it<00:00:09.170> this<00:00:09.260> morning<00:00:10.600> as<00:00:11.600> I<00:00:11.780> was

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:11.810 
ground I found it this morning as I was

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.570

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
walking in the woods and it still has

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.880 
walking in the woods and it still has
fluid<00:00:17.000> inside<00:00:17.330> so<00:00:17.929> I'm<00:00:18.169> gonna<00:00:18.289> wash<00:00:18.589> it<00:00:18.769> out

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
fluid inside so I'm gonna wash it out

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.749 
fluid inside so I'm gonna wash it out
let<00:00:19.279> it<00:00:19.310> dry<00:00:19.609> and<00:00:19.880> test<00:00:20.689> it<00:00:20.810> but<00:00:20.960> first<00:00:21.759> because

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
let it dry and test it but first because

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.630 
let it dry and test it but first because
I<00:00:23.089> haven't<00:00:23.359> even<00:00:23.720> tried<00:00:24.439> to<00:00:26.169> well<00:00:27.249> wheel<00:00:28.249> turns

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640

it's<00:00:29.599> full<00:00:29.810> of<00:00:29.929> mud<00:00:30.109> so<00:00:30.399> I'm<00:00:31.399> gonna<00:00:31.550> have<00:00:31.819> to

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
it's full of mud so I'm gonna have to

00:00:31.849 --> 00:01:06.020 
it's full of mud so I'm gonna have to
probably<00:00:32.689> take<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:33.140> safety<00:00:33.500> off

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.250 

I<00:01:06.890> was<00:01:07.890> getting<00:01:08.220> ready<00:01:08.370> to<00:01:08.610> take<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.940> apart

using<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.620> all<00:01:10.800> on<00:01:11.310> my<00:01:11.660> swiss<00:01:12.660> knife<00:01:14.000> because

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
using the all on my swiss knife because

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.430 
using the all on my swiss knife because
it<00:01:15.030> dried<00:01:15.450> out<00:01:15.770> really<00:01:16.770> fast<00:01:17.720> but<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.990> couldn't

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440

depress<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.040> button<00:01:20.190> here<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.240> guess<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.780> had<00:01:21.930> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
depress the button here I guess it had a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.900 
depress the button here I guess it had a
lot<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.490> dirt<00:01:23.490> stuck<00:01:24.479> underneath<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:26.729> would

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
lot of dirt stuck underneath it it would

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.390 
lot of dirt stuck underneath it it would
spark<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.600> add<00:01:28.140> something<00:01:28.440> and<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.190> hear

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
spark and add something and you can hear

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.510 
spark and add something and you can hear
