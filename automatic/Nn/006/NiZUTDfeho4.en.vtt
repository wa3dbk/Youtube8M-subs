00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.650
 we test badger pulsar 200 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:20.359
 the most interesting thing is that he has an engine 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.560
 almost the same as on cdm dyk carter and 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.840
 the bottom of the cylinder remained 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.220
 only the head of the block changed 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.669
 and release the whole machine is made on the same 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.520
 the factory itself so that youtube in the head 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.700
 cylinder now three candles three 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.170
 ignition which allows 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:45.870

 maximum power and better expectations 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.710

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.739
 kilometers is a terrific figure
