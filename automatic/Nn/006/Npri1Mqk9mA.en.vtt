time of surgery then it's going to fall
on<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.550> physicians<00:04:25.360> shoulders<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.230> that's

on the physicians shoulders and that's

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.220 
on the physicians shoulders and that's
not<00:04:26.980> very<00:04:27.430> fair<00:04:27.730> either<00:04:28.030> I<00:04:28.180> don't<00:04:28.360> think<00:04:28.600> and

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
not very fair either I don't think and

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.440 
not very fair either I don't think and
so<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:30.070> mostly<00:04:30.370> women<00:04:30.640> this<00:04:30.880> will<00:04:31.060> affect<00:04:31.330> that
