00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
could gank becomes a gank someone early

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.420 
could gank becomes a gank someone early
on<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.659> very<00:01:07.170> beginning<00:01:07.470> because<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.040> stuns

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
on like very beginning because it stuns

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.640 
on like very beginning because it stuns
it<00:01:08.580> for<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> good<00:01:09.060> two<00:01:09.900> seconds<00:01:10.350> i<00:01:10.380> believe

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
it for like a good two seconds i believe

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.969 
it for like a good two seconds i believe

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
last tier and this is up to this like

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.899 
last tier and this is up to this like
it's<00:01:34.229> auto<00:01:34.409> attack<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.400> auto<00:01:35.579> attack

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
it's auto attack so this auto attack

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.940 
it's auto attack so this auto attack
