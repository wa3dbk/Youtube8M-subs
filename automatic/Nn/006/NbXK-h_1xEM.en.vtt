cook so much bacon I decided that I

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.980 
cook so much bacon I decided that I
would<00:02:17.430> actually<00:02:17.580> try<00:02:18.090> different<00:02:18.480> cooking

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
would actually try different cooking

would actually try different cooking
methods<00:02:19.520> I<00:02:20.520> did<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.090> on<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.240> stovetop<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:22.970> let

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
next pile on top here I did on medium

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.930 
next pile on top here I did on medium
heat<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> little<00:02:44.130> hard<00:02:44.400> cooked<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.790> lot

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
heat so a little hard cooked a lot

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.610 
heat so a little hard cooked a lot
faster<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.630> honestly<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.200> looks<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.470> little

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
faster and honestly it looks a little

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.850 
faster and honestly it looks a little
short<00:02:47.310> like<00:02:47.550> not<00:02:47.700> charred<00:02:48.150> but<00:02:48.650> crunchy<00:02:49.650> like

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
crunchy that's a way to go but then I

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.560 
crunchy that's a way to go but then I
decided<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.610> also<00:02:53.760> do<00:02:54.120> it

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
decided to also do it

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.000 
decided to also do it
microwaved<00:02:55.550> because<00:02:56.550> I've<00:02:56.760> never<00:02:57.030> done<00:02:57.180> it

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010

bunch<00:04:07.079> of<00:04:07.260> shredded<00:04:07.560> cheese<00:04:07.980> so<00:04:08.340> we're<00:04:08.459> just

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
bunch of shredded cheese so we're just

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.179 
bunch of shredded cheese so we're just
gonna<00:04:08.760> get<00:04:09.480> these<00:04:09.659> all<00:04:09.930> toasty<00:04:10.469> and<00:04:10.650> then

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
we'll proceed with the rest of the

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.629 
we'll proceed with the rest of the
sandwiches<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.400> honestly<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.430> was

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
sandwiches and honestly I was

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.120 
sandwiches and honestly I was
considering<00:04:15.120> doing<00:04:15.239> mushrooms<00:04:15.569> but<00:04:16.199> they

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
considering doing mushrooms but they

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.069 
considering doing mushrooms but they
come<00:04:17.310> in<00:04:17.340> little<00:04:17.609> cans<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.329> can't<00:04:18.660> put<00:04:18.959> an

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
come in little cans and I can't put an

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.629 
come in little cans and I can't put an
entire<00:04:19.380> cans<00:04:19.769> worth<00:04:20.009> of<00:04:20.099> mushrooms<00:04:20.400> on<00:04:20.549> my

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
entire cans worth of mushrooms on my

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.450 
entire cans worth of mushrooms on my
thing<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.959> that<00:04:22.139> doesn't<00:04:22.470> want<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.650> share<00:04:22.949> I

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
thing and that doesn't want to share I

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.580 
thing and that doesn't want to share I
guess<00:04:24.330> I<00:04:24.419> could<00:04:24.570> put<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.870> rest<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.259> them<00:04:25.440> in

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
guess I could put the rest of them in

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.969 
guess I could put the rest of them in
the<00:04:25.770> in<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:27.150> fridge<00:04:27.660> for<00:04:27.900> later<00:04:28.050> but<00:04:28.410> I'll

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
the in the fridge for later but I'll

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.290 
the in the fridge for later but I'll
just<00:04:29.160> do<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.370> without<00:04:29.490> mushrooms<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.210> see

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
just do it without mushrooms and see

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.790 
just do it without mushrooms and see
what<00:04:30.419> I<00:04:30.509> think<00:04:30.539> complete<00:04:31.320> that<00:04:31.470> sandwich

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
what I think complete that sandwich

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.159 
what I think complete that sandwich
looks<00:04:31.860> pretty<00:04:32.250> good<00:04:32.460> but<00:04:33.060> how<00:04:33.210> does<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.570> taste

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
looks pretty good but how does it taste

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:41.420 
looks pretty good but how does it taste
I<00:04:39.199> mean<00:04:40.199> it's<00:04:40.349> not<00:04:40.500> which<00:04:40.740> which<00:04:40.979> but<00:04:41.250> this<00:04:41.340> is

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
I mean it's not which which but this is

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.260 
I mean it's not which which but this is
pretty<00:04:41.639> darn<00:04:42.000> good

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
pretty darn good

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.700 
pretty darn good
I<00:04:42.449> probably<00:04:42.930> could<00:04:43.259> have<00:04:43.320> put<00:04:43.380> a<00:04:43.500> lot<00:04:43.680> more

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
I probably could have put a lot more

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.129 
I probably could have put a lot more
meat<00:04:44.009> on<00:04:44.159> there<00:04:44.370> what<00:04:44.759> do<00:04:44.820> you<00:04:44.849> think<00:04:45.060> now<00:04:48.139> of
