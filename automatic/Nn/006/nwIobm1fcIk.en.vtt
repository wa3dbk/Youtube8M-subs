 chord play bass string first 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:48.910
 the sixth thumb of the right hand 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.050
 the sound should be a little protracted 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.440
 continue to play 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.470
 index fingernail movement 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.590
 top down mostly bottom 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.590
 stringed 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.220
 then the same finger only already 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.230
 pillow bottom up too because 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.959
 same movement 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.470
 continue to play the bass side only already 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.470
 five 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.130
 and in the conclusion of the battle we do three quick 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.169
 movements 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.440
 index finger up down up and 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.440
 all over again 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:34.800
 so it means lost once on 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.950
 card go to chord d 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:42.810
 We also play once we play first 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:46.700
 empty fourth bass and then 5 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.700
 empty like this 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:58.280
 and further to the court of e. play the sixth 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.280
 bass and then fifth in the chord 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:08.809
 continue to play the chord c and play the same 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:12.159
 the very first fifth bass string then 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:12.159
 sixth or 4 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.160
 and all over again 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.660
 When you lose the second time already on 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.340
 tsa play is not a whole fight 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:38.920
 half that is you down down and then 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:43.350
 present the model playing bass too 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:47.880
 here we have 4 empty and up down up 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.880
 that is, the second part of the battle 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.540
 it turns out all together 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.210
 and all over again 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:11.230
 the third verse and chorus are played the same way 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:13.630
 just play bass instead of bass 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.110
 top down mostly top 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.480
 strings 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.630
 you can nail the index finger can 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:24.600
 and a large pad of the rest of the movement 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.600
 same ones that makes all the difference 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:37.479
 but 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:50.180
 Well, that's what I hope I help you with. 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.180
 good luck and success
