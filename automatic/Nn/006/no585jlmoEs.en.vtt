00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
the first drive coming out i think was

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.270 
the first drive coming out i think was
like<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:28.630> 92-yard<00:04:29.320> drive<00:04:29.650> or<00:04:29.860> something<00:04:30.190> like

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
like a 92-yard drive or something like

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.840 
like a 92-yard drive or something like
that

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850
