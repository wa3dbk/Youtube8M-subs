00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:04.660
 good friends talking of car has 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.490
 tested as a minimum as I tested the 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.899
 1,500 cars and the world is because otherwise 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.030
 you do not have a correct assessment 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.730
 tarumã in our testing ground for a 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.280
 provided by the administration here of 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.499
 also by Valéria 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.660
 that always helps us our tests is mine 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:21.369
 ground for many years and should already have 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.679
 tested the car on several authors of the 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.259
 world as an outside branch will love me like 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.429
 if you play as much of it as spain 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.199
 Estoril in Portugal 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.669
 of course, at the invitation of the automakers and not 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.989
 with a professional pilot but like 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.970
 test pilot 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.430
 tarumã is it extremely fast as 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.040
 mainly serves to test the 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.470
 suspensions of the cars to their power of 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.540
 motor to resume torque to capacity 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.100
 braking and especially what 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.540
 we call handley the 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.920
 dirigibility 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.520
 these curves are extremely curved 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.710
 demanding that put in depth up to 7 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.440
 It's a real provocation. 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.540
 for all electronic systems and 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.780
 also mechanics of the automobile 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.509
 this will be because I'm already in the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.159
 seventh round and the first with you a 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.840
 the presence of you here in the 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.100
 passenger compartment 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.140
 I already saw that it has a platform 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.270
 extremely solid is not the first 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.670
 I test the cerato confidence and 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.690
 it is also not the first racetrack and the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.030
 cerato has some characteristics 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.100
 extremely positive as I said 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.880
 the rigidity of platform width of 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.370
 This platform is the lx model with 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.350
 rim wheels 17 which already improves the 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.780
 stability on a racetrack track 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.690
 because I'm being much more demanding 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.000
 with the car I'm going to get in here on the curve 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.799
 1 to 160 kilometers time 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.560
 and you will see the reaction of the car 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.659
 extremely need to see for I am 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.030
 with a net a reaction looks well the car 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.369
 in the hand is just a generous curve because 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.720
 she changes course the great challenge 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.700
 including these great drivers 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.960
 professionals from Brazil, Brazil is a 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.360
 of the best motorsport drivers 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.820
 continues with this 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.750
 great pilots of the gaucho 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.350
 who already honored that tired 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.540
 and floor of Brazil and the world will be the 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.910
 next 126 hp the four engines 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.920
 strong touch engine cylinders here 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.190
 helped in the lx version by the exchange 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.770
 sequential automatic transmission that is 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.760
 fairly accurate is not almost non-lego 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.560
 has almost holes in the sequential mode I 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.700
 I can dominate the car here with 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.950
 facility 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.620
 it offers a good level of inventory 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.600
 included here in the curve outputs that 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.730
 Do you know if the racetrack curve swims at all? 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.670
 has to do with curves have to do in the 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.230
 sense of testing the expensive board and this 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.080
 car is not with sp 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.640
 the psp is not reaping the possibility 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.800
 trend is rather the rear output 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.670
 which is easily controllable that 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.890
 account is rolling but all the time 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.510
 he did not pass me at all and 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.000
 insecurity and pass safety 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.470
 even in the most demanding corners and if the 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.320
 car has excellent stability 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.720
 directional and a great lateral exit 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.489
 How are you showing here will be on track? 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.500
 our business is not talking so much about 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.080
 Finishing is great the economy is very 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.970
 good but here is the performance of the 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.830
 car at high speed 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.019
 Why do you, as a family? 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.180
 Brazilian people are evidently feeling 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.489
 safe within legal limits 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.959
 will be a very large margin of 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.880
 security for you 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.060
 the media said it is on the verge of 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.340
 stressing the equipment 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.579
 mechanics of the car means suspensions 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.370
 steering wheel stability team comes everything 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.200
 motor set was also seen in harmony 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.940
 and set and in that set 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.400
 you almost distracts me here because 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.500
 My camera made me a sign the offense here 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.150
 of the rear seat squeezed in the same way 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.489
 one caramel at 140 for now 150 160 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.350
 making scenes means even me 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.540
 I have two microcameras go tests always 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.120
 forget to bring them in our silva 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.380
 left in derlei's hand and friends do not have 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.420
 more than talking a car is really 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.709
 exceptional is only for side 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.049
 it has a mechanical assembly 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.810
 extremely balanced will be a great 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.310
 sales success 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.410
 world market will have a new version 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.480
 of the cerato that will be presented in the hall 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.450
 in the paris hall 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.030
 now in october we'll be there 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.100
 we will launch the day from the 24th of 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.870
 september in paris by f. 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.880
 I stopped after a longer time in France 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.340
 doing car tests 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.720
 we see with the European crisis and we 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.880
 see this new will be 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.740
 displayed but this current will be 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.080
 necessarily only because the group 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.060
 hyundai-kia has a craving for the new one because 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.190
 this guy could have this and bush 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.830
 high and in this whole mechanical set 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.060
 be competitive for many years ahead 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.850
 still 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.010
 excellent product from here I write and 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.500
 I sign below without a doubt what 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.840
 will we now evaluate the 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.530
 another imported here in the program let's 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.360
 evaluation of the Jetta Jetta comfortline 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.250
 most affordable model in price and another 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.620
 thing is this guy that is not inaccessible 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.870
 not even impossible to hold percent 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.120
 this stupid pit of the Brazilian government 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.460
 that reminds those that that one 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.350
 absurd nationalism that we had a 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.150
 military government that ended up delaying 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.200
 our auto industry and 50 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.450
 years the computer industry 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.160
 in 160 years 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.750
 have to open market have to compete 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.130
 with equal conditions 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.410
 the assemblers installed in Brazil have 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.270
 be a much more competitive option and 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.210
 the closure of the market for 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.070
 imported goods and also takes an 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.390
 of automobile industries 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.930
 I installed in Brazil, I do not have 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.930
 doubts
