they've plowed the fields and they're

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.210 
they've plowed the fields and they're
still<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> little<00:00:15.809> fluffy<00:00:16.350> but<00:00:16.590> we'll<00:00:16.920> see<00:00:17.100> what

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
still a little fluffy but we'll see what

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.000 
still a little fluffy but we'll see what
we<00:00:17.310> can<00:00:17.430> find

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
we can find

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.929 
we can find
now<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.340> something<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.699> don't<00:00:20.789> see

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
now this is something you don't see

now this is something you don't see
every<00:00:21.330> day<00:00:21.510> at<00:00:21.630> first<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.020> thought<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.350> was

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
every day at first I thought this was

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.550 
every day at first I thought this was
another<00:00:22.680> glass<00:00:23.460> shard<00:00:24.109> but<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.380> see

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
another glass shard but you can see

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.050 
another glass shard but you can see
after<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.890> good<00:00:26.160> rain<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.580> these<00:00:26.760> freshly

after a good rain on these freshly
plowed<00:00:27.420> fields<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.769> never<00:00:28.980> know<00:00:29.130> what<00:00:29.310> you

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
plowed fields you never know what you

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.120 
plowed fields you never know what you
might<00:00:29.550> run<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> really<00:00:31.679> nice

can see that good that's gonna clean up
real<00:00:45.300> pretty<00:00:46.219> all<00:00:47.219> right

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.080 

some<00:01:14.030> sort<00:01:14.330> of<00:01:14.450> a<00:01:14.570> finial<00:01:15.790> looks<00:01:16.790> like<00:01:16.940> it's

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
some sort of a finial looks like it's

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:26.140 
some sort of a finial looks like it's
got<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.270> little<00:01:20.229> silver<00:01:21.229> plating<00:01:21.650> on<00:01:21.800> it<00:01:25.150> right

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
got a little silver plating on it right

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:34.540 
got a little silver plating on it right
there<00:01:32.229> it's<00:01:33.229> pretty<00:01:33.500> small<00:01:33.800> I<00:01:34.160> don't<00:01:34.369> know<00:01:34.460> if

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
there it's pretty small I don't know if

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.130 
there it's pretty small I don't know if
you<00:01:34.640> can<00:01:34.729> see<00:01:34.940> it<00:01:35.030> in<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.210> camera<00:01:35.450> or<00:01:35.600> not<00:01:35.660> but

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
you can see it in the camera or not but

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.370 
you can see it in the camera or not but
another<00:01:37.070> surface<00:01:37.490> fine<00:01:37.910> there's<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.509> glass

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
another surface fine there's a glass

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.190 
another surface fine there's a glass
faceted<00:01:40.190> blue<00:01:40.399> trade<00:01:40.729> bead<00:01:41.000> they<00:01:41.750> call<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.140> a

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
faceted blue trade bead they call that a

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.249 
faceted blue trade bead they call that a
Russian<00:01:42.500> blue<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.190> my<00:01:43.729> theory<00:01:44.000> is<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.540> where

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
Russian blue and my theory is that where

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.180 
Russian blue and my theory is that where
these<00:01:45.440> slave<00:01:45.920> cabins<00:01:46.550> once<00:01:47.360> sat<00:01:48.130> they<00:01:49.130> were

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
these slave cabins once sat they were

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.090 
these slave cabins once sat they were
probably<00:01:49.670> lost<00:01:49.850> by<00:01:50.210> some<00:01:50.270> of<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.680> tenants

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
probably lost by some of the the tenants

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.130 
probably lost by some of the the tenants
of<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.369> cabins<00:01:52.880> that<00:01:53.000> would<00:01:53.300> use<00:01:53.780> them<00:01:53.990> as

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
of the cabins that would use them as

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:02.440 
of the cabins that would use them as
ornamentation<00:01:55.100> I<00:02:00.700> wear<00:02:01.700> my<00:02:01.820> glasses<00:02:02.060> when<00:02:02.420> I

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
ornamentation I wear my glasses when I

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.420 
ornamentation I wear my glasses when I
come<00:02:02.720> out<00:02:02.870> here<00:02:03.110> because<00:02:03.320> otherwise<00:02:03.979> I

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
come out here because otherwise I

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.169 
come out here because otherwise I
wouldn't<00:02:04.640> see<00:02:04.820> these<00:02:05.000> little<00:02:05.210> tiny<00:02:05.420> things

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
wouldn't see these little tiny things

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:25.740 
wouldn't see these little tiny things
all<00:02:08.179> right

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.540 

there<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:26.990> looks<00:02:27.740> like<00:02:27.800> a<00:02:27.920> flat<00:02:28.250> button

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
there it is looks like a flat button

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.020 
there it is looks like a flat button
with<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.120> shank<00:02:29.390> stand<00:02:29.720> up<00:02:30.460> all<00:02:31.460> right<00:02:31.670> there

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
with the shank stand up all right there

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.900 
with the shank stand up all right there
well<00:02:32.540> that's<00:02:32.690> one<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.080> old<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.790> old

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
pewter style and see it almost looks

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.880 
pewter style and see it almost looks
like<00:02:37.090> it's<00:02:38.090> made<00:02:38.240> out<00:02:38.270> of<00:02:38.480> silver<00:02:38.780> there<00:02:39.050> Tom

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.320 

looks<00:02:47.480> like<00:02:47.660> we<00:02:47.870> walked<00:02:48.140> up<00:02:48.350> on<00:02:48.560> another

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
you can see that there it is sitting in

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.530 
you can see that there it is sitting in
the<00:02:57.230> ground<00:02:57.380> where<00:02:57.710> it<00:02:57.800> rest<00:02:58.070> its<00:02:59.000> pry<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.390> out

pretty one there you can see the the
hole<00:03:09.590> they<00:03:09.830> run<00:03:10.070> into<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.430> with<00:03:10.550> a<00:03:11.080> lighter

blue<00:03:12.350> one<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:12.920> that's<00:03:13.190> pretty<00:03:13.370> common<00:03:13.640> with

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
blue one and that's pretty common with

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.180 
blue one and that's pretty common with
these<00:03:14.380> it's<00:03:15.380> a<00:03:15.440> little<00:03:15.620> bit<00:03:15.710> bigger<00:03:15.890> than<00:03:16.100> the
