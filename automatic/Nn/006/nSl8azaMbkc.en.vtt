00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hey people and welcome i am today 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.290
 at the night of the jumps in word and 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.069
 shows you how to do a sports event 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.069
 filming 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.560
 yes as i said i am at the 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.529
 night of the jumps today one 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.050
 sports event where several motocross riders 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.060
 I would fly across the hall 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.070
 already say and I show you what you 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.660
 when filming there should pay attention 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.950
 generally at a sports event so it 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.750
 does not come on its night of 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.610
 the jumps on it can be anything 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.309
 be sports events and it will come 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.809
 on whether you are inside or outside 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.820
 We're inside in the hall now 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.040
 we depend on what light 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.010
 there is something there for light conditions 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.390
 there we are and need to 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.610
 we adjust ourselves 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.510
 with the camera I have at one today 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.120
 60d the lens kit 18 to 135 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.440
 millimeters and a tripod quite important 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.440
 have a tripod with something like that 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.590
 if you film it at a sports event 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.020
 It's important that you get on this 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.630
 sports event also a load so you have to 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.130
 look what could happen when 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.440
 are now at the night of the jumps 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.690
 and I know what's going on 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.300
 Motorcyclists are over the ramps 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.100
 jump the ramps are stuck and the 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.100
 drive her round from he knows when 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.200
 you reach which ramp that is at 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.149
 other sports such as sports 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.520
 a bit more difficult but you have to 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.860
 adapt to it and easy 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.539
 already try to foresee what when 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.880
 how could happen 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.070
 I have now with my with the canon 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.040
 60d filmed and as previously mentioned 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.060
 with the kit lens 18 to 135 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.340
 millimeter and that's great 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.620
 I could have served here in the hall 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.310
 I also have some important positions 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.160
 So change the top down times page 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.070
 Mitte tries as many positions as 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.290
 possible to take and have a camera 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.470
 I always filmed open so filmed 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.840
 so open it dazzles at 135 mm 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:45.549
 hold with 56 at 18 millimeters with 35 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.750
 I was always able to get the iso at 100 160 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.180
 160 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.720
 So keep that because the hall really good 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.570
 Illuminated shutter time is natural 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.950
 51 and white balance because I had one 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.670
 Little bit of light was mixed 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.739
 but I had 3800 most of the time 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.720
 kelvin on the camera so at least 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.209
 when the big spotlights on 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.980
 were and it was pretty good picture 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.709
 looks very good 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.630
 as I said many different positions 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.090
 take it with you so also the times 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.760
 driver from below make a total so 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.620
 I also have a lot with the focal lengths 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.760
 really played on 18 millimeters 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.470
 let's go to 50 80 135 I just have 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.880
 Looked like it fits and from the 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.799
 Camera setting you have to look too 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.470
 how it fits why if it wants to 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.720
 dark is so you can 160 iso 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.670
 but you can do 320 power 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.660
 320 you see it in liveview like 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.740
 the picture is dark and could be dark 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.740
 accordingly adapt 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.660
 as 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.220
 practical but not essential 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.810
 is definitely a tripod with it 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.000
 you get super trouper and 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.690
 steady movements and blurred 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.850
 not so much 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.700
 it's best to use a fluid head 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.800
 tripod if no fluid head then 1 3 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.980
 Vegetative need three way tripod 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.480
 ball heads are to film rather not 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.820
 At least they are very difficult 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.700
 to handle and so you can great 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.830
 so smoove all movements of the 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.050
 so I too in my case 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.600
 example of the driver track was quite 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.660
 Upstairs in the hall was very nice 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.270
 Overview of the whole arena and 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.669
 could follow all drivers very nicely 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.669
 The objective was 135 millimeters 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.720
 and at 135 mm was already partially 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.300
 a bit too much by the driver very much 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.069
 had image filling in the picture and if she had 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.710
 have made very fast movements 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:06.639
 or I just was not fast enough 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.750
 to come along 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.750
 then I have them out of the picture 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.069
 lost and then they stopped 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.720
 somehow cut or not at all 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.099
 only in the picture because you have to varian synonymous 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.050
 just really with the focal length 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.360
 play and watch as it just stops in 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.159
 the situation fits and thus one stops 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.650
 also has different perspectives 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:25.960
 really 18 millimeters to 35 millimeters 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.970
 Try everything to try 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.380
 Panning that is just a pure 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.009
 exercise thing so you really have to 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.470
 to practice 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.270
 and as I have already tried 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.130
 predict what the movements 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.169
 makes athletes and where he will be the same 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.610
 then you know in which direction 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.440
 you would have to pan so it stops 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.449
 no sense if you swing up 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.490
 if the soccer player left or 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.750
 right , of course, is nonsense 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.819
 therefore tries to 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.979
 to adjust and gives it also quietly 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.659
 So before that, do not go to practice like that 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.969
 an event tries good pictures 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:57.069
 but just give it to me 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:58.719
 Maybe you have someone at home 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:00.159
 Just run around where you can 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:02.199
 that could be practicing or a dog or something 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:04.509
 the sea pie shipyard and film team 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.219
 and then just try the whole thing too 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.960
 practice because that's just a pure one 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:11.310
 Exercise there's no big 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.310
 practicing secret practice 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:16.930
 I'll be happy to post it 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.380
 the pin board you have me expression 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.380
 brought 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.700
 so what about the subject of film 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.370
 sports events no matter if now night of the 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.650
 jumps with motocross riders or football 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.330
 or volleyball sport is sport and the 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.800
 sequences in the film are in the reason 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.210
 Taken the same pros on everyone 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.590
 fall out with the focal length 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.720
 also like detail crash so 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.640
 really close protection from the face or something 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.800
 or only by the feet at 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.540
 football players only the ball problem for 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.310
 him from exercising that in any case 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.260
 and if you did something cool 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.000
 send it to me I post it too 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.760
 like to facebook on the wall or 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.260
 post yourself on the pin board and if 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.120
 you liked the video and maybe 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.680
 has also helped yields in thumb 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.110
 top is no thumb down 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.070
 subscribed to the channel shares the video 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.390
 your friends and see you 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.390
 next wednesday 19 o'clock
