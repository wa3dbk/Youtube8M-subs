00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
even think he's actually scored that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.009 
even think he's actually scored that
many<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.760> season<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.449> been<00:01:03.629> it's

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
many this season so it's not been it's

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.570 
many this season so it's not been it's
not<00:01:04.110> been<00:01:04.260> brilliant<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:04.920> him<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.280> fair

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
not been brilliant for him to be fair

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.429 
not been brilliant for him to be fair
he's<00:01:05.939> got<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.630> generally<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.140> know<00:01:07.290> with

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
he's got just generally you know with

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.200 
he's got just generally you know with
the<00:01:07.530> pass<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> dribbling<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.700> defendant

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the pass in the dribbling the defendant

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.910 
the pass in the dribbling the defendant
and<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> head<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.720> all<00:01:09.930> gone<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.320> Kia<00:01:10.560> he<00:01:10.799> has

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
and the head in all gone up Kia he has

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.920 
and the head in all gone up Kia he has
predominantly<00:01:11.280> plays<00:01:11.850> center<00:01:12.090> back<00:01:12.390> this

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
predominantly plays center back this

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.899 
predominantly plays center back this
season<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.890> Chelsea<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.610> think<00:01:14.670> that's

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
season for Chelsea so I think that's

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.249 
season for Chelsea so I think that's
fair<00:01:15.210> enough<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.720> he's<00:01:15.810> managed<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.049> get

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
fair enough that he's managed to get

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.899 
fair enough that he's managed to get
that<00:01:16.470> an<00:01:16.920> overall<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.369> think<00:01:17.430> that's<00:01:17.670> quite<00:01:17.790> a

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
that an overall I think that's quite a

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.429 
that an overall I think that's quite a
realistic<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.810> said<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.200> could<00:01:19.350> have

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
realistic one like I said it could have

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.280 
realistic one like I said it could have
been<00:01:19.500> 84<00:01:20.150> 483<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> think<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.540> fair<00:01:21.810> enough<00:01:21.960> for

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290

to an 85 which is

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.160 
to an 85 which is
I<00:02:13.130> think<00:02:13.430> he<00:02:13.520> would<00:02:13.670> get<00:02:13.820> given<00:02:14.120> by<00:02:14.420> EA<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.080> his

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
I think he would get given by EA and his

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.660 
I think he would get given by EA and his
bed<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.590> current<00:02:15.890> moment<00:02:15.980> I'm<00:02:16.310> he<00:02:16.430> doesn't

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
bed this current moment I'm he doesn't

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.950 
bed this current moment I'm he doesn't
switch<00:02:16.850> club<00:02:17.120> but<00:02:17.570> that's<00:02:17.690> always<00:02:17.840> a

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
switch club but that's always a

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.500 
switch club but that's always a
possibility<00:02:18.370> Ibrahimovic<00:02:19.370> now<00:02:19.610> I've<00:02:19.910> put<00:02:20.360> him

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
possibility Ibrahimovic now I've put him

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.420 
possibility Ibrahimovic now I've put him
up<00:02:20.570> by<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.810> 1<00:02:21.230> overall<00:02:21.770> rating<00:02:22.220> you've<00:02:22.310> got

up by a 1 overall rating you've got

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.400 
up by a 1 overall rating you've got
minus<00:02:22.790> 1<00:02:22.970> on<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.150> pace<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:23.510> know<00:02:23.630> I<00:02:23.810> think<00:02:24.290> he

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
minus 1 on the pace you know I think he

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.290 
minus 1 on the pace you know I think he
isn't<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.770> i<00:02:24.830> think<00:02:24.890> it's<00:02:25.100> about<00:02:25.220> 30<00:02:25.580> 31<00:02:26.150> i

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
isn't it i think it's about 30 31 i

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.330 
isn't it i think it's about 30 31 i
could<00:02:26.540> be<00:02:26.660> wrong<00:02:26.690> but<00:02:26.870> i'm<00:02:27.140> sure<00:02:27.170> he's<00:02:28.070> getting

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
could be wrong but i'm sure he's getting

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.130 
could be wrong but i'm sure he's getting
a<00:02:28.580> bit<00:02:28.610> older<00:02:29.030> now<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.540> why<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.780> know

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
a bit older now and that is why you know

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.750 
a bit older now and that is why you know
the<00:02:30.530> pace<00:02:30.740> is<00:02:30.770> gonna<00:02:31.100> be<00:02:31.220> slowing<00:02:31.460> down<00:02:31.700> a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
the pace is gonna be slowing down a

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.000 
the pace is gonna be slowing down a
little<00:02:31.880> bit<00:02:32.180> as<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.390> go<00:02:32.540> along<00:02:32.900> which<00:02:33.350> is<00:02:33.530> it's

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
little bit as you go along which is it's

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.490 
little bit as you go along which is it's
understandable<00:02:34.790> but<00:02:35.270> then<00:02:35.480> no<00:02:36.050> that<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.290> my

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
understandable but then no that is my

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.260 
understandable but then no that is my

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
gooch has gone down one because

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.720 
gooch has gone down one because
obviously<00:02:44.740> zion<00:02:45.740> doesn't<00:02:46.010> need<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.280> trap<00:02:46.520> back

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
obviously zion doesn't need to trap back

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.700 
obviously zion doesn't need to trap back
and<00:02:47.000> then<00:02:47.360> heading<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.840> plus<00:02:48.110> one<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.530> finish
