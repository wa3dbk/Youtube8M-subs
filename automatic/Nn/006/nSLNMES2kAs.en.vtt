00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.230
 i 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.119
 as the law fulfills as it has recognized me 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.590
 that not for the corn lash 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.320
 Thank you 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.810
 today this is the apple food of 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.540
 Desserts are ruined 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.970
 a lot playing on the subway but it's 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.980
 what am I saving so that a conga or 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.660
 a bike where it brings more 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.940
 because when you start you can not stop 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.239
 brought them nothing to drink the source is 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.239
 free 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.070
 it's over, close your eyes and open the 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.070
 mouth 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.030
 what is 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.920
 when the family spends less than what 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.380
 earn a money is left available for 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.240
 save because this saving is necessary 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.909
 mainly for two reasons 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.829
 first as a safety mattress for a 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.170
 reason for prudence may that in the 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.180
 future we have some unforeseen expense or 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.060
 well that some temporary disappears 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.340
 I enter the second reason to save 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.130
 would be able to perform in the future a 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.970
 spending more for example buying a car 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.130
 or take a trip is convenient to save 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.890
 a part of the income for consumption 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.140
 future that is to spend less than 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.710
 we enter to be able to spend more 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.710
 ahead 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.310
 the saving supposes to stop consuming now 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.500
 to be able to consume in the future and 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.210
 we also save by precaution because 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.210
 you never know what can happen 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.540
 you have not said imagine 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.920
 hey 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.920
 you have seen that passed 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.590
 I bought it second hand in 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.530
 internet pulled by price with the bike 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.140
 I've only been able to repair in time 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.549
 bike would have to wait I would leave you 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.549
 the money but I'm stiff 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.280
 Hey, why do not you ask Carla 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.400
 lately it happens a lot 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.569
 Y 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.569
 to be that fine 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.460
 the food the electricity the entrance of the 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.040
 cinema or the nightclub are consumed 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.890
 very immediately and that is why they are 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.110
 calls expenses but a motorcycle a car or 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.530
 a house is not spent in a year 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.280
 let's hope that's why we do not consider them a 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.500
 spending but an investment are assets that 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.200
 will last several years and will continue 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.920
 consuming will be spent 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.200
 year after year 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.450
 the important investments of a 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.640
 family can hardly be undertaken 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.190
 without using our ability to 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.830
 indebtedness that is to say we will have to ask 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.690
 a loan if the purpose is correct 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.420
 and we have the ability to return what 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.860
 borrowing not only is not bad 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.980
 but it is usually essential 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.590
 the loan that normally grants it 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.540
 a bank or a savings bank 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.240
 allows you to consume over my 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.030
 income but eye I promise to 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.890
 return the money loaned for 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.020
 part of my future income to it 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.030
 I can not leave you pasta I have and I have 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.270
 I'm saving for a tortillas bike 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.120
 I have interests 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.530
 musicals 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.530
 an African percussion concert 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.760
 thank you but the bell and I have it 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.480
 and we could not do a concert to 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.480
 20 not 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.450
 in summary the family saves when 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.430
 consume less than what that 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.190
 saving in the first place 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.400
 tranquility in second place can 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.160
 allow greater consumption in the future and 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.020
 third will be indispensable to the 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.540
 time to ask for a credit then 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.240
 hardly a bank or a box of 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.030
 savings will finance our projects 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.560
 investment if we are not able 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.510
 to contribute a part 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.180
 the family will have to go into debt when 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.460
 consumes more than what you enter and when 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.750
 has the ability to return the amount 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.000
 then borrowed debt tends 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.600
 be essential to face their 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.639
 most important investment decisions 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.919
 acquire a home choose a good 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:13.960
 training for children or even 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.960
 start a family business 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.940
