life<00:01:25.189> it's<00:01:26.189> kind<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.460> hard<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> mix<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.119> because

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
life it's kind of hard to mix so because

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.590 
life it's kind of hard to mix so because

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
you need like the right proportion of

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.819 
you need like the right proportion of
blue<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.049> red<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:32.270> yeah<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:34.290> my<00:01:34.439> colors

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
blue and red so yeah so here my colors

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.060 
blue and red so yeah so here my colors
and<00:01:35.220> then<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> next<00:01:36.150> step<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:37.110> equally<00:01:37.650> or

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and then the next step is to equally or

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.490 
and then the next step is to equally or
as<00:01:38.520> your<00:01:38.759> best<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.780> write<00:01:39.990> all<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.409> those

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
as your best to write all of those

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.389 
as your best to write all of those
colors<00:01:40.950> into<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.270> baking<00:01:42.570> sheets<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:44.159> yeah

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
okay so this is the I guess final step I

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.460 
okay so this is the I guess final step I
felt<00:01:49.350> all<00:01:49.590> my<00:01:49.649> colors<00:01:50.340> into<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.780> baking<00:01:52.229> new

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
coloring left so I just made a new

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.050 
coloring left so I just made a new
virtual<00:01:59.280> colored<00:02:00.060> cupcake

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
virtual colored cupcake

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
steps after this and one of them is to

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.850 
steps after this and one of them is to
throw<00:02:09.800> them<00:02:09.920> in<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.069> oven<00:02:10.100> go<00:02:10.910> okay<00:02:11.569> so<00:02:12.500> get

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.620 
20 minutes so I just took my cupcakes
out<00:02:59.150> of<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.420> oven<00:03:00.069> and<00:03:01.069> this<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:02.090> what<00:03:02.330> they

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
out of the oven and this is what they

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.660 
out of the oven and this is what they
look<00:03:02.840> like<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:06.410> can<00:03:06.620> see<00:03:06.920> like<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.430> green

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
look like you can see like the green

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.810 
look like you can see like the green
from<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:07.970> other<00:03:08.239> layers<00:03:09.280> but<00:03:10.280> that's<00:03:10.489> okay

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
from the other layers but that's okay

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.620 
from the other layers but that's okay
the<00:03:11.780> ice<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.739> here<00:03:12.920> are<00:03:13.040> my<00:03:13.190> regular<00:03:13.630> color

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
the ice and here are my regular color

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.850 
the ice and here are my regular color
ones<00:03:15.489> they're<00:03:16.489> like<00:03:16.700> tangy

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.330 

they<00:03:21.860> look<00:03:22.070> awesome<00:03:22.600> and<00:03:23.739> then<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.920> next<00:03:25.190> step

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
they look awesome and then the next step

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.720 
they look awesome and then the next step
is<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:26.150> take<00:03:27.489> your<00:03:29.320> frosting<00:03:30.320> of<00:03:30.769> choice<00:03:31.100> and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
is to take your frosting of choice and

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.300 
is to take your frosting of choice and
for<00:03:32.660> this<00:03:32.750> I'm<00:03:32.959> using<00:03:32.989> Betty<00:03:33.470> Crocker<00:03:33.769> whipped

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310

for this I'm using Betty Crocker whipped
cream<00:03:35.680> frosting<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:37.370> I'm<00:03:38.000> thinking<00:03:38.329> about

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
cream frosting and I'm thinking about

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:46.319 
cream frosting and I'm thinking about
calling<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.620> frosting<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:42.160> with<00:03:44.350> colors<00:03:45.350> too

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
calling the frosting to with colors too

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.080 
calling the frosting to with colors too
okay<00:03:47.329> so<00:03:47.390> now<00:03:47.780> it's<00:03:47.959> time<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.380> frost<00:03:49.310> these<00:03:49.670> bad

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090
