I<00:01:34.590> mean<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.340> guess<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:36.150> depending<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
I mean I guess just depending on the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.960 
I mean I guess just depending on the
score<00:01:36.990> uh<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:38.070> determines<00:01:38.490> when<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.640> go<00:01:38.790> in

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
