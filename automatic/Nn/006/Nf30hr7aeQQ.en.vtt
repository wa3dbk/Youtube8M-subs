00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
what I wanted to be a cathedral or a

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.910 
what I wanted to be a cathedral or a
large<00:00:22.769> Church<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.480> kind<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.410> made<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.619> too

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
large Church but I kind of made it too

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.679 
large Church but I kind of made it too
big<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.430> that's<00:00:26.580> how<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> way<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.180> tour<00:00:27.510> and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
big and that's how is a way to tour and

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.509 
big and that's how is a way to tour and
it<00:00:27.750> just<00:00:27.869> looks<00:00:27.990> ridiculous<00:00:28.410> by<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.740> sea<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.490> I

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
it just looks ridiculous by the sea so I

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.070 
it just looks ridiculous by the sea so I
just<00:00:29.699> sort<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.880> pushed<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.269> back<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.420> bit<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
just sort of pushed it back a bit and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.770 
just sort of pushed it back a bit and
I'm<00:00:31.230> not<00:00:31.470> sure<00:00:31.740> what<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.489> with<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.420> if

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
I'm not sure what to do with it so if

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.690 
I'm not sure what to do with it so if
you<00:00:34.170> guys<00:00:34.350> have<00:00:34.620> any<00:00:34.739> suggestions<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.520> what<00:00:35.640> I

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
you guys have any suggestions of what I

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.580 
you guys have any suggestions of what I
should<00:00:35.940> do<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.390> kind<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:36.989> tower

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
should do it this kind of like tower

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.130 
should do it this kind of like tower
wall<00:00:38.129> thing<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.760> was<00:00:39.210> thinking<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.690> making<00:00:39.870> it

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
wall thing I was thinking of making it

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.290 
wall thing I was thinking of making it
into<00:00:40.350> kind<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> kingdoms<00:00:41.460> castle<00:00:42.000> but<00:00:42.180> it

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
into kind of the kingdoms castle but it

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.420 
into kind of the kingdoms castle but it
doesn't<00:00:42.629> really<00:00:42.840> look<00:00:43.260> all<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.559> castle

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
doesn't really look all that castle

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.760 
doesn't really look all that castle
shaped<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.600> can<00:00:45.809> see<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.140> kind<00:00:46.530> of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
shaped so here you can see it kind of

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.729 
shaped so here you can see it kind of
away<00:00:47.520> from<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> city<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.050> still<00:00:49.289> near

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
away from the city as in it's still near

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.680 
away from the city as in it's still near
the<00:00:49.920> city<00:00:50.129> near<00:00:50.520> enough<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.940> seen<00:00:51.239> by<00:00:51.420> stuff

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the city near enough to be seen by stuff

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.799 
the city near enough to be seen by stuff
but<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.590> far<00:00:53.460> away<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.629> still

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
but it's far away so that I can still

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.090 
but it's far away so that I can still
build<00:00:55.020> around<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.770> gonna<00:00:55.890> like

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
build around it and it's not gonna like

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.580 
build around it and it's not gonna like
tower<00:00:56.370> over<00:00:56.910> everything<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:57.960> can't<00:00:58.320> see<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
tower over everything so you can't see a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.670 
tower over everything so you can't see a
single<00:00:58.829> building<00:00:59.520> I<00:01:00.059> figured<00:01:00.750> as<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.170> should<00:01:01.500> be

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
single building I figured as I should be

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.080 
single building I figured as I should be
going<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.190> from<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.340> show<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.609> should<00:01:02.699> start

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
going in from the show I should start

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.690 
going in from the show I should start
off<00:01:03.120> kind<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.449> smaller<00:01:04.019> noise<00:01:04.890> high<00:01:05.159> builds

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
off kind of smaller noise high builds

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.370 
off kind of smaller noise high builds
and<00:01:05.820> then<00:01:05.939> get<00:01:06.090> higher<00:01:06.330> towards<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> center

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
and then get higher towards the center

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.830 
and then get higher towards the center
of<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> city<00:01:07.770> anyway<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.299> was<00:01:09.390> looking<00:01:09.479> for

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
of the city anyway so I was looking for

really good fun with this I was playing
with<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> roof<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.509> get<00:01:27.630> some<00:01:27.810> cool<00:01:28.020> shapes

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
roof but the thing is it doesn't really

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.890 
roof but the thing is it doesn't really

all the other wood and stuff so I might

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.250 
all the other wood and stuff so I might
go<00:02:36.580> back<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.030> change<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.390> wood<00:02:37.660> color<00:02:37.960> but

go back and change the wood color but

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.380 
go back and change the wood color but
then<00:02:38.620> again<00:02:38.740> it<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.130> good<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.580> have<00:02:39.670> variation

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390
