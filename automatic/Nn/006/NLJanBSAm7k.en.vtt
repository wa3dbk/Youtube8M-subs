00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
but it is pretty simple um a short delay

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.590 
but it is pretty simple um a short delay
between<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:32.369> two<00:00:32.610> clicks<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> repeater

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
between just two clicks on a repeater

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.990

between<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.440> TNT<00:00:34.890> redstone<00:00:35.430> between<00:00:35.820> them

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
between the TNT redstone between them

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.740

and TMT between the red zone in an army

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.860 
and TMT between the red zone in an army
green<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:41.760> reason<00:00:42.180> behind<00:00:42.360> putting

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
green and the reason behind putting

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.740 
green and the reason behind putting
clicks<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.340> TNT<00:00:44.760> blast<00:00:44.940> itself<00:00:45.480> around

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
clicks is so the TNT blast itself around

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.500 
clicks is so the TNT blast itself around
