at the center over here so let's get

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.220 
at the center over here so let's get
started<00:00:26.670> with<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:26.910> tutorial<00:00:27.019> you're<00:00:28.019> going

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
started with this tutorial you're going

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.900 
started with this tutorial you're going
to<00:00:28.320> take<00:00:28.529> your<00:00:28.710> square<00:00:28.949> sheet<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.340> paper<00:00:29.550> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
to take your square sheet of paper and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.999 
to take your square sheet of paper and
you're<00:00:30.300> going<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.810> flip<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.170> over<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
you're going to flip it over so that the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.940 
you're going to flip it over so that the
color<00:00:32.279> side<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.940> facing<00:00:33.270> down<00:00:33.800> then<00:00:34.800> you're

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
color side is facing down then you're

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.410 
color side is facing down then you're
going<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.190> fold<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.670> square<00:00:35.850> sheet<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.210> paper

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
going to fold the square sheet of paper

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:51.970 
going to fold the square sheet of paper
in<00:00:36.719> half<00:00:36.960> diagonally<00:00:37.620> like<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:49.760> unfold

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
in half diagonally like this unfold

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.670 
in half diagonally like this unfold
rotate<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.449> repeat<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.809> same<00:00:55.020> thing<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
rotate and repeat the same thing in the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:09.859 
rotate and repeat the same thing in the
other<00:00:55.890> direction<00:01:07.100> unfold<00:01:08.600> then<00:01:09.600> you're<00:01:09.750> going

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
other direction unfold then you're going

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.660 
other direction unfold then you're going
to<00:01:09.990> take<00:01:10.229> notice<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.189> Center

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
to take notice of this Center

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.910 
to take notice of this Center
intersection<00:01:12.420> over<00:01:12.570> here<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.200> you're<00:01:13.770> going

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
intersection over here and you're going

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.520 
intersection over here and you're going
to<00:01:14.100> align<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.880> point<00:01:15.270> at<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.630> bottom<00:01:15.780> with

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
to align this point at the bottom with

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:25.450 
to align this point at the bottom with
that<00:01:16.710> Center<00:01:17.100> intersection<00:01:22.460> crease<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.640> in

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
that Center intersection crease it in

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.280 
that Center intersection crease it in
and<00:01:25.549> then<00:01:26.299> you're<00:01:26.450> going<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.690> align<00:01:27.080> this

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
and then you're going to align this

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.289 
and then you're going to align this
bottom<00:01:27.710> side<00:01:27.950> here<00:01:27.979> with<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:28.970> horizontal

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
bottom side here with the horizontal

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:39.539 
bottom side here with the horizontal
crease<00:01:30.250> so<00:01:31.250> fold<00:01:31.490> it<00:01:31.640> up<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:34.130> crease<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:35.060> in

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.680 

after<00:01:40.549> that<00:01:40.700> you're<00:01:40.880> going<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.150> rotate<00:01:41.360> the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
after that you're going to rotate the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.450 
after that you're going to rotate the
unit<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.200> repeat<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.710> same<00:01:42.890> thing<00:01:42.950> on<00:01:43.310> this

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
unit and repeat the same thing on this

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.520 
unit and repeat the same thing on this
end<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:43.970> again<00:01:44.630> you're<00:01:44.810> going<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.140> take<00:01:45.350> this

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
end so again you're going to take this

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.920 
end so again you're going to take this
bottom<00:01:45.740> tip<00:01:46.220> over<00:01:46.580> here<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.060> fold<00:01:47.600> it<00:01:47.750> up<00:01:47.869> so

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
bottom tip over here and fold it up so

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.380 
bottom tip over here and fold it up so
that<00:01:48.290> it<00:01:48.380> aligns<00:01:48.680> with<00:01:49.100> this<00:01:49.399> intersection<00:01:50.119> at

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
that it aligns with this intersection at

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.749 
that it aligns with this intersection at
the<00:01:50.509> center<00:01:54.610> fold<00:01:55.610> it<00:01:55.850> up<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.300> crease<00:01:56.690> it<00:01:56.840> in

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
the center fold it up and crease it in

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.310 
the center fold it up and crease it in
then<00:01:58.759> align<00:01:59.149> this<00:01:59.330> bottom<00:01:59.720> side<00:01:59.960> over<00:02:00.289> here

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
then align this bottom side over here

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.070 
then align this bottom side over here
with<00:02:01.100> this<00:02:01.280> horizontal<00:02:01.640> Center<00:02:02.330> crease<00:02:05.080> fold

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
with this horizontal Center crease fold

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:15.280 
with this horizontal Center crease fold
it<00:02:06.320> up<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:08.200> crease<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:09.380> in<00:02:13.989> after<00:02:14.989> that<00:02:15.019> you

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
it up and crease it in after that you

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.990 
it up and crease it in after that you
just<00:02:15.470> want<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.709> unfold<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.340> two<00:02:16.550> folds<00:02:16.970> that

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
just want to unfold the two folds that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.850 
just want to unfold the two folds that
you<00:02:17.209> just<00:02:17.390> made<00:02:17.660> so<00:02:17.959> that<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.140> looks<00:02:18.410> like<00:02:18.500> this

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
you just made so that it looks like this

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.880 
you just made so that it looks like this
and<00:02:19.750> next<00:02:20.750> what<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:20.959> want<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.230> do<00:02:21.350> is<00:02:21.560> you<00:02:21.709> want

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
and next what you want to do is you want

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.309 
and next what you want to do is you want
to<00:02:21.950> reverse<00:02:22.400> this<00:02:22.670> crease<00:02:23.030> over<00:02:23.239> here<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.140> now

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
to reverse this crease over here so now

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.410 
to reverse this crease over here so now
it's<00:02:24.530> being<00:02:24.739> folded<00:02:25.040> like<00:02:25.400> this<00:02:25.640> you're<00:02:26.239> just

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
it's being folded like this you're just

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.590 
it's being folded like this you're just
going<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.690> fold<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.050> over<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.590> back<00:02:28.600> like

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
going to fold it over to the back like

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.300 
going to fold it over to the back like
that<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:30.250> then<00:02:31.250> flatten<00:02:32.890> go<00:02:33.890> ahead<00:02:34.160> and

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
that and then flatten go ahead and

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.520 
that and then flatten go ahead and
repeat<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.790> same<00:02:34.970> thing<00:02:35.030> on<00:02:35.360> this<00:02:35.540> side<00:02:35.780> so

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
repeat the same thing on this side so

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.170 
repeat the same thing on this side so
again<00:02:36.560> we're<00:02:36.950> going<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.190> reverse<00:02:37.579> this<00:02:37.850> crease

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
again we're going to reverse this crease

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:47.890 
again we're going to reverse this crease
over<00:02:38.510> here<00:02:38.799> fold<00:02:39.799> it<00:02:40.010> back<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:42.489> plan<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.780> now

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
over here fold it back and plan so now

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.300 
over here fold it back and plan so now
you're<00:02:48.049> just<00:02:48.200> going<00:02:48.320> to<00:02:48.410> go<00:02:48.500> ahead<00:02:48.829> and<00:02:49.070> draw

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
you're just going to go ahead and draw

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.759 
you're just going to go ahead and draw
your<00:02:49.489> eyeball<00:02:49.970> at<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.269> center<00:02:50.660> over<00:02:50.780> here<00:02:50.959> so

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
your eyeball at the center over here so

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.610 
your eyeball at the center over here so
where<00:02:51.980> that<00:02:52.160> center<00:02:52.579> point<00:02:52.790> is<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:53.930> I'm<00:02:54.290> going

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
where that center point is so I'm going

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.850 
where that center point is so I'm going
to<00:02:55.959> quickly<00:02:56.959> draw<00:02:57.350> one<00:02:59.620> I'm<00:03:00.620> going<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.769> start

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
to quickly draw one I'm going to start

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.740 
to quickly draw one I'm going to start
off<00:03:01.070> with<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.280> circle<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.180> then<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.390> smaller

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
off with a circle and then a smaller

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.140 
off with a circle and then a smaller
circle<00:03:03.260> right<00:03:03.440> over<00:03:03.680> here<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:04.250> then<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.820> tiny

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
circle right over here and then a tiny

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.800 
circle right over here and then a tiny
your<00:03:05.390> circle<00:03:05.780> right<00:03:05.989> at<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.470> center<00:03:07.600> then<00:03:08.600> I'm

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
your circle right at the center then I'm

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.380 
your circle right at the center then I'm
going<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.200> take<00:03:09.470> this<00:03:09.980> blue<00:03:10.549> sharpie<00:03:11.120> over

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390

I'm<00:03:23.010> just<00:03:23.220> going<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.520> draw<00:03:23.790> some<00:03:23.820> squiggly

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
I'm just going to draw some squiggly

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.910 
I'm just going to draw some squiggly
lines<00:03:24.930> over<00:03:25.290> here<00:03:25.320> with<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.520> red<00:03:26.790> sharpie<00:03:27.180> and

you know it's almost Halloween so I
wanted<00:03:36.300> to<00:03:36.450> draw<00:03:36.660> something<00:03:37.650> kind<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.190> creepy

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
wanted to draw something kind of creepy

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.930 
wanted to draw something kind of creepy
looking<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.290> yeah<00:03:40.290> anyway<00:03:40.770> so<00:03:40.980> there<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.730> is

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.250 

after<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.090> you're<00:03:45.240> just<00:03:45.300> going<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.750> refold

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
after that you're just going to refold

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.320 
after that you're just going to refold
these<00:03:46.500> two<00:03:46.710> folds<00:03:47.190> over<00:03:47.280> here<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:48.180> you're

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
these two folds over here so you're

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.890 
these two folds over here so you're
going<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.540> fold<00:03:48.840> that<00:03:48.900> up<00:03:49.200> like<00:03:49.800> that<00:03:50.900> rotate

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
going to fold that up like that rotate

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.100 
going to fold that up like that rotate
and<00:03:52.110> then<00:03:53.010> repeat<00:03:53.730> on<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.000> other<00:03:54.150> side<00:03:54.420> so

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
and then repeat on the other side so

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.920 
and then repeat on the other side so
just<00:03:55.350> like<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:56.450> all<00:03:57.450> right

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
just like that all right

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.720 
just like that all right
then<00:03:58.709> you're<00:03:58.860> going<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.070> flip<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.610> entire

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
then you're going to flip the entire

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.140 
then you're going to flip the entire
thing<00:04:00.270> over<00:04:00.390> like<00:04:00.810> this<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.730> you're<00:04:02.730> going<00:04:03.000> to

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
thing over like this and you're going to

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.110 
thing over like this and you're going to
take<00:04:03.420> notice<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:04.140> this<00:04:05.070> Center<00:04:05.580> crease<00:04:05.880> right

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
take notice of this Center crease right

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.850 
take notice of this Center crease right
over<00:04:06.360> here<00:04:06.600> or<00:04:06.780> rather<00:04:07.080> this<00:04:07.440> Center

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
over here or rather this Center

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.330 
over here or rather this Center
intersection<00:04:09.110> you're<00:04:10.110> going<00:04:10.350> to<00:04:10.440> align<00:04:10.830> this

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
intersection you're going to align this

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.710 
intersection you're going to align this
side<00:04:11.640> over<00:04:11.880> here<00:04:12.030> with<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:12.950> intersection<00:04:14.720> so

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
side over here with that intersection so

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.160 
side over here with that intersection so
just<00:04:15.930> lift<00:04:16.140> it<00:04:16.260> up<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.680> fold<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.370> over<00:04:17.489> and

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
just lift it up and fold it over and

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:27.710 
just lift it up and fold it over and
then<00:04:19.880> crease<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:21.060> in<00:04:24.919> and<00:04:26.270> rotate<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.510> repeat

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
then crease it in and rotate and repeat

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:35.740 
then crease it in and rotate and repeat
the<00:04:28.050> same<00:04:28.230> thing<00:04:28.290> in<00:04:28.620> this<00:04:28.800> direction<00:04:29.460> just

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.890 

like<00:04:36.750> this<00:04:38.419> so<00:04:39.419> now<00:04:39.540> you<00:04:39.600> should<00:04:39.690> have

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
like this so now you should have

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.270 
like this so now you should have
something<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.260> looks<00:04:40.500> like<00:04:40.650> this

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
something that looks like this

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.790 
something that looks like this
and<00:04:41.370> now<00:04:42.270> what<00:04:42.450> you<00:04:42.570> want<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:42.840> do<00:04:42.990> is<00:04:43.290> you<00:04:43.560> want

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
and now what you want to do is you want

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.240 
and now what you want to do is you want
to<00:04:43.950> take<00:04:44.520> notice<00:04:44.850> of<00:04:45.470> this<00:04:46.470> vertical<00:04:47.100> crease

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
to take notice of this vertical crease

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.750 
to take notice of this vertical crease
right<00:04:47.610> over<00:04:47.910> here<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.560> also<00:04:49.560> this<00:04:49.980> horizontal

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
right over here and also this horizontal

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.020 
right over here and also this horizontal
crease<00:04:50.940> right<00:04:51.360> over<00:04:51.930> here<00:04:52.260> and<00:04:52.700> the<00:04:53.700> folds

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
crease right over here and the folds

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.210 
crease right over here and the folds
that<00:04:54.240> we're<00:04:54.419> going<00:04:54.630> to<00:04:54.750> make<00:04:55.080> next<00:04:55.410> are<00:04:55.740> going

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
that we're going to make next are going

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.600 
that we're going to make next are going
to<00:04:56.460> be<00:04:56.640> from<00:04:57.450> this<00:04:57.840> point<00:04:58.169> at<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.560> bottom<00:04:58.710> to

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
to be from this point at the bottom to

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.630 
to be from this point at the bottom to
this<00:04:59.760> point<00:05:00.090> at<00:05:00.480> the<00:05:00.660> far<00:05:00.930> right<00:05:00.960> so<00:05:01.650> something

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
this point at the far right so something

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.460 
this point at the far right so something
like<00:05:02.669> that<00:05:04.820> okay<00:05:05.820> and<00:05:06.030> on<00:05:06.600> this<00:05:06.780> end<00:05:07.050> is<00:05:07.229> going

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
like that okay and on this end is going

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.640 
like that okay and on this end is going
to<00:05:07.650> be<00:05:07.830> from<00:05:08.100> here<00:05:08.130> to<00:05:10.010> here

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:22.820 

from<00:05:14.370> here<00:05:16.010> to<00:05:17.010> here<00:05:17.040> and<00:05:18.949> then<00:05:19.949> from<00:05:20.160> here<00:05:21.830> to

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
from here to here and then from here to

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.460 
from here to here and then from here to
here<00:05:23.100> so<00:05:23.820> essentially<00:05:24.389> it's<00:05:24.570> going<00:05:24.630> to<00:05:24.960> form<00:05:25.260> a

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
here so essentially it's going to form a

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.020 
here so essentially it's going to form a
diamond<00:05:26.130> shape<00:05:26.370> just<00:05:26.820> like<00:05:26.970> that<00:05:27.680> okay<00:05:29.030> so

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
diamond shape just like that okay so

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.310 
diamond shape just like that okay so
you're<00:05:30.180> just<00:05:30.240> going<00:05:30.510> to<00:05:30.660> go<00:05:30.780> ahead<00:05:30.930> and<00:05:31.199> make

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
you're just going to go ahead and make

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.680 
you're just going to go ahead and make
those<00:05:31.560> folds<00:05:32.010> so<00:05:32.220> fold<00:05:32.460> along<00:05:32.610> that<00:05:33.120> line<00:05:33.389> that

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
those folds so fold along that line that

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:41.120 
those folds so fold along that line that

long<00:06:17.100> horizontal<00:06:17.700> center<00:06:18.419> crease<00:06:18.660> so<00:06:19.530> just

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
long horizontal center crease so just

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.870

this

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.900 

repeat<00:06:39.080> the<00:06:39.200> same<00:06:39.410> thing<00:06:39.710> on<00:06:39.890> this<00:06:40.160> side<00:06:40.400> fold

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.550 

it<00:06:43.910> down<00:06:44.150> so<00:06:44.180> that<00:06:44.450> aligns<00:06:45.050> with<00:06:45.290> this

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560

horizontal<00:06:45.950> crease<00:06:46.400> right<00:06:46.730> over<00:06:46.940> here<00:06:47.890> and

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
horizontal crease right over here and

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.360 
horizontal crease right over here and
fold<00:06:50.900> this<00:06:51.110> part<00:06:51.350> up<00:06:51.530> so<00:06:52.070> that<00:06:52.420> it<00:06:54.070> aligns<00:06:55.070> with

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370
