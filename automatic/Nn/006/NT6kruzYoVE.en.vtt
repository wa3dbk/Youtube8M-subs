for<00:02:56.489> Mad<00:02:56.670> Dog<00:02:56.910> what<00:02:57.810> excited<00:02:58.290> us<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.620> most<00:02:58.830> is

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
for Mad Dog what excited us the most is

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.160 
for Mad Dog what excited us the most is
the<00:02:59.310> fact<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.700> as<00:02:59.970> Sports<00:03:00.330> evolved<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.140> you

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
the fact that as Sports evolved and you

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.199 
the fact that as Sports evolved and you
look<00:03:01.739> at<00:03:01.890> ESPN<00:03:02.370> where<00:03:02.610> they<00:03:02.730> had<00:03:02.910> all<00:03:03.090> the

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
look at ESPN where they had all the

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.140 
look at ESPN where they had all the
games<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.750> then<00:03:04.230> ultimately<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:05.220> morning<00:03:05.880> show

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
games and then ultimately a morning show

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.300 
games and then ultimately a morning show
what<00:03:06.720> we<00:03:06.870> have<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.260> potential<00:03:07.590> now<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:08.160> we

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
what we have the potential now is we

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.430 
what we have the potential now is we
have<00:03:08.340> all<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.819> games<00:03:09.060> by<00:03:09.900> virtue<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.410> the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
have all the games by virtue and the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.870 
have all the games by virtue and the
bandwidth<00:03:10.859> it<00:03:11.010> actually<00:03:11.280> sounds<00:03:11.549> pretty<00:03:11.579> good

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
bandwidth it actually sounds pretty good

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.949 
bandwidth it actually sounds pretty good
I<00:03:11.940> guess<00:03:12.120> he<00:03:12.239> looked<00:03:12.420> like<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.600> deer<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
I guess he looked like a deer in the

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.030 
I guess he looked like a deer in the
headlights<00:03:15.079> answering<00:03:16.079> that<00:03:16.200> question<00:03:16.410> he's

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
headlights answering that question he's

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.680 
headlights answering that question he's
pretty<00:03:17.250> good<00:03:17.400> though<00:03:17.519> himself<00:03:18.150> well<00:03:18.359> Scott

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
pretty good though himself well Scott

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.039 
pretty good though himself well Scott
but<00:03:20.030> he<00:03:21.030> didn't<00:03:21.180> look<00:03:21.269> like<00:03:21.329> he<00:03:21.480> wanted<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.900> be

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
but he didn't look like he wanted to be

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.770 
but he didn't look like he wanted to be
there<00:03:22.459> you<00:03:23.459> know<00:03:23.609> it<00:03:23.970> looked<00:03:24.150> like<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.299> burden

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
there you know it looked like a burden

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.270 
there you know it looked like a burden
