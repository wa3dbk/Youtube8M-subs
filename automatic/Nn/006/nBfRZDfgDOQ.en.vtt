00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:11.490
 good we'll talk good government tÃ¡ 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.730
 This party was studied today is the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.509
 ghat reference he reported my 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.509
 determined 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.189
 a detail about the lungs the main 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:29.450
 functions are the lung is that's where matosi 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.289
 is blood exchange venous blood 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.660
 arterial 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.400
 sent from the heart through the 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.840
 pulmonary arteries 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:42.280
 venous blood co2 vehicles is to send the 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.879
 lung where it happens in the alveoli 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.460
 just this haematological oxygen 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:52.070
 is transferred through the bases 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.070
 arterioles and then makes this blood 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.860
 venous in blood and oxygen today 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.620
 it is imperative for red blood because 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.129
 returns from the lung through the veins 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.009
 then goes from the heart to the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.780
 arteries as in venous blood 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.060
 it happens there, the main ones 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.520
 lung activities because the exchange of 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.580
 venous blood is dangerous 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.039
 is red blood and oxygen proteins 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.700
 vitamins returns to the veins 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:25.430
 pulmonary artery enters the left atrium and 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.670
 of the left ventricle and the optic 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.790
 the main branches around major 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.310
 parts of the body to nourish the organism 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.040
 Okay, so let's talk about the qualities 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.360
 we have a tracker 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:46.610
 the trachea we have here only citing the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:50.240
 tracheal ring tracheal ring is here 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.380
 our strategy is body give to who 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.960
 illustrates that ok all right 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.320
 so we have here the first part 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.780
 quality that good that the track 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.830
 so here is the first exit 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.700
 bronque tracheal, then we go 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.700
 show the fia 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:19.840
 soon high on high 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:22.060
 You are soon to win a part of the valley. 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.150
 emphasize the eggs terms 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.400
 anteriorly as apical and 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.230
 ask to leave the veterinary medicine 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.470
 which is the most commonly used term in medicine 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.310
 human in the human reference books 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.350
 then the reference books 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.740
 Today the term is coming. 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.890
 apical previously said right apical 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.209
 daniel so now it's only globe 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.340
 terminal and the path to the final 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.570
 we have here another structure here 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.250
 O 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:57.130
 this other structure here I soon medium 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.370
 ok soon 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:04.720
 I have here and here 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.930
 logo diaphragmatic logo diaphragmatic logo 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:13.000
 between the two we have here 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:20.560
 logo accessory accessory he 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.660
 leaves right from the main branch 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.239
 here is the main bronchus 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.769
 It's good that the main one left love. 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.600
 accessory 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.790
 we have another view here again 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.680
 games are the pragmatic day 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.680
 soon the sessions 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:51.390
 Here we have, then, a genial father of 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:54.000
 caudal logo cream then recapitulating a 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.630
 good governance that one of the main 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.900
 activities may eat it and killed the 11 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.230
 change of direction of what is 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.530
 alveoli is made the passage of oxygen 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.820
 that is inside the alveoli for the 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:14.910
 previous term which happens and only 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:18.390
 this genius he nourishes the venous blood 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.250
 where the arterial blood becomes the blood 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.330
 red rich in vitamins and proteins 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.620
 that makes this blood through these bands 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.430
 a nose opens into the left atrium 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.370
 reentry with the left and aortic valve 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:41.930
 there it will nourish the organism 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:46.080
 We have promoted long crane to 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:52.950
 truck can be champion 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:56.550
 logo brand new pragmatic average flow 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:59.990
 logo accessory we have here a 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:05.780
 main bronchus correct 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.780
 we have again soon 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:15.919
 here's right the o'kane nerd to the caudal and 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:19.610
 the champion and we have the trachea here 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:24.039
 How is the name of the government? 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.039
 the reference is the gadget
