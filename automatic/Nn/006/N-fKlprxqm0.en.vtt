now<00:01:25.190> this<00:01:25.340> windshield<00:01:25.729> is<00:01:25.910> integrated<00:01:26.570> and

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
now this windshield is integrated and

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.850 
now this windshield is integrated and
it's<00:01:26.810> part<00:01:27.080> of<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.229> structure<00:01:27.679> of<00:01:27.710> the

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.449 
it's part of the structure of the
hardtop<00:01:28.130> what<00:01:28.970> that<00:01:29.179> does<00:01:29.420> is<00:01:29.690> it<00:01:30.200> eliminates

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:30.459 
hardtop what that does is it eliminates

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:32.410 
hardtop what that does is it eliminates

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
forward I like that set up the fact is

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.330 
forward I like that set up the fact is
the<00:01:35.660> rest<00:01:35.899> of<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.110> supports<00:01:36.530> here<00:01:36.770> are<00:01:36.950> powder

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
the rest of the supports here are powder

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.279 
the rest of the supports here are powder
coated<00:01:37.490> it's<00:01:37.940> a<00:01:38.000> great<00:01:38.270> finish<00:01:38.630> it's<00:01:38.869> durable

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.100 
coated it's a great finish it's durable
and<00:01:39.380> looks<00:01:39.679> good<00:01:39.860> for<00:01:40.160> a<00:01:40.190> long<00:01:40.429> time

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
and looks good for a long time

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.210 
and looks good for a long time
ultimately<00:01:42.110> though<00:01:42.349> what<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:42.709> get<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.069> the

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
ultimately though what you get is the

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.249 
ultimately though what you get is the
best<00:01:43.429> possible<00:01:44.119> view<00:01:44.360> forward<00:01:44.690> and<00:01:44.929> I<00:01:44.989> really

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
best possible view forward and I really

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.859 
best possible view forward and I really
