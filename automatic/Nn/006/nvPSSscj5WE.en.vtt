demo tutorial out for XCOM and is a

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.770 
demo tutorial out for XCOM and is a
little<00:03:16.100> bit<00:03:16.190> more<00:03:16.340> storage<00:03:16.670> ribbon<00:03:17.270> and<00:03:17.510> lots

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
little bit more storage ribbon and lots

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.330 
little bit more storage ribbon and lots
of<00:03:17.960> cinematic<00:03:18.590> so<00:03:18.740> a<00:03:18.770> lot<00:03:18.950> people<00:03:19.040> aren't

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
of cinematic so a lot people aren't

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.560 
of cinematic so a lot people aren't
liking<00:03:19.520> that<00:03:19.760> but<00:03:20.000> don't<00:03:20.120> worry<00:03:20.300> the<00:03:20.420> game

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
liking that but don't worry the game

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.090 
liking that but don't worry the game
isn't<00:03:20.870> gonna<00:03:20.930> be<00:03:21.140> like<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.440> probably<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:21.860> said

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
isn't gonna be like that probably I said

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.370 
isn't gonna be like that probably I said
probably<00:03:22.310> right<00:03:22.580> let's<00:03:23.090> hope<00:03:23.300> so<00:03:23.750> an<00:03:23.870> alleged

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
probably right let's hope so an alleged

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.470 
probably right let's hope so an alleged
survey<00:03:24.890> came<00:03:25.100> out<00:03:25.280> from<00:03:25.490> 2k<00:03:25.850> games<00:03:25.880> all<00:03:26.450> about

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
survey came out from 2k games all about

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.390 
survey came out from 2k games all about
maps<00:03:27.110> and<00:03:27.410> everything<00:03:27.680> else<00:03:27.830> about<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.160> game

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
maps and everything else about the game

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.310 
maps and everything else about the game
so<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.940> looks<00:03:29.180> like<00:03:29.300> they're<00:03:29.960> trying<00:03:30.050> to<00:03:30.230> get

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
so it looks like they're trying to get

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.510 
so it looks like they're trying to get
more<00:03:30.410> testing<00:03:30.800> down<00:03:30.950> about<00:03:31.130> this<00:03:31.340> and

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
more testing down about this and

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.740 
more testing down about this and
everything<00:03:31.670> else<00:03:31.940> all<00:03:32.180> I<00:03:32.240> gotta<00:03:32.510> say<00:03:32.570> is

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
everything else all I gotta say is

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.230 
everything else all I gotta say is
nobody<00:03:33.260> ever<00:03:33.470> wanted<00:03:34.010> this<00:03:34.100> game<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.520> exist<00:03:35.000> as

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
nobody ever wanted this game to exist as

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.940 
nobody ever wanted this game to exist as
a<00:03:35.390> first<00:03:35.600> person<00:03:35.780> shooter<00:03:35.960> it<00:03:36.410> was<00:03:36.530> always<00:03:36.770> an
