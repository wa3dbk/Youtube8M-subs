it's<00:01:53.850> kind<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.210> tradition<00:01:54.659> if<00:01:55.290> you're

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
it's kind of like a tradition if you're

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.069 
it's kind of like a tradition if you're
a<00:01:55.470> team<00:01:55.680> losi<00:01:55.829> driver<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.369> run<00:01:56.520> yellow<00:01:56.820> wheels

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
rules don't really apply you can run

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.389 
rules don't really apply you can run
whatever<00:02:00.450> color<00:02:00.750> wheels<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.140> want<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.409> run<00:02:01.560> so

here's bagby and looks like again it's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.930 
here's bagby and looks like again it's
the<00:02:06.049> rear<00:02:07.049> shock<00:02:07.320> tower<00:02:07.560> rear<00:02:08.280> bulkhead<00:02:08.550> brace

it comes with the comes the clear body

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.479 
it comes with the comes the clear body
and<00:02:15.930> unfortunately<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.260> think<00:02:18.130> that<00:02:18.250> losi

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
and unfortunately you think that losi

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.710 
and unfortunately you think that losi
would<00:02:18.580> have<00:02:18.670> stepped<00:02:18.819> it<00:02:18.970> up<00:02:19.030> by<00:02:19.180> now<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.450> sent

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
would have stepped it up by now and sent

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.339 
would have stepped it up by now and sent
a<00:02:19.810> cab<00:02:20.050> forward<00:02:20.319> body<00:02:20.590> but<00:02:21.069> this<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.430> actually

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
a cab forward body but this is actually

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.809 
a cab forward body but this is actually
not<00:02:23.349> a<00:02:23.410> camp<00:02:23.680> for<00:02:23.830> body<00:02:24.040> this<00:02:24.250> is<00:02:24.370> just<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.640> old

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
not a camp for body this is just the old

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.580 
not a camp for body this is just the old
school<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.480> don't<00:02:26.140> know<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.290> thing<00:02:26.440> looks

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
school I don't know this thing looks

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.500 
school I don't know this thing looks
like<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.770> bullet<00:02:27.010> but<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:28.060> be<00:02:28.180> asked<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.420> I'm

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
like a bullet but to be asked the I'm

not a huge fan of this body but I'll

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.840 
not a huge fan of this body but I'll
probably<00:02:29.950> cut<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:30.370> out<00:02:30.430> run<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.700> for<00:02:30.790> a

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
some of the other vehicles but that's

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.300 
some of the other vehicles but that's
that<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:58.170> then<00:02:59.170> there's<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.560> looks<00:03:00.130> like<00:03:00.250> it

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
that and then there's the looks like it

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.680 
that and then there's the looks like it
has<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.459> separate<00:03:00.790> mid<00:03:00.970> motor<00:03:01.150> bag<00:03:01.390> which<00:03:01.569> is

has a separate mid motor bag which is

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.000 
has a separate mid motor bag which is
exactly<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.110> way<00:03:02.200> kyosho<00:03:02.560> does<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:02.860> looks

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
exactly the way kyosho does it looks

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
exactly the way kyosho does it looks
like<00:03:03.160> if<00:03:03.310> you're<00:03:03.459> going<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.640> build<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.880> car

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
like if you're going to build the car

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.880 
like if you're going to build the car
mid<00:03:04.239> motor<00:03:04.450> you<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:04.959> if<00:03:05.470> you're<00:03:05.560> in<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.680> billet

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890

mid motor you just if you're in a billet
rear<00:03:06.010> motor<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.340> don't<00:03:06.489> probably<00:03:06.670> only<00:03:06.910> have

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
rear motor you don't probably only have

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.759 
rear motor you don't probably only have
to<00:03:07.209> open<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:07.540> bag<00:03:07.780> but<00:03:08.410> if<00:03:08.500> you're<00:03:08.590> going<00:03:08.680> to

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
to open this bag but if you're going to

to open this bag but if you're going to
build<00:03:08.860> a<00:03:08.980> mid<00:03:09.130> motor<00:03:09.310> obviously<00:03:09.850> you'll<00:03:09.970> crack

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
build a mid motor obviously you'll crack

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.449 
build a mid motor obviously you'll crack
this<00:03:10.420> open<00:03:10.569> and<00:03:10.870> all<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.200> mid<00:03:11.769> motor<00:03:11.980> specific

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.610 
this open and all the mid motor specific
parts<00:03:12.700> will<00:03:12.819> be<00:03:12.880> in<00:03:12.970> there<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.380> last<00:03:14.380> but<00:03:14.470> not

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
parts will be in there and last but not

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.400 
parts will be in there and last but not
least<00:03:14.680> here<00:03:15.549> is<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.970> tlr<00:03:16.630> aluminum<00:03:17.230> chassis

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
least here is the tlr aluminum chassis

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.870 
least here is the tlr aluminum chassis
you<00:03:17.709> can<00:03:17.829> see<00:03:17.950> it's<00:03:18.070> got<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.190> kind<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:18.760> got<00:03:18.850> a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
you can see it's got a kind of got a

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.449 
you can see it's got a kind of got a
nice<00:03:19.410> anodized<00:03:20.410> finish<00:03:20.440> on<00:03:20.859> it<00:03:20.890> looks<00:03:21.340> like

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
nice anodized finish on it looks like

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.650 
nice anodized finish on it looks like
that<00:03:21.579> must<00:03:21.670> be<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.970> serial<00:03:22.269> number<00:03:22.510> and

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
that must be the serial number and

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.690 
that must be the serial number and
there's<00:03:23.019> some<00:03:23.140> etching<00:03:23.470> on<00:03:23.590> here<00:03:23.859> although<00:03:24.640> i

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
there's some etching on here although i

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.770 
there's some etching on here although i
don't<00:03:24.790> know<00:03:25.000> that<00:03:25.120> i'll<00:03:25.209> end<00:03:25.299> up<00:03:25.390> running<00:03:25.570> this

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
don't know that i'll end up running this

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.120 
don't know that i'll end up running this
chassis<00:03:26.200> long-term<00:03:26.590> because<00:03:26.799> there's

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
chassis long-term because there's

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.650 
chassis long-term because there's
another<00:03:27.310> guy<00:03:27.519> out<00:03:27.700> there<00:03:27.910> that's<00:03:28.540> actually

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
another guy out there that's actually

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.390 
another guy out there that's actually
making<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.200> shorter<00:03:29.500> chassis<00:03:29.890> and<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.250> lot<00:03:30.370> of

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
making a shorter chassis and a lot of

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.650 
making a shorter chassis and a lot of
the<00:03:30.519> factory<00:03:30.820> drivers<00:03:31.180> are<00:03:31.299> actually<00:03:31.540> running

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
the factory drivers are actually running

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.289 
the factory drivers are actually running
a<00:03:31.959> slightly<00:03:32.560> shorter<00:03:32.680> chassis<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.579> that'll<00:03:34.209> be

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
a slightly shorter chassis so that'll be

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.360 
a slightly shorter chassis so that'll be
in<00:03:34.359> the<00:03:34.420> next<00:03:34.540> video<00:03:34.840> but<00:03:35.109> that's<00:03:35.769> that<00:03:35.980> as<00:03:36.190> you

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
in the next video but that's that as you

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.530 
in the next video but that's that as you
can<00:03:36.489> see<00:03:36.640> all<00:03:36.670> that's<00:03:36.850> left<00:03:37.000> in<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.209> box<00:03:37.359> now

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
can see all that's left in the box now

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.199 
can see all that's left in the box now
are<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.350> instructions<00:03:39.000> stickers<00:03:40.000> and

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
are the instructions stickers and

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.810 
are the instructions stickers and
antenna<00:03:40.480> tube<00:03:40.720> so<00:03:41.079> that<00:03:41.380> is<00:03:41.980> what<00:03:42.519> you<00:03:42.640> get

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
antenna tube so that is what you get

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
antenna tube so that is what you get
when<00:03:43.269> you<00:03:43.450> buy<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:44.079> team<00:03:44.470> losi<00:03:44.650> 22<00:03:45.519> two<00:03:45.850> point<00:03:46.090> oh
