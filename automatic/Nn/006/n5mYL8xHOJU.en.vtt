00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
which activates the physics feature so

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.350 
which activates the physics feature so
it<00:01:16.920> basically<00:01:17.310> acts<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.759> way<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.970> turn<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
it basically acts as a way to turn the

feature on and off at will overall like

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.580

the other hype dt plugins it's
ultimately<00:01:23.009> going<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.369> come<00:01:23.520> down<00:01:23.640> to

ultimately going to come down to

ultimately going to come down to
personal<00:01:24.030> preference<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.080> not<00:01:25.229> exactly

personal preference and it's not exactly

personal preference and it's not exactly
a<00:01:25.619> game<00:01:25.860> changer<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.580> think<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.850> makes<00:01:26.939> for

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
a game changer but we think it makes for

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.240 
a game changer but we think it makes for
a<00:01:27.150> nice<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:27.330> addition<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> game<00:01:28.290> for

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
a nice little addition to the game for

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.830 
a nice little addition to the game for
the<00:01:29.430> second<00:01:29.820> mode<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> spotlight<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:30.659> have

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the second mode of the spotlight we have

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.870 
the second mode of the spotlight we have
Jackson's<00:01:31.320> renamer<00:01:31.770> some<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.700> might

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
Jackson's renamer some of you might

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.550 
Jackson's renamer some of you might
remember<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.299> Jackson's<00:01:33.810> positioner<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
remember the Jackson's positioner and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.140 
remember the Jackson's positioner and
what<00:01:34.890> they<00:01:35.009> let<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.250> pick<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.729> manipulate

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
what they let you pick up and manipulate

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.819 
what they let you pick up and manipulate
nearly<00:01:36.450> every<00:01:36.750> static<00:01:37.110> object<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> game

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
nearly every static object in the game

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.280 
nearly every static object in the game
so<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.880> example<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.420> could<00:01:39.570> pick<00:01:39.689> up<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.900> table

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
so for example you could pick up a table

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.410 
so for example you could pick up a table
and<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:40.619> resize<00:01:41.009> move<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.850> even<00:01:41.970> place<00:01:42.270> it

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and then resize move and even place it

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.630 
and then resize move and even place it
into<00:01:42.540> your<00:01:42.720> inventory<00:01:42.930> for<00:01:43.350> later<00:01:43.530> use<00:01:43.860> well

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
into your inventory for later use well

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.520 
into your inventory for later use well
the<00:01:44.850> rename<00:01:45.180> was<00:01:45.360> essentially<00:01:45.930> an<00:01:46.020> extension

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the rename was essentially an extension

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.350 
the rename was essentially an extension
to<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.799> mud<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.460> makes<00:01:47.610> use<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.909> recently

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
to that mud and it makes use of recently

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.999 
to that mud and it makes use of recently
released<00:01:48.600> UI<00:01:48.810> resources<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.680> let<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.860> rename

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
released UI resources to let you rename

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.410 
released UI resources to let you rename
pretty<00:01:50.369> much<00:01:50.549> every<00:01:50.880> object<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.390> game

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
pretty much every object in the game

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.870 
pretty much every object in the game
this<00:01:52.110> includes<00:01:52.500> containers<00:01:53.130> people<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
this includes containers people and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.450 
this includes containers people and
creatures<00:01:54.299> at<00:01:55.140> first<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.770> might<00:01:56.009> not<00:01:56.070> seem

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
creatures at first this might not seem

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.399 
creatures at first this might not seem
like<00:01:56.640> much<00:01:56.670> but<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.450> fact<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.869> can<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.020> used<00:01:58.290> in

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
like much but in fact it can be used in

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.920 
like much but in fact it can be used in
a<00:01:58.469> variety<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.920> handy<00:01:59.250> ways<00:01:59.430> so<00:02:00.270> for<00:02:00.479> example

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
a variety of handy ways so for example

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.600 
a variety of handy ways so for example
you<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.110> individually<00:02:01.770> name<00:02:01.979> your<00:02:02.159> horses

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
you can individually name your horses

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.850 
you can individually name your horses
pets<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.240> follow<00:02:03.479> us<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.290> could<00:02:04.439> even<00:02:04.590> take

pets and follow us you could even take

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.380 
pets and follow us you could even take
it<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.070> step<00:02:05.280> further<00:02:05.340> by<00:02:05.790> combining<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.360> with

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
it a step further by combining it with

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.089 
it a step further by combining it with
the<00:02:06.540> Jacksons<00:02:06.960> positioner<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.530> very<00:02:07.860> easily

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
the Jacksons positioner to very easily

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.919 
the Jacksons positioner to very easily
set<00:02:08.459> up<00:02:08.580> an<00:02:08.700> organized<00:02:09.060> chest<00:02:09.390> sorting<00:02:09.720> system

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
set up an organized chest sorting system

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.199 
set up an organized chest sorting system
with<00:02:10.229> their<00:02:10.319> own<00:02:10.500> labels<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.700> positioner

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
with their own labels the positioner

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.290 
with their own labels the positioner
opens<00:02:12.569> up<00:02:12.720> almost<00:02:13.020> n

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
opens up almost n

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.820 
opens up almost n
possibilities<00:02:14.020> in<00:02:14.170> what<00:02:14.320> you<00:02:14.410> could<00:02:14.560> create

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
possibilities in what you could create

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.710 
possibilities in what you could create
so<00:02:15.340> you're<00:02:15.520> technically<00:02:15.880> redesign<00:02:16.390> entire

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
so you're technically redesign entire

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.930 
so you're technically redesign entire
cities<00:02:17.140> player<00:02:17.590> homes<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.130> more<00:02:18.280> but

cities player homes and more but
obviously<00:02:19.330> it's<00:02:19.510> mainly<00:02:19.720> designed<00:02:20.020> for<00:02:20.380> the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
obviously it's mainly designed for the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.710 
obviously it's mainly designed for the
smaller<00:02:20.740> touches<00:02:21.220> we've<00:02:22.060> even<00:02:22.390> used<00:02:22.420> it

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
smaller touches we've even used it

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.450 
smaller touches we've even used it
recently<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.350> simple<00:02:23.680> taxes<00:02:24.070> spotlight

to show you how a tax clicks and

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.540 
to show you how a tax clicks and
strongbox<00:02:26.380> would<00:02:26.620> look<00:02:26.740> outside<00:02:27.040> Brie's<00:02:27.340> home

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
strongbox would look outside Brie's home
