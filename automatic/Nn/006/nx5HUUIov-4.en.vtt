they're able to X and I think that comes

with<00:01:06.950> friendship<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:07.820> I<00:01:08.210> think<00:01:08.390> our<00:01:08.869> team<00:01:09.140> is

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
with friendship so I think our team is

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.660 
with friendship so I think our team is
very<00:01:09.409> close-knit<00:01:09.710> we're<00:01:10.159> all<00:01:10.280> really<00:01:10.460> good

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
very close-knit we're all really good

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.459 
very close-knit we're all really good
friends<00:01:10.729> each<00:01:11.030> other<00:01:11.390> we<00:01:11.840> trust<00:01:12.200> each<00:01:12.289> other

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
friends each other we trust each other

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.020 
friends each other we trust each other
with<00:01:12.770> anything<00:01:13.100> our<00:01:13.280> seek<00:01:13.490> its<00:01:13.700> whatever

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
with anything our seek its whatever

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.690 
with anything our seek its whatever
Dakota<00:01:14.630> all<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.140> time<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.009> I<00:01:16.340> think<00:01:16.520> that

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
Dakota all the time so I think that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.819 
Dakota all the time so I think that
correlates<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:17.299> team<00:01:18.049> play<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:18.500> like<00:01:18.619> just

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
correlates to team play and like just

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.910 
correlates to team play and like just
team<00:01:19.789> fights<00:01:19.999> and<00:01:20.179> everything<00:01:20.479> I<00:01:20.630> guess

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.140 

basically<00:01:23.920> with<00:01:24.100> this<00:01:24.250> team<00:01:24.460> I<00:01:24.640> feel<00:01:24.910> like<00:01:25.030> I

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
basically with this team I feel like I

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.050 
basically with this team I feel like I
can<00:01:25.330> trust<00:01:25.360> I<00:01:25.870> recall<00:01:26.320> whereas<00:01:27.160> with<00:01:27.490> my<00:01:27.850> old

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
can trust I recall whereas with my old

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.100 
can trust I recall whereas with my old
teams<00:01:28.300> I<00:01:28.510> would<00:01:28.630> never<00:01:28.720> be<00:01:28.870> able<00:01:28.930> to<00:01:29.020> trust

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
teams I would never be able to trust

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.840 
teams I would never be able to trust
half<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:29.560> calls<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:29.980> I<00:01:30.100> would<00:01:30.220> be<00:01:30.340> making<00:01:30.610> up

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
half the calls and I would be making up

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.480 
half the calls and I would be making up
the<00:01:31.000> calls<00:01:31.380> whenever<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.680> call<00:01:32.920> is<00:01:33.010> made<00:01:33.190> here

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
the calls whenever a call is made here

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.550 
the calls whenever a call is made here
we<00:01:33.700> all<00:01:33.850> listen<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.390> it<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:34.720> it<00:01:35.020> almost<00:01:35.200> always

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
we all listen to it and it almost always

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.070 
we all listen to it and it almost always
works<00:01:36.040> out<00:01:36.190> it's<00:01:36.730> never<00:01:36.940> like<00:01:37.300> questionable

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
like should we go in here should we do

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.760 
like should we go in here should we do
this<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:40.090> then<00:01:40.630> like<00:01:40.960> we<00:01:41.200> go<00:01:41.380> in<00:01:41.500> it's<00:01:41.620> like

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
this and then like we go in it's like

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.870 
this and then like we go in it's like
all<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.160> and<00:01:42.280> where<00:01:42.400> if<00:01:42.490> we<00:01:42.520> shouldn't<00:01:42.730> do

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
all that and where if we shouldn't do

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.220 
all that and where if we shouldn't do
that<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.300> never<00:01:43.600> really<00:01:43.720> happens<00:01:44.050> like<00:01:44.200> that

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
that it never really happens like that

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.860 
that it never really happens like that
it's<00:01:44.710> if<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.430> call<00:01:45.610> is<00:01:45.640> made<00:01:45.910> and<00:01:46.270> we<00:01:46.390> follow<00:01:46.780> up

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
it's if a call is made and we follow up

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.080 
it's if a call is made and we follow up
on<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.050> correctly<00:01:47.440> then<00:01:47.710> we<00:01:48.160> usually<00:01:48.880> come<00:01:49.000> out

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090

North America to really test our skill
level<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:22.640> guess<00:04:22.820> so<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:24.320> next<00:04:24.530> evolution<00:04:24.650> will

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
level I guess so the next evolution will

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.860 
level I guess so the next evolution will
obviously<00:04:25.430> be<00:04:25.610> afterwards<00:04:25.940> will<00:04:26.450> either<00:04:26.600> go

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
obviously be afterwards will either go

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.590 
obviously be afterwards will either go
to<00:04:26.930> Worlds<00:04:27.440> win<00:04:28.160> it<00:04:28.310> or<00:04:28.490> get<00:04:28.850> smashed<00:04:29.150> by<00:04:29.330> some

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
to Worlds win it or get smashed by some

to Worlds win it or get smashed by some

know if we start losing games and we
have<00:04:37.040> to<00:04:37.160> like<00:04:37.310> take<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.880> look<00:04:38.120> at<00:04:38.240> how<00:04:38.330> we

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
have to like take a look at how we

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.930 
have to like take a look at how we
practice<00:04:38.630> or<00:04:39.080> how<00:04:39.230> we<00:04:39.290> you<00:04:40.070> know<00:04:40.160> researcher

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
practice or how we you know researcher

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.610 
practice or how we you know researcher
but<00:04:41.450> it's<00:04:41.600> really<00:04:41.810> hard<00:04:41.990> to<00:04:42.080> change<00:04:42.320> anything

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
but it's really hard to change anything

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.710 
but it's really hard to change anything
when<00:04:42.920> you're<00:04:43.010> doing<00:04:43.250> well<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:43.670> I<00:04:43.700> it's<00:04:44.390> hard<00:04:44.480> to

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
when you're doing well so I it's hard to

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.780 
when you're doing well so I it's hard to
tell<00:04:44.900> if<00:04:45.020> we<00:04:45.140> need<00:04:45.290> more<00:04:45.610> different<00:04:46.610> things

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
tell if we need more different things

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.400 
tell if we need more different things
right<00:04:47.030> now<00:04:47.060> a<00:04:47.420> lot<00:04:47.780> of<00:04:47.810> what<00:04:47.960> we<00:04:48.020> do<00:04:48.110> is<00:04:48.230> just

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
right now a lot of what we do is just

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.990 
right now a lot of what we do is just
teamwork<00:04:48.800> we<00:04:48.980> understand<00:04:49.460> that<00:04:49.550> it's<00:04:49.730> a<00:04:49.790> team

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
teamwork we understand that it's a team

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.060 
teamwork we understand that it's a team
game<00:04:50.030> and<00:04:50.480> instead<00:04:51.170> of<00:04:51.230> like<00:04:51.500> trying<00:04:51.770> to<00:04:51.860> look

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
game and instead of like trying to look

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.260 
game and instead of like trying to look
good<00:04:52.100> in<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.520> game<00:04:52.700> and<00:04:52.850> get<00:04:53.000> good<00:04:53.150> scores

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
and just try to 1b5 carry none of us

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.380 
and just try to 1b5 carry none of us
really<00:04:57.170> do<00:04:57.320> that<00:04:57.470> and<00:04:57.710> we<00:04:57.770> understand<00:04:58.190> that

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
really do that and we understand that

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.450

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
to be strong in the team to win I think

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.780 
to be strong in the team to win I think
teams<00:05:03.440> could<00:05:03.650> look<00:05:03.830> at<00:05:03.950> us<00:05:04.070> and<00:05:04.220> back<00:05:04.340> oh<00:05:04.520> hey

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790

hang<00:05:05.210> out<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.360> lot<00:05:05.600> to<00:05:05.810> play<00:05:05.990> a<00:05:06.020> lot<00:05:06.230> of<00:05:06.320> silicon

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
hang out a lot to play a lot of silicon

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.950 
hang out a lot to play a lot of silicon
just<00:05:07.430> understand<00:05:07.940> why<00:05:08.330> we're<00:05:08.540> doing<00:05:08.660> that

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
just understand why we're doing that

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.870 
just understand why we're doing that
we're<00:05:09.470> increasing<00:05:09.980> communication<00:05:10.160> getting

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
we're increasing communication getting

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.520 
we're increasing communication getting
people<00:05:11.180> by<00:05:11.330> hanging<00:05:11.570> out<00:05:11.780> with<00:05:11.930> them<00:05:12.080> become

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
people by hanging out with them become

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.050 
people by hanging out with them become
better<00:05:12.560> friends<00:05:12.770> with<00:05:13.070> them<00:05:13.280> so<00:05:13.940> I<00:05:13.970> think

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
better friends with them so I think

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.340 
better friends with them so I think
teams<00:05:14.360> can<00:05:14.540> definitely<00:05:14.900> learn<00:05:14.990> from<00:05:15.200> what

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
teams can definitely learn from what

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.750 
teams can definitely learn from what
we're<00:05:15.470> doing<00:05:15.680> and<00:05:15.860> we<00:05:16.160> can<00:05:16.310> learn<00:05:16.400> from<00:05:16.460> other

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
we're doing and we can learn from other

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.120 
we're doing and we can learn from other
teams<00:05:16.910> as<00:05:17.090> well
