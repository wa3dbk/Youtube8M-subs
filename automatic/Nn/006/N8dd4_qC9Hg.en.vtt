00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.840
 The first thing that must be removed are the 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.610
 gasoline lines 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.610
 that go towards the injectors 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.490
 then from a gas filter and 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.890
 old let's take the little tips out of the 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.400
 diameter that the lines of 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.910
 fuel like this is this thickness 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.640
 from the entry line 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.329
 and it's thinner than taking it out 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.230
 this team on the track 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:50.240
 will serve us for the return line 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.330
 then we put the tips 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.130
 that would be coming to the I'm going to the entrance 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:58.420
 and the capped return 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.910
 to be able to wash 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.880
 this consumption 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.570
 from the finite that you subject it to 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.570
 do not go to vote 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.690
 then as it is all because we take 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.160
 the liquid to wash I'm going to have to 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.650
 disconnecting the fuel pump 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.600
 I had to disconnect him 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.960
 the relay hello 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.060
 the possible or directly from the tank 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.509
 gasoline so that the pump no longer 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.509
 work 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.090
 we'll put it around 65 or 70 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.130
 pounds the edge takes a lot of 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.130
 fuel pressure 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.999
 learn it 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.680
 Well, here is already working 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.410
 the liquid 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.320
 of the cock 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.189
 I was ready 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.619
 on my channel is in video of 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.090
 how to make this simple jewel to wash 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.289
 injectors 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.289
 I hope someone can serve you
