00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.530 
this and I love it and when this past
years<00:01:51.410> has<00:01:52.340> been<00:01:52.550> everything<00:01:52.790> that<00:01:53.060> I<00:01:53.090> wanted

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
years has been everything that I wanted

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.760 
years has been everything that I wanted
and<00:01:53.690> I'm<00:01:55.570> this<00:01:56.570> time<00:01:56.840> I'm<00:01:57.020> gonna<00:01:57.170> be<00:01:57.290> sad<00:01:57.500> when

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
and I'm this time I'm gonna be sad when

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.430 
and I'm this time I'm gonna be sad when
it<00:01:57.890> ends<00:01:58.160> so<00:01:58.400> I<00:01:58.940> think<00:01:59.480> that's<00:01:59.930> a<00:02:00.020> sign<00:02:00.260> to<00:02:00.410> me

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
it ends so I think that's a sign to me

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.670 
it ends so I think that's a sign to me
that<00:02:00.740> I'm<00:02:00.920> doing<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.250> right<00:02:01.340> thing
