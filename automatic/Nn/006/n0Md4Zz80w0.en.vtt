00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.239
 downward 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.289
 very good everyone is presented maximum 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.390
 a 210 and we're coming to record the 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.590
 next video actually in the video 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.590
 previous we came to sneeze now 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.170
 we are here playing 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.590
 it's something I've never taken it off and I do not think 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.590
 take it off 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.190
 nothing, nothing, nothing 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.820
 to see if we have been doing something else 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.110
 interesting today because he does not look 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.190
 did a little bit of stuff up here 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.410
 We have come to you here I said something I left you a 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.910
 little bit more of that and I said no better no and 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.239
 then he says he is not small 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.309
 because it had wood then it was 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.960
 but better not wood and not gimeno 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.760
 you can recover 16 to 6 there 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.810
 we are here and then I did 6 in 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.380
 go ahead and then I started to remove it 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:22.040
 Of course it was not with there I went up and 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.869
 temps and I turned it on because it gave me laziness 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.970
 and I do not have anything good also we have not 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.830
 it was for nothing but it 's the wood and the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.970
 I would have taken it out and with this, I would have benÃ­tez 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.970
 they see that I did not do anything 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.240
 let's see 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.300
 good 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.640
 but we're not going to make it higher anymore 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.679
 high that that 's higher than the trap 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:12.539
 of more I do not know if it was seen with this 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.539
 it's already there that's going to stay 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.080
 what happened here 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.970
 not like that we are seeing that we are 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.129
 spending less 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.210
 we are not spending the same and exactly 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.360
 the same in material 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.010
 it does not matter 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.010
 is that you 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.300
 as saying is cute 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.900
 you are not going to cut this tree that I already 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.900
 have up 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.660
 I already understood this week 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.660
 previous 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.720
 hours and a half for all and I have left 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.650
 some in or with reason 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.650
 with this she died 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.319
 talks like those on the phone and 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.880
 the typical route that you do for all 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:16.080
 your house and well you already know that 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.500
 casual good then let's make a 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.610
 damn you because I already despair that 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.610
 grow to go watermelon 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.620
 and wood because because I can 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.909
 save fuel 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.909
 I'm also sick 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.370
 what's there 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.710
 I have stone 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.460
 but 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.010
 Well, I think we 're leaving it here 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.360
 because he talks to me too much about me 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.360
 this video 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.850
 Well yes because I do not speak almost anything 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.610
 my 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.610

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.390

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.730

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:27.040
