00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.110
 the stuttering Ahlen on Saturday night in Hesse 3 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.900
 with current information from football from both Bundesligen to a report 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.900
 from the Oberliga match Bad Soden FSV Frankfurt 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.000
 Germany's table tennis aces met for the reception last tournament in 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:23.999
 Northern Hesse 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.029
 a visit of Bavaria to the international motor show in 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.029
 Frankfurt 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.970
 through our place Andreas Klatt becomes ESA 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.880
 our Stork summer 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.240
 which topics we have in our program that they could harness ours 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.810
 We did not see them welcome our studio guest 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.810
 Stephan Studer from Eintracht Frankfurt 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.160
 But they do not want to start with the 1 on the professional football but 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.350
 Amateur Football 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.290
 rarely was the situation in the amateur Oberliga Hessen as exciting as in the 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.730
 Moment however this tension before the light generates active by the supposed 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.620
 Favorites Kickers Offenbach or Viktoria Aschaffenburg but by the 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.620
 Rising star TSV Wain is still at the top of the table 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.009
 not good in the race but also Bad Soden alone further climbers with seven too 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.740
 seven points 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.990
 also caused a sensation FSV Frankfurt 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.299
 this team lost eleven new players at the end of last season 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.549
 were relocated also came a new coach 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.580
 So an exciting meeting was on the program today between the 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.630
 Newcomers Bad Soden AHL and FSV Frankfurt the Dammeier is ours 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.420
 father 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.160
 It is almost happy to have the right name 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.330
 and yet much more difficult with the high 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.880
 So we are right 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.800
 Bad soden-salmÃ¼nster 65 kilometers northeast of Frankfurt 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.600
 Of course it is fatal if 3 times Bad Soden the postcodes directory 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.010
 emerges and all author Hessen lie as Bad sooden-allendorf in the north of the 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.010
 Landes and Bad Soden am Taunus 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.880
 not only was a man in black next to the wrong track 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.450
 Taunus had searched the Bornwiese with its unique idyll 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.469
 will be the best league football 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.499
 Bad Soden played 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:23.790
 is one of the guarantors of success Wolfgang Felber 37 years head of department and 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:25.509
 still active player today 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.509
 a role model that no training 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.769
 the BSV in the Dong clarify jersey still had replacement weakened behind Oka 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.209
 his most dangerous mankel tile free kick he tested the reliable 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.279
 Lauterbach in the gate 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:43.109
 once again 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.189
 these deflected or on the wet floor olz the treacherous free kick 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.430
 Bad Soden playful midfielder now had more of the game 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:57.069
 a shot of dangerous striker 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.709
 and Helen Brand 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.160
 could take measure 1 2 0 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
 in the 23 minute game 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.809
 An early leadership gave confidence and confidence 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.439
 repeat 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.269
 completely freestanding burned 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.549
 the FSV with 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.849
 Voting problems and Sarah Palin most of the impulses he always dared 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.709
 Again, he does not shoot him but a Yesil 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.709
 too undecided here 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.849
 then a corner shot from unburned 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.689
 Bangert very good for the ball 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.370
 Rolf against Vettel 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.769
 but the Frankfurt only with difficulty on the line clarify afterwards 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.160
 Glittering parade by Winkler 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.559
 against misery 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:40.299
 a wonderful combination 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.089
 The biggest problem child is negotiating for old pictures at the last moment 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:46.469
 commitment 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:50.499
 Clear advantages for Bad Soden FSV had its strengths 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:52.089
 standard situations 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:56.999
 Fight and use as throughout the game and again his Roccat whose shot of 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:59.859
 Weber another change of direction 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.619
 Another free-kick grenade from the rock off against a varied 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.429
 first half to an end 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:10.789
 despite constant rain over 1000 spectators the eleventh always excited 

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:13.789
 strengthen the back 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:16.449
 So the three factors 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:22.150
 Team percent board and coaches harmonize very well with each other 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.409
 Double room is big 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:25.439
 Percent plus 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:27.689
 and 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:31.830
 Another advantage is that most players come from rural areas 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.640
 and 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.630
 They feel with the club percent can be self-employed 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.189
 happen 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:39.030
 after the break the TSV 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.270
 I am overjoyed with gentle 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.860
 Stefan Walter but no problem for Claudia Bach 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:49.000
 that typed from both sides before the game and result 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.240
 for a draw after this corner kick was put into action again 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.520
 cold the starting point only error of Lauterbach 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.760
 The ball could not hold on and 14 October lures 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.090
 to dust off the 1 2 0-endstand a good league game with many highlights 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:07.089
 on both teams for the league 

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:08.319
 Phil enjoy it
