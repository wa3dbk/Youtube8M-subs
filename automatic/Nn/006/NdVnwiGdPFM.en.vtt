we're going to talk to you about camera

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.519 
we're going to talk to you about camera
and<00:00:03.510> teach<00:00:03.870> what<00:00:04.110> you<00:00:04.259> need<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.440> do<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.859> adjust

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
and teach what you need to do to adjust

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.870 
and teach what you need to do to adjust
the<00:00:07.529> camber<00:00:07.799> once<00:00:08.160> you've<00:00:08.309> raised<00:00:08.580> or<00:00:08.849> lowered

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
the camber once you've raised or lowered

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:25.700 
the camber once you've raised or lowered
your<00:00:09.240> vehicle

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.930 

positive<00:00:26.710> negative<00:00:26.890> camber<00:00:27.280> is<00:00:27.550> basically

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
positive negative camber is basically

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.630 
positive negative camber is basically
how<00:00:28.180> we<00:00:28.630> measure<00:00:28.960> how<00:00:29.650> squarely<00:00:30.160> the<00:00:30.310> tires

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
how we measure how squarely the tires

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.990 
how we measure how squarely the tires
hit<00:00:30.940> the<00:00:31.060> road<00:00:31.270> so<00:00:31.930> zero<00:00:32.619> degrees<00:00:33.460> camber

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
hit the road so zero degrees camber

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.880 
hit the road so zero degrees camber
would<00:00:34.360> be<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:34.960> tires<00:00:35.290> are<00:00:35.500> straight<00:00:35.770> up

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
would be the the tires are straight up

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.960 
would be the the tires are straight up
and<00:00:36.040> down<00:00:36.100> and<00:00:36.400> they<00:00:36.520> meet<00:00:36.700> the<00:00:36.820> road

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
and down and they meet the road

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.880 
and down and they meet the road
perfectly<00:00:37.510> now<00:00:38.110> when<00:00:38.470> you<00:00:38.559> raise<00:00:38.860> your

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
perfectly now when you raise your

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.530 
perfectly now when you raise your
vehicle<00:00:39.610> you're<00:00:39.910> going<00:00:39.940> to<00:00:40.120> get<00:00:40.210> positive

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
vehicle you're going to get positive

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.290 
vehicle you're going to get positive
camber<00:00:41.140> this<00:00:41.410> is<00:00:41.559> caused<00:00:41.800> by<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.700> top<00:00:43.090> of<00:00:43.239> the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
camber this is caused by the top of the

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.229 
camber this is caused by the top of the
wheels<00:00:43.540> being<00:00:44.110> tilted<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.650> the<00:00:44.680> outside

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
wheels being tilted to the outside

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.369 
wheels being tilted to the outside
negative<00:00:46.239> camber<00:00:46.480> happens<00:00:46.900> when<00:00:47.050> you<00:00:47.170> lower

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
negative camber happens when you lower

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.049 
negative camber happens when you lower
your<00:00:47.620> vehicle<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.489> top<00:00:48.699> of<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:48.879> wheels

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
your vehicle and the top of the wheels

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.900 
your vehicle and the top of the wheels
go<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.360> the<00:00:49.510> inside<00:00:50.100> now<00:00:51.100> why<00:00:51.370> does<00:00:51.550> camber

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
go to the inside now why does camber

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.299 
go to the inside now why does camber
matter<00:00:52.120> well<00:00:52.690> here's<00:00:53.050> what<00:00:53.199> happens<00:00:53.559> the

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
matter well here's what happens the

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.250 
matter well here's what happens the
vehicle<00:00:54.640> has<00:00:54.790> a<00:00:54.820> factory<00:00:55.330> specification<00:00:56.110> and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
vehicle has a factory specification and

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.500 
vehicle has a factory specification and
the<00:00:56.409> closer<00:00:56.650> you<00:00:56.800> get<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:56.979> that<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:58.089> engineers

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
the closer you get to that the engineers

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.780 
the closer you get to that the engineers
designed<00:00:58.720> the<00:00:59.140> car<00:00:59.409> based<00:00:59.739> on<00:00:59.949> torque<00:01:00.430> steer

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
designed the car based on torque steer

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.329 
designed the car based on torque steer
based<00:01:01.629> on<00:01:01.839> when<00:01:02.140> you<00:01:02.379> accelerate<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:03.040> car

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
based on when you accelerate the car

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.670 
based on when you accelerate the car
maybe<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.300> car<00:01:04.510> will<00:01:04.690> squat<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.470> tires

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
maybe the car will squat and the tires

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.170 
maybe the car will squat and the tires
will<00:01:05.830> come<00:01:05.979> out<00:01:06.100> so<00:01:06.250> they<00:01:06.340> have<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.520> factory

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
will come out so they have a factory

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.580 
will come out so they have a factory
specification<00:01:07.930> that<00:01:08.020> you<00:01:08.110> should<00:01:08.290> stay

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
specification that you should stay

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.200 
specification that you should stay
within<00:01:08.799> those<00:01:09.100> numbers<00:01:09.549> that's<00:01:09.909> going<00:01:10.150> to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
within those numbers that's going to

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.149 
within those numbers that's going to
make<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.420> car<00:01:10.600> handle<00:01:10.630> correctly<00:01:11.080> now<00:01:11.860> when

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
make the car handle correctly now when

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.190 
make the car handle correctly now when
you<00:01:12.280> raise<00:01:12.610> your<00:01:12.880> vehicle<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.750> camber

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
you raise your vehicle and that camber

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.469 
you raise your vehicle and that camber
actually<00:01:15.040> goes<00:01:15.280> to<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.460> positive<00:01:15.880> camber<00:01:16.090> and

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
actually goes to a positive camber and

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.850 
actually goes to a positive camber and
you<00:01:16.659> start<00:01:16.900> wearing<00:01:17.080> on<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:17.320> outside<00:01:17.680> of<00:01:17.770> the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
you start wearing on the outside of the

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.680 
you start wearing on the outside of the
tires<00:01:18.070> that's<00:01:18.640> kind<00:01:18.909> of<00:01:18.970> real<00:01:19.150> dangerous<00:01:19.479> it

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
tires that's kind of real dangerous it

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.210 
tires that's kind of real dangerous it
doesn't<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.260> car<00:01:20.470> won't<00:01:20.620> handle<00:01:20.950> really<00:01:21.100> well

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
doesn't the car won't handle really well

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.280 
doesn't the car won't handle really well
it<00:01:21.580> will<00:01:21.670> kind<00:01:21.850> of<00:01:21.909> follow<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.330> road<00:01:22.510> it's<00:01:23.020> not

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
it will kind of follow the road it's not

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.410 
it will kind of follow the road it's not
a<00:01:23.320> very<00:01:23.770> good<00:01:23.920> handling<00:01:24.280> vehicle<00:01:24.640> at<00:01:24.700> all<00:01:24.850> now

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
a very good handling vehicle at all now

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.120 
a very good handling vehicle at all now
when<00:01:25.750> you<00:01:25.840> go<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:25.990> negative<00:01:26.260> camber<00:01:26.680> a<00:01:26.799> lot<00:01:27.010> of

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
when you go to negative camber a lot of

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.680 
when you go to negative camber a lot of
race<00:01:27.250> cars<00:01:27.280> put<00:01:27.790> a<00:01:27.820> lot<00:01:28.030> of<00:01:28.120> negative<00:01:28.450> camber

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
race cars put a lot of negative camber

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.450 
race cars put a lot of negative camber
in<00:01:28.840> their<00:01:28.990> cars<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:29.710> reason<00:01:30.010> they<00:01:30.100> do<00:01:30.160> that<00:01:30.280> is

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
in their cars the reason they do that is

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.640 
in their cars the reason they do that is
when<00:01:30.790> they<00:01:30.940> go<00:01:31.120> into<00:01:31.300> corners<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:32.170> allows<00:01:32.440> that

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
when they go into corners it allows that

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.380 
when they go into corners it allows that
tire<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:33.070> roll<00:01:33.280> over<00:01:33.310> on<00:01:33.550> itself<00:01:33.940> and<00:01:34.210> get<00:01:34.300> the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
tire to roll over on itself and get the

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.450 
tire to roll over on itself and get the
full<00:01:34.600> contact<00:01:35.110> patch<00:01:35.320> of<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.920> tire<00:01:36.130> on<00:01:36.340> the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
full contact patch of the tire on the

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.900 
full contact patch of the tire on the
ground<00:01:36.840> okay<00:01:37.840> so<00:01:38.140> if<00:01:38.500> you're<00:01:38.740> not<00:01:38.770> in<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:39.460> racing

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
ground okay so if you're not in a racing

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.220 
ground okay so if you're not in a racing
environment<00:01:40.000> here's<00:01:40.930> what's<00:01:41.080> going<00:01:41.200> to

environment here's what's going to

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.870 
environment here's what's going to
happen<00:01:41.590> if<00:01:41.710> you<00:01:41.860> don't<00:01:42.100> get<00:01:42.520> rid<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:42.700> the

happen if you don't get rid of the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.340 
happen if you don't get rid of the
negative<00:01:43.210> camber<00:01:43.450> you're<00:01:43.990> going<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.170> wear<00:01:44.320> out

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
negative camber you're going to wear out

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.590 
negative camber you're going to wear out
the<00:01:44.650> insides<00:01:45.220> of<00:01:45.370> the<00:01:45.430> tires<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:46.270> car<00:01:46.480> will

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
the insides of the tires the car will

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.970 
the insides of the tires the car will
handle<00:01:46.930> pretty<00:01:47.110> decently<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:47.710> won't<00:01:47.860> be<00:01:47.950> a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
handle pretty decently it won't be a

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.110 
handle pretty decently it won't be a
problem<00:01:48.190> but<00:01:48.430> you're<00:01:48.550> not<00:01:48.640> going<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.850> get<00:01:48.940> any

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
problem but you're not going to get any

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.820 
problem but you're not going to get any
kind<00:01:49.300> of<00:01:49.450> mileage<00:01:49.660> at<00:01:49.960> all<00:01:50.110> out<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:50.530> tires

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
kind of mileage at all out of the tires

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.520 
kind of mileage at all out of the tires
they're<00:01:51.070> going<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:51.250> really<00:01:51.490> wear<00:01:51.730> out<00:01:51.910> quickly

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
they're going to really wear out quickly

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.840 
they're going to really wear out quickly
now<00:01:53.530> let's<00:01:53.830> start<00:01:53.980> out<00:01:54.070> by<00:01:54.100> talking<00:01:54.250> about<00:01:54.580> the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
now let's start out by talking about the

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.880 
now let's start out by talking about the
ways<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.090> correct<00:01:55.660> positive<00:01:56.260> or<00:01:56.440> negative

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
ways to correct positive or negative

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.040 
ways to correct positive or negative
camber<00:01:57.160> now<00:01:57.820> keep<00:01:58.480> in<00:01:58.600> mind<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.960> your

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
camber now keep in mind that your

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.100 
camber now keep in mind that your
factory<00:01:59.590> vehicle<00:02:00.370> has<00:02:00.940> a<00:02:01.360> camber<00:02:02.080> adjustment

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
factory vehicle has a camber adjustment

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.650 
factory vehicle has a camber adjustment
and<00:02:02.890> it's<00:02:03.280> designed<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.760> do<00:02:03.910> that<00:02:04.090> within<00:02:04.330> the

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
and it's designed to do that within the

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.630 
and it's designed to do that within the
factory<00:02:05.230> ride<00:02:05.470> height<00:02:05.770> so<00:02:06.010> once<00:02:06.250> you<00:02:06.370> start

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
factory ride height so once you start

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.070 
factory ride height so once you start
raising<00:02:06.970> or<00:02:07.060> lowering<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.330> vehicle<00:02:07.690> you're

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
raising or lowering a vehicle you're

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.330 
raising or lowering a vehicle you're
usually<00:02:08.379> not<00:02:08.590> going<00:02:08.769> to<00:02:08.950> have<00:02:09.069> enough

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
usually not going to have enough

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.210 
usually not going to have enough
adjustment<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:10.509> bring<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:10.840> out<00:02:10.899> now<00:02:11.739> most

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
adjustment to bring that out now most

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.280 
adjustment to bring that out now most
camber<00:02:12.670> adjustment<00:02:12.819> kits<00:02:13.569> will<00:02:13.840> work<00:02:14.050> with

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
camber adjustment kits will work with

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.890 
camber adjustment kits will work with
either<00:02:14.470> stock<00:02:14.920> or<00:02:15.159> aftermarket<00:02:15.900> suspension

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
either stock or aftermarket suspension

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.990 
either stock or aftermarket suspension
components<00:02:17.769> all<00:02:18.430> right<00:02:18.580> let's<00:02:18.700> start<00:02:18.849> off

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
components all right let's start off

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.880 
components all right let's start off
with<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.330> easiest<00:02:19.720> now<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.409> easiest<00:02:20.680> and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
with the easiest now the easiest and

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.410 
with the easiest now the easiest and
least<00:02:20.920> expensive<00:02:21.159> is<00:02:21.730> going<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.180> be<00:02:22.300> the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
least expensive is going to be the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.790 
least expensive is going to be the
camber<00:02:22.840> bolt<00:02:23.019> now<00:02:23.409> you're<00:02:23.500> going<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.680> get<00:02:23.739> a

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
camber bolt now you're going to get a

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.050 
camber bolt now you're going to get a
lot<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.010> adjustment<00:02:24.550> out<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:24.700> these<00:02:24.790> usually

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
lot of adjustment out of these usually

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.910 
lot of adjustment out of these usually
between<00:02:25.540> one<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.959> half<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.409> two<00:02:26.739> and<00:02:26.890> a

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
between one and a half and two and a

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.380 
between one and a half and two and a
half<00:02:27.069> degrees<00:02:27.220> there<00:02:27.580> are<00:02:27.700> some<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.120> do<00:02:28.209> more

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
half degrees there are some that do more

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.759 
half degrees there are some that do more
but<00:02:28.540> one<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.080> half<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.379> two<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.680> half

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
but one and a half and two and a half

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.309 
but one and a half and two and a half
degrees<00:02:29.890> is<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.250> pretty<00:02:30.430> good<00:02:30.810> pretty<00:02:31.810> common

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
degrees is a pretty good pretty common

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.410 
degrees is a pretty good pretty common
now<00:02:32.709> as<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.340> can<00:02:33.489> see<00:02:33.670> here<00:02:33.939> the<00:02:34.060> how<00:02:34.239> these

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
now as you can see here the how these

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.420 
now as you can see here the how these
work<00:02:34.689> they<00:02:35.079> have<00:02:35.230> an<00:02:35.349> eccentric<00:02:35.920> on<00:02:36.129> the<00:02:36.249> bolt

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
work they have an eccentric on the bolt

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.680 
work they have an eccentric on the bolt
now<00:02:36.609> this<00:02:36.790> goes<00:02:36.999> through<00:02:37.299> either

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
now this goes through either

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.460 
now this goes through either
the<00:02:37.990> lower<00:02:38.830> control<00:02:39.280> arm<00:02:39.640> or<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.570> goes<00:02:40.810> through

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
the lower control arm or it goes through

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.070 
the lower control arm or it goes through
the<00:02:41.920> strut<00:02:42.520> at<00:02:43.030> where<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.330> strut<00:02:43.600> meets<00:02:43.840> the

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
the strut at where the strut meets the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.560 
the strut at where the strut meets the
spindle<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.280> what<00:02:45.400> happens<00:02:45.730> is<00:02:45.910> as<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.300> turn

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
spindle and what happens is as you turn

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.020 
spindle and what happens is as you turn
the<00:02:46.600> bolt<00:02:46.990> it'll<00:02:47.620> allow<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:48.400> eccentric

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
the bolt it'll allow the the eccentric

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.480 
the bolt it'll allow the the eccentric
to<00:02:49.450> either<00:02:49.630> force<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.620> outside<00:02:51.070> of<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.370> wheel

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
to either force the outside of the wheel

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.190 
to either force the outside of the wheel
in<00:02:51.790> or<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.150> outside<00:02:52.600> of<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.780> wheel<00:02:52.900> out

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
in or the outside of the wheel out

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.960 
in or the outside of the wheel out
depending<00:02:54.100> on<00:02:54.160> whether<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.400> have<00:02:54.430> positive

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
depending on whether you have positive

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.150 
depending on whether you have positive
or<00:02:55.120> negative<00:02:55.720> camber<00:02:55.930> now<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.590> next<00:02:57.010> we're

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
or negative camber now the next we're

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.070 
or negative camber now the next we're
going<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.310> talk<00:02:57.460> about<00:02:57.640> is<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.420> control<00:02:58.930> arm

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
going to talk about is a control arm

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.170 
going to talk about is a control arm
that<00:02:59.230> actually<00:02:59.530> has<00:02:59.710> a<00:02:59.980> movable<00:03:00.490> ball<00:03:00.850> joint

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
that actually has a movable ball joint

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.390 
that actually has a movable ball joint
now<00:03:01.720> how<00:03:02.020> this<00:03:02.260> works<00:03:02.320> which<00:03:02.890> is<00:03:03.040> really<00:03:03.370> a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
now how this works which is really a

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.520 
now how this works which is really a
great<00:03:03.640> way<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.790> go<00:03:03.970> if<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.150> have<00:03:04.270> a<00:03:04.750> upper<00:03:05.410> and

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
great way to go if you have a upper and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.470 
great way to go if you have a upper and
lower<00:03:05.620> control<00:03:05.860> arms<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.430> your<00:03:06.580> vehicle<00:03:07.000> what

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
lower control arms on your vehicle what

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.910 
lower control arms on your vehicle what
happens<00:03:07.840> is<00:03:08.020> you're<00:03:08.350> actually<00:03:08.530> able<00:03:08.800> to

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
happens is you're actually able to

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.220 
happens is you're actually able to
physically<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:10.030> ball<00:03:10.270> joint<00:03:10.570> area<00:03:11.080> is

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
physically the the ball joint area is

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.860 
physically the the ball joint area is
actually<00:03:11.440> slotted<00:03:12.100> in<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.540> control<00:03:13.540> arm<00:03:13.750> and

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
actually slotted in the control arm and

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.570 
actually slotted in the control arm and
you<00:03:14.140> can<00:03:14.290> actually<00:03:14.410> slide<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.130> forward<00:03:15.490> and

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
you can actually slide that forward and

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.130 
you can actually slide that forward and
backward<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:15.940> get<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.090> lot<00:03:16.390> of<00:03:16.540> adjustment<00:03:17.080> out

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
backward you get a lot of adjustment out

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.960 
backward you get a lot of adjustment out
of<00:03:17.260> this<00:03:17.380> this<00:03:17.770> is<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.950> great<00:03:18.070> way<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.310> go<00:03:18.550> if<00:03:18.820> you

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
of this this is a great way to go if you

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.940 
of this this is a great way to go if you
have<00:03:19.210> upper<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.020> lower<00:03:20.140> control<00:03:20.500> arms<00:03:20.800> on

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
have upper and lower control arms on

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.040 
have upper and lower control arms on
your<00:03:20.980> vehicle<00:03:21.460> so<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.420> question<00:03:22.780> we<00:03:22.840> get<00:03:22.930> all

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
your vehicle so a question we get all

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.870 
your vehicle so a question we get all
the<00:03:23.140> time<00:03:23.200> is<00:03:23.380> what<00:03:23.950> is<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.070> pillow<00:03:24.400> ball<00:03:24.640> mount

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
the time is what is a pillow ball mount

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.490 
the time is what is a pillow ball mount
and<00:03:25.090> when<00:03:25.450> do<00:03:25.600> I<00:03:25.690> need<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.930> replace<00:03:26.140> it

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
and when do I need to replace it

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.190 
and when do I need to replace it
well<00:03:27.160> pillow<00:03:27.520> ball<00:03:27.760> mounts<00:03:28.090> only<00:03:28.450> work<00:03:28.720> with<00:03:28.990> a

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
well pillow ball mounts only work with a

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.710 
well pillow ball mounts only work with a
strut<00:03:29.680> style<00:03:30.250> system<00:03:30.760> whether<00:03:31.210> you<00:03:31.330> have<00:03:31.510> the

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
strut style system whether you have the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.050 
strut style system whether you have the
factory<00:03:32.050> McPherson<00:03:33.010> struts<00:03:33.310> or<00:03:33.580> you<00:03:33.880> have<00:03:34.030> a

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
factory McPherson struts or you have a

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.120 
factory McPherson struts or you have a
coilover<00:03:34.600> kit<00:03:34.750> now<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.410> pillow<00:03:35.680> ball<00:03:35.920> mount

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
coilover kit now the pillow ball mount

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.610 
coilover kit now the pillow ball mount
actually<00:03:36.910> holds<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.570> coil<00:03:37.840> spring<00:03:38.260> to<00:03:38.590> the

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
actually holds the coil spring to the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.920 
actually holds the coil spring to the
strut<00:03:39.070> or<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:39.610> coil<00:03:39.820> over<00:03:40.000> itself<00:03:40.420> it's

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
strut or to the coil over itself it's

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.050 
strut or to the coil over itself it's
this<00:03:41.200> piece<00:03:41.410> right<00:03:41.709> here<00:03:41.770> now<00:03:42.550> when<00:03:42.880> do<00:03:42.970> you

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
this piece right here now when do you

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.340 
this piece right here now when do you
need<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.209> replace<00:03:43.540> it<00:03:43.600> well<00:03:44.020> if<00:03:44.170> you're

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
need to replace it well if you're

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.860 
need to replace it well if you're
running<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.770> factory<00:03:45.600> McPherson<00:03:46.600> strut

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
running a factory McPherson strut

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.870 
running a factory McPherson strut
suspension<00:03:47.020> a<00:03:47.530> lot<00:03:47.920> of<00:03:48.010> times<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.430> bushing<00:03:48.790> in

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
suspension a lot of times the bushing in

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.860 
suspension a lot of times the bushing in
here<00:03:49.030> will<00:03:49.120> wear<00:03:49.239> out<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.570> you'll<00:03:49.690> actually

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
here will wear out and you'll actually

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.020 
here will wear out and you'll actually
see<00:03:50.170> this<00:03:50.290> move<00:03:50.530> back<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:50.950> forth<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.489> actually

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
see this move back and forth it actually

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.850 
see this move back and forth it actually
makes<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.330> suspension<00:03:52.840> very<00:03:53.020> sloppy<00:03:53.350> you

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
makes the suspension very sloppy you

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.070 
makes the suspension very sloppy you
need<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.130> replace<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.459> then<00:03:54.790> also<00:03:55.239> if<00:03:55.900> you're

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
need to replace it then also if you're

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.410 
need to replace it then also if you're
going<00:03:56.320> to<00:03:56.620> really<00:03:57.040> slam<00:03:57.400> your<00:03:57.640> car<00:03:57.880> you're

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
going to really slam your car you're

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.850 
going to really slam your car you're
going<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.630> want<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.840> use<00:03:59.050> what's<00:03:59.380> called<00:03:59.440> a

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
going to want to use what's called a

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.370 
going to want to use what's called a
caster<00:04:00.520> camber<00:04:00.790> plate<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.480> what<00:04:01.989> this<00:04:02.140> does

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
caster camber plate and what this does

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.350 
caster camber plate and what this does
is<00:04:02.650> this<00:04:02.770> actually<00:04:03.160> takes<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.640> place<00:04:03.850> of<00:04:03.880> the

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
is this actually takes the place of the

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.420 
is this actually takes the place of the
pillow<00:04:04.540> ball<00:04:04.750> mount<00:04:04.959> it<00:04:05.290> bolts<00:04:05.890> in<00:04:06.010> its<00:04:06.160> top

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
pillow ball mount it bolts in its top

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.190 
pillow ball mount it bolts in its top
and<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:07.090> strut<00:04:07.390> actually<00:04:07.720> comes<00:04:07.959> through

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
and the strut actually comes through

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.110 
and the strut actually comes through
this<00:04:08.380> now<00:04:08.890> this<00:04:09.070> gives<00:04:09.280> you<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.519> ability<00:04:09.910> to

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
this now this gives you the ability to

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.630 
this now this gives you the ability to
either<00:04:10.810> slide<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.440> top<00:04:11.830> of<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.070> strut<00:04:12.310> in<00:04:12.430> or

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
either slide the top of the strut in or

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.610 
either slide the top of the strut in or
out<00:04:12.820> and<00:04:13.060> backward<00:04:13.750> or<00:04:13.810> forward<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:14.320> adjust

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
out and backward or forward to adjust

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.240 
out and backward or forward to adjust
caster<00:04:15.070> and<00:04:15.220> camber<00:04:16.950> now<00:04:17.950> we're<00:04:18.070> going<00:04:18.190> to

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
caster and camber now we're going to

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.000 
caster and camber now we're going to
talk<00:04:18.370> about<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.790> rear<00:04:19.060> camber<00:04:19.480> arms<00:04:20.140> now<00:04:20.650> so

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
talk about the rear camber arms now so

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.800 
talk about the rear camber arms now so
far<00:04:21.220> what<00:04:21.489> we've<00:04:21.640> talked<00:04:21.880> about<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.360> caster

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
far what we've talked about the caster

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.260 
far what we've talked about the caster
camber<00:04:22.990> plates<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:23.800> camber<00:04:24.460> bolts<00:04:24.730> and<00:04:24.880> the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
camber plates the camber bolts and the

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.520 
camber plates the camber bolts and the
control<00:04:25.630> arm<00:04:25.810> with<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.020> adjustable<00:04:26.320> ball
