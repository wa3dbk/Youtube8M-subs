00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.870
Hey guys we are at the MWC 2015 and Lenovo
today released the Lenovo A7000 Phablet.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:15.269
It's a 5.5inch device has an HD IPS screen.
HD meaning 720P and it's brilliant bright

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.900
screen you can say it's mainly plastic you
can remove the back here.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.570
And in front you have glossy screen that should
attract lot of finger prints.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.699
You have the shortcut keys out here.
On top you have the front camera which is

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.450
5MP your ear piece and then some of the sensors
and LED lights.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.110
Nothing much on the left side nothing much
on below you have the power button here.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.760
The volume rocker and on top you have the
micro USB 2.0 port and the 3.5mm jack.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.260
Behind you have the 8MP auto focus camera.
So know that is not gonna be exactly premium

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.340
device.
And then you have a Dual tone LED flash for

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.690
right white balance and skin tones.
You have a noise cancelling mic here.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:09.340
And small speaker grill around there.
I like it it has mat finish on the back but

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:17.170
it's also will attract finger prints and greases.
You can open the back here inside which it

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.729
houses the 2900 mAh battery.
You have Dual Sim card slot and then the micro

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.189
SD card slot.
This guy is powered by MediaTek processor.

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:35.070
It has MediaTek OctaCore processor which supports
4G LTE 1.5Ghz clock speed.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.630
And then you have 2GB of RAM and 8GB of internal
storage.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:46.770
But of course then micro SD card can extend
the external storage up to 32GB as you can

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.620
see the Dual micro Sim card slot.
It comes with Android Lollipop right out of

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.700
the box yeah.
And it also the USB of the device is that

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.810
it's apparently the first device to incorporate
the Dolby utmost feature.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.599
Which should give very good 3D surround sound.
So it kind of media you know specific device.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.260
You can see media specific phone.
There you see Lenovo A7000 Android Version

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.160
5.0.
So we will give you full in depth hands on

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.440
when this device comes to our lab for full
review.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.370
You can see the user interface is pretty much
like the Vibe Series but not exactly.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:38.270
So it is quite lite and smooth and snappy.
We don't know the availability date yet we

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.420
don't know the price yet.
But that's the Lenovo A7000 it should be a

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.250
budget Phablet guys.
Thank you.
