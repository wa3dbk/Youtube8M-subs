00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.920
 hello how they are very good at all 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.750
 we are seeing the new one already shining 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:22.060
 for season 3 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.010
 let's see the skills and objects 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.099
 let's start with the passive 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.869
 equilibrium the mana regeneration must 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.750
 get increases by one percent per 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.910
 every one percent emanates lost this 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.720
 It helps us control the line 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.780
 fairly good 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.020
 since not enough mana is generated and therefore 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.810
 so with this way to continue against the champion 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.680
 enemy 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.230
 let's go with the belfus strike untie 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.360
 black magic against an enemy 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.800
 inflicting magical damage if the unit 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:01:00.579
 dies bÃ©gar gets 1 the ability power 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.390
 and passively Baker gets one of 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.010
 Enable power when it kills any 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.310
 enemy champion 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:14.110
 let's go to the w when eating after d 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.049
 1.2 seconds dark matter falls from the sky 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.009
 inflicting magical damage then to the 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.009
 enemies that surround them 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.980
 and they see horizon comes to twist the 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.880
 space boundaries around a 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.829
 location for three seconds 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.240
 and studying the enemies that cross 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.130
 the perimeter 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.170
 this does not get along very well for example 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.149
 last in faith or to start them 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.010
 although it is not recommended for 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:46.170
 start them but the stand helps a lot 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:50.780
 now we go with the the ultimate 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.780
 we are going to primordial works 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.760
 the objective champion suffers an explosion 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.610
 which inflicts a large amount of damage 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.330
 magical more than 80 percent of his death 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.050
 power 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.260
 well what does this mean if the 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.470
 enemy champion is ap we will give him 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.720
 magic damage to your 80% of enabled power 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.060
 So far this is very good for us 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.370
 control the line and then send it to 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.160
 recalar enough times so that we 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.410
 must knock down the tower 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.620
 and good let's start with the skills 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.620
 co 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.219
 as you see the one that throws a ball 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.110
 Now let's see the one that only works 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.110
 with champions 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.709
 and young the stone 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.769
 and now we go with his ultimate 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.319
 well honest samples 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.060
 then the essentials for each p 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.530
 you guys want the ones from pays 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.090
 the power tolita and gives them a bit of 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.430
 defense so they can ask us for 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.739
 message but here he is going to put this 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.739
 Mana degeneration and therefore alone power 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:49.110
 the runes are going to do 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.110
 the moon is the link of the video 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:58.190
 and the objects 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.240
 the objects you can start with a great 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.080
 swing that will allow you 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:09.220
 15 enable power plus 33 regeneration of 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.380
 mana for 5 seconds and 80 life this will 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.540
 comes very well to the line how can you 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.640
 start with speed boots and three 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.070
 positions 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:23.520
 to which was then d 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.520
 note if you buy boots you are going to buy a 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.400
 blas without want 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.970
 then I would give him a homework 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.970
 we work cap 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:44.020
 then you will have to follow the boots of 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.020
 Magician's boots that are twisted 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.680
 after Syria for a bot staff this 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.670
 allows you to stay pretty 20 power and you 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.670
 give this 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.680
 35 of strange magic penetration very 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.680
 all right 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.800
 you can start with any other 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.780
 objects I recommend you can be blast 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.160
 in one 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:17.630
 and after forming and curing it 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:21.350
 after that we're going to go for an English 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.020
 fat that gives us armor and quite 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.870
 violent power this that allows us this 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.830
 allows us to team fights because if 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.530
 the bulbs are for the great damage of age 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.660
 what can we do then simply 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.460
 we press the key in which we have 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.639
 and we are going to be sis 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.860
 and because its function will be in vain 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:48.720
 this is not going excellent 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.610
 then a nwanze circle and it's beautiful 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.099
 we can start by magic resist 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.780
 if your opponent online is magic 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.960
 resist 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:02.350
 or if you see that everyone is already in mid 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:06.320
 and there are enough champions of ape you can 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.900
 start with a negation clock 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.830
 or if you prefer you can start with the 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:15.640
 cathode of protector that gives you 200 of 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:19.370
 life of 300 weeks and so a radio 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:23.090
 evansville which is what this allows you 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.970
 and what benefits you is that it blocks you 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.129
 the first skill of your opponent that 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.169
 it suits you very well 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:32.419
 for the furnace see the universe is one 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:35.229
 so you can be found by the 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.229
 jungle or things like that 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:42.860
 and good also this 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:42.860
 can you say for a 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.210
 the letters 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.720
 that this allows you to hurt him 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:58.029
 about 15 percent of maximum life 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:58.029
 of your enemy 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:06.900
 and good if you prefer 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:10.810
 you can go for an archangel stuff 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.080
 I do not recommend you much but you can 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.419
 to go 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.419
 by a pull of Galvez 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.840
 and I'm sure loarque arg ingolstadt 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:26.430
 or if you do not prefer it, you can go 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:29.220
 other jobs round set cap 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.880
 well this will allow a lot of habilite 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.280
 power 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.080
 and good friends that was everything in it must 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.110
 get season 3 I hope you have them 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.110
 liked 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:43.810
 that is to say that they try to try 

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.810
 those objects and try everything
