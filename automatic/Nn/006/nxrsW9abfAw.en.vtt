00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.649 
mushrooms so it doesn't save that much
time<00:01:41.189> for<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.520> stopping<00:01:41.850> version<00:01:42.210> because

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
time for the stopping version because

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.080 
time for the stopping version because
you<00:01:43.320> could<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.740> lava<00:01:44.009> shortcut<00:01:44.460> but

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you could just do the lava shortcut but

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.730 
you could just do the lava shortcut but
you<00:01:45.299> get<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.570> keep<00:01:45.600> your<00:01:45.780> item<00:01:46.140> unlike<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:46.649> you

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
you get to keep your item unlike if you

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.050 
you get to keep your item unlike if you
do<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> lava<00:01:47.130> cut<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.460> if<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.700> triple

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
do the lava cut so if you have triple

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.060 
do the lava cut so if you have triple
shrooms<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:49.079> make<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:49.979> have

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
shrooms you can make it and then have

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.520 
shrooms you can make it and then have
two<00:01:50.250> streams<00:01:50.460> being<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> hot<00:01:51.659> position<00:01:52.079> so

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
two streams being like a hot position so

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.380

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.250 
first of all it's really bumpy in this
area<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.570> want<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.810> do<00:03:39.870> is<00:03:39.960> you<00:03:40.050> want<00:03:40.230> to

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
area so you want to do is you want to

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.720 
area so you want to do is you want to
start<00:03:40.350> your<00:03:40.710> drift<00:03:41.070> which<00:03:41.250> means<00:03:41.430> your<00:03:41.550> hop

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
start your drift which means your hop

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.220 
start your drift which means your hop
and<00:03:42.000> your<00:03:42.120> drift<00:03:42.390> right<00:03:42.780> at<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.020> highest

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
and your drift right at the highest

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.350 
and your drift right at the highest
point<00:03:43.560> which<00:03:43.800> is<00:03:43.950> right<00:03:44.220> there<00:03:44.610> right<00:03:45.150> where

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
point which is right there right where

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.260 
point which is right there right where
my<00:03:45.450> funky<00:03:45.810> Kong<00:03:45.930> is<00:03:46.230> right<00:03:46.410> now<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.830> then<00:03:47.550> as

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
my funky Kong is right now and then as

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.190 
my funky Kong is right now and then as
you're<00:03:48.630> drifting

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
you're drifting

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.750 
you're drifting
you<00:03:49.380> should<00:03:49.560> be<00:03:49.650> drifting<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.220> then<00:03:50.400> right

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
you should be drifting and then right

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.460 
you should be drifting and then right
here<00:03:50.790> at<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.210> lowest<00:03:51.630> dip<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:52.050> where<00:03:52.350> you

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
here at this lowest dip is where you

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.260 
here at this lowest dip is where you
want<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.740> release<00:03:53.010> your<00:03:53.250> drift<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:53.730> then<00:03:54.060> you

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
want to release your drift and then you

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.750 
want to release your drift and then you
know<00:03:54.390> shroom<00:03:54.960> onto<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.530> rock<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.310> can<00:03:56.520> see

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
know shroom onto the rock so you can see

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.340 
know shroom onto the rock so you can see
just<00:03:57.030> by<00:03:57.480> looking<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.810> can<00:03:58.020> see<00:03:58.140> there's<00:03:58.320> a

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
just by looking you can see there's a

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
just by looking you can see there's a
little<00:03:58.500> dip<00:03:58.770> right<00:03:58.980> there<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.280> that's

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
little dip right there and that's

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.070 
little dip right there and that's
exactly<00:03:59.910> where<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.090> want<00:04:00.270> to<00:04:00.360> be<00:04:00.480> aiming<00:04:00.930> for

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
exactly where you want to be aiming for

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.490 
exactly where you want to be aiming for
so<00:04:01.950> on<00:04:02.630> also<00:04:03.630> when<00:04:03.870> you're<00:04:03.990> in<00:04:04.050> mid<00:04:04.170> area<00:04:04.410> you

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
so on also when you're in mid area you

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.380 
so on also when you're in mid area you
want<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.800> loose<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.460> drift<00:04:05.670> like<00:04:05.820> I<00:04:05.940> said<00:04:06.180> and

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
want to loose the drift like I said and

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
want to loose the drift like I said and
then<00:04:06.510> right<00:04:06.690> when<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:06.870> hit<00:04:07.020> the<00:04:07.140> rock<00:04:07.290> you

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
then right when you hit the rock you

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.840 
then right when you hit the rock you
want<00:04:07.500> to<00:04:07.620> tilt<00:04:07.860> left<00:04:08.130> attack<00:04:08.490> because<00:04:08.700> if<00:04:08.790> you

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
want to tilt left attack because if you

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.430 
want to tilt left attack because if you
don't<00:04:08.970> till<00:04:09.240> left<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.600> tad<00:04:09.780> you'll<00:04:10.020> end<00:04:10.140> up<00:04:10.230> just

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
don't till left a tad you'll end up just

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.990 
don't till left a tad you'll end up just
hanging<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.710> rock<00:04:10.890> and<00:04:11.130> you'll<00:04:11.460> fall<00:04:11.700> into

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
hanging the rock and you'll fall into

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.410 
hanging the rock and you'll fall into
the<00:04:12.090> lava

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
the lava

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.840

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
so that thing Justin was trying earlier

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.719 
so that thing Justin was trying earlier
that's<00:04:38.350> actually<00:04:38.650> possible<00:04:38.800> he's<00:04:39.250> aim<00:04:39.460> right

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
that's actually possible he's aim right

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.010 
that's actually possible he's aim right
to<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.030> right<00:04:40.180> of<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.389> green<00:04:40.539> pipe<00:04:40.780> here<00:04:40.990> and

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
to the right of the green pipe here and

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.920 
to the right of the green pipe here and
then<00:04:41.289> use<00:04:42.009> a<00:04:42.039> mushroom<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:42.580> hold<00:04:43.270> back<00:04:43.539> and

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
then use a mushroom and hold back and

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.450 
then use a mushroom and hold back and
you<00:04:44.080> can<00:04:44.229> make<00:04:44.259> it<00:04:44.500> it's<00:04:45.039> not<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.310> useful

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
you can make it it's not that useful

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.770 
you can make it it's not that useful
though<00:04:45.759> because<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.210> other<00:04:46.300> circuits<00:04:46.660> are

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
though because the other circuits are

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.840 
though because the other circuits are
much<00:04:46.930> better<00:04:47.229> alright<00:04:47.800> guys<00:04:48.009> so<00:04:48.280> I'm<00:04:48.490> slap
