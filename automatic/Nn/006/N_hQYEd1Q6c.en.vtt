 talk about all this with someone you have to 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.220
 to say anything to anyone 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.070
 the story is so weird and 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:04:07.280

 that I know it but come we do not know 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.820
 even where the street we stop and what 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.300
 what happens to you 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.300
 [Laughs] 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:48.130
 it is true I greet the girls yes well 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.120
 you just discovered for monica 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.500
 turner 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.800
 I mean they are friends and nothing 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.590
 more 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.300
 [Music] 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.590
 no lastly she is aware or if we 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.730
 was in the nude big apartment 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.450
 when we saw them make love to 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.040
 through bay window 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.640
 in fact we rather made them to do 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.780
 love how to say against progress 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.160
 or so in reality they know that you 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.950
 you know but he does not know that rachel is at 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.030
 that's it yeah but you know 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.590
 now it does not matter who 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.940
 know what's enough to be at 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.260
 current so we can confess 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.700
 we are aware and a 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.920
 story of secrets and lies 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.450
 finally be finished or so we could 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.010
 do not tell them we know about it and 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:26.010
 having fun would not have lasted 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.010
 Yes 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.840
 girl is aware of it for both of us but 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.560
 I told them nothing to me how it 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.730
 the time you just told them 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:42.060

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.140
 joey and rachel I was planning on 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.850
 you talk about it but they made me 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.950
 promise not to say anything common sense I 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.270
 am really sorry but everything is 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.560
 finished now you go to them 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.150
 explain that you know they know 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.210
 and I will become again the one who does not 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.010
 absolutely nothing at all 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.480
 no no no we do not wait a second 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.940

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.620
 but yes we are great and she 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.940
 think they'll have us but the 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.180
 thing is, they do not know that 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.340
 we know they know what they 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:17.460
