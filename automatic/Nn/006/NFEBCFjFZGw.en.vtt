got a new connection to them and called
solar<00:00:23.250> bolts<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:24.119> basically<00:00:24.480> it's<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:25.019> ten

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
solar bolts and basically it's a ten

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.419 
solar bolts and basically it's a ten
times<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:26.130> amount<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.689> speed<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.429> they've

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
times the amount of speed and they've

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.519 
times the amount of speed and they've
that<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.849> be<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> push<00:00:30.240> through<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.539> then<00:00:31.019> usb3

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
that can be a push through and then usb3

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.280 
that can be a push through and then usb3
tomorrow<00:00:31.949> which<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.850> why<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.030> think<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.840> Apple

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
tomorrow which is why I think the Apple

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.819 
tomorrow which is why I think the Apple
uses<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.670> question<00:00:36.000> he<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.750> who<00:00:37.469> will<00:00:37.559> use

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
uses and the question he is who will use

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.190 
uses and the question he is who will use
the<00:00:37.980> little<00:00:38.190> tech<00:00:38.430> well<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.270> would<00:00:39.510> imagine<00:00:39.660> and

all time really and then it runs as you
swim<00:01:21.780> probably<00:01:22.409> would<00:01:22.890> run<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.549> within<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
swim probably would run just within the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.850

and the fact that it is faster you know

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.160 
and the fact that it is faster you know
we're<00:03:26.700> always<00:03:26.850> looking<00:03:27.030> for<00:03:27.180> faster<00:03:27.630> ways<00:03:27.780> to

we're always looking for faster ways to
a<00:03:28.200> chance<00:03:28.530> for<00:03:28.680> our<00:03:28.800> date<00:03:28.980> for<00:03:29.010> more<00:03:29.340> place<00:03:29.520> to

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
a chance for our date for more place to

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.580 
a chance for our date for more place to
another<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:30.120> believe<00:03:30.930> off<00:03:31.080> from<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.380> balls

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
another I believe off from the balls

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.979 
another I believe off from the balls
phenom<00:03:32.010> will<00:03:32.190> give<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.340> very<00:03:32.730> good<00:03:32.850> edge<00:03:33.420> over
