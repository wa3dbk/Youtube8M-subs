00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.220
A baby boy was born one day
In a stable far away

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.700
In a stable far away

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.980
He nestled in a manger bed
On straw he laid his tiny head

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.320
On straw he laid his tiny head

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.780
It's Christmas Day all over Earth 
let the bells ring out for Jesus' birth

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.280
It's Christmas Day all over Earth 
let the bells ring out for Jesus' birth

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:37.580

let the bells ring out for Jesus' birth

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:46.460
It's Christmas Day all over Earth 
let the bells ring out for Jesus' birth

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:57.440
The shepherds came from near and far 
guided by a lonely star

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:07.240
The Wise men travelled night and day 
To Bethlehem where Jesus lay

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.200
It's Christmas Day all over Earth 
let the bells ring out for Jesus' birth

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:25.520
It's Christmas Day all over Earth 
let the bells ring out for Jesus' birth

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.820
They looked upon that infant face
Saviour for the human race

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.880
So every year on Christmas Day
We'll thank dear God in our own way

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.800
It's Christmas Day all over Earth 
let the bells ring out for Jesus' birth

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:04.080
It's Christmas Day all over Earth 
let the bells ring out for Jesus' birth

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.320
It's Christmas Day all over Earth 
let the bells ring out for Jesus' birth

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.820

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.580
It's Christmas Day all over Earth 
let the bells ring out for Jesus' birth
