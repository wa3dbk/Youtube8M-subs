00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.750

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.750
 I distance you in this video 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:15.299
 awesome super short and above all he 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.750
 red stn.zgs.de 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.750
 Video 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.380
 you 've always wanted to skyrim 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.390
 actually have a companion 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.059
 what's on it and then another one 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.410
 looks pretty good then you have 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.940
 good luck that this video did 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.040
 there are no mistakes at all 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.960
 or so today, however, I'll show you 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.690
 toccata a very nice companion 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.250
 which means magic and flames 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.670
 healing magic in the fight support 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.010
 will be just like many other companions 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.250
 you can find them in the temple of 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.540
 bold counselor knows run and is located there 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.129
 In most cases, they are somewhere 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.769
 in the corner of the room and simply sets 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.360
 just lazy rum if you want it now but that 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.129
 theater follows you and in the fight 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.170
 you do not have to do anything to support it 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.520
 to speak as a year and that follows me 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.770
 select command 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.840
 as soon as you do that, it will be up to you 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.060
 fight your death at your side 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.130
 moment I just got to her 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.229
 life said that could be a problem 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.110
 represent there in their description 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.520
 she is immortal as well 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.840
 Can you marry her at her 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.610
 installation could be for 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.320
 I decide on different items 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.660
 However, have me for the cbj 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.430
 he decided in my opinion 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.070
 generally looks best 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.920
 besides, according to their statistics, theirs 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.840
 Personality has been put on 100 then 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.240
 moderate is the cutter with an iron 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.300
 by equipped and also with one 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.440
 small lakes stone that plays however 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.120
 not as big a role as you 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.300
 basically only with her anyway 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.070
 magic is fighting for me completely 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.380
 inconspicuously a barrel at the forge 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.710
 I also killed for ta 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.240
 short a little armor 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.540
 which actually looks pretty good 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.460
 and now I have at least something for that 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.610
 next murder adds near white 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.129
 Add a new location to this one 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.670
 on the map with the name Japan lodge 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.019
 which marks me pretty interesting 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.849
 At this mod is that she was then 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.790
 actually from a German mother 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.500
 comes as the name implies adds this 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.360
 mod a new place to their 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.189
 Japanese pretty look has 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.439
 and in my opinion damn cool 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.940
 does not really look like that though 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.250
 The world of pure skyrim 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.630
 However, it fits very well 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.600
 interesting this place once 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.460
 It's just a pity to look at mine 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.200
 opinion that this place is not 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.330
 really can inhabit 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.610
 Although there are possibilities his things 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.620
 There are both dummies you can store 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.930
 The armor can be put on weapons 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.700
 stands that you can use and also 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.620
 beds in which one can sleep 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.630
 however you can not really get in 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.250
 this building carries and feeds it 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.240
 Accordingly, no companion 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.640
 move in with 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.890
 the building tract generally has a very 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.290
 nice decor and also very cool 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.840
 functions what the putting away of armor 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.850
 and co concerns as well comes with 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.740
 This building also has a safe in it 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.720
 2000 gold 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.890
 I mentioned earlier that it was in 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.390
 this building drives many 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.820
 possibilities are his armor or 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.710
 also drop off weapon and here you can 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.750
 For example, see a building all alone 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.740
 used for his weapons 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.980
 can take off 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.360
 and admire them everywhere 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.190
 There is another one next to this building 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.350
 little girl in which one different 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.910
 you can set up dummies which his 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.989
 can put on armor and this 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.989
 can also admire 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.910
 the following murder should be especially 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.600
 the archers among you 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.069
 interest 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:53.370
 because in the place scope boys adds like the 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.860
 name says scope adds and adds 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.040
 This mod is especially cool though 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.010
 you have no or has a no mod 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.220
 has installed and therefore still 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.790
 Precisely what I personally can shoot 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.790
 think it's cool 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.130
 the next motto really changes 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.240
 nothing at the gameplay increases but 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.919
 in my opinion, the fun is immense 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.960
 because in principle, this place adds 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.620
 actually only on the map 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.450
 all the roads add something for me 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.310
 really much more enjoyable though 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.260
 in this way his way 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.419
 Do not lose sight of it and stop 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.450
 really knows exactly where to go 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.310
 next to the quality world map mod via 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.380
 means I have another one 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.450
 cards mod installs the whole 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.850
 card look a bit high resolution 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.650
 lets and for a better one at all 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.070
 looks and is in the description 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.390
 both mods due 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.510
 with this mode comes a really great 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.290
 nice installer one more 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.640
 Settings options are if you 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.980
 however, that wanted your card 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:12.620
 looks the same as mine you have 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:14.740
 Here are my settings 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:20.750
 Last murder for today is one sooner 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:23.240
 scary scary motzlar the one 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.240
 Damn house near river 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.620
 forest creates 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.120
 at first, this moth does not have that way 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.620
 very promised but then I saw 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.120
 that there are many different translations 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.800
 There is also a German as 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.450
 I figured that out 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.700
 then read me a bit smart 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.860
 on the german side and actually 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.600
 you did not need the original mod and 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.800
 you did not have to patch anything 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.150
 you just need the German 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.990
 version and download it 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.250
 everything works fine as already 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.410
 mentioned is the cursed 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.380
 house near river forest and the 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.930
 The first thing that's going to happen is this 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:03.700
 bloody skeletons on the way to the building 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.700
 lying on the forest path 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.970
 as soon as you see running into the woods 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.120
 Immediately the damn building with 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:30.040
 a relatively large cemetery and that 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.050
 is fighting here against a werewolf 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.300
 actually only by accident and not on the spot 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.440
 intended 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.480
 in front of the building you will find one 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.340
 bloody skeleton with a key and 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.410
 a note with the key you come 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.270
 then into the building and in the 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.510
 Note is a little prehistory too 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.440
 everything that has happened and me 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.300
 I do not want to play you great 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.230
 but I want to give you something 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.290
 give the way 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:56.050
 please take enough torches with or 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:58.120

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:05.290
 can or anything else then 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:07.450
 Are you as lost as I am? 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.830
 that's it with this video me 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.180
 Thank you very much for that 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.310
 that have been here 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:16.060
 and I followed you first 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:18.580

 Series and I will take care of it

 Let's see the week so often 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.430
 maybe a consequence to hew out or 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.000
 otherwise something 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:42.700
