the<00:02:07.110> smartphone<00:02:07.469> i<00:02:07.590> think<00:02:07.950> that's<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.220> really

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
the smartphone i think that's a really

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.190 
the smartphone i think that's a really
weird<00:02:08.700> placement<00:02:09.209> i<00:02:09.330> believe<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.810> they<00:02:10.170> should

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
weird placement i believe it they should

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.140 
weird placement i believe it they should
have<00:02:10.530> centred<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.190> i<00:02:11.310> think<00:02:11.670> might<00:02:12.030> have

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
have centred it i think might have

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.809 
have centred it i think might have
looked<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.870> much<00:02:13.020> better<00:02:13.080> but<00:02:13.500> i<00:02:13.560> knew
