00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.640 
together doesn't sound all that good it
sounds<00:02:19.370> quite<00:02:19.610> annoying<00:02:19.880> actually

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
sounds quite annoying actually

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.770 
sounds quite annoying actually
but<00:02:21.650> these<00:02:21.980> play<00:02:22.220> right<00:02:22.400> here<00:02:22.430> I<00:02:22.910> find<00:02:23.360> are

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
but these play right here I find are

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.949 
but these play right here I find are
pretty<00:02:24.200> good<00:02:24.410> when<00:02:24.590> they<00:02:24.680> go<00:02:24.829> together<00:02:25.959> okay

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
pretty good when they go together okay

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.130 
pretty good when they go together okay
