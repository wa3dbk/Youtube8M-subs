00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.280
 of the video for more information 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.789

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.699

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.170

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.660
 mexico with a new and exciting video 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.700
 how to get out in a space battle 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.580
 in the campaign composer mission in 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.020
 halo 4 now a thousand apologies if you already 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.820
 have seen this tutorial in some other 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.680
 side but I'm sure many 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.570
 people do not know how to do it and maybe 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.460
 they're interested in doing it then that's why 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.920
 that we are uploading to hell rich 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.989
 Mexico, as is normal, you are going to 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.120
 follow the normal campaign until 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.820
 come to this room that there are two of 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.830
 these identical to which they appear 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.360
 here but if this door is not opened 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.910
 up here you are not in a room 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.770
 indicated and you have to follow the second 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.990
 fourth that is where we are going to go 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.000
 and in that room is where we're going to do 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.030
 what we need to get out 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.170
 space and combat covenant 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.000
 indefinitely and once being here 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.580
 in the second room my friends jonathan 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.620
 is helping me with the capsules 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.710
 cast all the covenant before 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.300
 even enter this room they go to 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.790
 take a bit because the covenants 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.040
 they continue and they keep coming out but here goes to 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.720
 have a point where they do not leave anymore and it's 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.510
 when we are going to be able to continue with the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.270
 mission once they have finished 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.980
 get all the covenants out 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.230
 to give a checkpoint like I am 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.210
 giving right at this precise moment and 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.070
 then we get on this other 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.160
 platform where the door is 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.770
 that must be opened to be able to leave 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.110
 once we open the door for 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.390
 we go to the next room and here it is 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.570
 where I'm going to ask your attention in 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.030
 specific once they are here and 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.190
 follow right you are going to open this door 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.100
 and it will give you a checkpoint but do not leave 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.840
 to that side because if it's not going to 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.630
 work obviously closes the door 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.090
 behind you and forget about 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.340
 perform it and then do not get out 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.590
 that door and back know where 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.750
 they started this is to close the door 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.580
 from behind and be able to perform well in click 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.280
 it's going to cost a couple of tries but 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.030
 at a midpoint between certain death 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.540
 Y 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.250
 stay inside the station there is a 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.100
 invisible barrier that will allow us 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.540
 jump towards the tubes above and then 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.209
 here you just have to follow the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.160
 way and keep jumping to be able 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.110
 get to this space battle where 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.560
 let's meet with a couple of things 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.480
 curious the last tip of the video once 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.780
 being there do not get away so much where 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.910
 there are areas where the texture is already 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.340
 is not solid then you just step on 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.100
 where the young man is before stepping and there 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.380
 is where they know if the texture of the rock 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.060
 is solid or not and can also shoot 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.269
 towards the rock to realize if 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.940
 go through this rock or if it hits against 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.250
 the rock, thank you very much everyone 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.800
 to see I leave you with the rest of the 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.430
 video I hope you liked it

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.140
 to do it the clear glitch is therefore for me 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.940
 That's all part today I 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.870
