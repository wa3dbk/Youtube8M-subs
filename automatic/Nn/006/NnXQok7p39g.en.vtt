00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.830
 I welcome comrades gamers long ago on 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.990
 humble bundle i bought both alan wake of 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.210
 but he did not try to buy well, just 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.980
 because it 's still remady but nothing 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.440
 From this game I did not expect and when 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.010
 Still tried it was one 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.420
 of the best games of my life 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.730
 let's start as usual 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.100
 the main character is a writer who comes 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.289
 to a remote mountain town just to 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.780
 rest and spend a vacation lead 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.940
 Thoughts in order Well, and all that and then 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.219
 At the beginning, every hero begins more 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.530
 instead of the keys he needs 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.870
 some dumb from no less dumb 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.539
 grandmother and goes completely to another house 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.089
 and that very evening he wakes up in 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.850
 the whole time machine has gone by 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.219
 week but he doesn't remember anything about alice so 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.229
 and finally disappeared before reaching 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.999
 cities and having met with the sheriff he 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.370
 learns that the house in which he 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:06.250
 stayed altogether washed away in the lake yet 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.530
 many many years ago literally right there 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.680
 Alan Wake rings the phone turns 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.689
 his wife was kidnapped but why and why 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.880
 we have to figure out how and in general 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.740
 what's going on here i think you already 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.380
 long ago it was done because on pc 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.070
 The game was released in 2012 and on consoles and 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.109
 in general already 2010 is not for nothing at the beginning of the game 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.859
 mentioned steven king really 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:29.170
 alan wake 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.820
 very similar to one of his creations in 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.460
 first is the main character who 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.289
 writer how often does it happen at king 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.450
 the second is the scene of such 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.520
 remote town in which help 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.399
 never come then when you're on 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.289
 you need atmospheric add it that 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.969
 manuscript is scattered throughout the city 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.670
 which is written just what 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.039
 happening with the hero but the game itself is broken 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.850
 on such episodes of the chapter that even more 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.619
 gives it a resemblance to a book by far 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.049
 one of the most important factors of the game 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.299
 are her characters here they are made 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.429
 truly realistic reliably in 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.219
 unlike most pretentious and 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.830
 stupid video game characters like wife 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.250
 Alice who is afraid of the dark or himself 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.650
 hero 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.210
 alan wake nice damn it play 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.270
 for the normal man who 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.520
 understands what he is doing and thinks with his head or 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.710
 let's say the classic moment is king when 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.440
 sheriff sarah arrives like she 's here 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.980
 the police are all and here it is help but in fact 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.230
 business events are just beginning now 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.480
 move the gameplay the most important enemy 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.270
 alan wake is of course dark 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.280
 so he always carries a flashlight 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.290
 for example if you meet some 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.480
 obsessed woodcutter or other monster 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.880
 first thing you need to properly him 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.770
 light just the same from a flashlight then 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.410
 the darkness will go away it will be possible just 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.840
 shoot weapons in the game the most 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.980
 ordinary there gun shotgun 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.780
 hunting rifles 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.820
 but also the most important guest here 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.070
 a rocket launcher stands because it doesn't 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.400
 just kills and of course it accelerates 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.800
 darkness 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.620
 the game is natural with elements of horror 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.810
 This means that it will be dark all the time. 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.910
 will constantly be frightened by different attacks 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.800
 and ammo will always be missed 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.080
 well, of course like classic horror 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.450
 we will solve different puzzles 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.640
 very simple type there turn on the generator 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.460
 Click the cult button and all that 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.830
 like any good game scripts 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.209
 century wave a huge amount of events 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.490
 change with breakneck speed 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.130
 all the time something happens explodes 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.200
 collapses trying to scare us somehow 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.209
 In general, playing is very interesting and quite 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.730
 not boring separately I want to note 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.980
 level design he is very cool and 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.900
 really realistic really 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.060
 when you play wake do not think about 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.070
 that you are in a computer game and this 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.440
 did layla designers you just 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.900
 you are inside one big world 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.000
 sometimes the game even throws up different 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.300
 other entertainment let's say take a ride on 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.430
 typewriter well and stuff like that 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.270
 her repair career made only two 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.700
 game series 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.380
 2 pro max payne and 2 pro alan wake a and 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.160

 the developer 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.410
