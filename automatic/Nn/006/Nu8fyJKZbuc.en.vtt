well<00:01:36.840> about<00:01:37.140> there<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.740> back<00:01:38.189> will<00:01:38.579> stop

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
well about there the back will stop

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.340 
well about there the back will stop
turning<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.180> does<00:01:39.329> brick<00:01:39.630> fan<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
turning it does brick fan but the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.780 
turning it does brick fan but the
problem<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.740> i<00:01:40.979> think<00:01:41.280> there's<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.579> lot<00:01:41.670> of

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
problem is i think there's a lot of

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.569 
problem is i think there's a lot of
cable<00:01:42.000> stretch<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.659> these<00:01:42.840> these<00:01:43.590> old<00:01:43.799> cables

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
cable stretch on these these old cables

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.670 
cable stretch on these these old cables
so<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.780> i'm<00:01:45.840> going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.259> are<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.500> two

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
so what i'm going to do is are the two

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.980 
so what i'm going to do is are the two
new<00:01:46.890> brick<00:01:47.280> cables<00:01:47.880> i'm<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.689> going<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.840> put

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
new brick cables i'm just going to put

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.330 
new brick cables i'm just going to put
those<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.409> well<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.829> good<00:01:49.950> measure

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
those on as well just for good measure

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.980 
those on as well just for good measure
then<00:01:50.820> i<00:01:50.850> might<00:01:51.000> be<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.329> bike<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.869> and

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
then i might be with a bike you see and

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.450 
then i might be with a bike you see and
i've<00:01:52.110> got<00:01:52.229> new<00:01:52.380> bricks<00:01:52.710> i've<00:01:52.950> got<00:01:53.100> new<00:01:53.220> tires

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
i've got new bricks i've got new tires

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.289 
i've got new bricks i've got new tires

the<00:01:54.509> wheels<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:54.960> need<00:01:55.200> decent<00:01:55.649> condition

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the wheels are in need decent condition

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.310 
the wheels are in need decent condition
and<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.360> cables<00:01:57.780> are<00:01:57.869> there<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:58.110> well<00:01:58.290> that

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and if the cables are there as well that

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.950 
and if the cables are there as well that
will<00:01:58.649> help<00:01:58.939> so<00:01:59.939> i'm<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.540> these<00:02:00.719> wheels

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
will help so i'm in these wheels

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.300 
will help so i'm in these wheels
although<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.530> know<00:02:01.649> they're<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:01.979> turned

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
although you know they're not turned

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.620 
although you know they're not turned
percent<00:02:02.700> perfect<00:02:02.909> they<00:02:03.180> certainly<00:02:03.390> look<00:02:03.570> a

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
percent perfect they certainly look a

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.440 
percent perfect they certainly look a
lot<00:02:03.960> better<00:02:04.079> moving<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.619> last<00:02:04.649> video<00:02:05.009> so

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
lot better moving on the last video so

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.730 
lot better moving on the last video so
so<00:02:06.450> look<00:02:06.659> at<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:06.869> bread<00:02:07.110> crumbs<00:02:07.380> around<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
so look at this bread crumbs around the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.960 
so look at this bread crumbs around the
back<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.039> back<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:08.580> see<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.759> nice

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
back of the back you can see the nice

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.740 
back of the back you can see the nice
new<00:02:09.179> tales<00:02:09.450> I've<00:02:09.599> got<00:02:09.720> all<00:02:09.840> I've<00:02:10.080> been

new tales I've got all I've been

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.570 
new tales I've got all I've been
on<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.350> ground<00:02:11.560> gorilla<00:02:11.890> yet<00:02:12.100> but<00:02:12.310> you<00:02:12.460> can

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
on the ground gorilla yet but you can

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.180 
on the ground gorilla yet but you can
see<00:02:12.730> this<00:02:13.350> this<00:02:14.350> cable<00:02:14.800> here<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:14.950> runs

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
see this this cable here that runs

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.870 
see this this cable here that runs
through<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.460> back

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
through the back

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.700 
through the back
we've<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.240> been<00:02:16.420> setting<00:02:16.780> up<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.020> this

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
we've just been setting up this this

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.380 
we've just been setting up this this
braking<00:02:18.190> system<00:02:18.580> on<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.760> back<00:02:18.910> edge<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.270> can

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
braking system on the back edge you can

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.750 
braking system on the back edge you can
tell<00:02:19.630> now<00:02:19.840> this<00:02:20.050> this<00:02:20.740> arm<00:02:21.010> he<00:02:21.220> actually<00:02:21.550> moves

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
tell now this this arm he actually moves

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.460 
tell now this this arm he actually moves
round<00:02:21.910> on<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> spline<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:22.900> can<00:02:23.050> set<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.380> at

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
round on a spline so you can set it at

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.920 
round on a spline so you can set it at
various<00:02:23.920> points<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:25.090> make<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.330> cable<00:02:25.510> longer

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
various points and make the cable longer

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.270 
various points and make the cable longer
and<00:02:26.050> shorter<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:26.590> you've<00:02:26.740> got<00:02:26.830> an<00:02:26.920> adjustment

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
and shorter so you've got an adjustment

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.120 
and shorter so you've got an adjustment
on<00:02:27.460> there<00:02:27.760> there's<00:02:28.600> also<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.960> wear<00:02:29.620> indicator

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
on there there's also a wear indicator

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.890 
on there there's also a wear indicator
that's<00:02:30.370> on<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.580> back<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:30.910> brick<00:02:31.150> and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
that's on the back of the brick and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.300 
that's on the back of the brick and
there's<00:02:32.020> also<00:02:32.140> an<00:02:32.350> adjuster<00:02:32.770> here<00:02:32.920> which<00:02:33.130> is

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
there's also an adjuster here which is

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.430 
there's also an adjuster here which is
the<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:34.000> normal<00:02:34.330> way<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.450> would<00:02:34.930> do<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.170> until

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
the the normal way you would do it until

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.280 
the the normal way you would do it until
you<00:02:35.560> run<00:02:35.680> out<00:02:35.770> of<00:02:35.830> brick<00:02:36.130> shoes<00:02:36.460> but<00:02:36.850> even<00:02:37.750> with

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
you run out of brick shoes but even with

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.440 
you run out of brick shoes but even with
the<00:02:38.440> adjuster<00:02:38.830> right<00:02:38.980> in<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.430> can<00:02:40.060> still<00:02:40.270> make

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
the adjuster right in I can still make

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.480 
the adjuster right in I can still make
it<00:02:40.510> stop<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.590> brick<00:02:41.800> you<00:02:41.950> can<00:02:42.100> see<00:02:42.220> there<00:02:42.400> the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
it stop the brick you can see there the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.770 
it stop the brick you can see there the
wheel<00:02:42.670> serves<00:02:42.970> they<00:02:43.090> need<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.360> push<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.720> a

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
wheel serves they need to push it a

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.360 
wheel serves they need to push it a
little<00:02:43.810> bit<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.410> I'm<00:02:44.950> just<00:02:45.070> trying<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.280> move

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
little bit and I'm just trying to move

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.830 
little bit and I'm just trying to move
it<00:02:45.520> around<00:02:45.610> my<00:02:45.880> knee<00:02:46.000> there<00:02:46.270> you<00:02:46.330> can<00:02:46.450> see<00:02:46.600> it's

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
it around my knee there you can see it's

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.550 
it around my knee there you can see it's
already<00:02:48.690> stopping<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.810> wheel<00:02:50.110> from<00:02:50.350> turning

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
already stopping the wheel from turning

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.650 
already stopping the wheel from turning
but<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.580> problem<00:02:51.910> is<00:02:52.000> as<00:02:52.120> I've<00:02:52.270> shown<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.510> I

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
but the problem is as I've shown you I

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.750 
but the problem is as I've shown you I
can<00:02:52.810> still<00:02:53.050> I<00:02:53.530> could<00:02:54.010> still<00:02:54.220> push<00:02:54.400> this<00:02:54.550> lever

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
can still I could still push this lever

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.260 
can still I could still push this lever
right<00:02:55.090> in<00:02:55.240> so<00:02:55.450> I'm<00:02:55.510> just<00:02:55.660> gonna<00:02:55.750> put<00:02:56.560> these<00:02:57.270> new

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
right in so I'm just gonna put these new

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.070 
right in so I'm just gonna put these new
brake<00:02:58.570> levers<00:02:59.020> on<00:02:59.170> new<00:02:59.800> brick<00:03:00.040> cables<00:03:00.730> on<00:03:01.080> and

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
brake levers on new brick cables on and

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.540 
brake levers on new brick cables on and
then<00:03:02.290> I'm<00:03:02.620> gonna<00:03:02.770> move<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.100> part<00:03:03.310> ralph's

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
then I'm gonna move this part ralph's

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
here I think we should be a hundred

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.940 
here I think we should be a hundred
milliliter<00:03:25.630> of<00:03:25.780> 1030

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
milliliter of 1030

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.030 
milliliter of 1030
s<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.340> 1030<00:03:27.940> island<00:03:28.510> there<00:03:28.690> I<00:03:28.900> think<00:03:29.590> looking

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
s a 1030 island there I think looking

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.460 
s a 1030 island there I think looking
under<00:03:30.340> here<00:03:30.459> there's<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:31.630> was<00:03:31.750> just<00:03:31.930> a<00:03:32.050> drain

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
under here there's a it was just a drain

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.470 
under here there's a it was just a drain
bolt<00:03:32.709> which<00:03:32.890> is<00:03:32.920> our<00:03:33.220> there<00:03:33.430> see<00:03:34.060> if<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.180> can<00:03:34.300> get

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
bolt which is our there see if I can get

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.570 
bolt which is our there see if I can get
on<00:03:34.570> it<00:03:34.600> it's<00:03:35.530> just<00:03:35.650> on<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:35.980> back<00:03:36.130> under<00:03:36.430> there

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
on it it's just on the back under there

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.690 
on it it's just on the back under there
so<00:03:37.209> I'm<00:03:37.300> just<00:03:37.420> going<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.660> take<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:37.959> off<00:03:38.110> here
