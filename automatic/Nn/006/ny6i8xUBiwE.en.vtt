00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
go anywhere on the map you don't have to

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.020 
go anywhere on the map you don't have to
choose<00:00:37.050> any<00:00:37.800> specific<00:00:38.370> place<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.700> just<00:00:38.730> use

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
choose any specific place we just use

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.310 
choose any specific place we just use
the<00:00:39.149> airport<00:00:39.600> because<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> easiest

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the airport because it's the easiest

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.360 
the airport because it's the easiest
place<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.680> use<00:00:41.010> no<00:00:41.489> cars<00:00:41.790> coming<00:00:42.239> blah<00:00:42.420> blah

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
place to use no cars coming blah blah

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.680 
place to use no cars coming blah blah
but<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.700> use<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:44.969> specific<00:00:45.149> plane

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
but you have to use this specific plane

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.240 
but you have to use this specific plane
right<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.410> right<00:00:46.890> side<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.219> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
right here it's on the right side is a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.799 
right here it's on the right side is a
little<00:00:47.460> airport<00:00:47.969> one<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> stunt<00:00:48.539> planes

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
little airport one of the stunt planes

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.330 
little airport one of the stunt planes
there's<00:00:49.440> two<00:00:49.590> different<00:00:49.739> methods<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.250> you

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
there's two different methods that you

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.060 
there's two different methods that you
could<00:00:50.579> use<00:00:50.640> but<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.510> one's<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> easiest<00:00:52.199> so

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
could use but this one's the easiest so

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.500 
could use but this one's the easiest so
basically<00:00:53.460> all<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.730> do<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.180> park<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
basically all you do is you park the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.060 
basically all you do is you park the
plane<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> middle<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.350> air<00:00:55.500> filter<00:00:55.949> in

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
plane in the middle of the air filter in

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.200 
plane in the middle of the air filter in
the<00:00:56.129> middle<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.460> street<00:00:56.699> wherever<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.059> want

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the middle of street wherever you want

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.299 
the middle of street wherever you want
to<00:00:57.270> park<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.600> at<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.920> drive<00:00:59.129> up

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
to park it at and you just drive up

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.430 
to park it at and you just drive up
slowly<00:00:59.670> on<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.329> back<00:01:00.510> side<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.350> do

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
slowly on the back side of it if you do

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.900 
slowly on the back side of it if you do
the<00:01:01.530> front<00:01:01.710> side<00:01:02.010> there's<00:01:02.579> like<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> little

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the front side there's like a little

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.310 
the front side there's like a little
wheel<00:01:03.149> there<00:01:03.359> that'll<00:01:03.629> kind<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.899> block<00:01:04.110> you

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
wheel there that'll kind of block you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.170 
wheel there that'll kind of block you
you<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.739> still<00:01:04.920> do<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:05.610> easier<00:01:05.970> this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
you can still do it but it's easier this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.880 
you can still do it but it's easier this
way<00:01:06.240> once<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.020> get<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> back<00:01:07.530> side<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
way once you get to the back side of the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.740 
way once you get to the back side of the
plane<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.220> go<00:01:08.400> up<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.760> slowly<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.450> then

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
plane just go up to it slowly and then

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.240 
plane just go up to it slowly and then
all<00:01:10.049> you're<00:01:10.260> gonna<00:01:10.350> do<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.650> accelerate<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
little bit more speed when you're going

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.530 
little bit more speed when you're going
and<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.650> hit<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> little<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.670> wing<00:01:32.880> it's

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and you hit the little the wing it's

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.149 
and you hit the little the wing it's
gonna<00:01:33.720> push<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.079> completely<00:01:34.470> back<00:01:34.799> you'll<00:01:35.009> go

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
gonna push you completely back you'll go

gonna push you completely back you'll go
really<00:01:35.520> slow<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.210> you're<00:01:36.390> gonna<00:01:36.479> be<00:01:36.630> at<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
really slow but you're gonna be at the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.390 
really slow but you're gonna be at the
12<00:01:37.020> o'clock<00:01:37.079> stance<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:38.070> use<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.310> for

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
12 o'clock stance so you can use it for

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.280 
12 o'clock stance so you can use it for
like<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> little<00:01:38.820> short<00:01:39.600> type<00:01:39.840> video<00:01:40.170> or

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
like a little short type video or

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.250 
like a little short type video or
anything

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
anything

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.050 
anything
whatever<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:41.680> guys<00:01:41.770> are<00:01:41.830> trying<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.190> do<00:01:42.430> if

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
whatever you guys are trying to do if

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.550 
whatever you guys are trying to do if
you<00:01:43.330> guys<00:01:43.420> want<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.750> do<00:01:43.870> the<00:01:43.990> second<00:01:44.410> method

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
you guys want to do the second method

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.170 
you guys want to do the second method
it's<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.980> little<00:01:45.190> bit<00:01:45.280> harder<00:01:45.670> but<00:01:45.820> you<00:01:45.880> have

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
it's a little bit harder but you have

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.970 
it's a little bit harder but you have
someone<00:01:46.420> driving<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.960> little<00:01:47.200> pedestrian<00:01:47.320> car

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
someone driving a little pedestrian car

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.910 
someone driving a little pedestrian car
like<00:01:48.160> this<00:01:48.400> or<00:01:48.730> just<00:01:48.760> a<00:01:49.030> regular<00:01:49.150> car<00:01:49.800> you<00:01:50.800> have

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
like this or just a regular car you have

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.160 
like this or just a regular car you have
them<00:01:51.100> go<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.910> have<00:01:52.060> them<00:01:52.210> stop<00:01:52.570> completely

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
them go you have them stop completely

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.110 
them go you have them stop completely
and<00:01:53.380> then<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:53.920> drive<00:01:54.190> at<00:01:54.370> them<00:01:54.550> just<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:54.880> little

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
and then you drive at them just a little

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.300 
and then you drive at them just a little
bit<00:01:55.270> until<00:01:55.390> you<00:01:55.630> get<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.990> Willie<00:01:56.230> as<00:01:56.500> as<00:01:57.010> your

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
bit until you get the Willie as as your

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.920 
bit until you get the Willie as as your
Willie<00:01:57.520> starts<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:57.970> pop<00:01:58.150> up<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:58.540> have<00:01:58.690> them

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
Willie starts to pop up you have them

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.440 
Willie starts to pop up you have them
drive<00:01:59.680> off<00:01:59.710> completely<00:02:00.370> so<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.700> they<00:02:01.000> know

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
drive off completely so that they know

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.570 
drive off completely so that they know
that<00:02:01.480> you<00:02:01.900> really<00:02:02.170> could<00:02:02.350> continue<00:02:02.890> but<00:02:03.460> yeah

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
that you really could continue but yeah

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.980 
that you really could continue but yeah
this<00:02:03.820> method<00:02:04.180> takes<00:02:04.300> a<00:02:04.450> little<00:02:04.600> bit<00:02:04.750> longer

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
this method takes a little bit longer

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.990 
this method takes a little bit longer
because<00:02:05.260> it's<00:02:05.620> more<00:02:05.800> timing<00:02:06.220> on<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.490> car<00:02:06.760> and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
because it's more timing on the car and

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000 
because it's more timing on the car and
sometimes<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.290> Willie<00:02:08.500> will<00:02:08.680> just<00:02:08.860> get

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
sometimes the the Willie will just get

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.470 
sometimes the the Willie will just get
stuck<00:02:09.310> or<00:02:09.460> whatever<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:09.820> you'll<00:02:09.910> fly<00:02:10.090> off<00:02:10.300> the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 
stuck or whatever and you'll fly off the

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.200 
stuck or whatever and you'll fly off the
bike<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:11.440> I'd<00:02:11.530> recommend<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:12.070> plane<00:02:12.340> line<00:02:12.580> but

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
bike so I'd recommend the plane line but

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.730 
bike so I'd recommend the plane line but
it's<00:02:13.330> also<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.660> little<00:02:13.840> bit<00:02:14.050> difficult<00:02:14.290> because

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
it's also a little bit difficult because

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.830 
it's also a little bit difficult because
the<00:02:15.040> plane<00:02:15.250> one<00:02:15.460> kind<00:02:16.240> of<00:02:16.300> shoots<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.630> at<00:02:16.720> an

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
the plane one kind of shoots you at an

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.210 
the plane one kind of shoots you at an
angle<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:17.380> if<00:02:17.470> you're<00:02:17.560> trying<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.770> do<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.010> for<00:02:18.190> a

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
angle so if you're trying to do it for a

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.620 
angle so if you're trying to do it for a
video<00:02:18.520> or<00:02:18.580> something<00:02:18.730> like<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.330> it's<00:02:19.480> gonna

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
video or something like that it's gonna

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.210 
video or something like that it's gonna
be<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.810> little<00:02:20.020> bit<00:02:20.200> more<00:02:20.320> difficult<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.070> you

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
be a little bit more difficult and you

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.650 
be a little bit more difficult and you
guys<00:02:21.340> could<00:02:21.520> see<00:02:21.700> how<00:02:21.820> slow<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.150> makes<00:02:22.360> him<00:02:22.510> go

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
guys could see how slow it makes him go

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.210 
guys could see how slow it makes him go
because<00:02:22.810> he's<00:02:23.110> forced<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.620> like<00:02:23.800> an<00:02:23.920> upward

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
because he's forced in like an upward

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.890 
because he's forced in like an upward
position<00:02:24.430> where<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.000> backs<00:02:25.210> like<00:02:25.420> dragging

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
position where the backs like dragging

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.270 
position where the backs like dragging
so<00:02:26.050> if<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:26.260> guys<00:02:26.350> wanted<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.740> do<00:02:26.920> something

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
so if you guys wanted to do something

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.730 
so if you guys wanted to do something

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
like that to use it in a video I mean

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.840 
like that to use it in a video I mean
it's<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:29.920> cool<00:02:30.070> little<00:02:30.190> thing<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:30.700> could
