00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
hour impact bar and it was humans doing

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.510 
hour impact bar and it was humans doing
it<00:02:37.940> not<00:02:38.240> machinery<00:02:38.900> every<00:02:39.500> car<00:02:39.770> is<00:02:39.860> adjusted<00:02:40.430> a

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
it not machinery every car is adjusted a

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.120 
it not machinery every car is adjusted a
little<00:02:40.550> differently<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:42.290> even<00:02:42.830> if<00:02:42.950> you're

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
little differently so even if you're

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.060 
little differently so even if you're
installing<00:02:43.459> like<00:02:43.940> Rama<00:02:44.209> 79<00:02:44.959> we<00:02:45.470> found<00:02:45.770> that<00:02:45.920> we

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
installing like Rama 79 we found that we

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.979 
installing like Rama 79 we found that we
needed<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.430> go<00:02:46.700> through<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.270> drill<00:02:47.600> some<00:02:47.630> new
