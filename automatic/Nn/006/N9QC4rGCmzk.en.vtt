00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello million friends and sincerely 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.830
 Welcome to the seventh minecraft billing 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.660
 Tip a little shorter today because 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.340
 I have birthday and I do not like that 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.139
 have a lot of time to record the whole 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.610
 So today we will be just this little one 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.599
 make lamp i hope you like it 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.190
 anyway and then I would say 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.190
 Let's start right after the intro 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.779
 Let's start with that now 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.670
 actual video I have here now 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.320
 in the inventory a professional for items to do so 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.390
 I've now also times the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.190
 appropriate number packed that 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.660
 means just write down in 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.770
 The comments like that will find if I do 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.870
 here practically simply below 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.879
 according to the number at the 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.250
 cheap tips purely pack how much you 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.199
 we need budget for this tutorial 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.350
 have redstone blog a funnel four 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.089
 Falling behind a redstone lamp 15 being 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.519
 I have to look into how long your lamp is 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.230
 Just hang down and two paving 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.670
 stone wall and here we start 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.460
 simply we put our paving stone 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.809
 wall then put down here then 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.879
 according to four counters on it 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.530
 more cobblestone wall then come 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.869
 the doctors lamb and now we have that 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.020
 whole here with the reactor block 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.310
 activate 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.259
 You'll see if we do that again 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.759
 get rid of that again that means we 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.560
 activate that and for that he needs 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.539
 Now the next step is a server 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.240
 best buck rogers at god could be there 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.429
 now just lay in command stop 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.410
 enter and that will effect in the end 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:21.670
 that no blog updates are registered anymore 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.410
 or be executed 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.850
 that means we are being executed 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.830
 Now simply remove the block sets 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.780
 down here and judge here and here 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.009
 Now fly down a bit 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.450
 and then we put in this 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.830
 We can not report reporting there 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.899
 get down to our sound 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.289
 also outside a few trapdoors 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.869
 and if we did that then 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.630
 we can practically stop the command 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.130
 lag - c enter 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.289
 and now we are through the whole block 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.720
 a b2 allows you to do that now 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.640
 that if we update a blog here 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.560
 to run this redstone blog 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.720
 which would delete again that means we 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.280
 build from here and you see the whole 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.599
 extinguished again if that is the case 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.910
 you just have to down here 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:02.590
 For example, over here a 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.020
 then he would have to put the redstone blog on it 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.759
 when the stop was over again 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.050
 remove just as build it in 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.479
 end effect should still look 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.700
 and then you do it all again 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.110
 stop lay - accessible and it 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.250
 everything works fine if you have the video 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.930
 I would have liked it 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.400
 of course, as always, about a positive 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.440
 You are here, too 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.480
 to the last minecraft billing tip there 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.849
 it's really about how we perfect 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.410
 and you can also find 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.060
 on the side a few to the left 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.080
 social media facebook twitter google 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.400
 plus 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.900
 just pass look as need 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.220
 also off and as well as the current 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.630
 always up to date 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.850
 of course you can of course 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.770
 if you do not have another video anymore 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.600
 miss who is subscribing to my channel 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.430

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.630
 The next time we skin until then 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.630
