we<00:00:02.340> live<00:00:02.550> in<00:00:02.639> an<00:00:02.760> age<00:00:02.879> where<00:00:03.210> everything<00:00:03.780> is

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
we live in an age where everything is

we live in an age where everything is
changing<00:00:04.380> like<00:00:04.710> completely<00:00:05.549> new<00:00:05.609> things

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
changing like completely new things

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.120 
changing like completely new things
happening<00:00:06.299> there's<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.810> period<00:00:07.680> where<00:00:08.010> the

happening there's a period where the
amount<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.670> change<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.240> immensely<00:00:09.990> rapid

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
amount of change is so immensely rapid

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.860

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.950 
it's an awesome event not only do I get
to<00:02:14.290> hang<00:02:14.470> out<00:02:14.680> with<00:02:14.950> like-minded<00:02:15.520> people<00:02:16.180> but

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
to hang out with like-minded people but

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.500 
to hang out with like-minded people but
the<00:02:17.110> sparks<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.740> they<00:02:18.250> fly<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:19.150> the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
the sparks that they fly and the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.100 
the sparks that they fly and the
convergence<00:02:19.960> of<00:02:20.470> ideas<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.640> think<00:02:22.570> bring<00:02:22.840> about

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
convergence of ideas I think bring about

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.960 
convergence of ideas I think bring about
this<00:02:23.320> whole<00:02:23.560> exponential<00:02:24.190> experience<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.940> a

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
this whole exponential experience to a

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:25.920 
this whole exponential experience to a
whole<00:02:25.000> new<00:02:25.330> level

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
whole new level

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.740 
whole new level
here<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.890> get<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.190> perfect<00:02:27.430> blend<00:02:27.850> of<00:02:28.030> the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
here you get the perfect blend of the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.530 
here you get the perfect blend of the
visionaries<00:02:29.320> with<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.590> big<00:02:29.770> ideas<00:02:30.390> with<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
visionaries with the big ideas with the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.750 
visionaries with the big ideas with the
titans<00:02:31.990> of<00:02:32.110> industry<00:02:32.230> then<00:02:32.860> could<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.550> turn

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
titans of industry then could you turn

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.790 
titans of industry then could you turn
them<00:02:33.970> into<00:02:34.120> reality

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.800 

people<00:02:38.520> they<00:02:38.850> check<00:02:39.090> their<00:02:39.240> egos<00:02:39.480> at<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.690> door

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
people they check their egos at the door

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.260 
people they check their egos at the door
