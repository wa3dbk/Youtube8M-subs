I<00:01:04.089> think<00:01:04.210> somebody<00:01:04.690> posted<00:01:05.080> was<00:01:05.290> that<00:01:05.700> you

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
I think somebody posted was that you

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.130 
I think somebody posted was that you
know<00:01:06.790> there<00:01:06.970> is<00:01:07.000> no<00:01:07.210> reception<00:01:07.480> shoe<00:01:07.900> stay

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
know there is no reception shoe stay

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.440 
know there is no reception shoe stay
tuned<00:01:08.350> right<00:01:08.740> so<00:01:08.980> stay<00:01:09.190> tuned<00:01:09.450> obviously

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
tuned right so stay tuned obviously

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.780 
tuned right so stay tuned obviously
maybe<00:01:11.020> they<00:01:11.320> have<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.620> software<00:01:12.280> fix<00:01:12.490> that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
maybe they have a software fix that

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.450 
maybe they have a software fix that
could<00:01:13.150> potentially<00:01:13.600> remedy<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.440> problem<00:01:14.830> I'm

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
could potentially remedy the problem I'm

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.430 
could potentially remedy the problem I'm
not<00:01:15.820> quite<00:01:16.090> so<00:01:16.330> sure<00:01:16.360> because<00:01:16.840> it<00:01:17.140> seems<00:01:17.320> like

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
not quite so sure because it seems like

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.960 
not quite so sure because it seems like
it's<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.650> design<00:01:17.950> flaw<00:01:18.250> more<00:01:18.550> so<00:01:18.760> than

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
it's a design flaw more so than

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.300 
it's a design flaw more so than
something<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.830> operating<00:01:20.830> system<00:01:21.130> can

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
something that the operating system can

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.720 
something that the operating system can
repair<00:01:21.670> but<00:01:22.240> you<00:01:22.690> know<00:01:22.810> i'm<00:01:23.470> not<00:01:23.800> expert<00:01:24.490> at

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
repair but you know i'm not expert at

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
some sort of case will as long as you

but as soon as I bridge the gap with my
palm<00:03:00.100> Wow<00:03:01.100> look<00:03:01.430> at<00:03:01.490> that<00:03:01.550> I<00:03:01.940> went<00:03:02.210> from<00:03:02.360> five

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
palm Wow look at that I went from five

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.120 
palm Wow look at that I went from five
bars<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:04.340> nothing<00:03:05.470> so<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.560> saw<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.800> there<00:03:06.920> guys

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
bars to nothing so you saw it there guys

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.310 
bars to nothing so you saw it there guys
so<00:03:07.370> that's<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.790> issue<00:03:07.940> first<00:03:08.660> off<00:03:08.900> so<00:03:09.080> I<00:03:09.110> let

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
so that's the issue first off so I let

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.590 
so that's the issue first off so I let
go<00:03:09.500> long<00:03:10.280> as<00:03:10.340> you<00:03:10.430> let<00:03:10.580> go<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:11.270> will<00:03:11.360> slowly

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
go long as you let go it will slowly

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.090 
go long as you let go it will slowly
start<00:03:11.750> gaining<00:03:12.080> its<00:03:12.320> signal<00:03:12.650> strength<00:03:12.890> back

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
start gaining its signal strength back

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:21.370 
start gaining its signal strength back
and<00:03:13.900> reception<00:03:16.780> hopefully<00:03:19.750> let's<00:03:20.750> hope<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.140> I'm

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
and reception hopefully let's hope I I'm

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.020 
and reception hopefully let's hope I I'm
not<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.680> first<00:03:21.830> example<00:03:22.430> of<00:03:22.550> killing<00:03:22.880> your

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
not the first example of killing your

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.680 
not the first example of killing your
signal<00:03:23.360> permanently<00:03:24.940> there<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.090> go<00:03:26.209> so<00:03:26.510> see

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
signal permanently there you go so see

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.910 
signal permanently there you go so see
they're<00:03:26.870> just<00:03:26.900> spiked<00:03:27.380> all<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.650> way<00:03:27.739> back<00:03:27.860> to

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
they're just spiked all the way back to

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.520 
they're just spiked all the way back to
five<00:03:28.190> now<00:03:28.489> let's<00:03:28.820> do<00:03:28.970> a<00:03:29.000> quick<00:03:29.209> test<00:03:29.510> so<00:03:30.470> i'll

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
five now let's do a quick test so i'll

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.140 
five now let's do a quick test so i'll
just<00:03:30.560> show<00:03:30.830> you<00:03:30.860> guys<00:03:31.130> i'm<00:03:31.520> going<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.850> put<00:03:32.030> on

just show you guys i'm going to put on

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.360 
just show you guys i'm going to put on
the<00:03:32.330> bottom<00:03:32.660> portion<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:33.380> this<00:03:33.620> ifrogz<00:03:34.100> lutz

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
the bottom portion of this ifrogz lutz

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.550 
the bottom portion of this ifrogz lutz
case<00:03:34.610> you<00:03:35.390> don't<00:03:35.540> need<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.810> whole<00:03:35.989> case<00:03:36.290> i

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
case you don't need the whole case i

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.840 
case you don't need the whole case i
mean<00:03:36.709> i<00:03:36.860> can<00:03:37.010> just<00:03:37.130> recreate<00:03:37.310> this<00:03:37.580> at<00:03:37.760> the

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
mean i can just recreate this at the

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.080 
mean i can just recreate this at the
bottom<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:38.810> there's<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.200> five<00:03:39.380> bars<00:03:40.030> now<00:03:41.030> I

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
bottom so there's the five bars now I

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.229 
bottom so there's the five bars now I
hold<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.680> can<00:03:45.920> see<00:03:46.070> they're<00:03:46.340> still

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
hold it and you can see they're still

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:57.560 
hold it and you can see they're still
holding<00:03:48.340> still<00:03:49.340> nothing

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.780 

but<00:03:59.190> here's<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.310> issue<00:04:00.520> I<00:04:02.280> lost<00:04:03.280> two<00:04:03.520> bars

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
but here's the issue I lost two bars

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.450 
but here's the issue I lost two bars
there<00:04:04.110> but<00:04:05.110> I<00:04:05.140> didn't<00:04:05.500> lose<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.890> signal<00:04:06.100> out

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
there but I didn't lose the signal out

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.550 
there but I didn't lose the signal out
right<00:04:06.850> so<00:04:07.570> I<00:04:07.600> don't<00:04:07.810> know<00:04:07.900> if<00:04:07.990> that<00:04:08.170> could<00:04:08.350> just

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
right so I don't know if that could just

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.550 
right so I don't know if that could just
be<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.740> Wi-Fi<00:04:09.340> in<00:04:09.460> my<00:04:09.580> house<00:04:09.930> or<00:04:10.930> whatever<00:04:11.080> but

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
be the Wi-Fi in my house or whatever but

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.000 
be the Wi-Fi in my house or whatever but
a<00:04:11.740> case<00:04:12.070> seems<00:04:12.490> to<00:04:12.820> at<00:04:13.210> least<00:04:13.680> minimize<00:04:14.680> the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
a case seems to at least minimize the

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.710 
a case seems to at least minimize the
issue<00:04:15.750> that<00:04:16.750> is<00:04:16.870> occurring<00:04:17.140> between<00:04:17.580> you<00:04:18.580> know

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
issue that is occurring between you know

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.970
