and in a cloud the bottom center of the

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.970 
and in a cloud the bottom center of the
cloud<00:00:30.340> tends<00:00:30.730> to<00:00:30.939> be<00:00:31.059> heaviest<00:00:31.449> and<00:00:31.980> darkest

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
lightest tones which are going to be

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.440 
lightest tones which are going to be
close<00:01:22.599> to<00:01:22.630> that<00:01:23.340> white<00:01:24.340> kind<00:01:24.789> of<00:01:24.880> color<00:01:25.090> i

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450

because<00:01:45.849> we're<00:01:46.149> going<00:01:46.239> to<00:01:46.330> come<00:01:46.509> in<00:01:46.750> with<00:01:46.929> my

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
because we're going to come in with my

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.229 
because we're going to come in with my
special<00:01:47.800> technique<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:48.849> we're<00:01:49.090> going<00:01:49.209> to

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:49.239 
special technique and we're going to

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:52.100 
special technique and we're going to
blend<00:01:49.660> the<00:01:49.989> cloud<00:01:50.289> to<00:01:50.709> make<00:01:50.890> it<00:01:51.039> look<00:01:51.190> soft<00:01:51.670> and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
blend the cloud to make it look soft and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.940 
blend the cloud to make it look soft and
really<00:01:53.110> luxurious

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.110 

right<00:01:59.950> now<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.190> cloud<00:02:00.640> looks<00:02:00.910> very

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
right now the cloud looks very

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.390 
right now the cloud looks very
impressionistic<00:02:01.720> I<00:02:02.200> like<00:02:02.770> things<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.160> be<00:02:03.280> a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
impressionistic I like things to be a

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.130 
impressionistic I like things to be a
little<00:02:03.580> bit<00:02:03.790> more<00:02:03.940> realistic<00:02:04.330> and<00:02:04.870> a<00:02:04.900> little

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
little bit more realistic and a little

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.740 
little bit more realistic and a little
bit<00:02:05.260> softer<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:06.130> got<00:02:06.640> my<00:02:06.820> darks<00:02:07.210> where<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.450> want

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
bit softer I got my darks where I want

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.080 
bit softer I got my darks where I want
them<00:02:07.870> my<00:02:08.080> medium<00:02:08.470> tones<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:09.040> my<00:02:09.160> lights<00:02:09.460> now

I'm<00:02:10.119> going<00:02:10.600> to<00:02:10.690> smooth<00:02:10.990> them<00:02:11.110> out<00:02:11.260> with<00:02:11.920> my

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
I'm going to smooth them out with my

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.580 
I'm going to smooth them out with my
special<00:02:12.340> technique<00:02:12.850> which<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.360> using<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.990> hawk

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
special technique which is using a hawk

a<00:02:14.830> chinese<00:02:15.580> water<00:02:15.940> color<00:02:16.270> brush<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:17.230> smooth

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
a chinese water color brush to smooth

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.740 
a chinese water color brush to smooth
out<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.220> edges<00:02:18.250> I'm<00:02:19.180> going<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.360> take<00:02:19.540> a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
out the edges I'm going to take a

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.540 
out the edges I'm going to take a
smaller<00:02:20.170> one<00:02:21.600> like<00:02:22.600> this<00:02:22.890> I'm<00:02:23.890> going<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.190> start

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
smaller one like this I'm going to start

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.730 
smaller one like this I'm going to start
with<00:02:24.820> my<00:02:25.000> lights<00:02:25.270> now<00:02:25.600> because<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.410> don't<00:02:26.650> want

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
with my lights now because I don't want

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.560 
with my lights now because I don't want
the<00:02:27.010> dark<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.460> get<00:02:27.580> into<00:02:27.880> my<00:02:28.000> lights<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:30.570> all

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:22.530 
particularly like it that dark then I'm
going<00:05:12.720> to<00:05:12.780> put<00:05:12.930> some<00:05:12.960> lights<00:05:13.260> in

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.030 

this<00:05:23.540> parts<00:05:23.810> a<00:05:23.870> little<00:05:23.900> time<00:05:24.200> consuming<00:05:24.380> you

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
this parts a little time consuming you

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.790 
this parts a little time consuming you
go<00:05:25.160> back<00:05:25.340> and<00:05:25.370> forth<00:05:25.730> between<00:05:26.530> putting<00:05:27.530> in

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
go back and forth between putting in

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.990 
go back and forth between putting in
your<00:05:28.070> collar<00:05:28.730> with<00:05:29.120> a<00:05:29.150> big<00:05:29.420> brush<00:05:29.720> and<00:05:30.140> then

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
your collar with a big brush and then

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.340 
your collar with a big brush and then
gently<00:05:34.480> smoothing<00:05:35.480> it<00:05:35.540> into<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:35.960> colors<00:05:36.230> you

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
gently smoothing it into the colors you

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.370 
gently smoothing it into the colors you
already<00:05:36.680> have<00:05:37.690> creating<00:05:38.690> a<00:05:38.750> richness<00:05:38.960> on<00:05:39.320> the

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
already have creating a richness on the

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.370 
already have creating a richness on the
surface<00:05:39.890> but<00:05:40.420> I<00:05:41.420> think<00:05:41.720> the<00:05:41.810> results<00:05:42.110> are<00:05:42.200> with

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
surface but I think the results are with

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.530 
surface but I think the results are with
it
