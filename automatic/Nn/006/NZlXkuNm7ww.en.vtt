00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.010 

yeah<00:00:02.280> I'm<00:00:02.610> going<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.030> cut<00:00:03.210> out<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.389> trumpet

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
yeah I'm going to cut out a trumpet

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.619 
yeah I'm going to cut out a trumpet
resonator<00:00:04.589> here<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:06.000> it's<00:00:06.210> going<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.509> be<00:00:06.600> a

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
resonator here and it's going to be a

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.049 
resonator here and it's going to be a
conical<00:00:08.269> piece<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.719> pipe<00:00:10.130> narrow<00:00:11.130> at<00:00:12.030> the

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
conical piece of pipe narrow at the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.420 
conical piece of pipe narrow at the
bottom<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.750> wide<00:00:12.990> at<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.290> top<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:15.980> yeah<00:00:16.980> in

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
bottom and wide at the top and yeah in

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.439 
bottom and wide at the top and yeah in
order<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.880> cut<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.600> out<00:00:19.670> exactly<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.699> need<00:00:21.150> to

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
order to cut it out exactly I need to

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.109 
order to cut it out exactly I need to
make<00:00:22.199> lines<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.890> piece<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.369> metal<00:00:23.699> first

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
make lines on a piece of metal first

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.240 
make lines on a piece of metal first
this<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.570> piece<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.960> metal<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.529> has<00:00:26.039> been

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
this is a piece of metal that has been

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.919 
this is a piece of metal that has been
prepared<00:00:26.960> hammered<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.340> painted<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:30.300> anyway

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
prepared hammered and painted and anyway

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:54.560 
prepared hammered and painted and anyway
I'm<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:36.920> write<00:00:48.200> mark<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.410> radius<00:00:53.570> and

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
I'm going to write mark the radius and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:05.590 
I'm going to write mark the radius and
then<00:00:54.690> mark<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.260> upper<00:00:56.960> PSICOM<00:00:57.960> forints

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:16.219 

and<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.140> length<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> pipe<00:01:08.479> from<00:01:09.479> here<00:01:15.229> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
and the length of the pipe from here and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:38.030 
and the length of the pipe from here and
then<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> lower<00:01:16.880> circumference

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.520 

now<00:01:39.040> I<00:01:39.070> need<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.149> put<00:01:40.509> all<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.840> lines<00:01:41.050> on<00:01:41.350> this

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
now I need to put all the lines on this

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.350 
now I need to put all the lines on this
piece<00:01:41.590> of<00:01:41.890> metal<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.369> now<00:01:42.490> I<00:01:42.520> can<00:01:42.790> cut<00:01:43.060> it<00:01:43.210> out

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
piece of metal and now I can cut it out

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.680 
piece of metal and now I can cut it out
with<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.840> shear<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.649> then<00:01:45.610> after<00:01:46.000> that<00:01:46.240> it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
with the shear and then after that it

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.350 
with the shear and then after that it
gets<00:01:47.190> formed<00:01:48.190> around<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.820> mandrel

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
gets formed around the mandrel

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.930 
gets formed around the mandrel
and<00:01:49.960> then<00:01:50.259> soldered<00:01:50.799> those<00:01:51.520> are<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.729> next

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
and then soldered those are the next

00:01:51.940 --> 00:02:36.119 
and then soldered those are the next
steps

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.720 

okay<00:02:37.129> now<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.549> is<00:02:37.609> the<00:02:39.430> circumference<00:02:40.430> off

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
okay now this is the circumference off

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.399 
okay now this is the circumference off
to<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:40.939> top<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.510> it's<00:02:41.629> a<00:02:41.689> conference<00:02:42.170> on<00:02:42.349> the

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
to the top and it's a conference on the

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:47.110 
to the top and it's a conference on the
bottom<00:02:42.829> and<00:02:43.280> now<00:02:44.859> we<00:02:45.859> need<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.129> bevel<00:02:46.579> these

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
bottom and now we need to bevel these

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.909 
bottom and now we need to bevel these
two<00:02:47.450> edges<00:02:48.069> in<00:02:49.069> order<00:02:49.159> to<00:02:49.310> be<00:02:50.150> able<00:02:50.239> to<00:02:50.389> solder

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:50.919 
two edges in order to be able to solder

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:55.539 
two edges in order to be able to solder
those<00:02:51.919> two<00:02:52.419> sides<00:02:53.419> together<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.430> roll<00:02:55.430> it

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
those two sides together and roll it

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:15.640 
those two sides together and roll it
around<00:02:55.639> the<00:02:55.879> mandrel<00:03:13.569> I'm<00:03:14.569> actually<00:03:14.840> scraping

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
around the mandrel I'm actually scraping

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.289 
around the mandrel I'm actually scraping
away<00:03:15.979> or<00:03:16.489> cutting<00:03:17.030> away<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:18.590> bevel<00:03:19.310> at<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.060> same

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
away or cutting away a bevel at the same

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.789 
away or cutting away a bevel at the same
time<00:03:21.760> taking<00:03:22.760> off<00:03:22.940> this<00:03:23.269> paint<00:03:23.690> for<00:03:24.109> the

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
time taking off this paint for the

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.830 
time taking off this paint for the
solder<00:03:25.069> seam<00:03:25.400> is<00:03:25.609> going<00:03:25.879> to<00:03:26.030> go<00:03:26.180> because<00:03:26.599> the

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
solder seam is going to go because the

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.830 
solder seam is going to go because the
paint<00:03:27.079> will<00:03:27.349> not<00:03:27.879> take<00:03:28.879> the<00:03:29.180> solder<00:03:31.840> next

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
paint will not take the solder next

00:03:32.840 --> 00:05:41.180 
paint will not take the solder next
thing<00:03:33.049> is<00:03:33.169> to<00:03:33.199> form

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.880 

all<00:05:42.190> sorta<00:05:42.610> together<00:05:42.970> now<00:05:43.240> and<00:05:43.450> now<00:05:43.600> the<00:05:44.140> pipe

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
all sorta together now and now the pipe

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.760 
all sorta together now and now the pipe
is<00:05:45.070> not<00:05:45.280> really<00:05:45.660> exactly<00:05:46.660> wrong<00:05:46.870> but<00:05:47.440> it<00:05:47.560> needs

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
is not really exactly wrong but it needs

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.420 
is not really exactly wrong but it needs
to<00:05:47.920> be<00:05:48.010> wrong<00:05:48.370> so<00:05:48.730> you<00:05:48.910> know<00:05:49.170> it<00:05:50.170> gets<00:05:50.410> put<00:05:51.280> on

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
to be wrong so you know it gets put on

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.510 
to be wrong so you know it gets put on
the<00:05:51.640> mandrel<00:05:52.120> again
