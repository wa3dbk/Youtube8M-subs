kapok and leather and force fear and all
sorts<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.520> things<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:44.910> what<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:45.960> did<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.350> to

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
sorts of things so what we did was to

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.310 
sorts of things so what we did was to
use<00:00:46.559> closed<00:00:47.550> cell<00:00:47.820> foam<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.750> base<00:00:48.930> product

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
use closed cell foam as the base product

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.139 
use closed cell foam as the base product
and<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.890> wasn't<00:00:50.250> unique<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.879> did<00:00:51.059> it

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
and this wasn't unique but we did it

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.639 
and this wasn't unique but we did it
better<00:00:51.390> than<00:00:51.600> anybody<00:00:51.989> else<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> world

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
better than anybody else in the world

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.430 
better than anybody else in the world
and<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.520> think<00:00:53.730> also<00:00:54.180> importantly<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.960> saw<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and I think also importantly we saw the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.740 
and I think also importantly we saw the
goalkeeper<00:00:56.100> as<00:00:56.280> an<00:00:56.489> outstanding<00:00:56.789> athlete<00:00:57.239> in

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
goalkeeper as an outstanding athlete in

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.389 
goalkeeper as an outstanding athlete in
business<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.410> can<00:00:58.530> either<00:00:58.649> go<00:00:58.890> wide<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
business you can either go wide and

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.639 
business you can either go wide and
shallow<00:00:59.579> or<00:00:59.969> narrow<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.140> deep<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.530> we

shallow or narrow and deep and we

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.160 
shallow or narrow and deep and we
certainly<00:01:01.980> go<00:01:02.129> narrow<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.640> D<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.110> exporting<00:01:04.110> to

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
certainly go narrow in D so exporting to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.980 
certainly go narrow in D so exporting to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
the to remember that innovation and
