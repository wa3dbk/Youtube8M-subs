00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
the next tab is the registry there's a

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.339 
the next tab is the registry there's a
simple<00:03:16.819> registry<00:03:17.180> cleaner<00:03:17.420> it's<00:03:17.989> perfectly

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
simple registry cleaner it's perfectly

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.170 
simple registry cleaner it's perfectly
fine<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.770> have<00:03:18.800> all<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.459> check<00:03:19.640> boxes<00:03:19.970> ticked

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.470 
fine to have all the check boxes ticked
here<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:21.230> if<00:03:21.319> I<00:03:21.410> scan<00:03:21.680> for<00:03:21.920> issues<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:26.150> begins

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
here so if I scan for issues and begins

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.930 
here so if I scan for issues and begins
the<00:03:26.599> process

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.510 

so<00:03:33.480> once<00:03:33.660> it's<00:03:33.840> finished<00:03:34.020> you<00:03:34.410> can<00:03:34.650> tell<00:03:35.370> that

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
so once it's finished you can tell that

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.300 
so once it's finished you can tell that

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
when it says 100% up here when it's

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.190 
when it says 100% up here when it's
finished<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:38.700> press<00:03:39.030> fix<00:03:39.600> selected<00:03:39.900> issues

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
finished you press fix selected issues

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.070 
finished you press fix selected issues

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
now it's wise to back up the changes to

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.600 
now it's wise to back up the changes to
the<00:03:43.170> registry<00:03:43.290> in<00:03:43.680> case<00:03:43.890> anything<00:03:44.220> does<00:03:44.370> go

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
the registry in case anything does go

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.950 
the registry in case anything does go
wrong<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.150> they're<00:03:45.270> likely<00:03:45.600> written<00:03:45.720> what

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
wrong and they're likely written what

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.040 
wrong and they're likely written what
happens<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.920> can<00:03:47.130> restore<00:03:47.820> it<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.780> what<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.020> is

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
happens you can restore it to what it is

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.160 
happens you can restore it to what it is
now<00:03:49.170> so<00:03:50.040> if<00:03:50.100> I<00:03:50.220> say<00:03:50.370> yes<00:03:50.550> button<00:03:50.990> call<00:03:51.990> it

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
now so if I say yes button call it
