uncoupling membrane and what this does

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.529 
uncoupling membrane and what this does
is<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:13.700> cement<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:15.470> with<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.940> stuff<00:00:17.940> pop

thinset I'm going to be using in this
case<00:00:30.470> 253<00:00:31.470> lat<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.219> Crete<00:00:32.630> gold<00:00:33.950> and<00:00:36.920> the

case 253 lat of Crete gold and the
traveler<00:00:38.460> using<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.530> this<00:00:40.530> one<00:00:40.590> here

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
traveler using is this one here

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.160 
traveler using is this one here
it's<00:00:43.950> 1164<00:00:45.739> by<00:00:46.739> lemon<00:00:47.070> 64<00:00:47.629> square<00:00:48.629> knot<00:00:48.840> strap

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
it's 1164 by lemon 64 square knot strap

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.119 
it's 1164 by lemon 64 square knot strap
and<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.449> actually<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> shrewd<00:00:51.960> etroesch<00:00:52.620> I

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.670 

would<00:00:56.129> recommend<00:00:57.079> so<00:00:58.160> membrane<00:00:59.270> and<00:01:00.559> when<00:01:01.559> you

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
would recommend so membrane and when you

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.399 
would recommend so membrane and when you
film<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.039> tile<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.699> membrane<00:01:03.140> use<00:01:04.140> an

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
film a tile on this membrane use an

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.539 
film a tile on this membrane use an
unmodified<00:01:05.129> thinset<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:07.590> reason<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.430> do

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
unmodified thinset and the reason you do

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.109 
unmodified thinset and the reason you do
that<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.760> because<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.350> tile<00:01:11.000> when<00:01:12.000> it's

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
that is because the tile when it's

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.789 
that is because the tile when it's
installed<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.689> doesn't<00:01:13.049> actually<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
installed on this doesn't actually the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.460 
installed on this doesn't actually the
things<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.130> doesn't<00:01:14.280> actually<00:01:14.930> adhere<00:01:15.930> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
things that doesn't actually adhere to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.260 
things that doesn't actually adhere to
this<00:01:16.590> plastic<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.820> gets<00:01:18.060> locked<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.200> these

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
this plastic it gets locked in to these

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.670 
this plastic it gets locked in to these
waffles<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.479> which<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.960> might<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:22.650> a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
waffles here which I might have like a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.899 
waffles here which I might have like a
dovetail<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:27.950> don't<00:01:28.950> really<00:01:29.070> see<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.579> it's

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
dovetail I don't really see it but it's

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.710 
dovetail I don't really see it but it's
like<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.390> dovetail<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:31.710> here<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.240> what<00:01:33.390> happens

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
like a dovetail in here so what happens

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.690 
like a dovetail in here so what happens
is<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.229> dents<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:36.049> cures<00:01:37.460> it<00:01:38.460> gets

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
is one that dents that cures it gets

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.370 
is one that dents that cures it gets
locked<00:01:39.060> into<00:01:39.329> these<00:01:39.509> walls<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.380> because

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
locked into these walls and because

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:50.090 
locked into these walls and because
there's<00:01:44.000> these<00:01:45.000> ridges<00:01:47.299> behind<00:01:48.299> here<00:01:49.100> what

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
there's these ridges behind here what

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.880 
there's these ridges behind here what
that<00:01:50.280> done<00:01:51.180> couples<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.110> floor<00:01:52.790> from<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
that done couples the floor from the

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.859 
that done couples the floor from the
tile<00:01:55.890> floor<00:01:56.219> from<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:58.439> subfloor<00:01:59.570> so<00:02:00.570> if

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
tile floor from the subfloor so if

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.859 
tile floor from the subfloor so if
there's<00:02:01.049> any<00:02:01.200> movement<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.759> plywood<00:02:03.450> or

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
there's any movement in the plywood or

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.260 
there's any movement in the plywood or
whatever<00:02:04.140> lateral<00:02:04.770> movement<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.610> will<00:02:06.090> not

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
whatever lateral movement and will not

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.969 
whatever lateral movement and will not
transfer

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
transfer

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:17.660 
transfer
the<00:02:08.979> Detra<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.899> time<00:02:11.110> because<00:02:12.099> these<00:02:15.420> boys

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
the Detra to the time because these boys

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.180 
the Detra to the time because these boys
the<00:02:18.670> Dietrich<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.180> deform<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:20.190> luck

transfer the tile I mean the movement to

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.789 
transfer the tile I mean the movement to
the<00:02:25.060> that's<00:02:25.989> how<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.230> works

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
the that's how that works

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.699 
the that's how that works
there's<00:02:27.519> a<00:02:27.610> very<00:02:27.819> good<00:02:28.000> system<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.599> I've<00:02:29.470> used

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
there's a very good system and I've used

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.020 
there's a very good system and I've used
it<00:02:29.860> for<00:02:30.010> years<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.400> years<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.580> years<00:02:30.910> and

it for years and years and years and

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.030 
it for years and years and years and
I've<00:02:31.360> never<00:02:31.569> had<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.840> problem<00:02:32.110> with<00:02:32.319> it<00:02:32.379> just

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
I've never had a problem with it just

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.830 
I've never had a problem with it just
want<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.310> make<00:02:33.430> sure<00:02:33.459> when<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.450> put<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:34.780> down

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
want to make sure when you put this down

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.570 
want to make sure when you put this down
they<00:02:35.769> use<00:02:36.099> a<00:02:36.129> good<00:02:36.459> quality<00:02:37.170> polymer<00:02:38.170> modified

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
they use a good quality polymer modified

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.890 
they use a good quality polymer modified
thinset<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:40.660> adhere<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.799> D<00:02:42.010> trust<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:43.480> the

thinset to adhere the D trust to the
subfloor<00:02:44.370> these<00:02:45.370> comes<00:02:45.610> in<00:02:45.819> this<00:02:46.750> was<00:02:47.290> left

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
subfloor these comes in this was left

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.020 
subfloor these comes in this was left
over<00:02:48.069> from<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.400> 150<00:02:48.940> foot<00:02:49.060> rolls<00:02:49.329> they<00:02:50.049> come<00:02:50.230> in
