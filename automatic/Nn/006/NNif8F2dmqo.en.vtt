this phantom 2 from DJI now he's having

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.810 
this phantom 2 from DJI now he's having
quite<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.929> difficult<00:00:13.500> time<00:00:13.740> trying<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.639> fly

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
quite the difficult time trying to fly

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.490 
quite the difficult time trying to fly
this<00:00:14.880> thing<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.540> actually<00:00:16.020> he's<00:00:16.199> already

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
this thing and actually he's already

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.609 
this thing and actually he's already
crashed<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.340> twice<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.150> had<00:00:18.930> several<00:00:19.380> close

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
crashed it twice and had several close

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:43.689 
crashed it twice and had several close
calls

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.850 

shit<00:00:44.750> mike<00:00:45.750> says<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.230> pretty<00:00:46.500> stressful

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
shit mike says this is pretty stressful

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.270 
shit mike says this is pretty stressful
to<00:00:47.129> fly<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.699> one<00:00:47.960> because<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.410> phantom<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
to fly for one because the phantom to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.100 
to fly for one because the phantom to
itself<00:00:50.640> costs<00:00:51.000> about<00:00:51.150> nine<00:00:51.449> hundred<00:00:51.480> dollars

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
itself costs about nine hundred dollars

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.090 
itself costs about nine hundred dollars
with<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.980> gimbal<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.610> then<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.839> GoPro<00:00:55.470> hero3

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
with the gimbal and then the GoPro hero3

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.920 
with the gimbal and then the GoPro hero3
black<00:00:56.400> costs<00:00:57.120> about<00:00:57.300> four<00:00:57.629> hundred<00:00:57.750> dollars

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
black costs about four hundred dollars

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.660 
black costs about four hundred dollars
so<00:00:58.650> we're<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.070> thing<00:00:59.129> for<00:00:59.370> about

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
so we're in this thing for about

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.060 
so we're in this thing for about
thirteen<00:01:00.059> hundred<00:01:00.239> bucks<00:01:00.449> mike<00:01:01.290> says<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
thirteen hundred bucks mike says the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.249 
thirteen hundred bucks mike says the
reason<00:01:02.309> he<00:01:03.089> thinks<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.510> has<00:01:03.690> crashed<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
reason he thinks this has crashed a

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:05.570 
reason he thinks this has crashed a
couple<00:01:04.559> times<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.920> had<00:01:05.009> so<00:01:05.190> many<00:01:05.280> close<00:01:05.550> calls

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
couple times it had so many close calls

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.600 
couple times it had so many close calls
is<00:01:06.149> because<00:01:06.509> it<00:01:06.810> seems<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.289> have<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.890> mind<00:01:07.920> of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
is because it seems to have a mind of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.480 
is because it seems to have a mind of
its<00:01:08.759> own<00:01:08.910> now<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.840> think<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.890> because<00:01:11.250> he

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
its own now I think that it's because he

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.700 
its own now I think that it's because he
doesn't<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.030> take<00:01:12.179> the<00:01:12.390> time<00:01:12.500> to<00:01:13.500> read

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
doesn't like to take the time to read

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.359 
doesn't like to take the time to read
the<00:01:13.740> directions<00:01:14.300> like<00:01:15.300> everything<00:01:15.750> else<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
the directions like everything else and

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.190 
the directions like everything else and
hasn't<00:01:17.369> really<00:01:17.580> learned<00:01:17.880> how<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> fly<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.810> yet

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
hasn't really learned how to fly it yet

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.440 
hasn't really learned how to fly it yet
but<00:01:19.950> I've<00:01:20.190> read<00:01:20.399> the<00:01:20.460> directions<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.270> I've

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
but I've read the directions and I've

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.880 
but I've read the directions and I've
learned<00:01:21.660> all<00:01:21.899> about<00:01:21.929> it<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.440> I<00:01:22.500> came<00:01:22.590> out<00:01:22.860> here

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
learned all about it so I came out here

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.090 
learned all about it so I came out here
today<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.610> see<00:01:23.789> how<00:01:24.000> easy<00:01:24.420> or<00:01:24.990> not<00:01:25.619> that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
today to just see how easy or not that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.639 
today to just see how easy or not that
it<00:01:26.190> really<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.990> first<00:01:28.229> thing<00:01:28.410> I'm<00:01:28.530> going

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
it really is the first thing I'm going

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.999 
it really is the first thing I'm going
to<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.190> calibrate<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:30.710> because<00:01:31.710> I've

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
to do is calibrate this because I've

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.249 
to do is calibrate this because I've
read<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> most<00:01:33.659> important<00:01:34.140> thing

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
read that it is the most important thing

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.990 
read that it is the most important thing
to<00:01:34.409> do<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.679> I<00:01:34.740> kind<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.190> think<00:01:35.429> that<00:01:35.789> maybe

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
to do and I kind of think that maybe

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.449 
to do and I kind of think that maybe
might<00:01:36.300> skip<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.990> step<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:38.009> could<00:01:38.340> be

00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:38.459 
might skip that step and that could be

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.460 
might skip that step and that could be
the<00:01:38.610> whole<00:01:38.759> problem<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.390> why<00:01:39.539> he's<00:01:39.810> crashed<00:01:40.140> so

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the whole problem of why he's crashed so

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.419 
the whole problem of why he's crashed so
many<00:01:40.679> times<00:01:41.509> so<00:01:42.509> calibrating<00:01:43.259> these<00:01:43.440> is<00:01:43.679> very

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
many times so calibrating these is very

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.639 
many times so calibrating these is very
very<00:01:44.700> important<00:01:45.330> because<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:46.080> can<00:01:46.259> actually

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
very important because it can actually

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.010 
very important because it can actually
fly<00:01:46.890> away<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.700> other<00:01:48.179> words<00:01:48.420> you're

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
fly away on you in other words you're

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.389 
fly away on you in other words you're
flying<00:01:49.349> it<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.800> think<00:01:50.039> you're<00:01:50.160> doing<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
flying it you think you're doing the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.100 
flying it you think you're doing the
little<00:01:50.520> controls<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.270> all<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.539> a<00:01:51.630> sudden<00:01:51.660> it

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
little controls and all of a sudden it

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.779 
little controls and all of a sudden it
just<00:01:52.319> takes<00:01:52.560> off<00:01:52.739> it<00:01:52.920> never<00:01:53.069> comes<00:01:53.280> back<00:01:53.399> and

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
just takes off it never comes back and

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.839 
just takes off it never comes back and
there<00:01:54.270> goes<00:01:54.450> your<00:01:54.569> thirteen<00:01:54.869> hundred<00:01:55.050> dollars

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
there goes your thirteen hundred dollars

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.490 
there goes your thirteen hundred dollars
to<00:01:56.849> calibrate<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.539> we<00:01:57.780> first<00:01:58.020> want<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.349> turn

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
to calibrate this we first want to turn

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.249 
to calibrate this we first want to turn
on<00:01:58.679> the<00:01:58.860> controller<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.670> then<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.599> unit<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
on the controller and then the unit and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.740 
on the controller and then the unit and
let<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.890> go<00:02:02.099> through<00:02:02.369> its<00:02:02.520> systems<00:02:02.940> check

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.900 

then<00:02:08.750> we're<00:02:08.959> going<00:02:09.140> to<00:02:09.259> move<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.890> s-1<00:02:10.580> switch

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
then we're going to move the s-1 switch

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.650 
then we're going to move the s-1 switch
back<00:02:11.269> and<00:02:11.300> forth<00:02:11.510> five<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.200> six<00:02:12.440> times<00:02:15.250> at<00:02:16.660> this

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
back and forth five to six times at this

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.920 
back and forth five to six times at this
point<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.140> back<00:02:18.349> two<00:02:18.650> lights<00:02:18.950> are<00:02:19.220> yellow

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
point the back two lights are yellow

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.240 
point the back two lights are yellow
holding<00:02:20.930> this<00:02:21.050> where<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.380> nose<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:21.860> pointed

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
holding this where the nose is pointed

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.160 
holding this where the nose is pointed
forward<00:02:22.489> we're<00:02:23.269> going<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.480> rotate<00:02:23.660> this

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
forward we're going to rotate this

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.420 
forward we're going to rotate this
counterclockwise<00:02:25.599> one<00:02:26.599> full<00:02:27.319> turn<00:02:30.040> okay<00:02:31.040> the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
counterclockwise one full turn okay the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.009 
counterclockwise one full turn okay the
back<00:02:31.610> two<00:02:31.819> lights<00:02:32.060> are<00:02:32.209> now<00:02:32.330> solid<00:02:32.840> green

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
back two lights are now solid green

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.199 
back two lights are now solid green
point<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.069> nose<00:02:34.269> straight<00:02:35.269> down<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:37.209> turn

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
point the nose straight down and turn

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:46.059 
point the nose straight down and turn
this<00:02:38.450> again<00:02:38.900> counterclockwise<00:02:44.799> and<00:02:45.799> now

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
this again counterclockwise and now

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.440 
this again counterclockwise and now
they're<00:02:46.280> going<00:02:46.489> yellow<00:02:46.849> and<00:02:47.329> they're

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
they're going yellow and they're

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.350 
they're going yellow and they're
blinking<00:02:47.630> green<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.910> it's<00:02:49.910> going<00:02:50.239> through

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
blinking green and it's going through

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.030 
blinking green and it's going through
its<00:02:50.540> final<00:02:51.200> system<00:02:51.590> of<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.769> calibration<00:02:52.370> and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
its final system of the calibration and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.190 
its final system of the calibration and
now<00:02:55.040> they<00:02:55.280> are<00:02:55.310> slowly<00:02:55.760> flashing<00:02:56.569> green<00:02:56.690> so

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
now they are slowly flashing green so

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.199 
now they are slowly flashing green so
that's<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.040> fully<00:02:58.310> calibrated<00:02:58.610> and

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
that's it it is fully calibrated and

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.069 
that's it it is fully calibrated and
ready<00:02:59.269> to<00:02:59.989> go<00:03:01.450> all<00:03:02.450> right<00:03:02.480> let's<00:03:02.630> turn<00:03:02.930> this

ready to go all right let's turn this

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.440 
ready to go all right let's turn this
thing<00:03:03.140> on<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:03.470> give<00:03:03.709> it<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:03.860> try

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:54.010 

Wow

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.050 

this<00:05:55.020> is<00:05:55.199> really<00:05:55.500> fun<00:05:55.860> to<00:05:56.009> fly<00:05:56.220> for<00:05:56.280> sure<00:05:56.759> and

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
this is really fun to fly for sure and

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.640 
this is really fun to fly for sure and
it's<00:05:57.240> going<00:05:57.389> to<00:05:57.479> make<00:05:57.629> for<00:05:57.689> some<00:05:57.990> really<00:05:58.500> good

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
it's going to make for some really good

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.830 
it's going to make for some really good
videos<00:05:59.039> you<00:05:59.669> can't<00:05:59.939> make<00:06:00.120> a<00:06:00.180> lot<00:06:00.479> of<00:06:00.509> moves

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
videos you can't make a lot of moves

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.510 
videos you can't make a lot of moves
suddenly<00:06:01.349> and<00:06:01.530> quickly<00:06:01.860> you<00:06:01.979> really<00:06:02.250> have<00:06:02.400> to

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
suddenly and quickly you really have to

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.740 
suddenly and quickly you really have to
think<00:06:02.639> about<00:06:02.909> which<00:06:03.060> way<00:06:03.240> you<00:06:03.300> want<00:06:03.599> it<00:06:03.629> to

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
think about which way you want it to

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.600 
think about which way you want it to
turn<00:06:03.900> first<00:06:04.229> and<00:06:04.530> I<00:06:04.860> think<00:06:04.949> with<00:06:05.280> more

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
turn first and I think with more

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.159 
turn first and I think with more
practice<00:06:05.909> we're<00:06:06.479> going<00:06:06.629> to<00:06:06.689> get<00:06:06.810> way<00:06:06.960> better

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
practice we're going to get way better

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.040 
practice we're going to get way better
at<00:06:07.379> this<00:06:07.560> and<00:06:07.860> Mike<00:06:08.490> will<00:06:08.729> too<00:06:08.969> and<00:06:09.210> I<00:06:09.659> can<00:06:09.870> tell

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
at this and Mike will too and I can tell

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.439 
at this and Mike will too and I can tell
you<00:06:10.110> that<00:06:10.379> today<00:06:10.500> the<00:06:11.159> wind<00:06:11.430> is<00:06:11.699> blowing<00:06:11.729> which

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
you that today the wind is blowing which

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.779 
you that today the wind is blowing which
is<00:06:12.599> a<00:06:12.629> huge<00:06:13.169> factor<00:06:13.560> in<00:06:13.800> it<00:06:14.069> the<00:06:14.280> wind<00:06:14.520> does

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
is a huge factor in it the wind does

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:17.360 
is a huge factor in it the wind does
push<00:06:15.120> this<00:06:15.300> very<00:06:15.569> easy<00:06:15.930> so<00:06:16.590> I'm<00:06:16.770> sure<00:06:17.069> when<00:06:17.280> we

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
push this very easy so I'm sure when we

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.070 
push this very easy so I'm sure when we
go<00:06:17.520> out<00:06:17.669> video<00:06:18.060> and<00:06:18.449> make<00:06:18.569> sure<00:06:18.599> that<00:06:18.750> it's<00:06:18.990> not

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
go out video and make sure that it's not

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.159 
go out video and make sure that it's not
going<00:06:19.229> to<00:06:19.319> be<00:06:19.409> a<00:06:19.439> windy<00:06:19.770> day<00:06:20.509> mike<00:06:21.509> has<00:06:21.750> flown

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
going to be a windy day mike has flown

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.379 
going to be a windy day mike has flown
this<00:06:22.409> a<00:06:22.650> lot<00:06:22.979> more<00:06:23.009> than<00:06:23.310> me<00:06:23.580> and<00:06:23.819> crash<00:06:24.180> this

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:24.389 
this a lot more than me and crash this

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.119 
this a lot more than me and crash this
couple<00:06:24.750> times<00:06:24.960> so<00:06:25.560> he's<00:06:25.740> made<00:06:25.949> some

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:26.129 
couple times so he's made some

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:28.820 
couple times so he's made some
modifications<00:06:26.509> for<00:06:27.509> one<00:06:27.750> he<00:06:28.319> bought<00:06:28.560> these

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
modifications for one he bought these

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.529 
modifications for one he bought these
propeller<00:06:29.340> guards<00:06:29.789> which<00:06:29.969> you<00:06:30.120> can<00:06:30.270> get<00:06:30.419> for

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
propeller guards which you can get for

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:32.450 
propeller guards which you can get for
about<00:06:30.690> fifteen<00:06:31.020> or<00:06:31.050> twenty<00:06:31.379> dollars<00:06:31.710> and<00:06:31.919> he

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
about fifteen or twenty dollars and he

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.749 
about fifteen or twenty dollars and he
also<00:06:32.669> painted<00:06:33.270> the<00:06:33.659> two<00:06:33.900> forward<00:06:34.650> ones<00:06:34.919> hot

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 
also painted the two forward ones hot

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.200 
also painted the two forward ones hot
pink<00:06:36.469> reason<00:06:37.469> is<00:06:37.710> when<00:06:38.310> you<00:06:38.460> get<00:06:38.639> it<00:06:38.759> up<00:06:38.909> in<00:06:39.060> the

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
pink reason is when you get it up in the

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.029 
pink reason is when you get it up in the
air<00:06:39.240> and<00:06:39.690> it's<00:06:40.199> turned<00:06:40.440> around<00:06:40.560> a<00:06:40.830> few<00:06:40.979> times

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 
air and it's turned around a few times

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:43.070 
air and it's turned around a few times
you<00:06:41.490> really<00:06:41.969> don't<00:06:42.150> know<00:06:42.270> which<00:06:42.449> ways<00:06:42.659> forward

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
you really don't know which ways forward

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.649 
you really don't know which ways forward
so<00:06:43.409> it's<00:06:43.560> pretty<00:06:43.800> easy<00:06:44.129> to<00:06:44.430> see<00:06:45.000> the<00:06:45.270> hot<00:06:45.419> pink

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:45.659 
so it's pretty easy to see the hot pink

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:47.180 
so it's pretty easy to see the hot pink
words<00:06:45.960> which<00:06:46.199> ways<00:06:46.409> front<00:06:46.740> and<00:06:46.830> which<00:06:46.919> ones

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
words which ways front and which ones

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.820 
words which ways front and which ones
back<00:06:47.539> the<00:06:48.539> other<00:06:48.569> modification<00:06:49.379> that<00:06:49.500> we<00:06:49.620> did

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
back the other modification that we did

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.850 
back the other modification that we did
is<00:06:50.190> this<00:06:50.969> gimbal<00:06:51.360> comes<00:06:51.840> with<00:06:51.960> a<00:06:52.050> bracket<00:06:52.620> that

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
is this gimbal comes with a bracket that

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.429 
is this gimbal comes with a bracket that
holds<00:06:52.919> the<00:06:53.580> GoPro<00:06:53.969> in<00:06:54.120> place<00:06:54.389> by<00:06:54.810> two<00:06:54.870> screws

00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:55.439 
holds the GoPro in place by two screws

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:58.010 
holds the GoPro in place by two screws
so<00:06:56.370> since<00:06:56.610> we<00:06:56.729> use<00:06:56.939> the<00:06:57.090> GoPro<00:06:57.479> a<00:06:57.509> lot<00:06:57.779> for

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
so since we use the GoPro a lot for

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.379 
so since we use the GoPro a lot for
other<00:06:58.199> things<00:06:58.560> it's<00:06:58.979> a<00:06:59.400> constant<00:06:59.879> pain<00:07:00.090> to

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:00.389 
other things it's a constant pain to

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:02.119 
other things it's a constant pain to
have<00:07:00.419> to<00:07:00.599> unscrew<00:07:01.139> this<00:07:01.289> and<00:07:01.529> screw<00:07:01.650> it<00:07:01.770> every

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:02.129 
have to unscrew this and screw it every

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:04.459 
have to unscrew this and screw it every
single<00:07:02.310> time<00:07:02.460> so<00:07:03.210> instead<00:07:03.870> we<00:07:04.139> took<00:07:04.319> the

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:04.469 
single time so instead we took the
