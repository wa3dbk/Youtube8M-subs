00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
right beside it but I want to just

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.780 
right beside it but I want to just
because<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:52.500> perfect<00:01:52.920> like<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> perfect

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
because it's perfect like it's a perfect

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.179 
because it's perfect like it's a perfect
target<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.299> enemy<00:01:54.450> artillery<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.040> place

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
target for enemy artillery so just place

target for enemy artillery so just place
it's<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.060> right<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.930> then<00:01:58.170> what<00:01:58.500> you

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it's like that right and then what you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.020 
it's like that right and then what you
do<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.040> never<00:01:59.159> get<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.460> bottom<00:01:59.850> and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
do is you never get on the bottom and

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.789 
do is you never get on the bottom and
here<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.659> shows<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.869> what<00:02:01.110> soldiers<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.649> have

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
here it shows you what soldiers you have

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.060 
here it shows you what soldiers you have
and<00:02:02.240> you<00:02:03.240> get<00:02:03.509> out<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.680> need<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.860> get<00:02:04.979> out

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
and you get out the you need to get out

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.130 
and you get out the you need to get out
the<00:02:05.159> driver<00:02:05.430> or<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.689> guy<00:02:06.840> here<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the driver or the this guy here the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.690 
the driver or the this guy here the
commander<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.500> think<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.770> is

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
commander I think that is

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.729 
commander I think that is
what<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.420> do<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.780> what<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.110> do<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.410> usually<00:02:10.530> get

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
what I do is what I do is I usually get

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.350 
what I do is what I do is I usually get
to<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.890> commander<00:02:11.280> because<00:02:11.580> if<00:02:11.940> my<00:02:12.120> truck

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
to the commander because if my truck

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.720 
to the commander because if my truck
needs<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.660> flee<00:02:12.870> then<00:02:13.319> I<00:02:13.620> can<00:02:13.860> do<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.519> clearly

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
needs to flee then I can do it clearly

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.210 
needs to flee then I can do it clearly
so<00:02:15.660> get<00:02:15.840> them<00:02:15.959> out<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.170> then<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.319> press<00:02:16.530> X<00:02:16.739> or

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
round the the armament they like unit

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.080 
round the the armament they like unit
you<00:02:39.959> want<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.230> brief<00:02:40.470> resupply<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.700> need<00:02:42.030> to

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
know what kind of round it uses so the

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.870 
know what kind of round it uses so the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
pak40 it actually uses I think the 75

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.059 
pak40 it actually uses I think the 75
millimeters<00:02:48.299> let<00:02:48.420> me<00:02:48.480> check<00:02:48.630> yeah<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.799> uses

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
millimeters let me check yeah it uses

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.819 
millimeters let me check yeah it uses
the<00:02:50.160> 75<00:02:50.610> 75<00:02:51.090> millimeter<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:52.140> what<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.380> do<00:02:52.530> is

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829

press<00:02:53.340> X<00:02:53.579> like<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.329> said<00:02:54.569> like<00:02:55.140> so<00:02:55.500> left<00:02:55.650> click

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
press X like I said like so left click
