00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:15.820
 Hello everyone , Cheerfully, the world is playing 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:20.779
 game galaxy on fire 2 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:25.449
 this space fly is very global 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:35.109
 very beautiful with great graphics 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:38.420
 but everything is cool we will load my progress 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:41.299
 here is my boat standard 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.799
 until new did not buy I am now 

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:48.829
 at union station technical level 

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:51.459
 station 5 then here is more advanced 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.369
 weapons can then be bought in the hangar 

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:58.819
 here we see what cannons there are 

00:00:55.369 --> 00:01:03.309
 frantic prices all here you can rackets 

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:08.810
 buy let's buy something else 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:13.000
 on the ship we will ship on assignment I must 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:16.850
 I was kuplyat electromagnetic bomb 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.969
 Here they are now immersed in the same way 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.869
 the most you can unload them here and 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:26.030
 immerse here rockets on assignments so by 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.340
 the job also bought a new gun 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.039
 some kind of electromagnetic too 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.869
 this is our equipment is presented by the 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:37.399
 gives extra armor 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.170
 mining asteroid resources here 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.880
 I have n't found any drawings yet 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.399
 drawings here you can go here hall 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.770
 expectations at each station, I understand 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.770
 they are a little different here too 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.840
 talking to people aliens not 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.569
 here all sorts of earthlings receive from them 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.759
 additional tasks but we will go 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:06.469
 on our quest our kvass is in 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:09.670
 to this system by the way about systems this one 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.670
 huge map 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.750
 see how big she is these lines 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.500
 this is it is possible to move on them 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:24.100
 With the help of a retro translator such a chip 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.280
 type stargate to speed here 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.140
 each station 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.250
 that is, each stage of the galaxy type is 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.959
 small sector a few planets 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:42.600
 so we need to move on mission 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:42.600
 Now we go here is our sector 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:53.890
 so we are at this station need 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:57.910
 just fly a target somewhere near mean 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.160
 we just take off from this station will see 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.720
 somewhere near should be our goal here 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.480
 exactly the gameplay of living space and a bunch 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.150
 the ship flies constantly a bunch of some 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:15.360
 management is going on 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.980
 performed here by joysticks so 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.130
 marker level I will tell on what 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.130
 ship 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.880
 arch portable run bombs out 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.870
 touch and I understood why we need 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:40.000
 were these bombs we needed for 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.810
 order to choose these glasses for you 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.730
 to cut down 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:50.320
 enemy ship and in short do not damage 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.710
 its so that there our good dude 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:58.180
 some sitting like that 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:05.270
 four kilometers this arrow is 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:14.300
 autopilot and he himself leads us 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:14.920
 accelerate a little bit here they we fly 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.900
 we fly 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:22.780
 You can look around so cool in general 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:26.500
 how I like this beauty so much 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.500
 pair off autopilot 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.160
 the end tells me here they are 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.840
 near here 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.840
 okay okay target pickup 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:52.930
 rushed like our electromagnetic bomb 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.930
 now we can shoot freely at them 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:01.580
 turn here it is here it is a pancake and 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.920
 Look I don't know how to slow down 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.450
 You can be with you like this in 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.450
 dodge enemy shells 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:20.419
 and here they are together on us twig ambush 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.360
 guns here answer here they have a protective field 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.360
 what is standing on ships steeper 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.460
 I have not come across such 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:34.160
 the battle takes place long enough since 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:37.360
 still here while aiming 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.830
 you will enter the enemy ship 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.370
 this one can not breathe i'm not yet 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:49.610
 used to managing it all enough 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:53.080
 difficult especially not together on me 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.080
 now the pond and 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:02.610
 like exactly the game on the schedule and 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:12.009
 atmosphere that is cosmic 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:14.999
 the atmosphere is very interesting as it were 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:19.300
 everything blew me down just the graphics 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:24.699
 spectacular explosions and all sorts of shooting this 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:27.249
 the atmosphere of the cosmos is very beautiful 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:31.469
 that guys there are several companies and 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:34.629
 if here we allow to come into options here 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:39.819
 then let us put in a new rub, here are three 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:43.860
 companies, other companies are paid there 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:47.259
 I think you need to download them separately 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:53.279
 somewhere here here yes here additions here 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:53.279
 they are looking for represented companies like this 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.180
 interesting tasks will be 

00:06:55.659 --> 00:07:01.599
 theta besides the fact that the toys are still 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.999
 there are additional tasks that 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:08.409
 that you can sit here endlessly very 

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:10.270
 interesting to explore all the same square 

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:14.620
 this is tixie galaxies 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:18.099
 with your characters interesting on 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:20.620
 general who liked to download here and 

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:23.229
 you have been padre the world subscribe to 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.860
 channel on public vkontakte everything just
