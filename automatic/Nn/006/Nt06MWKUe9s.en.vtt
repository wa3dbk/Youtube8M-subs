00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
server and they go at it in a hardcore

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.569 
server and they go at it in a hardcore
kind<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.630> team<00:00:30.630> deathmatch<00:00:31.320> although<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.189> do

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
kind of team deathmatch although you do

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.220 
kind of team deathmatch although you do
have<00:00:32.669> three<00:00:33.000> lives<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:33.570> not<00:00:33.690> totally

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
have three lives so it's not totally

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.720 
have three lives so it's not totally
hardcore<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:35.059> you<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.239> your<00:00:36.390> bow<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.050> you

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
hardcore but you have your bow and you

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.130 
hardcore but you have your bow and you
hold<00:00:38.730> down<00:00:38.879> right<00:00:39.180> click<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.870> starts

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
hold down right click and it starts

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.350 
hold down right click and it starts
shooting<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> machine<00:00:41.250> gun<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:42.210> goes

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
shooting like a machine gun it goes

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.090 
shooting like a machine gun it goes
really<00:00:42.540> fast<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.649> bullets<00:00:43.920> go

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
really fast and the bullets go

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.610 
really fast and the bullets go
completely<00:00:44.520> straight<00:00:45.149> as<00:00:45.390> well<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.530> can

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
completely straight as well as you can

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.680 
completely straight as well as you can
see<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.309> does<00:00:47.520> quite<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.360> bit<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.660> damage

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
see here it does quite a bit of damage

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.670 
see here it does quite a bit of damage
also<00:00:49.489> per<00:00:50.489> bullet<00:00:50.730> I'm<00:00:51.149> not<00:00:51.329> really<00:00:51.480> sure<00:00:51.680> how

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
also per bullet I'm not really sure how

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.709 
also per bullet I'm not really sure how
much<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.219> one<00:00:53.430> bullet<00:00:53.670> does<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.480> seems

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
much like one bullet does but it seems

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.569 
much like one bullet does but it seems
to<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:54.960> quite<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.260> bit<00:00:55.379> actually<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
to do quite a bit actually and the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.299 
to do quite a bit actually and the
bullets<00:00:56.850> give<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.300> knock<00:00:57.539> back<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.309> only

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
bullets give you knock back the only

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.729 
bullets give you knock back the only
definite<00:00:59.879> way<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.359> found<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.079> actually<00:01:01.410> turn

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
definite way I found to actually turn

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.000 
definite way I found to actually turn
your<00:01:02.370> bow<00:01:02.760> off<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.870> actually<00:01:04.049> scroll<00:01:04.530> off<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
your bow off it's actually scroll off of

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.880 
your bow off it's actually scroll off of
it<00:01:05.159> there's<00:01:06.150> really<00:01:06.510> no<00:01:06.840> control<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.560> turn<00:01:07.710> it

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
it there's really no control to turn it

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.929 
it there's really no control to turn it
off<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.520> now<00:01:08.840> so<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.439> little<00:01:10.470> buggy<00:01:10.939> but

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
off as of now so it's a little buggy but

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.859 
off as of now so it's a little buggy but
something<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.110> note<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.390> bullets<00:01:15.390> do

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
something to note is that bullets do

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.810 
something to note is that bullets do
different<00:01:16.320> damages<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.890> likes<00:01:17.159> torso<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
different damages on likes torso and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.700 
different damages on likes torso and
head<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.299> all<00:01:18.570> from<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.049> red<00:01:19.229> stoners

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
head this is all from the red stoners

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.490 
head this is all from the red stoners
live<00:01:20.670> stream<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.210> he<00:01:21.360> had<00:01:21.540> when<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.020> played

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
live stream that he had when we played

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.480 
live stream that he had when we played
this<00:01:22.710> game<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:24.290> like<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.470> said<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:26.100> only<00:01:26.280> way

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
this game and like I said the only way

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.149 
this game and like I said the only way
to<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:26.850> make<00:01:27.840> your<00:01:27.990> gun<00:01:28.200> stop<00:01:28.619> shooting<00:01:29.040> is

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
to really make your gun stop shooting is

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.310 
to really make your gun stop shooting is
to<00:01:29.280> scroll<00:01:29.549> off<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.200> have

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
to scroll off of it and you do have

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.039 
to scroll off of it and you do have
three<00:01:31.740> life's<00:01:31.950> total<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:33.299> when<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.750> throw

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
three life's total so at when you throw

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.230 
three life's total so at when you throw
an<00:01:34.229> ender<00:01:34.560> pearl<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.220> basically<00:01:35.729> just<00:01:35.880> says

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
an ender pearl it basically just says

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.330 
an ender pearl it basically just says
you<00:01:36.479> can't<00:01:36.810> teleport<00:01:37.470> here<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:39.860> I'm<00:01:40.860> assuming

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
you can't teleport here and I'm assuming

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.980 
you can't teleport here and I'm assuming
that<00:01:41.790> they're<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.210> implement<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.869> as

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
that they're going to implement it as

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.350 
that they're going to implement it as
grenades<00:01:43.409> considering<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> get<00:01:44.280> three<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
grenades considering you get three and

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.080 
grenades considering you get three and
you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.630> kind<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.960> thrown<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.189> grenade<00:01:47.579> like

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
you can kind of thrown in a grenade like

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.929 
you can kind of thrown in a grenade like
way<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.740> definitely<00:01:50.009> kill<00:01:50.549> people

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
way but you can definitely kill people

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.330 
way but you can definitely kill people
from<00:01:51.119> pretty<00:01:51.390> far<00:01:51.479> away<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.110> game<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
from pretty far away in this game and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.490 
from pretty far away in this game and

and now i have what looks like in a
k<00:02:11.730> 47<00:02:12.630> type<00:02:12.900> gun<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.970> bullets<00:02:15.390> which<00:02:15.750> are

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
k 47 type gun and the bullets which are

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.309 
k 47 type gun and the bullets which are
arrows<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:16.950> course<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.819> it<00:02:18.480> even<00:02:18.510> has<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:19.080> a

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
arrows of course and it even has in a

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.380 
arrows of course and it even has in a
little<00:02:19.709> animation<00:02:20.280> when<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.550> pull<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:20.910> gun

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
little animation when you pull the gun

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.180 
little animation when you pull the gun
back<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.110> might<00:02:22.260> see<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.920> sec<00:02:23.160> but

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
back and you might see that in a sec but

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.570 
back and you might see that in a sec but
I'm<00:02:24.090> not<00:02:24.630> very<00:02:24.870> good<00:02:24.990> at<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.620> far<00:02:25.950> it's

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
I'm not very good at this so far it's

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.550 
I'm not very good at this so far it's
kind<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:26.850> hard<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.060> figure<00:02:27.270> out<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.959> map<00:02:28.260> is

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
kind of hard to figure out in the map is

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.290 
kind of hard to figure out in the map is
pretty<00:02:29.010> big<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.610> it's<00:02:29.880> hard<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.150> find<00:02:30.480> people

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
pretty big so it's hard to find people

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.990 
pretty big so it's hard to find people
near<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.450> end<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:34.050> near<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.010> beginning<00:02:35.160> it's

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
near the end and near the beginning it's

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.560 
near the end and near the beginning it's
hard<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.360> find<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.320> place<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:38.010> actually<00:02:38.970> get<00:02:39.540> a

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
hard to find a place to actually get a

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.010 
hard to find a place to actually get a
good<00:02:39.810> lead<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:40.500> someone<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:42.020> without

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
good lead on someone and and without

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.870 
good lead on someone and and without
dying<00:02:43.350> basically<00:02:43.980> because<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.250> whole<00:02:44.459> map<00:02:44.640> is

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
dying basically because the whole map is

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.280 
dying basically because the whole map is
pretty<00:02:45.090> open<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.600> there's<00:02:45.810> people<00:02:46.140> all

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
pretty open and there's people all

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.979 
pretty open and there's people all
