00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.390
 What people I have a right 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.730
 interesting discovery made namely 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.020
 I have after death plays me 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.029
 completely driven insane 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.950
 again the desperate google 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.750
 started and maybe me 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.400
 to change something in his system 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.500
 This can make the network a bit better 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.800
 works on us and someday 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.629
 I came then on packet loss 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.010
 or packet loss and then I have 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.450
 is google how to avoid it 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.890
 or just his attitudes 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.590
 to change that can 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.230
 no longer occurs and then I am on the 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.200
 I have linked this page and 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.170
 in the description again completely 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.150
 and result was i have google 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.000
 can attach as i want i have 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.530
 had a hundred percent packet loss and 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.329
 I have therefore adjusted immediately 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.399
 At some point, no more packet loss 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.290
 was present and I a successful one 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.269
 ping four times to perform a row 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.490
 could and has been playing ever since 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.470
 Battlefield 4 is completely different 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.240
 still a bad netcode man 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.189
 you can meet at once, etc 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.439
 but it is not all live again 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.900
 to delayed the opponent's opponents 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.340
 turn up and stop first off 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.260
 their running and start the fire at 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.340
 as it is normal that you nice 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.229
 somehow shot west and ground 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.670
 come against it the sec I am since then 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.460
 behind the wall not even kicked the bucket 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.990
 I really do not have one since then 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.950
 death cup where i really do not care 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.400
 could understand 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.869
 or where the enemy almost shoots me 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.090
 and then I hear them shoot that 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.250
 what all this synchronicity is at 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.799
 I suddenly have no idea 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.990
 why that takes such a serious influence 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.310
 but you 're a little bit pinging 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.080
 but that will probably be better 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.119
 Do not be that just a little bit 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.740
 better ping is but it is easy 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.020
 live again the game and suddenly go 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.340
 I turn off I can relax operations 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.439
 play suddenly has a ten card 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.720
 instead of me the two kdh because I 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.040
 ever shot by a game 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.630
 will not be there yet 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.130
 suddenly the game works 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.619
 at least as good as Battlefield 3 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.530
 about internet it certainly comes 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.140
 still very bad and by far 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.099
 not perfect but this incredible 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.860
 delay because I at least personally 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.650
 he is gone now and I think so 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.239
 also that many do not like the netcode 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.160
 bad judge because maybe 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.900
 have no packard and for the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.210
 where package have the feeling it as 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.560
 unbelievably bad and 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.940
 I really think I'm more there 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.370
 or less a good option 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.650
 found these these giant 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.930
 Delay between the servers 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.490
 and client for yourself personally 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.620
 that's why I have of the matter 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.840
 no idea what that is 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.610
 down there is in the description and 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.600
 then you most likely have one 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.160
 much better gaming experience 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.640
 at least for me that was completely 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.610
 adjusted 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.560
 now it is set correctly and 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.540
 now I can play much better 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.340
 So please try it out 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.360
 Duty and good luck for that 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.090
 works like it does with me 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.200
 works and I finally have it again 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.880
 fun on the battlefield and yes 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.930
 be sure to try people up 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.700
 for the next time, thank you for watching 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.110
 and I hope that it is with you 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.100
 I work and press my thumb 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.100
 thank you, see you next time
