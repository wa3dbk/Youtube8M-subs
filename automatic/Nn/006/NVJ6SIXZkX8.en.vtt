get<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.950> somewhat<00:01:41.400> opaque<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:43.140> think<00:01:43.710> it

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
get it somewhat opaque and I think it

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.039 
get it somewhat opaque and I think it
could<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.100> even<00:01:44.250> taken<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.790> third<00:01:45.060> coat<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:45.840> I

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
could have even taken a third coat but I

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.990 
could have even taken a third coat but I
just<00:01:46.560> think<00:01:46.740> three<00:01:47.070> coats<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.430> nail<00:01:47.579> polish

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
just think three coats of nail polish

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.700 
just think three coats of nail polish
you<00:01:48.030> know<00:01:48.270> plus<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.570> base<00:01:48.780> coat<00:01:48.990> under<00:01:49.229> topcoat

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
you know plus a base coat under topcoat

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.340 
you know plus a base coat under topcoat
is<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:50.100> too<00:01:50.399> much<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.909> do<00:01:51.540> like<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.079> brush

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
is just too much I do like the brush

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.770 
is just too much I do like the brush
it's<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.070> little<00:01:53.280> bit<00:01:53.399> larger<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.540> find

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
it's a little bit larger and I find

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.660 
it's a little bit larger and I find
that's<00:01:54.899> easier<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.530> work<00:01:55.680> with<00:01:55.740> unless<00:01:56.520> you

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
that's easier to work with unless you

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.789 
that's easier to work with unless you
have<00:01:56.850> very<00:01:57.090> small<00:01:57.290> fingernails<00:01:58.290> then<00:01:58.649> you

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
have very small fingernails then you

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.440 
have very small fingernails then you
might<00:01:58.950> not<00:01:59.189> like<00:01:59.399> something<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.850> has<00:02:00.420> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
might not like something that has a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.680 
might not like something that has a
larger<00:02:00.899> brush<00:02:01.110> but<00:02:01.680> what<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> didn't<00:02:02.219> like<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.369> I

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
larger brush but what I didn't like is I

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.210 
larger brush but what I didn't like is I
find<00:02:02.810> that<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.050> handles<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.680> little<00:02:03.770> bit<00:02:04.010> too

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
find that the handles a little bit too

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.480 
find that the handles a little bit too
long<00:02:04.720> so<00:02:05.720> you<00:02:05.780> don't<00:02:06.080> have<00:02:06.290> as<00:02:06.500> much<00:02:06.620> control<00:02:06.890> I

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
long so you don't have as much control I

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.370 
long so you don't have as much control I
find<00:02:08.060> that<00:02:08.270> if<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.600> handles<00:02:08.990> a<00:02:09.080> little<00:02:09.170> bit

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
find that if the handles a little bit

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.710 
find that if the handles a little bit
shorter<00:02:09.830> you're<00:02:10.010> closer<00:02:10.400> to<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.760> nail<00:02:11.060> I<00:02:11.300> find

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
shorter you're closer to the nail I find

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.510 
shorter you're closer to the nail I find
it's<00:02:11.840> just<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.260> little<00:02:12.380> bit<00:02:12.590> easier<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:12.950> control

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
it's just a little bit easier to control

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.700 
it's just a little bit easier to control
so<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:13.970> think<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.600> also<00:02:14.870> led<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.290> how<00:02:15.650> the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
so I think that also led to how the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.160 
so I think that also led to how the
polish<00:02:16.370> applied<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.450> how<00:02:17.570> it<00:02:17.750> looked

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
polish applied and how it looked

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.830 
polish applied and how it looked
I<00:02:18.320> did<00:02:19.070> notice<00:02:19.250> chipping<00:02:19.790> after<00:02:20.180> two<00:02:20.330> days<00:02:20.540> so

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
I did notice chipping after two days so

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.410 
I did notice chipping after two days so
overall<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.920> didn't<00:02:22.400> like<00:02:22.520> this<00:02:22.700> polish<00:02:23.180> I

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
overall I didn't like this polish I

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.120 
overall I didn't like this polish I
wouldn't<00:02:23.810> purchase<00:02:24.170> one<00:02:24.410> of<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.710> industry

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
wouldn't purchase one of the industry

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.580 
wouldn't purchase one of the industry
dry<00:02:25.250> polishes<00:02:25.760> again<00:02:26.030> just<00:02:26.570> because<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.500> know

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
the brush handle the formula it's kind

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
for lilac now this applied a little bit

for lilac now this applied a little bit
streaky<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.460> in<00:02:40.550> my<00:02:40.670> husband's<00:02:41.060> words<00:02:41.300> a

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
streaky and in my husband's words a

streaky and in my husband's words a
little<00:02:41.900> bit<00:02:42.020> chunky<00:02:42.380> but<00:02:42.770> I<00:02:42.800> found<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.490> it

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
little bit chunky but I found that it

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.940 
little bit chunky but I found that it
did<00:02:43.910> dry<00:02:44.270> nicely<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.050> my<00:02:45.260> suggestion<00:02:45.650> would

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
did dry nicely so my suggestion would

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.220 
did dry nicely so my suggestion would
just<00:02:46.130> be<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.700> make<00:02:47.270> sure<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:47.630> get<00:02:47.750> an<00:02:47.870> even

take<00:02:49.670> your<00:02:49.820> time<00:02:50.030> try<00:02:50.540> not<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:51.170> use<00:02:51.560> too<00:02:51.590> many

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
take your time try not to use too many

take your time try not to use too many
brush<00:02:52.250> strokes<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:52.940> should<00:02:53.360> be<00:02:53.540> fine<00:02:53.780> now

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
in terms of staying power it didn't chip

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.320 
in terms of staying power it didn't chip
until<00:02:57.620> day<00:02:57.830> four<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:58.670> I<00:02:58.700> thought<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.150> was

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
until day four so I thought that was

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.930 
until day four so I thought that was
pretty<00:02:59.540> good<00:02:59.690> the<00:03:00.440> brush<00:03:00.740> is<00:03:01.100> a<00:03:01.250> little<00:03:01.760> bit

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
pretty good the brush is a little bit

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.780 
pretty good the brush is a little bit
smaller<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.720> thinner<00:03:03.020> so<00:03:03.890> again<00:03:04.430> not<00:03:04.610> my

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
smaller and thinner so again not my

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.600 
smaller and thinner so again not my
favorite<00:03:05.240> but<00:03:05.840> because<00:03:06.320> it<00:03:06.590> is<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:07.070> regular

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
favorite but because it is a regular

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.870 
favorite but because it is a regular
size<00:03:07.850> shorter<00:03:08.480> handle<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:09.440> was<00:03:09.620> fine<00:03:09.860> this<00:03:10.670> is

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
size shorter handle it was fine this is

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.850 
darker or a little bit more vibrant but
it<00:03:23.030> was<00:03:23.180> still<00:03:23.390> a<00:03:23.420> nice<00:03:23.660> polish<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.440> applying

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
it was still a nice polish and applying

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.430 
it was still a nice polish and applying
nicely<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.790> wasn't<00:03:26.239> streaky<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:27.050> wasn't

I<00:03:28.340> gave<00:03:28.910> this<00:03:29.239> one<00:03:29.300> actually<00:03:29.720> three<00:03:30.650> coats

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
I gave this one actually three coats

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.370 
I gave this one actually three coats
just<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.820> see<00:03:32.090> how<00:03:32.330> much<00:03:32.480> color<00:03:32.810> I<00:03:32.930> could<00:03:33.230> get

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
just to see how much color I could get

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.400 
just to see how much color I could get
out<00:03:33.530> of<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:33.860> but<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:35.030> brush<00:03:35.420> it's<00:03:36.110> a<00:03:36.230> little

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
out of it but the brush it's a little

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.560 
out of it but the brush it's a little
bit<00:03:36.530> smaller<00:03:36.830> than<00:03:37.100> I<00:03:37.220> prefer<00:03:37.700> but<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.300> was

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
bit smaller than I prefer but it was

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.780 
bit smaller than I prefer but it was
fine<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.500> work<00:03:39.650> with<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.340> brush<00:03:40.519> handle

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
fine to work with and the brush handle

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.970 
fine to work with and the brush handle
being<00:03:41.150> shorter<00:03:41.600> compared<00:03:42.050> to<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.380> insta<00:03:42.830> buy

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
being shorter compared to the insta buy

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.160 
being shorter compared to the insta buy
you<00:03:43.700> have<00:03:43.880> more<00:03:44.060> control<00:03:44.360> it's<00:03:44.600> easier<00:03:44.959> to

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
you have more control it's easier to

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.970

work<00:03:45.320> I<00:03:46.540> noticed<00:03:47.540> chipping<00:03:47.989> on<00:03:48.200> day<00:03:48.440> four<00:03:48.769> with

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
work I noticed chipping on day four with

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.190 
work I noticed chipping on day four with
this<00:03:49.130> polish<00:03:49.580> overall<00:03:50.300> I<00:03:50.330> think<00:03:50.690> it's<00:03:50.900> an<00:03:51.050> okay

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
this polish overall I think it's an okay

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.610 
this polish overall I think it's an okay
polish<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.910> application<00:03:53.660> was<00:03:53.810> fine<00:03:54.019> but<00:03:54.590> I

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
polish the application was fine but I

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.770 
polish the application was fine but I
think<00:03:55.010> what<00:03:55.310> makes<00:03:55.550> it<00:03:55.730> one<00:03:55.940> of<00:03:56.060> my<00:03:56.090> lesser

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
think what makes it one of my lesser

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.780 
think what makes it one of my lesser
favorites<00:03:57.260> is<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.590> price<00:03:57.890> it<00:03:58.459> was<00:03:58.640> the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
favorites is the price it was the

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.120 
favorites is the price it was the
priciest<00:03:59.269> out<00:03:59.570> of<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.870> bunch<00:04:00.080> and<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.980> would

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
priciest out of the bunch and I would

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.979 
priciest out of the bunch and I would
expect<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.640> little<00:04:01.760> bit<00:04:02.030> more<00:04:02.300> at<00:04:02.570> this<00:04:02.750> price

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
expect a little bit more at this price

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:03.400 
expect a little bit more at this price

considering the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.050 
considering the
of<00:04:10.379> this<00:04:10.680> nail<00:04:10.920> polish<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:11.610> thought<00:04:11.909> it

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
of this nail polish I thought it

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.780 
of this nail polish I thought it
performed<00:04:12.629> very<00:04:12.989> well<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.709> applied<00:04:14.040> close<00:04:14.519> to

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
performed very well it applied close to

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.930 
performed very well it applied close to
opaque<00:04:15.120> with<00:04:15.420> one<00:04:15.659> coat<00:04:15.989> so<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.650> think<00:04:16.769> if<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.609> had

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
opaque with one coat so I think if I had

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.210 
opaque with one coat so I think if I had
just<00:04:18.299> been<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.780> little<00:04:18.870> bit<00:04:19.290> more<00:04:19.320> heavy-handed

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
just been a little bit more heavy-handed

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.099 
just been a little bit more heavy-handed
with<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.549> one<00:04:20.760> coat<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.329> could<00:04:21.780> have<00:04:21.900> gotten

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
with that one coat I could have gotten

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.990 
with that one coat I could have gotten
away<00:04:22.320> with<00:04:22.650> just<00:04:22.830> one<00:04:22.979> coat<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:23.400> then<00:04:23.669> applied

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
away with just one coat and then applied

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.600 
away with just one coat and then applied
my<00:04:24.210> top<00:04:24.419> coat<00:04:24.690> I<00:04:24.960> do<00:04:25.380> like<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.919> brush<00:04:26.130> it's<00:04:26.490> a

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
my top coat I do like the brush it's a

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.969 
my top coat I do like the brush it's a
nice<00:04:26.789> wider<00:04:27.120> brush<00:04:27.479> and<00:04:27.840> I<00:04:28.530> find<00:04:28.830> that

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
nice wider brush and I find that

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.010 
nice wider brush and I find that
actually<00:04:29.190> this<00:04:29.699> handle<00:04:30.210> is<00:04:30.449> quite

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
actually this handle is quite

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.930 
actually this handle is quite
comfortable<00:04:31.289> it's<00:04:31.770> pretty<00:04:32.039> short<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:32.850> it

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
comfortable it's pretty short so it

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.210 
comfortable it's pretty short so it
gives<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.240> lot<00:04:33.449> of<00:04:33.479> control<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:34.289> I<00:04:34.979> find

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
gives you a lot of control and I find

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.150 
gives you a lot of control and I find
it's<00:04:35.370> pretty<00:04:35.430> comfortable<00:04:36.180> for<00:04:36.479> my<00:04:36.600> hand<00:04:36.810> I

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
it's pretty comfortable for my hand I

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.770 
it's pretty comfortable for my hand I
didn't<00:04:38.160> notice<00:04:38.430> any<00:04:38.669> chipping<00:04:39.030> until<00:04:39.570> day

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
didn't notice any chipping until day

claims to dry in 60 seconds and that you
only<00:04:51.780> need<00:04:52.050> one<00:04:52.289> coat<00:04:52.470> I<00:04:52.820> found<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:53.970> it

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
only need one coat I found that it

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.969 
only need one coat I found that it
applied<00:04:54.389> pretty<00:04:54.720> close<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.260> a<00:04:55.289> peak<00:04:55.560> with<00:04:55.770> one

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
applied pretty close to a peak with one

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.860 
applied pretty close to a peak with one
coat<00:04:56.250> had<00:04:56.760> it<00:04:56.910> been<00:04:56.940> a<00:04:57.150> bit<00:04:57.300> more<00:04:57.449> generous

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
coat had it been a bit more generous

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.480 
coat had it been a bit more generous
with<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.199> application<00:04:58.860> I<00:04:58.979> think<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.340> would

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
with the application I think it would

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.640 
with the application I think it would
have<00:04:59.610> been<00:04:59.760> fine<00:05:00.000> with<00:05:00.300> just<00:05:00.330> one<00:05:00.720> coat<00:05:00.960> I<00:05:01.199> did

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
have been fine with just one coat I did

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.990 
have been fine with just one coat I did
like<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:01.979> brush<00:05:02.160> it<00:05:02.400> is<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.550> little<00:05:02.789> bit<00:05:02.880> of<00:05:02.940> the

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
like the brush it is a little bit of the

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.750 
like the brush it is a little bit of the
larger<00:05:03.330> brush<00:05:03.539> and<00:05:03.960> I<00:05:04.080> did<00:05:04.320> like<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.919> handle

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
larger brush and I did like the handle

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.730 
larger brush and I did like the handle
length<00:05:05.970> I<00:05:06.210> found<00:05:06.419> it<00:05:06.960> was<00:05:07.050> easy<00:05:07.289> to<00:05:07.560> work<00:05:07.680> with

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
length I found it was easy to work with

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.279 
length I found it was easy to work with
and<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.130> had<00:05:08.310> enough<00:05:08.610> control<00:05:09.150> now<00:05:09.660> chipping

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
and I had enough control now chipping

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.860 
and I had enough control now chipping
was<00:05:10.710> on<00:05:11.010> day<00:05:11.340> four<00:05:11.729> so<00:05:12.000> lasted<00:05:12.479> four<00:05:12.690> days

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
was on day four so lasted four days

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.500 
was on day four so lasted four days
before<00:05:13.139> chipping<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.860> like<00:05:14.729> this<00:05:14.970> slightly

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
before chipping I like this slightly

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.570 
before chipping I like this slightly
better<00:05:15.870> than<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.289> essence<00:05:16.710> polished<00:05:17.220> just

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
better than the essence polished just

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.580 
better than the essence polished just
because<00:05:17.910> I<00:05:17.940> found<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.360> formula<00:05:18.900> to<00:05:19.110> be<00:05:19.139> just<00:05:19.410> a

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
because I found the formula to be just a

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.450 
because I found the formula to be just a
tad<00:05:20.160> bit<00:05:20.190> thinner<00:05:20.940> not<00:05:21.690> thin<00:05:22.199> at<00:05:22.680> all<00:05:23.010> but<00:05:23.340> just

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
tad bit thinner not thin at all but just

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.430 
tad bit thinner not thin at all but just
a<00:05:23.669> little<00:05:23.849> bit<00:05:24.090> easier<00:05:24.479> to<00:05:24.570> work<00:05:24.930> with<00:05:24.990> in<00:05:25.320> the

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
a little bit easier to work with in the

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.140 
a little bit easier to work with in the
essence<00:05:25.889> the<00:05:26.130> essence<00:05:26.669> is<00:05:26.820> still<00:05:27.030> an

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
essence the essence is still an

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.210 
essence the essence is still an
excellent<00:05:27.570> nail<00:05:27.900> polish<00:05:28.320> especially<00:05:29.010> at<00:05:29.130> the

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
excellent nail polish especially at the

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.950 
excellent nail polish especially at the
price<00:05:29.400> point<00:05:29.430> but<00:05:30.120> I<00:05:30.150> found<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:30.539> rimmel<00:05:30.810> is

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
price point but I found the rimmel is

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.620 
price point but I found the rimmel is
just<00:05:31.229> that<00:05:31.680> that<00:05:32.310> tad<00:05:32.639> bit<00:05:32.940> easier<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:33.539> work

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
just that that tad bit easier to work

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.100 
just that that tad bit easier to work
with

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
with

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.740 
with
so<00:05:35.099> overall<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:35.729> rimmel<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.330> essence

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
so overall the rimmel and the essence

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.810 
so overall the rimmel and the essence
performed<00:05:37.229> very<00:05:37.500> well<00:05:37.620> in<00:05:37.800> terms<00:05:38.190> of<00:05:38.669> the

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
performed very well in terms of the

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.510 
performed very well in terms of the
formula<00:05:39.360> how<00:05:39.840> long<00:05:40.020> they<00:05:40.169> lasted<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:41.220> brush

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
formula how long they lasted the brush

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.379 
formula how long they lasted the brush
the<00:05:41.789> application<00:05:42.570> the<00:05:43.320> rimmel<00:05:43.770> is<00:05:44.010> I<00:05:44.580> find<00:05:45.090> for

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
the application the rimmel is I find for

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.020 
the application the rimmel is I find for
me<00:05:45.539> work<00:05:46.320> just<00:05:46.590> a<00:05:46.710> little<00:05:47.010> bit<00:05:47.130> better<00:05:47.340> just

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
me work just a little bit better just

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.580 
me work just a little bit better just
because<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.360> formula<00:05:48.810> like<00:05:48.990> I<00:05:49.080> said<00:05:49.260> was<00:05:49.410> just

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
because the formula like I said was just

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.740 
because the formula like I said was just
a<00:05:49.740> tiny<00:05:50.039> bit<00:05:50.340> thinner<00:05:50.669> than<00:05:50.910> the<00:05:51.060> essence<00:05:51.449> but

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
a tiny bit thinner than the essence but

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.779 
a tiny bit thinner than the essence but
at<00:05:52.199> the<00:05:52.380> price<00:05:52.530> point<00:05:52.590> the<00:05:53.130> essence<00:05:53.550> is<00:05:53.760> a

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
at the price point the essence is a

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.270 
at the price point the essence is a
great<00:05:54.210> option<00:05:54.449> a<00:05:54.780> great<00:05:55.050> value<00:05:55.440> so<00:05:55.650> if<00:05:55.949> you<00:05:56.099> are

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
great option a great value so if you are

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.860 
great option a great value so if you are
in<00:05:56.430> the<00:05:56.550> market<00:05:56.699> for<00:05:56.880> some<00:05:57.120> nail<00:05:57.270> polish<00:05:57.630> I

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
essence the idea for this video came

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.700 
essence the idea for this video came
about<00:06:02.820> because<00:06:03.300> I<00:06:03.479> was<00:06:03.659> asked<00:06:04.229> what<00:06:04.409> some<00:06:04.620> of

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
about because I was asked what some of

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.770 
about because I was asked what some of
my<00:06:04.830> favourite<00:06:05.190> nail<00:06:05.370> polishes<00:06:05.880> are<00:06:06.090> and<00:06:06.510> I<00:06:06.570> had

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
my favourite nail polishes are and I had

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.589 
my favourite nail polishes are and I had
a<00:06:06.810> look<00:06:07.080> and<00:06:07.320> then<00:06:07.500> I<00:06:07.590> realized<00:06:08.130> at<00:06:08.550> the<00:06:09.330> two

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
a look and then I realized at the two

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.390 
a look and then I realized at the two
that<00:06:09.720> are<00:06:09.870> my<00:06:09.990> favourites<00:06:10.440> or<00:06:10.680> actually<00:06:11.190> no

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
that are my favourites or actually no

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.219 
that are my favourites or actually no
longer<00:06:11.580> available<00:06:12.000> and<00:06:12.479> so<00:06:12.900> I<00:06:12.930> didn't<00:06:13.199> really

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
longer available and so I didn't really

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.140 
longer available and so I didn't really
want<00:06:13.620> to<00:06:13.710> share<00:06:13.889> those<00:06:14.099> with<00:06:14.159> people<00:06:14.610> in<00:06:14.909> case

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
want to share those with people in case

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.210 
want to share those with people in case
they<00:06:15.930> wanted<00:06:16.380> to<00:06:16.500> pick<00:06:16.650> them<00:06:16.770> up<00:06:16.860> they're<00:06:17.099> not

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
they wanted to pick them up they're not

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.279 
they wanted to pick them up they're not
available<00:06:17.340> in<00:06:17.760> anymore

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
available in anymore

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:19.510 
available in anymore
so<00:06:18.319> I<00:06:18.379> thought<00:06:18.619> you<00:06:18.680> know<00:06:18.889> what<00:06:19.009> haven't

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860

what<00:06:47.029> color<00:06:47.240> I<00:06:47.330> want<00:06:47.449> to<00:06:47.749> wear<00:06:47.930> I'll<00:06:48.229> go<00:06:48.499> with

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
what color I want to wear I'll go with

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.459 
what color I want to wear I'll go with
this<00:06:48.830> one<00:06:49.069> just<00:06:49.099> because<00:06:49.399> it's<00:06:50.240> very<00:06:51.110> simple

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:51.469 
this one just because it's very simple

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:54.820 
this one just because it's very simple
it'll<00:06:52.219> match<00:06:52.490> with<00:06:52.759> any<00:06:53.180> outfit<00:06:53.719> any<00:06:54.020> look<00:06:54.409> and

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
it'll match with any outfit any look and

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.820 
it'll match with any outfit any look and
I<00:06:55.279> do<00:06:55.339> like<00:06:55.969> the<00:06:56.240> brush<00:06:56.509> and<00:06:56.779> the<00:06:56.959> formula<00:06:57.499> it

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
I do like the brush and the formula it

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.339 
I do like the brush and the formula it
applies<00:06:58.219> very<00:06:58.430> nicely<00:06:58.879> sometimes<00:06:59.809> with<00:07:00.169> this

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:00.349 
applies very nicely sometimes with this

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:02.859 
applies very nicely sometimes with this
one<00:07:00.649> I<00:07:00.830> just<00:07:01.159> want<00:07:01.610> a<00:07:01.669> coat<00:07:01.909> just<00:07:02.389> to<00:07:02.539> get<00:07:02.689> you

00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:02.869 
one I just want a coat just to get you

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:04.209 
one I just want a coat just to get you
know<00:07:02.959> a<00:07:02.990> little<00:07:03.080> bit<00:07:03.409> of<00:07:03.499> color<00:07:03.680> on<00:07:03.889> the<00:07:03.919> nails

00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:04.219 
know a little bit of color on the nails

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:05.290 
know a little bit of color on the nails
and<00:07:04.580> that's<00:07:04.819> it

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
and that's it

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.019 
and that's it
I<00:07:05.330> wouldn't<00:07:06.319> say<00:07:06.589> that<00:07:06.619> it<00:07:06.889> wears<00:07:07.159> for<00:07:07.520> 10<00:07:07.759> days

00:07:08.019 --> 00:07:08.029 
I wouldn't say that it wears for 10 days

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:10.839 
I wouldn't say that it wears for 10 days
but<00:07:08.809> I<00:07:09.050> can<00:07:09.289> get<00:07:09.439> four<00:07:09.770> to<00:07:09.889> five<00:07:10.099> days<00:07:10.369> without

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:10.849 
but I can get four to five days without

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:13.480

chipping<00:07:11.270> from<00:07:11.569> this<00:07:11.719> polish<00:07:12.189> my<00:07:13.189> next

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:13.490 
chipping from this polish my next

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.600 
chipping from this polish my next
favorite<00:07:13.939> is<00:07:14.209> from<00:07:14.479> quo<00:07:15.259> by<00:07:15.649> Orly<00:07:16.099> and<00:07:16.279> it's<00:07:16.459> in

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.610 
favorite is from quo by Orly and it's in

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.820 
favorite is from quo by Orly and it's in
the<00:07:16.699> shade<00:07:16.939> soft<00:07:17.479> spot<00:07:17.839> this<00:07:18.050> is<00:07:18.199> a<00:07:18.229> mini<00:07:18.499> and

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830 
the shade soft spot this is a mini and

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.860 
the shade soft spot this is a mini and
actually<00:07:19.490> came<00:07:19.819> in<00:07:20.059> a<00:07:20.270> set<00:07:20.749> with<00:07:21.939> 18<00:07:22.939> mini<00:07:23.659> nail

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:23.870 
actually came in a set with 18 mini nail

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.540 
actually came in a set with 18 mini nail
polishes<00:07:24.469> I<00:07:24.649> thought<00:07:24.830> this<00:07:24.979> as<00:07:25.129> a<00:07:25.159> gift<00:07:25.399> a

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550 
polishes I thought this as a gift a

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.279 
polishes I thought this as a gift a
couple<00:07:25.759> of<00:07:25.819> years<00:07:25.999> ago<00:07:26.300> and<00:07:26.569> so<00:07:26.930> that's<00:07:27.080> why<00:07:27.259> I

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:27.289 
couple of years ago and so that's why I

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:29.259 
couple of years ago and so that's why I
think<00:07:27.439> this<00:07:27.740> is<00:07:27.800> no<00:07:28.039> longer<00:07:28.189> available<00:07:28.490> effect

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:29.269 
think this is no longer available effect

00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:32.709 
think this is no longer available effect
or<00:07:29.629> just<00:07:30.050> this<00:07:30.379> shade<00:07:30.769> and<00:07:31.129> it's<00:07:32.089> a<00:07:32.300> clear

00:07:32.709 --> 00:07:32.719 
or just this shade and it's a clear

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:36.189 
or just this shade and it's a clear
polish<00:07:33.439> with<00:07:34.099> a<00:07:34.129> hint<00:07:34.580> of<00:07:34.729> pink<00:07:35.029> so<00:07:35.599> this<00:07:35.899> is

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:36.199 
polish with a hint of pink so this is

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:38.499 
polish with a hint of pink so this is
another<00:07:36.709> polish<00:07:37.219> when<00:07:37.490> I'm<00:07:37.759> not<00:07:37.939> sure<00:07:38.180> what<00:07:38.479> I

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:38.509 
another polish when I'm not sure what I

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:40.989 
another polish when I'm not sure what I
want<00:07:38.930> to<00:07:39.439> wear<00:07:39.589> on<00:07:39.740> my<00:07:39.889> nails<00:07:40.099> or<00:07:40.639> I<00:07:40.669> don't

00:07:40.989 --> 00:07:40.999 
want to wear on my nails or I don't

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:43.629 
want to wear on my nails or I don't
really<00:07:41.360> want<00:07:41.599> any<00:07:41.749> color<00:07:42.050> but<00:07:42.589> I<00:07:42.620> do<00:07:42.740> want<00:07:43.490> I

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:43.639 
really want any color but I do want I

don't want to have them bare I want to

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:46.719 
don't want to have them bare I want to
have<00:07:45.080> something<00:07:45.409> on<00:07:45.559> them<00:07:45.800> this<00:07:46.249> gives<00:07:46.550> a

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:46.729 
have something on them this gives a

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:48.850 
have something on them this gives a
little<00:07:46.849> bit<00:07:47.089> of<00:07:47.180> shine<00:07:47.509> with<00:07:47.959> just<00:07:48.199> a<00:07:48.379> hint<00:07:48.680> of

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:48.860 
little bit of shine with just a hint of

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.459 
little bit of shine with just a hint of
kind<00:07:49.580> of<00:07:49.669> a<00:07:49.759> healthy<00:07:50.419> pink<00:07:50.689> glow<00:07:50.990> so<00:07:51.289> that's

00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:51.469 
kind of a healthy pink glow so that's

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:53.920 
kind of a healthy pink glow so that's
why<00:07:51.649> I<00:07:51.680> like<00:07:51.919> this<00:07:52.159> it<00:07:52.459> is<00:07:52.969> a<00:07:52.999> mini<00:07:53.330> so<00:07:53.719> the

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:53.930 
why I like this it is a mini so the

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.529 
why I like this it is a mini so the
brush<00:07:54.199> is<00:07:54.439> quite<00:07:54.769> small<00:07:55.189> but<00:07:55.519> I<00:07:55.759> can<00:07:56.180> work<00:07:56.330> with

00:07:56.529 --> 00:07:56.539 
brush is quite small but I can work with

00:07:56.539 --> 00:08:00.070 
brush is quite small but I can work with
it<00:07:56.779> I<00:07:57.050> find<00:07:57.800> it<00:07:57.919> applies<00:07:58.219> nicely<00:07:58.849> and<00:07:59.119> it<00:07:59.569> lasts
