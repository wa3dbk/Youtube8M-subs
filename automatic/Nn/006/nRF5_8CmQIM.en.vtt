00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.439
 hello friends look today I'm going to 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.139
 make piquillo peppers stuffed with 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:11.400
 meat and the ingredients are the 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:16.140
 piquillo peppers the minced meat 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:21.100
 grated cheese for cooking milk 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:25.810
 onion tomato butter oil and salt 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.290
 and aside an oven handle and a 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.290
 skillet 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.930
 now let's start look at the 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:40.580
 fire and I put it to medium 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.940
 a medium-low we put the pan and 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.550
 we throw the oil 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.340
 the oil do not cast much because here 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.910
 it needs to be greasy what 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.989
 next that we are going to put 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.989
 is the minced meat 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.470
 and this if what you have to do 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:05.790
 is rejecting the assist at the time so that 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.010
 do not stay not stuck or be the vais 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.980
 going around like that without stopping until 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.530
 you see that it is all separated and then 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.700
 he keeps telling me to what extent 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.700
 it has to be kitchen 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.729
 Look, I've been five minutes 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.150
 and doing these and see how you have to 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.360
 so everything is well separated so that 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.720
 has to do without stopping because if not you 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.520
 goop would be a good look and you 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.979
 I have taught how it should be and now what 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.710
 let's leave giving appointments too 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.710
 well from time to time five more minutes 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.350
 the five minutes have already passed since 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.810
 let's add the onion 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.530
 is the onion you have to bathe 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.530
 serradilla 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.409
 and we mix everything well for the onion 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.579
 and we're going to leave him 6 minutes to go 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.579
 doing with the ceremony 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.399
 6 minutes have passed and now what 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.399
 what we are going to do is add the tomato 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.930
 the tomato and now we put 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.930
 the birds 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.970
 I'm going to put it like this I'm going to move it 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.360
 I will not try each one has to put the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.819
 salt to your liking but it's always better than 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.160
 I know a little bit of that because later 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.390
 there is also grated cheese and everything 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.390
 but good to your liking 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.200
 we have already mixed the tomato well and now 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.400
 with the tomato we are going to leave another 6 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.400
 minutes to be done 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.370
 and both at six minutes look what 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.629
 let's do now 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.819
 let's catch me as the liquid cream is 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:10.530
 a little bit extensive 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:13.140
 I always add a little milk and 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.780
 eggs 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.590
 and so that this has more of joy you 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.160
 I put no information 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.160
 and so 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.849
 no meters those that pull softer 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.849
 afterwards inside 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.070
 and we are already paid 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.970
 we put out the fire 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.950
 Now what we are going to do is take a 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.950
 little here 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.849
 we're not going to leave this and now we're going to 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.230
 start filling the peppers with the 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.260
 meat 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.770
 now let's put here so that what 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.650
 see better 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.900
 you take the pepper with your hands 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.260
 very clean especially as long as this 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.200
 you work with your hands 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.890
 and now with the spoon we go 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.890
 filling well 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.750
 and we are putting ourselves in the tray of 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.750
 fungus 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.530
 the friends 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.530
 and we fill 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.009
 we have in the way 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:50.879
 we are all full and now 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.419
 let's put the milk cream for 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.419
 over 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.860
 we have already put the milk cream and 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:03.389
 Now what we are going to do is cover them 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.389
 with the grated cheese 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.010
 we have already put the grated cheese and now 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.260
 we are going to put some pieces of 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.430
 butter above to gratinate in 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.430
 our facts well 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.960
 we have already put the butter and now 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.880
 we 're going to put it in the oven 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.930
 and in the oven we're going to put it to 180 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:35.289
 look how it is to gratinate just 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:39.569
 I liked this at the moment I'm going to 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:44.279
 put 20 minutes 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:46.020
 at 180 we will look at how it is and according to how 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:48.349
 we'll see it then we'll leave it for a while 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.349
 plus 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.729
 the 20 minutes have passed and we are going to 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.729
 check how it is 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:07.360
 I is perfect for me I have left 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:12.010
 20 minutes with the oven without preheating 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.010
 and I think it's very good 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.439
 look here I present the ration look 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.180
 how is it that it was great to follow 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:22.370
 all the steps because it is very simple 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.449
 to do I hope you do that 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.449
 like and until next time
