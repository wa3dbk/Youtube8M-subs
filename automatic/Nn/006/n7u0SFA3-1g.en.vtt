&lt;soft piano&gt;

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
How to bake unleavened bread like the one used to celebrate the Lord's Evening Meal

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.000
Ingredients: 1 cup of wheat flour, 1/4 cup of water
You will need: baking sheet, parchment paper

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
(or you can put a thin film of cooking oil on the sheet)
Preparation: clean inside of oven, pre-heat it to 450ºF o 230ºC

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
&lt;oven beeps&gt;

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
OK well this was my practice ball.&lt;sigh&gt;

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
...there were a lot of practice balls..

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We're gonna try another one.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.000
First attempt.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'm going to leave it in the oven 3 minutes.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.000
Whoops! I left it 9 minutes.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
&lt;fire alarm beeps&gt;

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Oops.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So now we have a very clear idea of how it's not supposed to look... uhm...

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.290
I forgot to- uhm- say, this is parchment paper

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.150
for cooking.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
OK, I see what the problem was.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's that

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
it should really be about 1/4 cup of water for each cup of flour.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It's beginning to tear so I'm going to make the little holes.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And although it's not round, it really doesn't matter because I was going to break it into pieces at the end.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Though I would've liked for it to be round, I can't make round tortillas either so it's no surprise.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.000
Voila!

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I think after much effort I finally understand how to do this

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
so I'm gonna make one last one on camera

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and then I'll show what it looks like.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So then

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.150
we sprinkle

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
flour-

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
-sorry I don't know how to say "sprinkle" in Spanish-

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.000
...uhm...

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.000
The word is "sprinklear."

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
-before you start rolling it with this thing because otherwise it gets stuck all icky.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Well, once I've rolled it on one side, I turn it around.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I roll it on the other side.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So I turn it over each time so it doesn't stick to the...

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
...roll.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.000
"roll" -&gt; rolling pin

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Just so it's not so sticky.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It gets stuck anyway but-

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
if it starts to get sticky you can sprinkle this on this thingy

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and that helps.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I used organic wheat flour

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:25.000
but you can use any type of whole flour that's been ground.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I meant to say any ground whole grain flour.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Though ideally it ought to be, uhm, wheat.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
&lt;humming doo-doo-roo-doo-doo&gt;

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
The holes?

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.000
I honestly don't know what they're for.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.000
I've always seen them on the bread.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I don't know, I imagine this way it toasts more thoroughly.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And the bread, well, really, it is tasteless. It doesn't carry salt.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000
It is eaten thus to represent the perfect body of our Lord Jesus Christ

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.000
who was without sin

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
which is represented with leaven in the Bible.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Each bread should be baked for 5-6 minutes.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.290
This one's ready

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and they end up looking like this

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and once broken

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.150
they look like this.
