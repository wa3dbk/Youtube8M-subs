hey<00:00:01.890> this<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:02.370> how<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.550> make<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:02.909> piston

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
hey this is how to make the piston

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.390 
hey this is how to make the piston
drawbridge<00:00:03.870> that<00:00:04.259> was<00:00:04.380> seen<00:00:04.620> in<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.040> castle

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
drawbridge that was seen in the castle

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.450 
drawbridge that was seen in the castle
video<00:00:05.899> first<00:00:06.899> you<00:00:07.109> are<00:00:07.259> you're<00:00:07.770> going<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.309> want

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
video first you are you're going to want

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.190 
video first you are you're going to want
to<00:00:08.550> lay<00:00:08.700> out<00:00:08.820> 12<00:00:09.300> sticky<00:00:09.840> pistons<00:00:10.290> um<00:00:11.389> 6<00:00:12.389> across

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
to lay out 12 sticky pistons um 6 across

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.460 
to lay out 12 sticky pistons um 6 across
and<00:00:13.740> too<00:00:14.340> wide<00:00:17.810> after<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.930> do<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.080> you're

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
and too wide after you do that you're

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.870 
and too wide after you do that you're
going<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:20.100> need<00:00:20.369> about<00:00:21.109> 12<00:00:22.109> repeaters<00:00:22.920> it's

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
going to need about 12 repeaters it's

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.490 
going to need about 12 repeaters it's
what<00:00:24.029> i<00:00:24.060> use<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.900> can<00:00:25.019> do<00:00:25.140> different<00:00:25.289> things

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
what i use you can do different things

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.620 
what i use you can do different things
different<00:00:25.890> layouts<00:00:26.340> obviously<00:00:27.000> i<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.539> found

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
different layouts obviously i just found

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.980 
different layouts obviously i just found
this<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> easiest<00:00:29.390> so<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.599> put<00:00:30.689> them

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
this is the easiest so you just put them

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.760 
this is the easiest so you just put them
on<00:00:31.260> each<00:00:31.590> side<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.369> your<00:00:32.550> little<00:00:33.770> sticky

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
on each side of your little sticky

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.200 
on each side of your little sticky
piston<00:00:35.219> block<00:00:35.760> area<00:00:40.910> after<00:00:41.910> you're<00:00:42.030> done<00:00:42.059> with

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
piston block area after you're done with

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.369 
piston block area after you're done with
that<00:00:42.270> you're<00:00:42.510> going<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> need<00:00:42.840> your<00:00:42.930> redstone

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
that you're going to need your redstone

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.940 
that you're going to need your redstone
you<00:00:43.890> want<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> attach<00:00:44.370> each<00:00:44.820> side<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.950> each

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
you want to attach each side to each

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.459 
you want to attach each side to each
other<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:47.969> actually<00:00:48.420> attach<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.140> whole

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
other you can actually attach the whole

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.380 
other you can actually attach the whole
square<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:50.969> one<00:00:53.390> one

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
square so that you can have one one

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.760 
square so that you can have one one
lever<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:55.079> both<00:00:55.500> sides<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:58.320> drawbridge

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
lever on both sides of the drawbridge

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.639 
lever on both sides of the drawbridge
but<00:00:59.760> in<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.300> example<00:01:01.109> we're<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.559> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
but in this example we're just going to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:09.679 
but in this example we're just going to
have<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:07.460> so<00:01:08.460> now<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.820> want<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> test<00:01:09.450> to

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
have one so now you just want to test to

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.179 
have one so now you just want to test to
see<00:01:09.869> if<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.049> works<00:01:10.229> make<00:01:10.470> sure<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.710> wired<00:01:10.950> it

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
see if it works make sure you wired it

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.530 
see if it works make sure you wired it
properly<00:01:11.840> just<00:01:12.840> sort<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.049> few<00:01:13.470> more<00:01:13.650> oh<00:01:14.540> no

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
properly just sort of few more oh no

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
properly just sort of few more oh no
sorry<00:01:16.290> actually<00:01:16.799> you're<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:18.560> yeah

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
sorry actually you're going to yeah

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
we're going to make sure that it works

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.249 
we're going to make sure that it works
throw<00:01:21.180> down<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.390> lever<00:01:23.570> BAM<00:01:26.840> done<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.110> do

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
throw down that lever BAM done what I do

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.410 
throw down that lever BAM done what I do
is<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.470> put<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.939> put<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.299> layer

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
is I put the I just put one layer

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.530 
is I put the I just put one layer
cobblestone<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.229> top<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.540> that's

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
cobblestone on top of it and that's

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.810 
cobblestone on top of it and that's
what's<00:01:33.780> actually<00:01:33.960> going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.290> pop<00:01:34.500> out<00:01:34.820> after

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
what's actually going to pop out after

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.899 
what's actually going to pop out after
the<00:01:36.030> lava<00:01:36.619> I'm<00:01:37.619> putting<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.100> repeaters<00:01:38.640> down

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the lava I'm putting the repeaters down

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.249 
the lava I'm putting the repeaters down
just<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.390> make<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.659> signal<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:40.049> little

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
just to make the signal a little

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:52.210 
just to make the signal a little
stronger<00:01:41.030> for<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.060> wiring

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.130 

after<00:01:52.970> i<00:01:53.000> put<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.240> cobblestone<00:01:53.810> down<00:01:53.960> i'm

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
after i put the cobblestone down i'm

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.740 
after i put the cobblestone down i'm
pretty<00:01:54.350> much<00:01:54.410> done<00:01:54.770> with<00:01:54.890> this<00:01:55.130> part<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:55.750> then

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
pretty much done with this part and then

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.080 
pretty much done with this part and then
you<00:01:57.350> kind<00:01:57.770> of<00:01:57.830> just<00:01:57.980> want<00:01:58.190> to<00:01:58.250> hide<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.610> wiring

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
you kind of just want to hide the wiring

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.080 
you kind of just want to hide the wiring
that's<00:01:59.330> pretty<00:01:59.660> much<00:01:59.810> all<00:02:00.410> there<00:02:00.740> is<00:02:00.800> left<00:02:01.090> to

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
that's pretty much all there is left to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:16.780 
that's pretty much all there is left to
do<00:02:02.420> for<00:02:03.110> that<00:02:03.140> part

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.380 

and<00:02:17.269> this<00:02:17.840> test<00:02:18.049> it<00:02:18.290> make<00:02:18.439> sure<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.739> works<00:02:19.390> no

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
and this test it make sure it works no

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:28.420 
and this test it make sure it works no
reason<00:02:20.719> why<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:20.900> shouldn't

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.880 

and<00:02:28.969> then<00:02:29.120> coming<00:02:29.420> up<00:02:29.629> basically<00:02:30.409> this<00:02:30.680> is

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
and then coming up basically this is

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.640 
and then coming up basically this is
just<00:02:31.219> the<00:02:31.370> big<00:02:31.549> brass<00:02:31.879> square<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:33.319> big<00:02:33.349> dirt

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
just the big brass square the big dirt

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.830 
just the big brass square the big dirt
square<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.069> I<00:02:34.099> put<00:02:34.370> down<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.969> hides<00:02:35.510> all<00:02:35.810> the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
square that I put down it hides all the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.740 
square that I put down it hides all the
wiring<00:02:36.200> as<00:02:36.799> you<00:02:37.129> can<00:02:37.280> see<00:02:37.579> you<00:02:38.209> just<00:02:38.390> can't<00:02:38.599> see

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
wiring as you can see you just can't see

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.339 
wiring as you can see you just can't see
anything<00:02:38.930> anymore<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:40.599> then<00:02:41.599> I<00:02:41.629> moved<00:02:42.019> where

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
anything anymore and then I moved where

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.440 
anything anymore and then I moved where
the<00:02:42.590> lever<00:02:42.799> is<00:02:44.349> and<00:02:45.549> so<00:02:46.549> then<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.790> cobblestone

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
the lever is and so then the cobblestone

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.500 
the lever is and so then the cobblestone
is<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:48.439> bridge<00:02:48.680> throw<00:02:49.639> that<00:02:49.819> lever<00:02:49.969> on<00:02:50.269> it

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
is the bridge throw that lever on it

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.240 
is the bridge throw that lever on it
still<00:02:50.780> pops<00:02:50.989> up<00:02:51.230> out<00:02:51.349> of<00:02:51.409> the<00:02:51.560> big<00:02:51.680> brass<00:02:51.920> box

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
still pops up out of the big brass box
