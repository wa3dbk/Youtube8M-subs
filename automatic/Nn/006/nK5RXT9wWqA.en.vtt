00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
see on the back I've also maps off the

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.620 
see on the back I've also maps off the
wooden<00:04:07.070> area<00:04:07.670> and<00:04:08.770> fortunately<00:04:09.770> because<00:04:10.630> I

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
wooden area and fortunately because I

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.510 
wooden area and fortunately because I
have<00:04:12.290> it<00:04:12.470> all<00:04:12.560> masked<00:04:12.800> off<00:04:13.010> like<00:04:13.190> that<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:13.490> I

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
have it all masked off like that and I

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.289 
have it all masked off like that and I
have<00:04:13.700> my<00:04:13.880> spinning<00:04:14.690> tray<00:04:15.560> I<00:04:16.070> can<00:04:17.000> in<00:04:17.600> theory

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
have my spinning tray I can in theory

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.920 
have my spinning tray I can in theory
keep<00:04:20.299> one<00:04:20.720> side<00:04:20.989> of<00:04:21.229> it

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
keep one side of it

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:37.090 
keep one side of it
and<00:04:22.930> then<00:04:23.260> flip<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:23.680> over<00:04:24.030> paint<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.210> other
