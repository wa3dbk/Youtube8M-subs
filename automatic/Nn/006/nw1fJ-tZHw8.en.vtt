00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
because there's sometimes there's no

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.020 
because there's sometimes there's no

other way to get around in a city that's
structured<00:03:20.570> like<00:03:20.780> this<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:22.010> it's<00:03:22.459> really

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
structured like this and so it's really

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.490 
structured like this and so it's really
important<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.060> us<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:23.300> did<00:03:23.450> not<00:03:23.660> feel<00:03:23.930> like<00:03:23.959> you

know a Ratchet and Clank thing which is

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.750 
know a Ratchet and Clank thing which is
you<00:03:26.180> know<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.810> when<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:27.230> start<00:03:27.470> with<00:03:27.760> profile

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
you know and when you start with profile

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.860 
you know and when you start with profile
like<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.209> see<00:03:29.330> something<00:03:29.480> that's<00:03:29.570> very

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870

like that you see something that's very
cool<00:03:30.140> from<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:30.500> gameplay<00:03:30.709> perspective<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:31.370> can

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
cool from a gameplay perspective you can

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.009 
cool from a gameplay perspective you can
you<00:03:31.790> could<00:03:31.910> see<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.330> possibilities<00:03:32.989> of

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
you could see the possibilities of

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.960 
you could see the possibilities of
fighting<00:03:33.440> on<00:03:33.560> those<00:03:33.739> things<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.250> jumping<00:03:34.790> off

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
fighting on those things and jumping off

fighting on those things and jumping off
and<00:03:35.180> shooting<00:03:35.450> things<00:03:35.720> but<00:03:36.290> we<00:03:36.470> then<00:03:36.680> have<00:03:36.890> to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
and shooting things but we then have to

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.120 
and shooting things but we then have to
make<00:03:37.160> sure<00:03:37.370> it<00:03:37.519> feels<00:03:38.320> part<00:03:39.320> of<00:03:39.410> Columbia<00:03:39.860> and

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
make sure it feels part of Columbia and

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
disease designer drawn-out splines like

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.460 
disease designer drawn-out splines like
they<00:03:46.670> have<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:47.000> either<00:03:47.300> be<00:03:47.600> there<00:03:48.230> for

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
they have to either be there for

transportation or there for you know the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.250 
transportation or there for you know the
cargo<00:03:52.160> like<00:03:52.340> Ken<00:03:52.519> says<00:03:52.760> do<00:03:53.690> we<00:03:53.780> have<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:53.989> video

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
cargo like Ken says do we have the video

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.690 
cargo like Ken says do we have the video
of<00:03:54.320> the<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:55.010> straight<00:03:55.730> line<00:03:56.510> I<00:03:57.160> really<00:03:58.160> I'm

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
of the the straight line I really I'm

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.400 
of the the straight line I really I'm
good<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:59.000> get<00:03:59.090> out<00:03:59.180> look<00:03:59.540> at<00:03:59.660> that<00:03:59.780> yeah<00:04:00.140> but<00:04:00.350> I

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
good to get out look at that yeah but I

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.520 
good to get out look at that yeah but I
think<00:04:00.590> that<00:04:00.890> you<00:04:01.700> know<00:04:01.959> thinks<00:04:02.959> this<00:04:03.320> is<00:04:03.500> a

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
think that you know thinks this is a

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.860 
think that you know thinks this is a
good<00:04:03.739> evolution<00:04:04.280> to<00:04:04.370> show<00:04:04.550> like<00:04:04.820> when<00:04:04.940> Justin

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
good evolution to show like when Justin

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.650 
good evolution to show like when Justin
comes<00:04:06.050> to<00:04:06.200> us<00:04:06.380> with<00:04:06.620> that<00:04:06.800> map<00:04:07.640> and<00:04:07.940> it's<00:04:08.330> pure

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
comes to us with that map and it's pure

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.259 
comes to us with that map and it's pure
design<00:04:09.019> and<00:04:09.290> it's<00:04:09.410> pure<00:04:09.709> jumping<00:04:10.670> around<00:04:10.760> and

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
design and it's pure jumping around and

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.930 
design and it's pure jumping around and
navigating<00:04:12.230> then<00:04:12.500> we

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
navigating then we

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.400 
navigating then we
it<00:04:13.090> comes<00:04:13.300> to<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.510> art<00:04:13.660> team<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.050> we<00:04:14.140> have<00:04:14.290> to

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
it comes to the art team and we have to

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.630 
it comes to the art team and we have to
think<00:04:14.560> about<00:04:14.860> like<00:04:15.100> well<00:04:15.280> how<00:04:15.400> do<00:04:15.460> we<00:04:15.550> make

there's<00:05:22.040> still<00:05:22.360> we're<00:05:23.360> still<00:05:23.600> you<00:05:24.080> know<00:05:24.140> we're

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
there's still we're still you know we're

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.750 
there's still we're still you know we're
still<00:05:24.470> figuring<00:05:24.770> out<00:05:25.040> some<00:05:25.340> of<00:05:25.460> this<00:05:25.580> and

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
still figuring out some of this and

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.520 
still figuring out some of this and

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
have a term we called player RAM at the

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.520 
have a term we called player RAM at the
that<00:05:34.910> we<00:05:35.060> use<00:05:35.600> called<00:05:35.780> player<00:05:35.990> RAM<00:05:36.260> which<00:05:36.440> is

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
that we use called player RAM which is

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.290 
that we use called player RAM which is
like<00:05:36.620> how<00:05:37.130> much<00:05:37.280> can<00:05:37.340> the<00:05:37.580> play<00:05:37.790> are<00:05:37.940> keeping

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
like how much can the play are keeping

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.510 
like how much can the play are keeping
his<00:05:38.450> head<00:05:38.660> and<00:05:38.960> and<00:05:39.170> and<00:05:39.380> and<00:05:39.590> without<00:05:39.950> his

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
his head and and and and without his

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.970 
his head and and and and without his
brain<00:05:40.850> exploding<00:05:41.510> and<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:42.230> skylines<00:05:42.680> are

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
brain exploding and the skylines are

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.840 
brain exploding and the skylines are
really<00:05:43.610> challenging<00:05:44.530> too<00:05:45.530> because<00:05:46.400> it's<00:05:46.580> so

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
really challenging too because it's so

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.340 
really challenging too because it's so
visceral<00:05:47.120> and<00:05:47.450> there's<00:05:47.570> so<00:05:47.750> much<00:05:47.870> going<00:05:48.200> on

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
and so you know arch our challenge right

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.850 
and so you know arch our challenge right
now<00:05:50.660> is<00:05:50.840> that<00:05:50.900> we<00:05:51.050> have<00:05:51.080> this<00:05:51.260> huge<00:05:51.440> level<00:05:51.770> of

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
now is that we have this huge level of

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.500 
now is that we have this huge level of
excitement<00:05:52.130> it's<00:05:52.490> now<00:05:52.610> getting<00:05:52.880> it<00:05:53.180> in<00:05:53.300> within

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
excitement it's now getting it in within

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.450 
excitement it's now getting it in within
player<00:05:53.840> RAM<00:05:54.200> so<00:05:54.470> people<00:05:54.770> can<00:05:54.890> actually<00:05:55.100> play

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
player RAM so people can actually play

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.580 
player RAM so people can actually play
and<00:05:55.640> omastar<00:05:56.360> and<00:05:56.570> feel<00:05:56.720> really<00:05:56.930> powerful<00:05:57.470> on

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
and omastar and feel really powerful on

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.810 
and omastar and feel really powerful on
it<00:05:57.770> and<00:05:57.950> that's<00:05:58.070> that's<00:05:58.370> what<00:05:58.550> we're<00:05:58.640> doing
