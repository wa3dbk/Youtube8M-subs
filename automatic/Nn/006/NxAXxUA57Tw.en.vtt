00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.289 
engineer for Cisco Systems public sector
and<00:00:07.160> today<00:00:07.549> what<00:00:07.730> we're<00:00:07.850> showing<00:00:08.000> in<00:00:08.240> our

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:08.299 
and today what we're showing in our

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.370 
and today what we're showing in our
booth<00:00:08.510> here<00:00:08.750> at<00:00:08.780> IWC<00:00:09.500> 2014<00:00:10.490> is<00:00:11.330> what<00:00:12.019> we<00:00:12.139> call

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
booth here at IWC 2014 is what we call

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.410 
booth here at IWC 2014 is what we call
premium<00:00:13.370> over<00:00:13.549> broadband<00:00:14.120> it's<00:00:14.360> a

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
premium over broadband it's a

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.970 
premium over broadband it's a
combination<00:00:15.110> of<00:00:16.869> LTE<00:00:17.869> wireless<00:00:18.230> using

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
combination of LTE wireless using

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.980 
combination of LTE wireless using
Cisco's<00:00:19.430> wants<00:00:20.090> a<00:00:20.150> pertinent<00:00:20.359> packet<00:00:20.810> core

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
Cisco's wants a pertinent packet core

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.470 
Cisco's wants a pertinent packet core
which<00:00:21.230> is<00:00:21.260> a<00:00:21.430> evolved<00:00:22.430> packet<00:00:22.760> core<00:00:22.939> for<00:00:23.150> LTE

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
which is a evolved packet core for LTE

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.890 
which is a evolved packet core for LTE
and<00:00:24.310> today<00:00:25.310> what<00:00:25.490> we're<00:00:25.640> using<00:00:25.760> is<00:00:26.060> a<00:00:26.269> public

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
and today what we're using is a public

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.070
