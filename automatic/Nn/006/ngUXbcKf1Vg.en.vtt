00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
now if i move it up to the fourth

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.630 
now if i move it up to the fourth
position<00:02:39.900> it'll<00:02:40.680> go<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.010> last<00:02:41.280> position

completely on the fly no respring is

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.520 
completely on the fly no respring is
