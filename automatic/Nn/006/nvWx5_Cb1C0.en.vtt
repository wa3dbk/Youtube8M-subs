for<00:01:23.549> their<00:01:23.670> opponents<00:01:24.240> then<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.780> should<00:01:24.960> be

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
for their opponents then you should be

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.170 
for their opponents then you should be
playing<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.500> soloqueue<00:01:26.100> now<00:01:26.580> while<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.820> have

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
playing in soloqueue now while I have

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.690 
playing in soloqueue now while I have
previously<00:01:27.689> said<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.590> other<00:01:28.890> videos<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.640> you

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
previously said in other videos that you

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.609 
previously said in other videos that you
should<00:01:29.880> respect<00:01:30.240> your<00:01:30.360> opponents<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.110> assume

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
should respect your opponents and assume

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.289 
should respect your opponents and assume
they're<00:01:31.829> playing<00:01:32.070> smart<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.729> don't<00:01:33.030> die

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
they're playing smart so you don't die

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.330 
they're playing smart so you don't die
there<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.079> such<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> thing<00:01:34.829> as<00:01:35.009> too<00:01:35.310> much

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
there is such a thing as too much

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.760 
there is such a thing as too much
respect<00:01:36.119> people<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.840> play<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.110> soloqueue

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
respect people you play in soloqueue

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
respect people you play in soloqueue
will<00:01:38.130> make<00:01:38.400> plenty<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.970> mistakes<00:01:39.210> especially

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
will make plenty of mistakes especially

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.440 
will make plenty of mistakes especially
if<00:01:40.680> you're<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.950> gold<00:01:41.159> divisions<00:01:41.610> are<00:01:41.759> lower<00:01:41.970> so

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
if you're in gold divisions are lower so

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.539 
if you're in gold divisions are lower so
you<00:01:42.509> should<00:01:42.840> play<00:01:43.110> much<00:01:43.439> more<00:01:43.470> maybe<00:01:44.310> not

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
you should play much more maybe not

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.399 
you should play much more maybe not
aggressively<00:01:45.119> but<00:01:45.450> much<00:01:45.630> more<00:01:45.810> offensively

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
aggressively but much more offensively

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.260 
aggressively but much more offensively
in<00:01:46.619> soloqueue<00:01:47.159> as<00:01:47.340> opposed<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.850> what<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.090> see

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
in soloqueue as opposed to what you see

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.389 
in soloqueue as opposed to what you see
in<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.479> LCS<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.710> learn<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> decent<00:01:50.310> amount

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
in the LCS you can learn a decent amount

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.340 
in the LCS you can learn a decent amount
by<00:01:50.700> watching<00:01:50.909> pros<00:01:51.299> play<00:01:51.540> styles<00:01:52.049> which<00:01:52.200> I'll

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
by watching pros play styles which I'll

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.289 
by watching pros play styles which I'll
talk<00:01:52.500> about<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:53.040> second<00:01:53.430> but<00:01:53.790> take<00:01:54.000> note

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
talk about in a second but take note

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.660 
talk about in a second but take note
that<00:01:54.540> if<00:01:54.960> they<00:01:55.200> were<00:01:55.259> at<00:01:55.560> your<00:01:55.920> rating<00:01:56.340> playing

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
that if they were at your rating playing

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.520 
that if they were at your rating playing
soloqueue<00:01:57.299> they'd<00:01:57.570> play<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.899> game<00:01:58.110> much

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
soloqueue they'd play the game much

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.139 
soloqueue they'd play the game much
differently<00:01:59.100> than<00:01:59.369> what<00:01:59.520> you're<00:01:59.670> seeing<00:01:59.969> on

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
stage secondly it don't pay too much

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
thing you should try to avoid is don't

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.440 
thing you should try to avoid is don't
go<00:02:13.590> out<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:13.950> say<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.640> Pro<00:02:14.970> played<00:02:15.240> this

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450

champion<00:02:16.050> he's<00:02:16.320> Opie<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.860> should<00:02:17.250> pick<00:02:17.400> him<00:02:17.520> in

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
champion he's Opie I should pick him in

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.490 
champion he's Opie I should pick him in
soloqueue<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.360> he<00:02:18.480> carries<00:02:18.780> me<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.960> Diamond

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
you're on the right track secondly try

you're on the right track secondly try

decision making decision making is a

decision making decision making is a
hard<00:03:52.230> skill<00:03:52.530> for<00:03:52.769> someone<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.160> teach<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.670> it's

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
hard skill for someone to teach and it's

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.130 
hard skill for someone to teach and it's
also<00:03:53.970> pretty<00:03:54.209> hard<00:03:54.480> for<00:03:54.630> someone<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.930> learn

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
also pretty hard for someone to learn

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.390 
also pretty hard for someone to learn
through<00:03:55.470> something<00:03:55.799> other<00:03:55.950> than<00:03:56.190> just

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
through something other than just

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.130 
through something other than just
straight<00:03:56.700> practice<00:03:57.299> but<00:03:57.750> if<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:57.959> pay

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
straight practice but if you pay

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.990 
straight practice but if you pay
attention<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.680> specific<00:03:58.860> Lane<00:03:59.519> or<00:03:59.940> a

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
attention to a specific Lane or a

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.820 
attention to a specific Lane or a

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
specific moment before a teamfight you

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.800 
specific moment before a teamfight you
can<00:04:02.010> compare<00:04:02.340> what<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.670> pros<00:04:03.000> do<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.480> what<00:04:03.630> you

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
can compare what the pros do to what you

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.050 
can compare what the pros do to what you
think<00:04:04.110> they<00:04:04.320> should<00:04:04.350> do<00:04:04.890> this<00:04:05.340> is<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:05.580> tricky

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
think they should do this is a tricky

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.090 
think they should do this is a tricky
one<00:04:06.239> since<00:04:06.720> like<00:04:06.989> I<00:04:07.110> said<00:04:07.350> earlier<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.769> have

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
one since like I said earlier you have

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.320 
one since like I said earlier you have
to<00:04:08.130> know<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.489> they're<00:04:08.820> going<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:08.970> be<00:04:09.090> playing

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
to know that they're going to be playing

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.030 
to know that they're going to be playing
the<00:04:09.450> game<00:04:09.600> much<00:04:09.810> more<00:04:09.840> cautiously<00:04:10.560> than<00:04:10.830> you

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
the game much more cautiously than you

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.580 
the game much more cautiously than you
should<00:04:11.100> but<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.330> thought<00:04:12.570> process<00:04:13.080> is<00:04:13.260> still

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
should but the thought process is still

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.530 
should but the thought process is still
going<00:04:13.830> to<00:04:13.890> be<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.220> same<00:04:14.489> wait<00:04:15.000> for<00:04:15.239> someone<00:04:15.420> to

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
going to be the same wait for someone to

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.180 
going to be the same wait for someone to
make<00:04:15.720> some<00:04:15.930> sort<00:04:16.080> of<00:04:16.169> mistake<00:04:16.560> or<00:04:16.830> leave<00:04:16.979> some

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
make some sort of mistake or leave some

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.949 
make some sort of mistake or leave some
sort<00:04:17.340> of<00:04:17.430> opening<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:17.970> then<00:04:18.299> go<00:04:18.450> on<00:04:18.600> in<00:04:18.630> and
