00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
design project so they'll take a real

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.580 
design project so they'll take a real
piece<00:01:45.610> of<00:01:45.640> land<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.539> they'll<00:01:46.810> use<00:01:47.289> all<00:01:47.470> the

knowledge that they've learned during
the<00:01:48.820> PVC<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.930> make<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.140> design<00:01:50.470> but<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.520> really

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
the PVC to make a design but the really

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.789 
the PVC to make a design but the really
interesting<00:01:52.210> thing<00:01:52.659> is<00:01:52.810> now<00:01:53.020> all<00:01:53.439> of<00:01:53.680> our

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
interesting thing is now all of our

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.920 
interesting thing is now all of our
students<00:01:54.310> are<00:01:54.399> going<00:01:54.490> back<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.180> starting<00:01:55.750> to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
students are going back and starting to

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.320 
students are going back and starting to
implement<00:01:56.530> these<00:01:56.649> designs<00:01:57.070> so<00:01:57.939> that<00:01:57.970> what's

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
implement these designs so that what's

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.810 
implement these designs so that what's
happening<00:01:58.780> in<00:01:59.140> paper<00:01:59.530> is<00:01:59.979> now<00:02:00.159> happening<00:02:00.490> in

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
happening in paper is now happening in

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.380 
happening in paper is now happening in
reality

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
reality

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.779 
reality
so<00:02:02.020> all<00:02:02.200> these<00:02:02.440> permaculture<00:02:03.190> projects<00:02:03.670> are

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
so all these permaculture projects are

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:11.180 
so all these permaculture projects are
starting<00:02:03.909> to<00:02:04.149> pop<00:02:04.330> up<00:02:04.390> all<00:02:04.750> over<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:05.080> world
