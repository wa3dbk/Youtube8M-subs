My Goddess Lea most people does come to

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:06.990 
My Goddess Lea most people does come to
the<00:00:05.379> top<00:00:05.590> three<00:00:05.800> that<00:00:06.160> passing<00:00:06.640> teams<00:00:06.850> the

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.000 
the top three that passing teams the

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.020 
the top three that passing teams the
country<00:00:07.360> going<00:00:07.540> is<00:00:07.720> to<00:00:07.960> the<00:00:08.200> worst<00:00:08.469> rated<00:00:09.030> pass

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
country going is to the worst rated pass

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.730 
country going is to the worst rated pass
defenses<00:00:10.750> the<00:00:10.840> country<00:00:11.170> expected<00:00:11.559> a<00:00:11.620> high

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
defenses the country expected a high

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.000 
defenses the country expected a high
scoring<00:00:12.070> game<00:00:12.190> why<00:00:12.970> it<00:00:13.030> was<00:00:13.269> so<00:00:13.570> difficult

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.010 
scoring game why it was so difficult

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.710 
scoring game why it was so difficult
five<00:00:15.010> top<00:00:15.280> bolt<00:00:15.519> defenses<00:00:16.090> played<00:00:16.299> real<00:00:16.539> well

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
five top bolt defenses played real well

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.109 
five top bolt defenses played real well
I<00:00:17.080> thought<00:00:17.410> both<00:00:17.590> defenses<00:00:18.220> played<00:00:18.460> physical

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
I thought both defenses played physical

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.000 
I thought both defenses played physical
and<00:00:19.330> and<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:22.000> know<00:00:22.199> whatever<00:00:23.199> the<00:00:23.440> rated<00:00:23.830> I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
and and you know whatever the rated I

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.950 
and and you know whatever the rated I
don't<00:00:24.189> pay<00:00:24.490> much<00:00:24.670> attention<00:00:25.240> in<00:00:25.359> the<00:00:25.449> ratings

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
don't pay much attention in the ratings

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.679 
don't pay much attention in the ratings
but<00:00:26.170> whatever<00:00:26.670> rated<00:00:27.670> this<00:00:27.820> rate<00:00:28.119> of<00:00:28.269> that<00:00:28.480> the

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
but whatever rated this rate of that the

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.689 
but whatever rated this rate of that the
defense<00:00:29.080> bowl<00:00:29.500> on<00:00:29.680> both<00:00:29.859> sides<00:00:30.160> played<00:00:30.490> better

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
defense bowl on both sides played better

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.519 
defense bowl on both sides played better
than<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:30.970> offenses<00:00:31.599> there's<00:00:31.779> no<00:00:31.960> question

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
than the offenses there's no question

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.160 
than the offenses there's no question
and<00:00:32.739> I<00:00:33.670> think<00:00:33.699> our<00:00:34.089> defense<00:00:34.269> took<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:34.929> step

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
and I think our defense took a step

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.229 
and I think our defense took a step
today<00:00:35.409> I<00:00:35.589> think<00:00:35.979> they<00:00:36.100> played<00:00:36.370> with<00:00:36.579> the<00:00:36.850> good

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
today I think they played with the good

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.959 
today I think they played with the good
effort<00:00:37.629> I<00:00:37.870> thought<00:00:38.710> we<00:00:39.399> did<00:00:39.579> a<00:00:39.609> lot<00:00:39.789> of<00:00:39.850> good

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
effort I thought we did a lot of good

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.049 
effort I thought we did a lot of good
things<00:00:40.359> on<00:00:40.659> defense<00:00:40.899> i<00:00:41.409> think<00:00:41.789> you<00:00:42.789> know<00:00:42.819> we'll

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
things on defense i think you know we'll

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.759 
things on defense i think you know we'll
go<00:00:43.210> back<00:00:43.389> and<00:00:43.659> look<00:00:43.749> at<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.079> film<00:00:44.319> and<00:00:44.530> find

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
go back and look at the film and find

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.579 
go back and look at the film and find
ways<00:00:44.979> to<00:00:45.280> play<00:00:46.239> more<00:00:46.479> completely<00:00:46.989> improve

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
ways to play more completely improve

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.160 
ways to play more completely improve
there's<00:00:47.889> no<00:00:48.069> question<00:00:48.639> I<00:00:48.789> thought<00:00:49.749> we<00:00:49.989> were

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
there's no question I thought we were

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.639 
there's no question I thought we were
pretty<00:00:50.379> disjointed<00:00:51.100> on<00:00:51.249> offense<00:00:51.789> i<00:00:51.999> think<00:00:52.649> you

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
pretty disjointed on offense i think you

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.770 
pretty disjointed on offense i think you
know<00:00:53.679> when<00:00:54.100> we<00:00:54.219> faced<00:00:54.519> adversity<00:00:55.089> I<00:00:55.329> thought

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
know when we faced adversity I thought

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.379 
know when we faced adversity I thought
Oregon<00:00:56.199> State's<00:00:56.499> defense<00:00:57.010> was<00:00:57.190> was<00:00:57.639> more

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:58.389 
Oregon State's defense was was more

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:00.479 
Oregon State's defense was was more
physical<00:00:59.019> than<00:00:59.049> our<00:00:59.350> offense<00:00:59.859> you<00:01:00.249> know<00:01:00.339> we

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
physical than our offense you know we

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:01.949 
physical than our offense you know we
had<00:01:00.579> too<00:01:00.760> many<00:01:00.850> guys<00:01:01.089> getting<00:01:01.479> slung<00:01:01.809> around

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:01.959 
had too many guys getting slung around

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:05.910 
had too many guys getting slung around
and<00:01:02.529> then<00:01:03.369> when<00:01:03.639> that<00:01:03.819> happened<00:01:04.770> rather<00:01:05.770> than

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
and then when that happened rather than

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.340 
and then when that happened rather than
rely<00:01:06.219> on<00:01:06.280> our<00:01:06.490> technique<00:01:07.149> it<00:01:07.390> became<00:01:07.780> a<00:01:07.810> series

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
rely on our technique it became a series

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.649 
rely on our technique it became a series
of<00:01:08.380> street<00:01:08.859> ball<00:01:08.890> you<00:01:09.609> know<00:01:09.729> I<00:01:09.789> thought<00:01:10.060> we<00:01:10.210> we

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
of street ball you know I thought we we

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.240 
of street ball you know I thought we we
spent<00:01:10.990> most<00:01:11.140> of<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.380> day<00:01:11.469> playing<00:01:11.859> street

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
spent most of the day playing street

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.639 
spent most of the day playing street
ball<00:01:12.310> on<00:01:12.700> offense<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.990> know<00:01:14.020> our<00:01:14.170> effort<00:01:14.530> was

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
ball on offense you know our effort was

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.980 
ball on offense you know our effort was
there<00:01:14.859> are<00:01:15.219> guys<00:01:15.430> you<00:01:15.729> know<00:01:15.869> grinding<00:01:16.869> away

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
there are guys you know grinding away

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.440 
there are guys you know grinding away
running<00:01:17.619> hard<00:01:17.950> trying<00:01:18.429> hard<00:01:18.850> and<00:01:19.119> all<00:01:19.210> that

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
running hard trying hard and all that

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.569 
running hard trying hard and all that
type<00:01:19.689> of<00:01:19.719> thing<00:01:20.079> over<00:01:20.500> trying<00:01:20.770> if<00:01:21.009> anything

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
type of thing over trying if anything

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.410 
type of thing over trying if anything
and<00:01:21.939> then<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:22.810> thought<00:01:23.170> that<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:24.670> resorted<00:01:25.299> the

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
and then I thought that we resorted the

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.690 
and then I thought that we resorted the
street<00:01:25.780> ball<00:01:25.990> rather<00:01:26.259> than<00:01:26.409> just<00:01:26.649> you<00:01:26.950> know<00:01:27.070> do

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
street ball rather than just you know do

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.550 
street ball rather than just you know do
routine<00:01:28.210> things<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:28.810> you<00:01:28.929> practice<00:01:29.140> all<00:01:29.500> the

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
routine things that you practice all the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.760 
routine things that you practice all the
time<00:01:29.829> that<00:01:30.039> you<00:01:30.070> pattern<00:01:30.520> all<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.789> time<00:01:31.770> then

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
time that you pattern all the time then

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.700 
time that you pattern all the time then
really<00:01:33.159> I<00:01:33.189> think<00:01:33.280> both<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:34.090> defense<00:01:34.990> has<00:01:35.499> got

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
really I think both the defense has got

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.800 
really I think both the defense has got
both<00:01:35.920> offenses<00:01:36.700> out<00:01:36.850> of<00:01:36.999> their<00:01:37.119> rhythm<00:01:37.570> but

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
both offenses out of their rhythm but

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.719 
both offenses out of their rhythm but
and<00:01:38.259> then<00:01:38.409> of<00:01:38.560> course<00:01:38.619> Oregon<00:01:39.219> State<00:01:39.460> did<00:01:39.640> a

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
and then of course Oregon State did a

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.709 
and then of course Oregon State did a
better<00:01:39.909> job<00:01:39.999> of<00:01:40.270> that<00:01:40.509> then<00:01:41.909> then<00:01:42.909> that<00:01:43.270> we<00:01:43.450> did

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
better job of that then then that we did

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.880 
better job of that then then that we did
and<00:01:43.899> then<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.460> then<00:01:45.670> offensively<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.799> know

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
and then and then offensively you know

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.800 
and then and then offensively you know
just<00:01:48.159> became<00:01:48.549> a<00:01:48.609> series<00:01:49.030> of<00:01:49.060> errors<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.689> know

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
just became a series of errors you know

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.099 
just became a series of errors you know
yet<00:01:50.850> we're<00:01:51.850> getting<00:01:52.030> beat<00:01:52.359> up<00:01:52.390> front<00:01:52.899> because

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
yet we're getting beat up front because

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.279 
yet we're getting beat up front because
they're<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:54.609> Oregon<00:01:55.539> State<00:01:55.780> defensive

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
they're the Oregon State defensive

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.149 
they're the Oregon State defensive
fronts<00:01:56.560> more<00:01:56.740> physical<00:01:57.280> than<00:01:57.310> we<00:01:57.609> are<00:01:57.639> and<00:01:59.159> so

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
fronts more physical than we are and so

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.989 
fronts more physical than we are and so
you<00:02:00.549> know<00:02:00.810> quarterback<00:02:01.810> goes<00:02:02.049> back<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.520> he's

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:03.999 
you know quarterback goes back and he's

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:07.139 
you know quarterback goes back and he's
on<00:02:04.179> is<00:02:04.359> a<00:02:04.950> first-rate<00:02:05.950> maybe<00:02:06.280> can't<00:02:06.639> go<00:02:06.789> beyond

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
on is a first-rate maybe can't go beyond

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.649 
on is a first-rate maybe can't go beyond
it<00:02:07.299> because

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
it because

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.570 
it because
time<00:02:07.869> or<00:02:08.140> maybe<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.530> receiver<00:02:08.920> gets<00:02:09.129> jammed

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
time or maybe the receiver gets jammed

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.020 
time or maybe the receiver gets jammed
up<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.650> think<00:02:11.890> our<00:02:12.040> receivers<00:02:12.550> definitely

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
up and I think our receivers definitely

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.930 
up and I think our receivers definitely
need<00:02:13.239> to<00:02:13.360> be<00:02:13.510> more<00:02:13.690> physical<00:02:14.379> and<00:02:15.250> then<00:02:17.099> we<00:02:18.099> and

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
need to be more physical and then we and

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.990 
need to be more physical and then we and
then<00:02:19.000> about<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.080> time<00:02:20.110> he's<00:02:20.620> got<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.730> time<00:02:21.970> to

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
then about the time he's got the time to

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.259 
then about the time he's got the time to
read<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.480> field<00:02:23.400> we're<00:02:24.400> not<00:02:24.549> able<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.940> do<00:02:25.060> that

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
read the field we're not able to do that

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.720 
read the field we're not able to do that
because<00:02:25.480> he's<00:02:25.750> been<00:02:26.019> had<00:02:26.860> people<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.370> his<00:02:27.519> lap

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
because he's been had people in his lap

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.170 
because he's been had people in his lap
the<00:02:27.760> last<00:02:28.209> four<00:02:28.900> or<00:02:29.019> five<00:02:29.049> plays<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.180> doesn't

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
the last four or five plays and doesn't

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.020 
the last four or five plays and doesn't
trust<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.629> go<00:02:31.780> on<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.319> then<00:02:32.790> then<00:02:33.790> there's

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
trust it to go on and then then there's

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.910 
trust it to go on and then then there's
guys<00:02:34.239> trying<00:02:34.569> to<00:02:34.660> make<00:02:34.780> too<00:02:34.959> much<00:02:35.110> happen<00:02:35.709> and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
guys trying to make too much happen and

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.830 
guys trying to make too much happen and
then<00:02:36.040> once<00:02:36.250> we<00:02:36.459> make<00:02:36.849> too<00:02:37.030> much<00:02:37.180> happen<00:02:37.690> that

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
then once we make too much happen that

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.140 
then once we make too much happen that
leads<00:02:38.049> to<00:02:38.290> errors<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.400> know<00:02:39.519> as<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.700> series

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
leads to errors and you know as a series

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.559 
leads to errors and you know as a series
of<00:02:40.180> over<00:02:40.510> Corrections<00:02:41.110> throughout<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.560> game

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
of over Corrections throughout the game

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.990 
of over Corrections throughout the game
was<00:02:43.569> my<00:02:43.840> decision<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.769> bring<00:02:44.980> Connor<00:02:45.430> back<00:02:45.730> in

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
was my decision to bring Connor back in

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.470 
was my decision to bring Connor back in
after<00:02:49.260> he<00:02:50.260> died<00:02:50.970> because<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.090> thought<00:02:52.299> he'd

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
after he died because I thought he'd

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.990 
after he died because I thought he'd
settle<00:02:52.840> down<00:02:53.019> he<00:02:53.560> practiced<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.280> lot<00:02:54.459> he'd<00:02:54.760> look

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
settle down he practiced a lot he'd look

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.240 
settle down he practiced a lot he'd look
good<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.299> practice<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:56.019> thought<00:02:56.709> he'd<00:02:56.860> settled

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
good to practice I thought he'd settled

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.819 
good to practice I thought he'd settled
down<00:02:57.430> and<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:01.150> know<00:03:01.359> and<00:03:01.510> then<00:03:02.049> he<00:03:02.200> do<00:03:02.530> he's

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
down and you know and then he do he's

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.229 
down and you know and then he do he's
going<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.069> be<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.190> great<00:03:03.400> player<00:03:03.670> but<00:03:03.700> he<00:03:04.060> wasn't

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
going to be a great player but he wasn't

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.890 
going to be a great player but he wasn't
settled<00:03:04.660> down<00:03:04.780> this<00:03:05.049> game<00:03:09.510> now<00:03:10.510> we're<00:03:10.780> going

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
settled down this game now we're going

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.870 
settled down this game now we're going
to<00:03:10.959> look<00:03:11.019> at<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.319> film<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.829> talk<00:03:12.519> about<00:03:12.700> I

to look at the film and talk about I

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.670 
to look at the film and talk about I
thought<00:03:13.209> Jeff<00:03:13.480> did<00:03:13.690> some<00:03:13.900> good<00:03:14.019> things<00:03:14.079> you

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
thought Jeff did some good things you

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.190 
thought Jeff did some good things you
know<00:03:14.799> Connor<00:03:15.760> got<00:03:16.000> intercepted<00:03:16.480> Jeff<00:03:16.959> got

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
know Connor got intercepted Jeff got

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.879 
know Connor got intercepted Jeff got
sacked<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.950> know<00:03:18.069> so<00:03:18.569> you<00:03:19.569> know<00:03:20.470> we<00:03:20.590> need<00:03:20.769> to

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
either way we need to improve both of

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.420 
either way we need to improve both of
them<00:03:26.609> in<00:03:27.609> yes<00:03:27.910> or<00:03:28.090> no<00:03:28.299> like<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:30.160> don't

veteran<00:05:00.110> now<00:05:00.650> I<00:05:00.680> think<00:05:00.979> our<00:05:01.669> freshmen<00:05:02.300> are

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
veteran now I think our freshmen are

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.930 
veteran now I think our freshmen are
better<00:05:02.690> than<00:05:02.930> we<00:05:03.139> expected<00:05:03.550> you<00:05:04.550> know<00:05:04.669> because

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
better than we expected you know because

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.469 
better than we expected you know because
we<00:05:05.090> have<00:05:06.550> my<00:05:07.550> lost<00:05:07.820> count<00:05:08.210> we<00:05:08.450> have<00:05:08.570> 11<00:05:08.900> or<00:05:09.200> so

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
we have my lost count we have 11 or so

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.900 
we have my lost count we have 11 or so
that<00:05:11.479> played<00:05:11.750> significant<00:05:12.500> roles<00:05:12.560> today<00:05:13.010> so<00:05:13.880> I

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
that played significant roles today so I

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.600 
that played significant roles today so I
i<00:05:14.539> think<00:05:15.410> our<00:05:15.560> freshmen<00:05:16.100> are<00:05:16.220> better<00:05:16.430> than

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
i think our freshmen are better than

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.760 
i think our freshmen are better than

expected I didn't expect to start quite

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.920 
expected I didn't expect to start quite
as<00:05:19.220> many<00:05:19.430> of<00:05:19.700> them<00:05:19.910> and<00:05:20.120> then<00:05:21.970> now<00:05:22.970> you<00:05:23.780> know
