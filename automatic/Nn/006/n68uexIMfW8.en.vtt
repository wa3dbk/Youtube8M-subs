and I think we just had our just a pinch

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.429 
and I think we just had our just a pinch
of<00:01:04.850> salt<00:01:05.119> just<00:01:05.660> for<00:01:05.869> that<00:01:06.369> taste<00:01:07.960> so<00:01:08.960> once<00:01:09.260> you

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
of salt just for that taste so once you

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:10.990 
of salt just for that taste so once you
cut<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:09.799> avocado<00:01:10.159> this<00:01:10.369> is<00:01:10.520> how<00:01:10.640> it<00:01:10.790> looks

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
cut the avocado this is how it looks

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.800 
cut the avocado this is how it looks
like<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:11.360> has<00:01:11.570> a<00:01:11.600> seed<00:01:12.140> that's<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:14.240> size<00:01:14.479> of<00:01:14.659> a

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
like it has a seed that's the size of a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.830 
like it has a seed that's the size of a
lemon<00:01:15.430> it<00:01:16.430> looks<00:01:16.700> like<00:01:16.909> a<00:01:16.939> planet<00:01:17.510> right<00:01:17.810> now

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
lemon it looks like a planet right now

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.859 
lemon it looks like a planet right now
right<00:01:18.260> like<00:01:18.439> a<00:01:18.500> Saturn<00:01:19.010> ring<00:01:19.310> or<00:01:19.520> something<00:01:19.970> so

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
right like a Saturn ring or something so

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.270 
right like a Saturn ring or something so
