 and here we see how here 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.019
 here's the music we push it 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.529
 we do not choose let any music 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:04.639
 songs 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.580
 I do not care what the left bank 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.580
 naked to hear how it sounds 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.270

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.270
 sounds very good 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.639
 But now let's see 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.189
 bad the fact that the sound of anyone is as good as 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.169
 okrugu for the night and in the morning I'm fine 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.169
 just look at the sky

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.880
 there is a bad thing 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:06.270
 the fact is that the wife 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.940

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.819
 far enough 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.089
