00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.330
 earning money can be a hint and more 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.189

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.750
 it was cool 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.230
 and nothing better than to start with the magic 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.970

 all the pictures that I can do the 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.870
 that I know the normal time I 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.900
 I promise, it's okay that you know me, you know. 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.090
 I make these marks is in person but 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.890
 I'll start shuffling in three ways. 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.160
 first in the Brazilian way that 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.989
 brazilian beauty guy 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.989
 after the American Egypt, which is a bit 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:25.960
 more pee is like this the third way but 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:29.370
 It is the Portuguese way that so every coin 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.370
 in each h 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.640
 now that you've seen a video of us when 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.280
 More scrambled I'll show again 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.229
 all the letters here I will choose 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.229
 either one of them either does 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:46.270
 Come on in the middle, it was easier. 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.680
 good serve canopy zip beautiful 7 ie 17 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.149
 beautiful I do not know 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:55.540
 Finally I'll write ps what I'm going 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.850
 make points and risks 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.789
 the house is well marked and you know 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.429
 that this is a totally unique letter 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.130
 beauty is like having another guy like 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.960
 quiet and do not sign it will last 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.360
 to be able to compare and I'll leave this 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.820
 house here in the middle of the deck 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.400
 in the middle I'll show you that it's not the 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.420
 first and coolest every time your 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.610
 fingers 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:24.340
 the card goes up a new eleven 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.950
 slowly slow motion at last slowly 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.170
 even roll seven of hearts 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.010
 in the middle of the deck one more down and 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.250
 so slowly so easy, so it's my house 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.780
 She goes up again, it's just not cool, I 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.549
 I like to close the tags with 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.769
 gold in a very fucking way I think I will 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.690
 leave this letter here in the middle of 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.030
 I will show that she is not 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.090
 useful here and also that it is not the 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.100
 first is 14 of hearts when in the team 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.780
 It's just as easy to pick up room and 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.780
 rock gypsy that's cool 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:00.930
 the world bitch is watching her win 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.930
 a set of hearts that decision 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.230
 And then, let's go there, the part will do it. 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.100
 a series of money that is better part of the 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.180
 video I think at least it 's e 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.860
 I always researched a lot about the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.290
 players always divide you many 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.600
 graphics to see who was very good had 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.980
 was above average at last 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.080
 At first I thought that who was above 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.850
 of the average that was ahead 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.140
 today I do not think today I think who 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:49.240
 above the average that has a graph 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:50.890
 Constant constant use can lead to 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.580
 bit how real you work 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.250
 here it has no it can not be different 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.750
 constant and he can count on the day 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.310
 end of the month and has an income almost 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.709
 Just imagine this one has a 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.590
 fixed income is already talking in the en 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.600
 chelsea arrived or after a long time 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.300
 I think a lot of studying and I discovered two 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.860
 players only two players is that I 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.870
 I think they are very good 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.310
 the two are gringos but there is a lot 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.410
 good for several reasons 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.010
 it's one of them because he hurts them above the 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.990
 average another day because the chart it 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.460
 seems to have no validity and finally 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.680
 players who never stayed long 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.750
 if you lose without money, the newspaper is 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.000
 a year ago with no money for me in the game 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.130
 update the updated registration 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.169
 So, who are these players? 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.180
 network that, in my opinion, is a 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.270
 of the best players in the world and already 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.550
 Bra each look, the guy is already done today. 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.540
 Moored even better than rivers 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.210
 but I did not have the opportunity to 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.740
 talk with him measures like the idea 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.750
 different from the team that already knew a 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.700
 little about him I talked to him saw the 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.550
 play it as he thinks 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.169
 anyway because I think it's logical in my 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.950
 opinion of these two players are so 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.840
 differentiated but so differentiated 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.979
 because they take too much because they just 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.870
 have value 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:09.030
 no this has a lot of good player who knows 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:12.640
 do it already the total for granddaughter game 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.260
 he does not play practically a hand without 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.979
 look at an assistant without knowing how she 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.520
 play 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.600
 I'll give an example has two expensive sites 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.880
 in the left thigh 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.100
 Can you give me kings at last, competitor? 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.650
 gigantic he has two aggressive faces 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.420
 You have to choose the range better. 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.240
 beauty and that sometimes we do such 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.650
 he does not go beyond always making every hand 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.630
 who is playing against a player is 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.660
 analyzing assistants ie he plays 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.940
 for granddaughter he was able to create a 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.990
 game that is exploitable against almost everyone 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.700
 the players 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.500
 or is able to make money on top 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.540
 from the world of the field 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.990
 I wanted so much money he did not play a 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.700
 automatic abc game of a game focused on 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.190
 every opponent who is playing against 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.110
 that is, he does not do anything out of 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.450
 because it is all based on one 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.580
 very detailed mathematics that is 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.740
 inside the head of that guy 's face is 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.780
 a genius in my opinion and not in 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.060
 landscapes the way he does not want 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.740
 it is worth to him the status of everybody 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.630
 from the same store that exists 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.430
 table and see if the galley is aggressive and 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.210
 galley is not similar in low goes 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.210
 to cheer 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.730
 He is a very intelligent guy and he is 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.910
 That's why I think in my opinion. 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.800
 that guy is so good for goal game 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.210
 moment and this is the first tip that I 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.920
 I'm giving it here today. 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.200
 play more promise game since more 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.360
 resistant already in the exploitable game 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.560
 explore players history throughout 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.810
 world that is on the table 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.760
 it's not because the movie has 200 players 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.780
 which is only making money from 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.810
 bad players 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.700
 if you think well and analyze well 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.040
 in some way or another you 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.990
 would get even the good players 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.910
 This will increase the thug will make you 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:53.670
 make more money and everything in the long term will 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:58.120
 be a wonderful beautiful thing 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:07:00.400
 so this is it guys ah ah ah and what 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.740
 returns on investment by 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.520
 example having a guy who won 500 grand 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.670
 dollars 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:10.780

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.510
 the guy that the 200 dollars who plays 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.370
