catalyst to trigger the ability so they

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.270 
catalyst to trigger the ability so they
need<00:05:33.510> one<00:05:33.720> such<00:05:34.170> as<00:05:34.380> whatever<00:05:34.560> is<00:05:34.800> found<00:05:35.040> in

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
stealth boys to trigger it well that's
