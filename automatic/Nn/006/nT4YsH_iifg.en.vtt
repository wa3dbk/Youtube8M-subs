00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 now let's work the stop in two 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.649
 times the stop in two times or 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.559
 step stops now as the word 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.049
 says we stopped with one foot first and then 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.230
 the other as we execute it we execute it 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.340
 first of all small children are 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.189
 we will explain what it is like when 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.359
 juanes against the English hideaway 'a 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.330
 scene comments english 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.750
 and I stand up is to say is a normal step is 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.519
 a short step that makes us lose the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.500
 balance if we open our legs a lot 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.710
 we will lose the balance then 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.980
 we carry the shoulder against the knee 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.640
 advanced 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.130
 that means that in addition to stopping us 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.360
 worth as a weekend towards the opposite for 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.280
 that believe that we are going to continue that 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.280
 address and then we take the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.199
 determination we create convenient 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.059
 once we have stopped in two times 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.610
 we can only tax on the foot 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.820
 backward is the foot that we have posed in 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.410
 the floor we are first talking about when 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.620
 we have a ball when we do not have a ball 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.150
 we can equip on the gdp and we want 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.680
 this so that it is used is used to 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.720
 the reception farms in many 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.720
 occasions cargo body weight 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.359
 I put against the roller 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.179
 front view is not balance me not 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:21.270
 under the eyes of bucket what now 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.710
 we will see how pÃ­vot masters from that 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.470
 position 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.020
 we are in the same situation and then 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.820
 Now you can only pivot your profile 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.820
 back when we go back 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.090
 let's achieve 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.790
 we recover the option back we're going 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.450
 go ahead and we are ready to 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.710
 it is not always epidemic 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.689
 if we learn from those stops we will win 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.280
 position in the initiation farms that 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.030
 we will give in the editing fields with 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.049
 value and in any other situation 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.429
 including the output tape that 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.480
 we will learn from the stop in two 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.820
 time 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.720
 from there we can pivot on the 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.020
 past 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.850
 we can lift the weight by following 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.390
 flexed but always collective 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.720
 televised 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.819
 I only know when I'm going to stop is a 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.360
 tenth of a second that I have the advantage 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.360
 on the contrary 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.470
 to another 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.360
 behind 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.319
 to be able to rectify and overcome the 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.859
 Bolivian 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.859
 ah 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.740
 I'm sorry interesting forward 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.850
 Y 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.670
 also and for her 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.670
 more tours I stop 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.219
 one leg with the other 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.629
 yes
