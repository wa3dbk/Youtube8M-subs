 people in Lugansk continue but 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.759
 the Ukrainian media are already Western reporters 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.560
 working at the scene in open 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.990

 administration he but the rest spice you 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.920
 I was around 3 o'clock in the afternoon yesterday 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.809
 8 civilians struck at the building 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.590
 among them five women died and three 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.140
 the men 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.149
 Kiev authorities insisted that this 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.129
 there was a mistake of the locals and that with 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.899
 one of the missiles crashed as 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.739
 began to attack flying in the sky 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:58.140
 the plane she went through the building has about 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.210
 this peaks today were there in the square 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.090
 with an expert on military weapons and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.339
 obviously it was otherwise otherwise by us 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.860
 what he saw indicated that the blow 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.229
 the aircraft was inflicted on social networks 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.780
 and write to which shortly before hitting 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.909
 the sky you can watch the plane judging by 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.640
 the way the trees are cut , you can see that 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.350
 the projectile flew light throughout the area 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.360
 there were several funnels which 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.670
 formed a line going towards 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.009
 municipal building and it talks about 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.759
 that the fire was opened from the grave where 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.759

 Naturally committee Russia today was 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.040
 created a management that will deal with

 war crimes investigation 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.490
 committed on the territory of Ukraine 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.320
 evidence of these crimes 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.150
 may be found in military units 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.820
 which came under control today 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.979
 Militia Lugansk command of one 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.899

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.470
 multiple glass attacks chaotically 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.140
 scattered things are all that's left 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.910
 partly choosing the right moment personal 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.190
 the composition of the frontier guard today is just 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.420
 fled exactly three days in Lugansk 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.940
 the militia tried to take by storm 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.840
 last center of resistance 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.670
 border guards have repeatedly asked 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.440
 military support from Kiev but received 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.510
 answers whose general meaning came down to 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.990
 Do not expect a phrase for help. 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.660
 only on themselves big captivity or very 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.040
 tight fire this is the result today in 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:33.640
 one o'clock in the morning night did not know the sieve went and 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.400

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.470
 all let go spoiled anyone at home 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.140
 not attached or so here they are left 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.670
 weapons how much fate passes under 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.350
 which town on this topic 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.570
 now at the disposal of self-defense forces 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.970
 new small arms and ammunition and 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.770
 appliances a few hours earlier in 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.930
 similar situation turned out to be internal 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.330
 troops of the Ukrainian police in the part number 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.010
 30-35 offer militia folded 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.290
 weapon and not starting firing to go their separate ways 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.480
 was rejected instead because of the walls 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.520
 earned heavy machine guns even manual 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.010
 grenade launchers made three attempts 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.110
 storming by morning it turned out shooting lead 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.180
 only several officers and contractors 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.459
 hundreds of conscripts they just locked in 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.110
 the barracks lasted a few hours 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.150
 this fight was hottest here in 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.160
 there are used convoys 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.230
 automotive we are as trenches and 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.980
 only after all ended 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.770
 cartridges 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.830
 they disabled the weapon and set it on fire 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.959
 its entire part area is literally littered with 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.360
 3 or other cartridge shells are not police 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.130
 regretted it was a real lead stream in 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.110
 the dark Ukrainian military shot at 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.150
 all suspicious so shoot back 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.070
 only desperate and frightened people 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.959
 in the morning it turned out that they themselves were shooting at 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.850
 the walls themselves have retained their characteristic 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.040
 bullet holes during battles 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.239
 militia destroyed one btr 2 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.489

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.530
 about the method mobilized Kiev authorities 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.120
 he didnâ€™t want to let off steam 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.400
 only the army could free him 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.959
 southeast at the beginning of the militia carried 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.819
 the weapons then opened the gate for 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.500
 conscripts already in civilian clothes not silently 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.539
 answering questions they went their separate ways 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.130
 the streets and dissolved in the city will there be 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.989
 remember this night as well as the residents 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.910
 the nearest ones are the parts of the houses that 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.240
 forced to hide from crazy 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.190
 bullets 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.560

 lying on the floor 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.039
 it was the very first bullet that 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.110

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:44.280
 this is where the bullet came in 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.740
 Zhovtnevoe could not assume that this 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.960
 at night the front line will pass through their quiet 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.120
