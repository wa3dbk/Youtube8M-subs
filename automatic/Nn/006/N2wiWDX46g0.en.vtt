00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello to a new tutorials one 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.500
 I would like to test again today 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.139
 the microphones or at least that 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.660
 microphone and this rise microphone 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.570
 We were able to test the network again 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.410
 I can ask my microphone directly 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.210
 Plug in the computer 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.619
 most say no then come because of that 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.750
 ask yes why 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.300
 there is a lay in and that 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.610
 would have to go I want you today 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.790
 let's see what happens or of course 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.930
 but it is what consequences it has 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.000
 as well as the quality of the tone 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.160
 then that's what I want today 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.690
 Simply show times currently, take 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.110
 I know today with my world here 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:55.280
 on top of that is a logitech g25 that takes 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.020
 hd on so the full hd or hd at least 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.449
 and I take that sound too 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.270
 Instantly look around for less 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.720
 stopper and then different 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.020
 try out what I can 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.460
 my beloved is going to try 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.360
 hartz iv this is still here 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.310
 show it around properly 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:23.549
 the zoom h2n that has a synonymous 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.159
 audio interface function and the other 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:31.759
 what I show you who the city is short 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:35.640
 this is in the audio audio interface 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.369
 or prix I'll give it a try 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.500
 I'll also both pieces with 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.659
 different adapters or the bread 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.909
 need not a adapter that has to 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.229
 excel connection well then we'll see each other 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.020
 right now I'll stop once 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:54.360
 short the recording and plug once the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:58.439
 audio devices to have it alright now 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.310
 I here the microphone here at my 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.930
 sweater on it and that's right 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.930
 in the computer so in the laity 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.629
 input of the computer and not over 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.690
 any car interface becomes the sound 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:15.650
 certainly not be special 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.330
 because that is always reported 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.550
 I will now directly times 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.860
 try with the npd 2 the saving 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.420
 2 which also directly into the computer in 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.210
 the laien entrance will connect 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.450
 let's see what comes out of it 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.060
 now have the wheel ntg 2 too 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.500
 connected directly to the computer and 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.030
 just now take the sound with it 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.800
 certainly not the sound here 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.180
 be exhilarating probably something 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.670
 better than with the lavallee microphone 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.640
 Nevertheless, I think good is something else 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.180
 ok I will try now 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.860
 how the sound is when I h2n the zoom 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:04.640
 as an audio interface I use 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.970
 now the microphone to the or the 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.090
 zoom h2n connected this one is 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.370
 then with a usb cable with the 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.110
 computer and now serves as 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:20.690
 audio interface what you are in 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.680
 background noise is unfortunately my 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.570
 computer that is stupidly very loud 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.930
 the ventilation noise would be the 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.940
 Fan noise is very loud that is 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.709
 on the one hand on the graphics card to one 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.530
 to the other fans that's just now 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.850
 a relatively large computer and me 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.239
 have not made it so far 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.800
 somehow unfortunately to get but well 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.870
 in addition it is natural that way 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.400
 a lavallee microphone he has such a ball 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.800
 characteristic and therefore natural 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:54.140
 everything in the circle takes up 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.110
 that's a bit of a shotgun microphone 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.360
 different then but see it soon 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.870
 because I'm going to the red one now 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.100
 Two will change 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:09.950
 flying change now the red ntg 2 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:14.540
 also on zoom h2n which as audio 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.700
 interface serves the red ntg 2 has is yes 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.049
 a directional microphone should be so now 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.930
 my computer noise is not so 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.539
 pick up the ball as it's lovely 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.190
 but I will 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.270
 Probably listen to me right now 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:34.250
 is it different again? 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:37.229
 and now the last test the red ntg 2 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.720
 mm audio mobile pre directly on the computer 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:43.259
 connected only with prix serves as 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.509
 audio interface the la wally microphone 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.789
 I have omitted that you will 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:50.479
 already thought the lovely 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.639
 of course microphone needs plugin power 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.770
 the mobile pre can not plugin power 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.080
 but deliver it delivers phantom 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.759
 power which in the g2 of course 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.690
 also can process respectively 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:06.830
 also needed yes i hope i could 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.930
 to help you a little with the 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.300
 I can ask a microphone directly on the 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.449
 computer or not me 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.000
 think the individual tests have shown 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.770
 that the sound quality is directly at the computer 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.289
 So right on the line in input 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.759
 certainly not so intoxicating 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.800
 So you either need an audio 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:30.770
 interface what is between the microphone 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:34.979
 and the computer is yes or you go 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:37.919
 the complicated way and take that 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:40.130
 microphone signal is extra on and mixes 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.990
 then in post-processing 1 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.389
 I think that is for me at least 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.620
 the one passable way 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:51.330
 but also the processing of the microphone 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.310
 over the audio interface is not like that 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.729
 bad but good that is 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.669
 taste thing as always good then say 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.020
 First of all, thanks for seeing and me 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:05.270
 I hope I could help too 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.270
 and say goodbye until then
