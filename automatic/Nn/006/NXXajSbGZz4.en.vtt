00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.200
 so next next stage next 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.190
 arrow preparation stage 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.349
 this shooting with two hands exist 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.160
 different points of view about the style 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.230
 fast district 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.150
 Some experts say that 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.890
 need to take here is a combat 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.019
 position some specialists tend 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.640
 talk about what needs to be taken 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.489
 lateral position to arm 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:39.360
 which is that the gun was 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:41.690
 as if closer to the goal exists . ancient 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.520
 according to which is taken 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.090
 left-sided so much if you shoot 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.000
 right hand while right in some 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.149
 repent straightened 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.610
 Alenka supports supports 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.530
 a gun in such a way that he was 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:05.690
 more stable and have a shooter to 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.690
 possibility of vritar making shots 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.960
 sintering 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.090
 a weapon that is aimed at a target of course 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.439
 this can be achieved only when 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.460
 pistol 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.530
 powerfully griped one more one 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.290
 important position and so 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.000
 of these three points of view i am inclined 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.509
 stick here is the settlement when 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.329
 pistol 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.430
 It is here on this here about this 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.680
 here in this building 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.380
 letting down the gun may be well 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.320
 may be on top depending again 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.880
 from specific 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.909
 This position in my opinion is 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.150
 the most optimal for shooting from two 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.229
 hands 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:01.590
 although of course the combat situation may be 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:04.000
 different and here some kind of dogma or 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.670
 this position when you need to stick 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.399
 only that rule can not be so 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.770
 I think that here we emphasize again 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.740
 Here it is disgusting and martial law is 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.140
 League 2 and the opposite as well, Kaki still here 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.780
 these are in the left-sided rack but 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.520
 least right book tally straight 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.590
 first to support weapons bug 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.560
 fairly common palette are you 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:34.020
 two-handed some beginner arrows 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.760
 take the gun in this way 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.150
 when fired when the bolt moves 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.680
 frame need 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.019
 naturally thumb 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.290
 opposite hand as a rule 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.400
 get injured very seriously because 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.820
 Makarov pistol like any other 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.590
 military weapons have great power 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.390
 so by no means does the gun 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.130
 need to keep that way you 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.850
 put yourself in danger 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:05.190
 need to keep and become that way 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.470
 to hold your left hand fingers 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:13.290
 fingers squeezing hijack and big 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:16.480
 finger did not interfere with work did not interfere with work 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.570
 right thumb which is on 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:25.000
 the trigger of that arm is such that 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:27.130
 there were no some specialists 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.250
 take in hand in this position when 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.460
 big 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.550
 in his hand index finger forgive 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:39.560
 when the index finger of his left hand 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:42.230
 forward to the gun for the trigger guard 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.820
 this is a bargain, not bad because firstly 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.820
 in this position there is no interference 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.820
 work 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:58.670
 right thumb and timoni exist 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:01.700
 less recoil since the angle just doesn't 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.340
 ask for less there is less angle 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.350
 throwing because you want it and not 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.680
 want your thumb and forefinger 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.660
 left hand pressed to the bracket and write 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.080
 fairly stable score but not 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:19.579
 less I personally advise taking a gun here 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.850
 to speak it for a start here it is this 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.000
 already 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.570
 this is bloody is the next stage 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.530
 shooting from two hands again you can 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.770
 hold a gun 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.140
 right hand left supporting 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.900
 you can hold a gun in your left hand 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.200
 and then you have 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.540
 right hand is supported 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.270
 manifests itself that is to be necessary again 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.810
 learn professional and keep it up 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:51.350
 a gun and so hold a gun 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.650
 when shooting from two hands as a rule when 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.620
 light is pursued primarily goal 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:02.030
 achieve a higher rate of fire 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:04.280
 that is, you can assume if you 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.640
 one hand for 3 seconds more 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.770
 set himself three or four times for three 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:17.419
 seconds being waterfalls 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:18.370
 8 times good professionals from the gun 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.280
 Makarov 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:28.629
 a half second shoots eight 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:34.129
 just holding the gun in both hands 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:37.759
 moderately so the next stage you learned 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:41.979
 shoot correctly in this position and 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:44.960
 and steadily enough to hit the target 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:48.159
 here it is necessary to make one small 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.840
 on the right if when shooting with one hand 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:54.259
 The main task of shooting is 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.150
 accurate hitting the target when shooting 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:57.430
 of the two groups with the so -called 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.539
 tempo shooting 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.240
 here plays a big role looking 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:05.030
 psychological effect that has 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.830
 quick Taliban opponent your task 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.430
 here it's not easy to get into exactly 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.610
 ten 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.740
 but generally hit the mark here 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.469
 a little bit task changing day task 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:24.289
 is to shoot than he is like 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:27.639
 can be in this position and by 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:33.520
 opportunities as accurately as possible inducing it 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:33.520
 that is, you see here a little problem 1
