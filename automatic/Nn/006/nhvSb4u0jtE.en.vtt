a<00:00:00.060> few<00:00:00.539> days<00:00:00.719> ago<00:00:00.780> someone<00:00:01.380> made<00:00:01.560> a<00:00:01.589> game

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
a few days ago someone made a game

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.230 
a few days ago someone made a game
called<00:00:01.939> 204<00:00:02.939> 8<00:00:03.179> or<00:00:03.799> 2048<00:00:04.799> in<00:00:05.430> it<00:00:05.609> you<00:00:05.850> use<00:00:06.089> your

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
called 204 8 or 2048 in it you use your

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.480 
called 204 8 or 2048 in it you use your
arrow<00:00:06.420> keys<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.779> move<00:00:06.990> these<00:00:07.350> dolls<00:00:07.710> so<00:00:08.340> when

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
arrow keys to move these dolls so when

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.520 
arrow keys to move these dolls so when
you<00:00:08.580> press<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.970> up<00:00:09.000> arrow<00:00:09.389> key<00:00:09.540> all<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.290> tiles

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
you press the up arrow key all the tiles

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.740 
you press the up arrow key all the tiles
will<00:00:10.800> move<00:00:11.010> up<00:00:11.280> when<00:00:11.969> two<00:00:12.150> tiles<00:00:12.420> with<00:00:12.630> the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
will move up when two tiles with the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.600 
will move up when two tiles with the
same<00:00:12.929> number<00:00:13.290> touch<00:00:13.530> each<00:00:13.710> other<00:00:14.040> they<00:00:14.429> will

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
same number touch each other they will

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.820 
same number touch each other they will
merge<00:00:14.820> into<00:00:15.030> one<00:00:15.150> bigger<00:00:15.660> number<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.800> is

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
merge into one bigger number and it is

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.599 
merge into one bigger number and it is
your<00:00:17.100> goal<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.580> get<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:18.170> 2048<00:00:19.170> tile<00:00:19.590> which<00:00:20.430> is

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
your goal to get to a 2048 tile which is

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.179 
your goal to get to a 2048 tile which is
really<00:00:20.880> hard<00:00:21.060> by<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.270> way<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:22.320> over<00:00:22.800> time<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
really hard by the way so over time the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.710 
really hard by the way so over time the
numbers<00:00:23.490> will<00:00:23.670> be<00:00:23.760> bigger<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.269> bigger<00:00:24.449> and

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
numbers will be bigger and bigger and

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.750 
numbers will be bigger and bigger and
you<00:00:25.109> need<00:00:25.260> more<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.740> more<00:00:25.890> space<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.490> get<00:00:26.640> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
you need more and more space to get to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.640 
you need more and more space to get to
the<00:00:26.880> biggest<00:00:27.150> number<00:00:27.449> thus<00:00:28.050> making<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.619> game

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the biggest number thus making the game

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.160 
the biggest number thus making the game
harder<00:00:29.220> over<00:00:29.429> time<00:00:29.820> if<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.599> want<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.840> play<00:00:30.990> it

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
harder over time if you want to play it

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.170 
harder over time if you want to play it

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
addictive Oh to make the explanation a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.160 
addictive Oh to make the explanation a
bit<00:01:15.119> more<00:01:15.330> understandable

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
bit more understandable

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.050 
bit more understandable
I'll<00:01:16.290> make<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.799> field<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.189> bit<00:01:17.369> smaller<00:01:17.759> so

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
I'll make the field a bit smaller so

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.330 
I'll make the field a bit smaller so
let's<00:01:18.570> say<00:01:18.720> there's<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.080> 2<00:01:19.320> over<00:01:19.650> here<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.310> 0

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
let's say there's a 2 over here and a 0

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.179 
let's say there's a 2 over here and a 0
over<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:21.000> when<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.900> press<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.979> shoot

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
over here when you press up the to shoot

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.370 
over here when you press up the to shoot
moves<00:01:23.490> up<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:24.119> when<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.659> isn't<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.170> zero

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
moves up but when this one isn't a zero

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.130 
moves up but when this one isn't a zero
let's<00:01:25.860> say<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.430> 4<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:26.909> example<00:01:27.140> nothing

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
let's say it's a 4 for example nothing

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.200 
let's say it's a 4 for example nothing
should<00:01:28.290> happen<00:01:28.369> however<00:01:29.369> when<00:01:29.850> these<00:01:29.970> numbers

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
should happen however when these numbers

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.080 
should happen however when these numbers
are<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.600> same<00:01:30.720> two<00:01:31.560> twos<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:32.189> example<00:01:32.640> they

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
are the same two twos for example they

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.450 
are the same two twos for example they
should<00:01:33.119> combine<00:01:33.689> into<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.020> four<00:01:34.439> now<00:01:35.250> we'll

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
should combine into a four now we'll

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.730 
should combine into a four now we'll
repeat<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:35.939> process<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.540> couple<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.930> times<00:01:37.140> we

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
repeat that process a couple of times we

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.590 
repeat that process a couple of times we
will<00:01:37.890> move<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.369> one<00:01:38.549> over<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.360> one

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
will move this one over here this one

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.499 
will move this one over here this one
over<00:01:40.140> here<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.040> over<00:01:41.340> here<00:01:41.490> now<00:01:42.450> we

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
over here and this one over here now we

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.420 
over here and this one over here now we
will<00:01:42.780> move<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.259> one<00:01:43.470> over<00:01:43.500> here<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.369> one

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
will move this one over here this one

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.120 
will move this one over here this one
over<00:01:44.700> here<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.390> last<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.170> will<00:01:46.470> move<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.950> one

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
over here and last we will move this one

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.999 
over here and last we will move this one
over<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.790> again<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.960> let's<00:01:49.530> see<00:01:49.710> how<00:01:49.799> that

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
over here again so let's see how that

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.160 
over here again so let's see how that
works<00:01:50.220> out<00:01:50.460> I've<00:01:50.610> got<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> 2<00:01:51.270> over<00:01:51.509> here<00:01:51.540> here

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
works out I've got a 2 over here here

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.730 
works out I've got a 2 over here here
and<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.799> we'll<00:01:53.340> do<00:01:53.490> those<00:01:53.640> 6<00:01:53.970> steps

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.490 

and<00:01:57.829> as<00:01:58.460> you<00:01:58.549> can<00:01:58.700> see<00:01:58.759> we<00:01:59.360> will<00:01:59.509> end<00:01:59.750> with<00:01:59.960> a<00:02:00.170> 4

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
and as you can see we will end with a 4

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.560 
and as you can see we will end with a 4
and<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:00.829> 2<00:02:00.860> just<00:02:01.610> like<00:02:01.790> in<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.060> original<00:02:02.180> game

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
and a 2 just like in the original game

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.230 
and a 2 just like in the original game
we'll<00:02:03.439> do<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:03.799> process<00:02:04.009> four<00:02:04.549> times<00:02:04.850> for

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
we'll do that process four times for

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.359 
we'll do that process four times for
every<00:02:05.600> row<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.110> we'll<00:02:06.560> do<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:06.979> four<00:02:07.340> times

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
every row and we'll do that four times

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.089 
every row and we'll do that four times
for<00:02:07.880> every<00:02:08.149> direction<00:02:08.509> but<00:02:09.380> first<00:02:09.770> we'll<00:02:09.950> take

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
for every direction but first we'll take

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.040 
for every direction but first we'll take
a<00:02:10.160> look<00:02:10.429> at<00:02:10.550> one<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.090> these<00:02:11.239> steps<00:02:11.540> because

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
a look at one of these steps because

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.259 
a look at one of these steps because
what<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.770> actually<00:02:13.130> going<00:02:13.310> on<00:02:13.550> over<00:02:13.910> here

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
what is actually going on over here

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.920 
what is actually going on over here
the<00:02:14.780> answer<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.370> squids<00:02:16.370> we<00:02:17.030> will<00:02:17.180> make<00:02:17.360> 16

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
the answer is squids we will make 16

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.020 
the answer is squids we will make 16
squids<00:02:18.440> each<00:02:18.709> with<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.190> different<00:02:19.430> name<00:02:19.819> and

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
squids each with a different name and

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.449 
squids each with a different name and
now<00:02:20.510> we<00:02:20.569> can<00:02:20.840> apply<00:02:20.870> scores<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.950> those<00:02:22.130> squids

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
now we can apply scores to those squids

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.030 
now we can apply scores to those squids
these<00:02:23.360> are<00:02:23.630> just<00:02:24.019> a<00:02:24.170> few<00:02:24.200> command<00:02:24.650> books<00:02:24.860> that

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
these are just a few command books that

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.620 
these are just a few command books that
are<00:02:25.160> all<00:02:25.310> powered<00:02:25.730> in<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.030> right<00:02:26.239> order

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
are all powered in the right order

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.870 
are all powered in the right order
that's<00:02:27.260> because<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:28.040> stone<00:02:28.400> is<00:02:28.610> set<00:02:28.790> to

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
that's because this stone is set to

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.270 
that's because this stone is set to
redstone<00:02:29.269> blocks<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.720> back<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.260> stone<00:02:30.680> check

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
redstone blocks and back to stone check

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.520 
redstone blocks and back to stone check
out<00:02:31.430> this<00:02:31.640> video<00:02:31.819> from<00:02:32.150> city<00:02:32.450> on<00:02:32.660> he<00:02:33.110> explains

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
out this video from city on he explains

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.630 
out this video from city on he explains
how<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:33.860> thing<00:02:34.100> works

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
how this thing works

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.300 
how this thing works
so<00:02:35.150> these<00:02:35.360> 13<00:02:36.049> command<00:02:36.470> blocks<00:02:36.680> are<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:36.980> logic

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
so these 13 command blocks are the logic

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.180 
so these 13 command blocks are the logic
behind<00:02:37.489> one<00:02:38.000> single<00:02:38.450> step<00:02:38.660> this<00:02:39.319> entire<00:02:39.739> row

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
behind one single step this entire row

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.880 
behind one single step this entire row
makes<00:02:40.640> all<00:02:40.880> six<00:02:41.239> steps<00:02:41.569> work<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.049> this<00:02:42.470> entire

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
makes all six steps work and this entire

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.850 
makes all six steps work and this entire
field<00:02:43.400> makes<00:02:43.940> One<00:02:44.209> Direction<00:02:44.870> work<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.350> all

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
field makes One Direction work and all

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.530 
field makes One Direction work and all
these<00:02:46.069> four<00:02:46.459> fields<00:02:46.910> make<00:02:47.180> all<00:02:47.390> the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
these four fields make all the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.570 
these four fields make all the
directions<00:02:47.870> work<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.440> then<00:02:49.130> there's<00:02:49.400> this

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
directions work and then there's this

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.699 
directions work and then there's this
last<00:02:49.850> row<00:02:50.150> of<00:02:50.180> man<00:02:50.540> books<00:02:50.780> that<00:02:51.230> make<00:02:51.470> sure

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
last row of man books that make sure

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.100 
last row of man books that make sure
there<00:02:51.980> is<00:02:52.100> a<00:02:52.130> new<00:02:52.430> towel<00:02:53.000> added<00:02:53.480> every<00:02:53.870> time

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
there is a new towel added every time

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.979 
there is a new towel added every time
you<00:02:54.290> make<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.530> move<00:02:55.269> first<00:02:56.269> it<00:02:56.540> will<00:02:56.690> create

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
you make a move first it will create

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.050 
you make a move first it will create
stone<00:02:57.500> blocks<00:02:57.769> for<00:02:58.040> all<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.489> towels<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:58.910> are

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
stone blocks for all the towels that are

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.990 
stone blocks for all the towels that are
0<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.810> then<00:03:00.349> I<00:03:00.560> use<00:03:00.799> spread<00:03:01.370> players<00:03:01.670> to

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
0 and then I use spread players to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.150 
0 and then I use spread players to
teleport<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:02.510> squid<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.170> random<00:03:03.590> block<00:03:03.709> over

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
teleport a squid to a random block over

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.740 
teleport a squid to a random block over
here<00:03:04.459> then<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.209> will<00:03:05.329> be<00:03:05.480> teleported

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
here then it will be teleported

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.170 
here then it will be teleported
relatively<00:03:06.500> above<00:03:07.070> one<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.370> these<00:03:07.640> squids

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
relatively above one of these squids

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.819 
relatively above one of these squids
and<00:03:08.299> then<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:09.079> will<00:03:09.260> set<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.560> squid

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
and then it will set the squid

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.060 
and then it will set the squid
underneath<00:03:10.340> him<00:03:10.549> to<00:03:10.850> either<00:03:11.030> 2<00:03:11.390> or<00:03:11.600> 4<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.320> that

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
underneath him to either 2 or 4 and that

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.490 
underneath him to either 2 or 4 and that
number<00:03:13.519> is<00:03:13.549> again<00:03:14.209> randomly<00:03:14.930> chosen<00:03:15.200> using

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
number is again randomly chosen using

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.190 
number is again randomly chosen using
spread<00:03:15.890> players<00:03:16.100> on<00:03:16.400> this<00:03:16.670> squid<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.239> this

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
spread players on this squid and this

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.620 
spread players on this squid and this
row<00:03:18.380> also<00:03:18.620> summons<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.280> item<00:03:19.579> frames<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:20.090> it

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
row also summons the item frames and it

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.539 
row also summons the item frames and it
makes<00:03:20.840> sure<00:03:20.930> there<00:03:21.350> isn't<00:03:21.620> an<00:03:21.709> extra<00:03:22.040> towel<00:03:22.310> at

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
makes sure there isn't an extra towel at

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.400 
makes sure there isn't an extra towel at
it<00:03:22.700> when<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:23.000> did<00:03:23.209> not<00:03:23.390> move<00:03:23.630> anything<00:03:23.930> around

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
it when you did not move anything around

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.630 
it when you did not move anything around
but<00:03:25.340> that's<00:03:25.549> way<00:03:25.760> too<00:03:25.820> advanced<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.690> explain

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
but that's way too advanced to explain

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.340 
but that's way too advanced to explain
so<00:03:28.640> if<00:03:29.390> you<00:03:29.480> want<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.690> see<00:03:29.870> how<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.019> works

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
so if you want to see how that works

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.710 
so if you want to see how that works
feel<00:03:30.799> free<00:03:31.069> to<00:03:31.100> download<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.609> world<00:03:31.880> or<00:03:32.090> not

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
feel free to download the world or not

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.259 
feel free to download the world or not
because<00:03:33.260> it's<00:03:33.530> pretty<00:03:33.769> addictive<00:03:34.190> um<00:03:34.489> and

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
because it's pretty addictive um and

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.530 
because it's pretty addictive um and
that's<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:35.840> thanks<00:03:36.350> for<00:03:36.440> watching<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:37.540> so

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
that's it thanks for watching and so

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.970 
that's it thanks for watching and so
what<00:03:38.780> should<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:39.019> say<00:03:39.200> now<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:39.590> should<00:03:39.739> make<00:03:39.950> a

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
what should I say now you should make a

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.660
