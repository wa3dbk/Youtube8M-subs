00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
 more the head we're just going to 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.050
 discover 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.050
 a small triangle of the ears 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.830
 like life 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.960
 of course this work can 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.960
 do with the machine 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.020
 some pets are stressed noise 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.190
 of the machine and a good option would be 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.310
 work it with scissors like I am 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.310
 doing 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.030
 here has an ear 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.030
 do you have 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:08.010
 then comb the ear 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.720
 and we only cut a little bit the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.040
 shore 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.040
 with a straight scissors 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.619
 in the face aside from the grimm al is the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.259
 let's clear the front view of the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.070
 dog with scissors thin and giving 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.370
 only the hair on top and in front 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.780
 Of the eye 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.780
 the same thing on the other side 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.690
 If I had many hairs on equal 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.710
 without recharging the scissors we can 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.700
 fade to clear the vision 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.700
 frontal of the dog 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.300
 we will try with the small touches 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.880
 what do we do 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.780
 try to improve the expression of the dog 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.920
 to see more more puppy more tender 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.920
 rounder the head 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.640
 good 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.200
 i
