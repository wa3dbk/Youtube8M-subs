buddies and when I play portal by myself
I<00:00:20.270> can<00:00:21.270> play<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.990> 1080<00:00:22.430> or<00:00:23.430> whatever

I can play in the the 1080 or whatever
the<00:00:23.910> highest<00:00:24.390> resolution<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.199> don't<00:00:25.260> even

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the highest resolution is I don't even

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.460 
the highest resolution is I don't even
know<00:00:25.529> 12<00:00:25.830> some<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.640> can<00:00:27.539> play<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.080> with

really no problems at all it runs

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.440 
really no problems at all it runs
smoothly<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.109> once<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.529> bring<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.099> my

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
smoothly but once I bring in my

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.229 
smoothly but once I bring in my
recording<00:00:33.450> software<00:00:34.040> it<00:00:35.040> gets<00:00:35.370> really<00:00:35.670> laggy

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
recording software it gets really laggy

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.910 
recording software it gets really laggy
and<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.480> played<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:36.780> all<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> settings<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.860> I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
and I played with all the settings and I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.389 
and I played with all the settings and I
really<00:00:38.190> couldn't<00:00:38.430> get<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.820> crisp<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.620> went

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
really couldn't get it crisp so I went

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.910 
really couldn't get it crisp so I went
on<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> internet<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.180> searched<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:42.960> a

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
on to the internet and I searched for a

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.459 
on to the internet and I searched for a
game<00:00:44.640> booster<00:00:45.000> which<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> program<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.230> i'm

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
game booster which is a program that i'm

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.470 
game booster which is a program that i'm
familiar<00:00:46.649> with<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.520> pc<00:00:47.940> back<00:00:48.180> when<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.390> used

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
familiar with on the pc back when I used

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.350 
familiar with on the pc back when I used
to<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:49.309> pc<00:00:50.309> laptop<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.239> would

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
to have a pc laptop and it would

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.810 
to have a pc laptop and it would
basically<00:00:51.539> stop<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.649> processes<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.460> your

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
basically stop all the processes of your

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.850 
basically stop all the processes of your
computer<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.390> weren't<00:00:54.690> necessary<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.800> you

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
computer that weren't necessary so you

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.400 
computer that weren't necessary so you
could<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.910> know<00:00:56.940> increased<00:00:57.449> FPS<00:00:58.050> in

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
could have you know increased FPS in

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.270 
could have you know increased FPS in
your<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.879> your<00:01:00.059> game<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:01.590> could<00:01:01.770> not<00:01:01.890> find<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
your in your game and I could not find a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.250 
your in your game and I could not find a
mac<00:01:02.460> version<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:02.969> anywhere<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.870> began

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
mac version of that anywhere so I began

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
mac version of that anywhere so I began
to<00:01:04.530> search<00:01:04.739> more<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.129> more<00:01:05.280> did<00:01:05.880> some

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
to search more and more did some

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.390 
to search more and more did some
internet<00:01:06.479> sleuthing<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.710> stumbled<00:01:08.310> upon

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
internet sleuthing and I stumbled upon

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.030 
internet sleuthing and I stumbled upon
the<00:01:08.670> next<00:01:08.850> best<00:01:09.000> thing<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.960> called<00:01:10.170> cpu

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the next best thing this is called cpu

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.039 
the next best thing this is called cpu
speed<00:01:11.400> accelerator<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:12.540> icon<00:01:12.840> looks

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
speed accelerator the little icon looks

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.859 
speed accelerator the little icon looks
like<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.880> basically<00:01:14.880> what<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.360> does<00:01:15.450> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
like this and basically what it does is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.490 
like this and basically what it does is
it<00:01:15.900> boosts<00:01:16.650> your<00:01:16.799> cpu<00:01:17.430> performance<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
it boosts your cpu performance and

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.010 
it boosts your cpu performance and
basically<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.890> overpowers<00:01:20.880> any<00:01:21.119> app<00:01:21.509> that's

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
basically like overpowers any app that's

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.109 
basically like overpowers any app that's
currently<00:01:22.439> running<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.159> runs<00:01:23.520> super<00:01:23.850> quick

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
currently running so it runs super quick

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.830 
currently running so it runs super quick
so<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.080> perform<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.600> Preferences<00:01:27.600> that

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
so that perform the the Preferences that

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.920 
so that perform the the Preferences that
you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.110> choose<00:01:28.590> are<00:01:28.799> pretty<00:01:29.130> simple<00:01:29.750> this<00:01:30.750> is

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
you can choose are pretty simple this is

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.080 
you can choose are pretty simple this is
really<00:01:31.110> all<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.439> get<00:01:31.650> here<00:01:31.920> tells<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.850> your

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
really all you get here tells you your

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.149 
really all you get here tells you your
your<00:01:33.750> computer's<00:01:34.170> configuration<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.070> then

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
your computer's configuration and then

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.640 
your computer's configuration and then
you<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.400> choose<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.380> amount<00:01:37.380> of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
you just choose the amount of

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.710 
you just choose the amount of
acceleration<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.640> want<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.299> don't<00:01:39.420> know<00:01:39.600> why

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
acceleration you want you don't know why

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.620 
acceleration you want you don't know why
you<00:01:39.780> wouldn't<00:01:40.200> choose<00:01:40.470> 100<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.549> um<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:42.479> just

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
you wouldn't choose 100 but um you just

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.929 
you wouldn't choose 100 but um you just
click<00:01:42.780> start<00:01:43.110> States<00:01:43.890> active<00:01:44.369> you'll<00:01:44.579> know<00:01:44.759> by

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
click start States active you'll know by

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.840 
click start States active you'll know by
the<00:01:45.000> little<00:01:45.270> icon<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> bar<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.890> here<00:01:46.920> get

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the little icon and the bar up here get

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.969 
the little icon and the bar up here get
rid<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.540> there<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.409> go<00:01:49.439> that's

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
rid of that and there you go that's

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.210 
rid of that and there you go that's
really<00:01:50.310> as<00:01:50.759> simple<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.500> guess<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.009> does

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
really as simple as that I guess it does

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.609 
really as simple as that I guess it does
take<00:01:54.180> away<00:01:54.420> from<00:01:54.659> your<00:01:54.810> battery<00:01:55.200> life<00:01:55.229> a

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
take away from your battery life a

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.170 
take away from your battery life a
little<00:01:55.799> bit<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.040> guess<00:01:56.130> that's<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
little bit I guess that's a one of the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.359 
little bit I guess that's a one of the
downsides<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.680> besides<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.280> I

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
downsides of it but besides that I

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.760 
downsides of it but besides that I
haven't<00:01:59.520> really<00:01:59.790> noticed<00:01:59.939> anything<00:02:00.770> notable

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
haven't really noticed anything notable

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.209 
haven't really noticed anything notable
but<00:02:02.430> uh<00:02:02.460> let<00:02:02.880> me<00:02:02.909> give<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> quick<00:02:03.390> demo<00:02:04.219> how

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
but uh let me give you a quick demo how

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.819 
but uh let me give you a quick demo how
quickly<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.759> opens<00:02:06.060> stuff<00:02:06.299> like<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.990> mean<00:02:07.619> I

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
quickly it opens stuff like I mean I

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.430 
quickly it opens stuff like I mean I
have<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.099> good<00:02:08.220> computer<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.929> didn't

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
have a good computer but it didn't

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.640 
have a good computer but it didn't
merely<00:02:11.330> compete<00:02:12.330> with<00:02:12.569> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
merely compete with the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.929 
merely compete with the
speeds<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.129> get<00:02:14.280> after<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.610> use<00:02:14.790> this

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
speeds that I get after I use this

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:18.979 
speeds that I get after I use this
program<00:02:15.950> so<00:02:16.950> i<00:02:16.980> thought<00:02:17.459> i<00:02:17.700> would<00:02:18.030> share<00:02:18.810> this

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
program so i thought i would share this

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.420 
program so i thought i would share this
with<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.170> world<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.680> hopefully<00:02:20.040> some<00:02:20.280> other

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
with the world and hopefully some other

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.819 
with the world and hopefully some other
people<00:02:20.700> benefit<00:02:21.180> from<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.569> like<00:02:21.689> i<00:02:21.840> do<00:02:21.900> so

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
people benefit from it like i do so

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.710 
people benefit from it like i do so
thank<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.489> guys<00:02:23.519> for<00:02:23.700> watching<00:02:23.909> I<00:02:24.420> hope<00:02:24.629> you
