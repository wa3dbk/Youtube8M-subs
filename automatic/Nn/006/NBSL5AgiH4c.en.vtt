water fall that used to fall all the way
down<00:00:43.440> here<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:44.070> basically<00:00:44.280> could<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.670> fall

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
down here you basically could just fall

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.850 
down here you basically could just fall
down<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.329> but<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:46.230> got<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> ladder<00:00:46.620> for

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860
