my name is Mark Elliott I've been
involved<00:00:09.590> this<00:00:09.740> program<00:00:10.219> for<00:00:10.370> almost<00:00:10.580> four

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
involved this program for almost four

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.500 
involved this program for almost four
years<00:00:10.940> now<00:00:11.330> and<00:00:11.539> I've<00:00:11.840> a<00:00:12.969> considerable<00:00:13.969> hand<00:00:14.269> I

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
years now and I've a considerable hand I

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.659 
years now and I've a considerable hand I
believe<00:00:14.809> in<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.769> designed<00:00:16.099> the<00:00:16.219> flight<00:00:16.430> deck

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:16.669 
believe in the designed the flight deck

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:19.570 
believe in the designed the flight deck
the<00:00:16.820> philosophy<00:00:17.300> of<00:00:17.330> the<00:00:17.509> airplane<00:00:18.460> there<00:00:19.460> was

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
the philosophy of the airplane there was

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.700 
the philosophy of the airplane there was
two<00:00:19.789> parts<00:00:20.270> primarily<00:00:20.779> involved<00:00:21.289> in<00:00:21.349> this<00:00:21.470> one

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
two parts primarily involved in this one

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.410 
two parts primarily involved in this one
was<00:00:21.829> from<00:00:21.980> an<00:00:22.130> Airbus<00:00:22.579> background<00:00:23.119> and<00:00:23.300> myself

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
was from an Airbus background and myself

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.830 
was from an Airbus background and myself
from<00:00:23.779> a<00:00:23.990> Boeing<00:00:24.349> background<00:00:24.920> and<00:00:25.630> we've<00:00:26.630> both

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
from a Boeing background and we've both

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.810 
from a Boeing background and we've both
got<00:00:27.160> incredible<00:00:28.160> experience<00:00:28.640> long

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
got incredible experience long

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.310 
got incredible experience long
experience<00:00:29.240> of<00:00:29.449> airline<00:00:29.750> flying<00:00:30.019> and

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
experience of airline flying and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.650 
experience of airline flying and
teaching<00:00:30.830> pilots<00:00:31.009> so<00:00:31.400> we<00:00:31.849> believe<00:00:32.180> we<00:00:32.330> know

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
teaching pilots so we believe we know

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.950 
teaching pilots so we believe we know
what<00:00:33.019> parts<00:00:33.410> want<00:00:34.180> so<00:00:35.180> what<00:00:35.330> we've<00:00:35.480> done<00:00:35.720> our

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
what parts want so what we've done our

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.619 
what parts want so what we've done our
philosophy<00:00:36.500> is<00:00:36.650> we<00:00:36.860> wanted<00:00:37.160> big<00:00:37.610> windows<00:00:38.000> and

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
philosophy is we wanted big windows and

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.229 
philosophy is we wanted big windows and
the<00:00:38.900> aeroplane<00:00:39.260> so<00:00:39.379> you<00:00:39.620> can<00:00:39.799> see<00:00:39.979> outside<00:00:40.239> we

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
the aeroplane so you can see outside we

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.969 
the aeroplane so you can see outside we
want<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.570> pass<00:00:41.839> to<00:00:42.019> be<00:00:42.110> heads-up<00:00:42.559> so<00:00:42.830> they're

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:42.979 
want the pass to be heads-up so they're

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:45.880 
want the pass to be heads-up so they're
looking<00:00:43.100> outside<00:00:43.430> not<00:00:44.030> heads<00:00:44.299> down<00:00:44.769> so<00:00:45.769> we

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
looking outside not heads down so we

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.640 
looking outside not heads down so we
were<00:00:46.400> fitted<00:00:46.760> Hut<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.989> head-up<00:00:48.229> display

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
were fitted Hut the head-up display

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.579 
were fitted Hut the head-up display
which<00:00:49.159> projects<00:00:49.940> our<00:00:50.119> primary<00:00:50.809> flying

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
which projects our primary flying

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.600 
which projects our primary flying
instruments<00:00:52.010> on<00:00:52.159> flat<00:00:53.470> now<00:00:54.470> mode<00:00:55.159> control

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
instruments on flat now mode control

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.910 
instruments on flat now mode control
panel<00:00:56.000> was<00:00:56.180> up<00:00:56.360> high<00:00:56.659> here<00:00:57.199> now<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:57.619> the

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
panel was up high here now and the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.210 
panel was up high here now and the
visual<00:00:58.580> range<00:00:58.790> so<00:00:59.150> again<00:00:59.540> the<00:01:00.110> main<00:01:00.350> controls

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
visual range so again the main controls

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.329 
visual range so again the main controls
we<00:01:01.400> use<00:01:01.519> in<00:01:01.670> flight<00:01:01.939> are<00:01:02.150> up<00:01:02.269> high<00:01:03.309> so<00:01:04.309> that

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
we use in flight are up high so that

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.520 
we use in flight are up high so that
again<00:01:05.089> with<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.570> pilots<00:01:05.930> lock<00:01:06.110> it<00:01:06.320> down

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
again with the pilots lock it down

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.920 
again with the pilots lock it down
we<00:01:08.130> want<00:01:08.340> big<00:01:08.610> screens<00:01:08.970> you've<00:01:09.210> got<00:01:09.330> five<00:01:09.630> big

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
we want big screens you've got five big

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.870 
we want big screens you've got five big
screens<00:01:10.290> they're<00:01:10.710> all<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.040> same<00:01:11.100> part<00:01:11.550> number

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
screens they're all the same part number

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.679 
screens they're all the same part number
all<00:01:12.060> interchangeable

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.770 

so<00:01:15.289> obviously<00:01:15.740> for<00:01:16.039> spare<00:01:16.280> parts<00:01:16.310> it<00:01:16.819> makes<00:01:17.569> it

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
so obviously for spare parts it makes it

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.499 
so obviously for spare parts it makes it
less<00:01:18.319> parts<00:01:18.829> we<00:01:18.920> have<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.069> carry<00:01:19.369> big<00:01:20.090> screens

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
less parts we have to carry big screens

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.870 
less parts we have to carry big screens
allow<00:01:20.869> us<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.140> put<00:01:21.350> a<00:01:21.380> lot<00:01:21.619> of<00:01:21.799> information<00:01:22.759> on

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
allow us to put a lot of information on

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.160 
allow us to put a lot of information on
there<00:01:23.090> so<00:01:23.270> we<00:01:23.329> had<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.479> be<00:01:23.569> careful<00:01:23.780> that<00:01:24.079> we

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
there so we had to be careful that we

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.419 
there so we had to be careful that we
designed<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.799> present<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.219> information

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
designed and present the information

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.709 
designed and present the information
nice<00:01:25.909> and<00:01:26.149> neatly<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:26.600> clearly<00:01:28.240> as<00:01:29.240> far<00:01:29.569> as

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
nice and neatly and clearly as far as

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.789 
nice and neatly and clearly as far as
the<00:01:29.840> overhead<00:01:30.259> panel<00:01:30.530> is<00:01:30.799> concerned<00:01:32.799> any

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
the overhead panel is concerned any

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.429 
the overhead panel is concerned any
switch<00:01:34.369> that<00:01:34.609> has<00:01:34.759> an<00:01:34.909> auto<00:01:35.149> position<00:01:35.569> that

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
switch that has an auto position that

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:37.990 
switch that has an auto position that
will<00:01:36.560> be<00:01:36.679> Auto<00:01:36.890> for<00:01:37.219> flight<00:01:37.459> and<00:01:37.729> that's<00:01:37.789> its

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
will be Auto for flight and that's its

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.699 
will be Auto for flight and that's its
normal<00:01:38.329> position<00:01:38.420> always<00:01:38.959> will<00:01:39.259> stay<00:01:39.469> there

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:39.709 
normal position always will stay there

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:42.039 
normal position always will stay there
all<00:01:40.250> switches<00:01:40.969> will<00:01:41.119> be<00:01:41.240> in<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:41.420> 12<00:01:41.719> o'clock

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
all switches will be in the 12 o'clock

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.649 
all switches will be in the 12 o'clock
position<00:01:42.079> so<00:01:43.069> for<00:01:43.789> normal<00:01:44.060> operations<00:01:44.569> or

position so for normal operations or
anything<00:01:44.899> that's<00:01:45.049> Auto<00:01:45.349> will<00:01:46.159> be<00:01:46.280> 12<00:01:46.579> o'clock

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:46.849 
anything that's Auto will be 12 o'clock

the normal position this should be known

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.969 
the normal position this should be known
lights<00:01:52.849> on<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.299> flight<00:01:53.509> so<00:01:53.899> a<00:01:54.170> real<00:01:54.679> quick

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
lights on and flight so a real quick

lights on and flight so a real quick
glance<00:01:55.250> up<00:01:55.549> there<00:01:55.759> I<00:01:55.819> can<00:01:56.000> look<00:01:56.119> at<00:01:56.209> all<00:01:56.360> the

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
glance up there I can look at all the

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.660 
glance up there I can look at all the

we've<00:02:03.450> gone<00:02:03.600> with<00:02:03.950> side<00:02:04.950> sticks<00:02:05.280> independent

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
we've gone with side sticks independent

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.169 
we've gone with side sticks independent
side<00:02:06.299> sticks<00:02:07.100> for<00:02:08.100> those<00:02:08.250> pilots<00:02:08.789> who<00:02:08.910> are<00:02:09.030> not

familiar with side sticks we have not

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.430 
familiar with side sticks we have not
flown<00:02:10.950> an<00:02:11.190> Airbus<00:02:11.520> for<00:02:11.700> example<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:13.110> hadn't

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
flown an Airbus for example and I hadn't

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.500 
flown an Airbus for example and I hadn't
before<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.860> flew<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.160> airplane<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:15.000> really

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
before I flew this airplane it's really

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.600 
before I flew this airplane it's really
easy<00:02:15.720> it's<00:02:16.110> very<00:02:16.319> natural<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.920> now<00:02:17.550> the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
easy it's very natural and now the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.130 
easy it's very natural and now the
airplane<00:02:17.970> just<00:02:18.090> flies<00:02:18.390> like<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.690> dream<00:02:18.959> it's

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
airplane just flies like a dream it's

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.600 
airplane just flies like a dream it's
extremely<00:02:20.100> easy<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.459> fly<00:02:22.250> anything<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.370> see

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
extremely easy to fly anything you see

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.820 
extremely easy to fly anything you see
in<00:02:23.760> here<00:02:23.910> with<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.360> orange<00:02:24.750> color<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.709> we've

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
in here with the orange color so we've

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.580 
in here with the orange color so we've
got<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> panel<00:02:26.340> here<00:02:26.370> we<00:02:26.880> have<00:02:27.440> switches<00:02:28.440> up

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
got a panel here we have switches up

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.920 
got a panel here we have switches up
here<00:02:28.890> another<00:02:29.520> panel<00:02:29.940> down<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.330> our<00:02:30.480> center

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
here another panel down in our center

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.050 
here another panel down in our center
console<00:02:31.350> it's<00:02:31.530> orange<00:02:31.920> anything<00:02:32.910> that's

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
console it's orange anything that's

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.360 
console it's orange anything that's
orange<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.600> experimental<00:02:34.140> equipment<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.340> that

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
orange is experimental equipment so that

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.250 
orange is experimental equipment so that
won't<00:02:35.730> be<00:02:35.850> on<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.030> production<00:02:36.330> airplane<00:02:36.840> this

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
won't be on the production airplane this

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.759 
won't be on the production airplane this
is<00:02:37.319> just<00:02:37.590> purely<00:02:37.920> for<00:02:38.280> test<00:02:38.910> flying<00:02:39.150> purposes

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
is just purely for test flying purposes

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.160 
is just purely for test flying purposes
so<00:02:40.769> I've<00:02:40.830> flown<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.280> airplane<00:02:41.989> flow<00:02:42.989> from

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
so I've flown the airplane flow from

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.380 
so I've flown the airplane flow from
both<00:02:43.350> seats<00:02:43.680> I've<00:02:43.920> found<00:02:44.160> extremely<00:02:44.970> easy<00:02:45.209> to

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
both seats I've found extremely easy to

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.440 
both seats I've found extremely easy to
fly<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:46.190> it's<00:02:47.190> just<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.430> dream<00:02:47.640> it's<00:02:48.090> really

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
fly and it's just a dream it's really

00:02:48.450 --> 00:03:02.230 
fly and it's just a dream it's really
really<00:02:48.690> nicer<00:02:48.959> up

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:21.390 

Oh

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.400 

just<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.150> morning<00:03:22.510> from<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.810> front<00:03:23.080> door

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
just the morning from the front door

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.010 
just the morning from the front door
this<00:03:23.920> is<00:03:24.070> easy

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.520 

entering<00:03:27.710> the<00:03:27.860> cabin<00:03:28.070> of<00:03:28.700> our<00:03:29.140> cs100<00:03:30.140> aircraft

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
entering the cabin of our cs100 aircraft

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.440 
entering the cabin of our cs100 aircraft
this<00:03:31.070> aircraft<00:03:31.400> has<00:03:31.460> been<00:03:31.550> configured<00:03:32.000> for

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
this aircraft has been configured for

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.600 
this aircraft has been configured for
the<00:03:32.570> evacuation<00:03:32.720> test<00:03:33.290> which<00:03:33.950> is<00:03:34.070> a<00:03:34.100> testing

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
the evacuation test which is a testing

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.430 
the evacuation test which is a testing
you<00:03:34.670> need<00:03:34.820> to<00:03:35.210> pass<00:03:35.570> in<00:03:35.930> order<00:03:36.050> to<00:03:36.260> get

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
you need to pass in order to get

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.250 
you need to pass in order to get
certification<00:03:37.300> so<00:03:38.300> you<00:03:38.360> see<00:03:38.630> we<00:03:38.810> see<00:03:38.990> a<00:03:39.020> high

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
certification so you see we see a high

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.440 
certification so you see we see a high
very<00:03:39.530> high<00:03:39.620> density<00:03:40.100> configuration<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:41.150> the

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
very high density configuration of the

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.640 
very high density configuration of the
aircraft<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.780> highest<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.350> can<00:03:42.500> actually

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
aircraft the highest you can actually

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.310 
aircraft the highest you can actually
have<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:43.700> also<00:03:44.060> it's<00:03:44.570> by<00:03:44.750> all<00:03:44.900> means<00:03:45.110> a

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
have and also it's by all means a

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.340 
have and also it's by all means a
prototype<00:03:45.740> so<00:03:46.310> it's<00:03:46.490> a<00:03:46.700> it's<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.480> test<00:03:48.080> this

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
prototype so it's a it's a test this

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.870 
prototype so it's a it's a test this

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
to go through testing that's why you see

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.850 
to go through testing that's why you see
here<00:03:52.910> at<00:03:53.060> a<00:03:53.180> station<00:03:53.630> that<00:03:53.810> is<00:03:54.110> dedicated<00:03:54.620> with

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
here at a station that is dedicated with

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.830 
here at a station that is dedicated with
flight<00:03:55.070> test<00:03:55.340> engineers<00:03:55.850> when<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.540> aircraft

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
flight test engineers when the aircraft

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.980 
flight test engineers when the aircraft
will<00:03:56.960> be<00:03:56.990> in<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.350> air<00:03:58.030> so<00:03:59.030> this<00:03:59.210> is<00:03:59.330> the<00:03:59.510> cs100

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
will be in the air so this is the cs100

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.980 
will be in the air so this is the cs100
cabin<00:04:00.620> so<00:04:01.190> just<00:04:01.430> we<00:04:01.580> maybe<00:04:01.760> move<00:04:02.240> your<00:04:02.750> further

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
cabin so just we maybe move your further

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.910 
cabin so just we maybe move your further
back<00:04:03.320> where<00:04:04.040> you<00:04:04.100> can

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.640 

you<00:04:08.220> can<00:04:08.490> experience<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.390> comfort<00:04:09.960> level<00:04:10.410> the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
you can experience the comfort level the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.309 
you can experience the comfort level the
desert<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:11.100> 10<00:04:11.340> offered<00:04:11.790> is<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.720> first<00:04:12.990> and

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
desert of 10 offered is the first and

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.250 
desert of 10 offered is the first and
aircraft<00:04:14.310> that<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.490> game<00:04:14.790> design<00:04:15.720> brand-new

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
aircraft that is game design brand-new

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.500 
aircraft that is game design brand-new
for<00:04:16.859> this<00:04:16.980> world<00:04:17.250> market<00:04:17.609> segment<00:04:18.060> in<00:04:18.359> the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
for this world market segment in the

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.750 
for this world market segment in the
last<00:04:18.690> 30<00:04:18.989> years<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.500> that<00:04:20.010> allowed<00:04:20.310> us<00:04:20.519> to<00:04:20.549> do

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
last 30 years and that allowed us to do

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.180 
last 30 years and that allowed us to do
things<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.269> other<00:04:22.109> manufacture<00:04:22.710> cannot<00:04:23.040> do

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
things that other manufacture cannot do

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.909 
things that other manufacture cannot do
so<00:04:23.880> we<00:04:24.210> designed<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.870> most<00:04:25.140> fuel-efficient

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
so we designed the most fuel-efficient

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.370 
so we designed the most fuel-efficient
aircraft<00:04:26.370> open<00:04:27.030> top<00:04:27.390> of<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:27.690> we<00:04:27.900> decided<00:04:28.169> to

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
aircraft open top of it we decided to

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.140 
aircraft open top of it we decided to
give<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.800> passengers<00:04:28.980> the<00:04:29.430> widest<00:04:29.850> possible

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
give the passengers the widest possible

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.960 
give the passengers the widest possible
level<00:04:30.780> of<00:04:30.840> comfort<00:04:31.230> so<00:04:31.610> this<00:04:32.610> aircraft

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
level of comfort so this aircraft

in the industry today this is the area
of<00:06:58.050> the<00:06:58.169> cabin<00:06:58.560> where<00:06:58.919> you<00:06:59.130> get<00:06:59.340> less<00:06:59.940> space

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
of the cabin where you get less space

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.020 
of the cabin where you get less space
because<00:07:00.449> it's<00:07:00.780> the<00:07:00.870> part<00:07:01.080> where<00:07:01.680> the<00:07:02.099> cockpit

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.649

starts<00:07:03.360> shaping<00:07:03.569> up<00:07:04.789> despite<00:07:05.789> that<00:07:06.060> we<00:07:06.539> have

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:06.659 
starts shaping up despite that we have

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.800 
starts shaping up despite that we have
made<00:07:06.870> sure<00:07:06.900> and<00:07:07.440> asked<00:07:07.590> our<00:07:07.830> design

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:08.810 
made sure and asked our design

which<00:07:23.190> is<00:07:23.310> very<00:07:23.520> atypical<00:07:23.730> for<00:07:24.570> this<00:07:24.810> size<00:07:25.050> of

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.260

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.080 
which is very atypical for this size of
aircraft<00:07:25.590> because<00:07:26.040> as<00:07:26.190> I<00:07:26.220> said<00:07:26.490> this<00:07:26.760> is<00:07:26.820> the

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:36.140 
aircraft because as I said this is the
area<00:07:27.360> where<00:07:27.930> we<00:07:27.990> start<00:07:28.380> to<00:07:28.530> be
