down<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.750> probably<00:00:27.990> noticed<00:00:28.500> more<00:00:28.650> than

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
down but you probably noticed more than

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.500 
down but you probably noticed more than
anything<00:00:29.039> else<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> speaker<00:00:29.910> system<00:00:30.150> is

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
anything else in the speaker system is

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.030 
anything else in the speaker system is
the<00:00:30.630> transparent<00:00:31.349> design<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the transparent design and the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.069 
the transparent design and the
futuristic<00:00:32.669> look<00:00:32.940> they<00:00:33.239> feel<00:00:33.450> very<00:00:33.660> strong

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
futuristic look they feel very strong

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.630 
futuristic look they feel very strong
and<00:00:34.350> they<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.890> some<00:00:35.100> weight<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.460> them

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and they do have some weight to them

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.069 
and they do have some weight to them
which<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:35.880> always<00:00:36.329> good<00:00:36.570> because<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.960> makes

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
which is always good because it makes

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.720 
which is always good because it makes
them<00:00:37.290> feel<00:00:37.320> more<00:00:37.530> professional<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.460> sturdy

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
them feel more professional and sturdy

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.549 
them feel more professional and sturdy
the<00:00:39.059> two<00:00:39.239> satellite<00:00:39.690> speakers<00:00:39.989> look<00:00:40.320> very

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the two satellite speakers look very

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.229 
the two satellite speakers look very
similar<00:00:41.010> except<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.489> one<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.879> them<00:00:42.030> has<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
similar except that one of them has a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.569 
similar except that one of them has a
touch-sensitive<00:00:42.629> volume<00:00:43.530> control<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.190> a

touch-sensitive volume control and a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.490 
touch-sensitive volume control and a
thicker<00:00:44.820> cable<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.480> can<00:00:45.510> definitely<00:00:46.110> see<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
thicker cable you can definitely see the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.799 
thicker cable you can definitely see the
cabling<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.579> air<00:00:47.760> exhaust<00:00:48.210> tube<00:00:48.570> when

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
cabling and the air exhaust tube when

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.270 
cabling and the air exhaust tube when
looking<00:00:49.020> at<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.379> speaker<00:00:49.620> from<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> side

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
looking at the speaker from the side

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.060 
looking at the speaker from the side
view<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.940> does<00:00:51.300> indeed<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:52.469> cool<00:00:52.739> at<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
view it does indeed really cool at the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.830 
view it does indeed really cool at the
bottom<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> speakers<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.270> circular

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
bottom of the speakers is a circular

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
stand that allows you to adjust the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.779 
stand that allows you to adjust the
angle<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.840> speakers<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.949> subwoofer<00:00:59.579> is

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
angle of the speakers the subwoofer is

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.639

also<00:01:00.180> transparent<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.530> how

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
also transparent and you can see how

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.500 
also transparent and you can see how

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
to be completely honest this is one of

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.419 
to be completely honest this is one of
the<00:02:06.719> best<00:02:07.020> sounding<00:02:07.649> speakers<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.310> have

themselves<00:02:11.039> are<00:02:11.160> absolutely

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
themselves are absolutely

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.899

my speakers that I use the bigger

two large speakers or monitors as they

two large speakers or monitors as they
are<00:02:32.819> called<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.329> a<00:02:33.959> built-in<00:02:34.440> amplifier<00:02:34.799> they

are called and a built-in amplifier they

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.580 
are called and a built-in amplifier they
allow<00:02:35.610> me<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.879> adjust<00:02:35.970> both<00:02:36.390> volume<00:02:36.959> bass<00:02:37.290> and

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
awesome

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.309 
awesome
however<00:02:41.099> somehow<00:02:41.549> Harman<00:02:42.209> Kardon<00:02:42.450> were<00:02:42.900> able

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
however somehow Harman Kardon were able

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.349 
however somehow Harman Kardon were able
to<00:02:43.500> pack<00:02:43.799> so<00:02:44.040> much<00:02:44.190> punch<00:02:44.549> into<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:45.030> sound

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
to pack so much punch into the sound

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.539 
to pack so much punch into the sound
sticks<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.349> actually<00:02:46.620> think<00:02:47.099> they<00:02:47.250> sound

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
sticks that I actually think they sound

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.610 
sticks that I actually think they sound
better<00:02:47.790> than<00:02:47.970> my<00:02:48.329> monitoring<00:02:48.840> speakers<00:02:49.230> they

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
better than my monitoring speakers they

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.250 
better than my monitoring speakers they
are<00:02:49.709> capable<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:50.730> much<00:02:50.760> bass<00:02:51.359> and<00:02:51.750> they<00:02:52.109> can

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
are capable of so much bass and they can

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.589 
are capable of so much bass and they can
play<00:02:52.470> electronic<00:02:53.129> music<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:53.970> well<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.450> was

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
play electronic music so well that I was

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.629 
play electronic music so well that I was
blown<00:02:54.959> away<00:02:55.349> when<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.709> first<00:02:56.010> tested<00:02:56.220> them<00:02:56.489> out

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
blown away when I first tested them out

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.789 
blown away when I first tested them out
due<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.510> transparent<00:02:58.200> assigned<00:02:58.560> they

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
due to the transparent assigned they

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.099

wherever you want to place them it's

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.309 
wherever you want to place them it's
like<00:03:02.670> they<00:03:02.819> never<00:03:03.030> get<00:03:03.389> in<00:03:03.510> your<00:03:03.659> way<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:04.109> have
