equipment that it had and when I born

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.900 
equipment that it had and when I born
into<00:00:25.260> an<00:00:25.350> engraving<00:00:25.710> business<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.370> inherited<00:00:26.789> a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
into an engraving business I inherited a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.960 
into an engraving business I inherited a
secondhand<00:00:27.240> cam<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.770> and<00:00:29.430> actually<00:00:29.760> loved

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
secondhand cam to and and actually loved

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.689 
secondhand cam to and and actually loved
the<00:00:30.119> machine<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.110> when<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.740> came<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.009> expanding

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699 
the machine so when I came to expanding

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.910 
the machine so when I came to expanding
into<00:00:33.059> other<00:00:33.300> machines<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.170> example<00:00:34.620> like<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
into other machines for example like the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.849 
into other machines for example like the
large<00:00:35.129> format<00:00:35.550> printers<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.410> me<00:00:37.530> only

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
large format printers it was to me only

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:39.439 
large format printers it was to me only
reasonable<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.640> I'd<00:00:38.789> look<00:00:38.969> at<00:00:39.059> Roland

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
reasonable that I'd look at Roland

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:40.819 
reasonable that I'd look at Roland
because<00:00:39.720> of<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> service<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.440> I've<00:00:40.530> got<00:00:40.710> out

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
because of the service that I've got out

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.780 
because of the service that I've got out
of<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> machine<00:00:41.310> I<00:00:41.340> already<00:00:41.670> had<00:00:43.550> this<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.670> my

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
of the machine I already had this is my

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.840 
of the machine I already had this is my
newest<00:00:45.120> fixer<00:00:45.720> Roland<00:00:46.050> equipment<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.620> XR<00:00:46.980> 640

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
newest fixer Roland equipment the XR 640

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.389 
newest fixer Roland equipment the XR 640
the<00:00:48.420> machine<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.899> had<00:00:49.079> before<00:00:49.230> was<00:00:50.220> five

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the machine that I had before was five

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.990 
the machine that I had before was five
years<00:00:50.430> old

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
years old

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.209 
years old
so<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.690> lease<00:00:51.870> was<00:00:52.050> up<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.620> warranty<00:00:53.010> time

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
so the lease was up the warranty time

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.680 
so the lease was up the warranty time
was<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.489> about<00:00:53.760> up<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> thought<00:00:54.510> there's

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
was just about up so I thought there's

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.139 
was just about up so I thought there's
an<00:00:54.780> opportunity<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:56.309> upgrade<00:00:56.700> the<00:00:56.850> machine

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
an opportunity to to upgrade the machine

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.720 
an opportunity to to upgrade the machine
or<00:00:57.750> more<00:00:57.870> experience<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.500> far<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.190> XR

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
or more experience so far with the XR

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.569

it pretty well consistently as far as
the<00:01:07.500> productivity<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.189> concerned<00:01:08.640> if<00:01:08.880> this

equals the inks have provided me with

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.130 
equals the inks have provided me with
seamless<00:01:53.130> printing<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.720> haven't<00:01:55.020> even

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
seamless printing so I haven't even

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.380 
seamless printing so I haven't even
bother<00:01:55.439> looking<00:01:55.619> elsewhere<00:01:56.270> but<00:01:57.270> the
