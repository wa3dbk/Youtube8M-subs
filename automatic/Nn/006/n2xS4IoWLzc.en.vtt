00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.870
 that the clothes and welcome to a 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.580
 new video to take a piece with 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.960
 the piano pull easy point fr 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.390
 today's program we will see the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.990
 mans sochaux to friends of julien dorÃ© on 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.390
 will see the rif principle as a result 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.779
 chords and rhythm that can 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.580
 operate especially the song here it is 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.869
 there cigarettes the nice work and so 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.250
 that's why we see it they 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.989
 are already pretty good piece 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.850
 Well, here we go we start with 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.850
 agreements then for agreements we go in 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.320
 to have three and a half then three and a half 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.600
 why because the first one is going to be 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.750
 a soil so the first soil is in 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:55.210
 syria after we will see a 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.890
 the major do C sharp me after why 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.660
 I have three neither because the agreement that goes 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.880
 to arrive now is a fat 16 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.580
 base miners from there we 'll just move 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.920
 finally the little finger and on the 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.369
 fat matte like those ci fabienne 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.980
 minors pass from there and after a 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.080
 seminar 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.030
 so rafa diez these four agreements 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.950
 but it's true that between the la and the fa 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.480
 sharp we move the now a 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.480
 more complicated part the rhythmic 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.840
 the rhythmic you've posted it we're going 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.450
 now try to understand her 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.039
 that is to say that we will have one 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.200
 will see right away the following agreement 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.859
 to do it is going to be sol 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.890
 the F sharp minor base from there and if 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:40.109
 minor so he'll have to cut that 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.520
 rhythmic in two and it will have to do 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:47.009
 the ground on an ascetic and from eight to sixteen 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.829
 we will do the same for the fa 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.819
 sharp and so if the F sharp from 1 to 7 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.780
 and 2 8 to 16 the minor site I'm going to you 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.119
 show now what to do 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.129
 so we will do it little by little so 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:06.239
 we are already going to do the part of the ground that will 

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:07.890
 to be this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.349
 so we'll see the left alternation 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.980
 right left 1 2 3 4 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:17.460
 left right left the being preceded 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:26.100
 on the 8 on the eight years to do there 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:28.110
 9 10 12 13 14 15 16 8 9 10 years 13 14 15 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.340
 16 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:36.470
 the difficulty is going to be in China and the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:41.790
 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.220
 I redo 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 years 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.790
 13 14 15 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.530
 a little more slowly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.370
 pistons 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.930
 remain 14th 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:01.050
 the same on the F sharp minor 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:05.400
 base of the six minors 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.510
 or 15 16 so rhythmic to work 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.890
 to get used to doing a little 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.510
 manipulation now we'll see the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.190
 m6 piece has already seen I'll go 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.750
 show what it gives 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.500
 so let's go on and go on 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.500
 it will give this 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.220
 we 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.960
 and it's looping you can of course 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.520
 kept the demo to see with a little 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.630
 her who's gonna see her to see to 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.650
 what did it look like well here we have seen 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.370
 all you need to work 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.370
 although a big
