all<00:06:04.469> we<00:06:04.590> have<00:06:04.710> to<00:06:04.740> do<00:06:04.949> now<00:06:05.130> is<00:06:05.400> just<00:06:05.430> go<00:06:05.909> get<00:06:06.150> a

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
all we have to do now is just go get a

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.149 
all we have to do now is just go get a
tombstone<00:06:06.840> because<00:06:07.469> we<00:06:07.650> can<00:06:07.800> pretty<00:06:08.039> much

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159 
tombstone because we can pretty much

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.149 
tombstone because we can pretty much
declare<00:06:08.699> this<00:06:08.849> company<00:06:09.330> dead<00:06:10.080> and<00:06:10.440> that's<00:06:10.949> a
