00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:20.850
 one of my favorites is it's affections 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.439
 Jorge Luis Borges de contos is not for me 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.430
 the best book boj I'm a big 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.430
 fan of borges 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.540
 It is not difficult to read is one has a 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.970
 language is that so tactically a lot 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.650
 simple and he has assumed his degree of 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.630
 difficulty but he is also an accountant 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.820
 story right storyteller one 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.950
 both absurd twice but not 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.950
 let be history has these multiple 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.640
 these reading plans from the very 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.220
 superficial to the deepest is everything 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.060
 a certain game spirit that too I 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.130
 I think it's very cool in the goat I think 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.640
 Maybe that's what got me 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.640
 scored 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.920
 is a deeply erudite book book 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.250
 the absurd right Borges was a rat 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.740
 The library is a guy who practically 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.009
 did not live changed his life for the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.979
 same literature, right? 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.020
 but it's a book that being all this is is 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.179
 a book take a book extremely well 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.450
 A memo has very funny things. 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.450
 huh 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.789
 I remember reading some of the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.130
 stories 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.730
 one of them is one of the most famous call 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.250
 memorial functions which is about one on one 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.209
 a totally clumsy fellow who 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.709
 has a memory is a perfect memory 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.050
 the bottom does not forget anything that 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.940
 happened to him he forgets a detail of 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.560
 Nothing happened in his life. 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.019
 the funny story said is because she 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.410
 ends up becoming a fable about the 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.970
 limits of the language of thought 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.590
 functions as it does not forget anything 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.540
 can think that he is capable of 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.550
 abstraction then being unable to 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.010
 abstraction it is capable of language of 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.010
 build the concept a sign in able 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.170
 to think then is a man with the brain 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.959
 the most prodigious in the history of 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.090
 humanity and at the same time it is a 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:59.480
 complete moron is this kind of mood 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.560
 paradox that is in the fictions in several in 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.959
 several of the stories 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.970
 I find the first spectacular that 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:10.079
 somewhat contradicts a certain system of 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.220
 yuan seriousness is that one tends to attribute 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.220
 the high literature is not 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.220
 When I read in colleges there are many 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.590
 years as it was a revelation as 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.880
 big was an explosion of a party 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:41.750
 literary so so intoxicated 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.080
 intoxicating me is one thing is that I 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.430
 not so I do not know if it's a book that 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.320
 I could say that influenced me 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.480
 exactly because what I write does not 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.760
 has nothing to do as before but is a book 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.760
 which certainly encouraged me to write
