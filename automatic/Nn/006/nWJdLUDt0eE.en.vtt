00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
see fingered solves some sort of a

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.980 
see fingered solves some sort of a
regulation<00:01:43.280> won't<00:01:43.970> information<00:01:44.690> something

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
regulation won't information something

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:55.330 
regulation won't information something
like<00:01:45.350> that<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:54.200> nothing<00:01:54.380> else<00:01:54.650> left<00:01:55.070> in<00:01:55.220> the

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
like that so nothing else left in the

or less nothing basically what it looks
like<00:02:09.489> learn<00:02:10.489> sign<00:02:10.880> information<00:02:11.540> about<00:02:11.810> in

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
like learn sign information about in

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:37.140 
like learn sign information about in
those<00:02:12.350> eight<00:02:15.250> all<00:02:16.250> right

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.030 

we<00:02:38.150> need<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.600> buy<00:02:38.780> tri-fold<00:02:39.470> or<00:02:39.620> something

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
we need to buy tri-fold or something

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:50.410 
we need to buy tri-fold or something
like<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.400> once<00:02:49.670> that<00:02:49.760> show<00:02:50.120> up<00:02:50.240> it

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
like that so once that show up it

00:02:50.420 --> 00:03:09.890 
like that so once that show up it
yourself<00:03:00.130> there<00:03:01.130> you<00:03:01.160> have<00:03:01.460> it

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.300 

core<00:03:10.500> i3<00:03:10.739> processor<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.879> meet<00:03:12.299> audio

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.509 

it<00:03:17.310> also<00:03:17.459> has<00:03:17.879> DVD<00:03:18.540> drive<00:03:18.950> on<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.099> right<00:03:20.250> hand

it also has DVD drive on the right hand

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.449 
it also has DVD drive on the right hand
side<00:03:21.680> here<00:03:23.959> also<00:03:24.959> here<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.230> find<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:26.099> looks<00:03:26.310> to

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
side here also here you find it looks to

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.740 
side here also here you find it looks to
be<00:03:26.489> USB<00:03:27.090> port<00:03:28.159> then<00:03:29.159> obviously<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:30.180> port<00:03:30.480> for

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
be USB port then obviously the port for

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.979 
be USB port then obviously the port for
headphones<00:03:31.939> the<00:03:32.939> microphone<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.659> probably

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
headphones the microphone is probably

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.660 
headphones the microphone is probably
built-in<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.680> don't<00:03:34.859> see<00:03:35.010> any<00:03:35.189> microphone

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
built-in I don't see any microphone

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.990 
built-in I don't see any microphone
ports<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:37.280> here<00:03:38.280> again<00:03:40.040> couple<00:03:41.040> USB<00:03:41.549> ports<00:03:41.879> an

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
ports and here again couple USB ports an

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.309 
ports and here again couple USB ports an
HDMI<00:03:43.760> this<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.060> advert<00:03:45.450> one<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.930> power

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
HDMI this is the advert one and power

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:57.080 
HDMI this is the advert one and power
one<00:03:46.590> up<00:03:46.769> here<00:03:55.430> so<00:03:56.430> yeah<00:03:56.579> that's<00:03:56.819> pretty<00:03:56.879> much

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
one up here so yeah that's pretty much

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.619 
one up here so yeah that's pretty much
it<00:03:57.540> that's<00:03:57.780> basically<00:03:58.500> how<00:03:58.769> it<00:03:58.799> looks<00:03:59.099> like

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
it that's basically how it looks like

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:09.209 
it that's basically how it looks like
just<00:04:00.629> one<00:04:00.780> more<00:04:01.109> time<00:04:01.319> and<00:04:01.530> open<00:04:01.739> up<00:04:01.829> for<00:04:02.129> you

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:09.219 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:12.970 

you<00:04:10.219> get<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.700> opt<00:04:10.819> up<00:04:10.969> itself<00:04:11.769> to<00:04:12.769> power

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
you get to opt up itself to power

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.719 
you get to opt up itself to power
adapter<00:04:13.579> incorporate<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:15.379> battery<00:04:15.890> some

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
adapter incorporate the battery some

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.699 
adapter incorporate the battery some
sort<00:04:16.970> of<00:04:17.000> some<00:04:17.329> sort<00:04:17.359> of<00:04:17.630> instruction<00:04:18.049> manual

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
sort of some sort of instruction manual

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.529 
sort of some sort of instruction manual
and<00:04:18.799> integration<00:04:19.459> of<00:04:19.549> information<00:04:20.209> from<00:04:20.359> EU

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
and integration of information from EU

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.070 
and integration of information from EU
and<00:04:21.289> that's<00:04:21.620> pretty<00:04:21.829> much<00:04:21.949> it<00:04:22.100> so<00:04:22.720> that's<00:04:23.720> it<00:04:23.930> I

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
and that's pretty much it so that's it I

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.379 
and that's pretty much it so that's it I
would<00:04:24.199> say<00:04:24.490> that's<00:04:25.490> all<00:04:25.759> way<00:04:25.880> to<00:04:25.940> get<00:04:26.210> in<00:04:26.330> the

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
would say that's all way to get in the

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.600 
would say that's all way to get in the
box
