 games to determine the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.450
 platform but some time ago not 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.100
 far 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.260
 if you were in the mood to play in 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.690
 regulator before you needed to find 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.789
 someone who had an emulator can pass 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.399
 oo and the home of someone who had 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.530
 internet so you can download more 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.049
 chance of memory a thousand years to do the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.610
 virus is huge 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.490
 I remember the first regulator that 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.650
 he heard it was a cpu that had the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.159
 300 mega drive games 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.710
 if I'm not mistaken 360 mega drive games 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.290
 our mother and has exceeded is the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.930

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.409
 for you to choose from a child that is not 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.020
 The date with that human gets worse 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.750
 any time when you played and logo 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.220
 I 've seen those games and b1 I did not 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.110
 I have to introduce him always 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.970
 it appeared written right 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.369
 just like the mega-drive I had there 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.649
 and I soon realized that some 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.570
 games on that list I also had 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.579
 made mega drive to that I went 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.220
 understand that this was a 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.899
 simulator but I particularly called 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.490
 to give in the field to play in the mega 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.520
 drive on the computer 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.680
 Hey, man, do you mind if there's a Brazilian there? 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.909
 run a little after this time of the cd 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.409
 world on the beam 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.090
 I finally won the first 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.890
 computer 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.229
 staff was one of the best things I have ever 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.510
 I gained in my life without doubts. 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.720
 there as soon as I asked for an acquaintance of 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.040
 family that handled the pizzerias 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.920
 install some games electronics 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.160

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.080
 super nintendo mobile very good and is 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.030
 used until today I enjoyed a lot and 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.370
 made it very interesting because I 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.040
 had mega drive at home but the super 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.799
 nintendo only my cousin a neighbor but there 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.329
 when it arrived and simulator and my hands 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.160
 I had the chance to meet many 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.500
 new games and show them that I 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.989
 also handled from nintendo's console 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.700
 very crazy look who does not have a dog 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.180
 hunting with cat 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.910
 Time goes by and the bag goes crazy. 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.640
 Even when one day I find out that 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.700
 there is already a playstation emulator that 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.140
 it was working right our self 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.329
 I was too local to see it. 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.190
 because one thing is you 'mule' games 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.230
 more primitive as mega- drive and 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.299
 super nintendo something else is you 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.980

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.139
 your computer works 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.420
 I saw a simulator working there in 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.579
 computer in the house of a friend of mine and 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.069
 I was impressed and asked for 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.170
 his brother who owned the computer 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.069
 if he 's going to lend me the humor 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.170
 copy 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.510

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.370
 But what I ended up borrowing, I remember. 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.599
 very well he went through a floppy I went 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.239
 There at home is the law. 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.760

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.160

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.950
 I was very happy and I could not 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.290
 believe that I was running here in my 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.720
 computer and you can finally play 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.390
