00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
happen but they can't always stay on top

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.070 
happen but they can't always stay on top
and<00:04:30.370> you're<00:04:30.520> kind<00:04:30.730> of<00:04:30.790> going<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.150> roll<00:04:31.660> your

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
then another easy step is a loop turns

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.070 
then another easy step is a loop turns
he's<00:05:02.290> an<00:05:02.440> interesting<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:03.250> have<00:05:03.340> everybody<00:05:04.080> so
