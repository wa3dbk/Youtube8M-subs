 hello friends speak to you the voice of the future mister yuyito in this 

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:08.179
 I will explain how to add musical guitar jero three with the 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:09.839
 sound editor 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.650
 first we must have installed the patch 1 point one of guitars and the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.999
 three that I will leave in the description of the video 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:20.519
 second we must have the song program editor list that we leave them in 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.619
 description to download it 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.890
 third any audio converter can serve them and finally a 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.720
 page to download the music that also leave them in description 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:34.210
 Each music has its level of difficulty to touch it and to be able to 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.300
 download a music we have to create an account but it's fast 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.180
 let's start the first thing we have to do to download a song from the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.630
 page that leaves them 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.320
 we create a folder to save them now unzip the file after 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.320
 unzip we will have a folder with the name of the song within 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.600
 that folder we are going to find two files with format or gg one called 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.800
 vital and the other called are and another file called notes the two files or 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.159
 gg we are going to transform them to mp3 format with the converter that we have 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.360
 done this we open the sound editor 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.610
 we give it where it says cahil in the upper left part then open and we look for the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.630
 folder where the default game is installed and look for the time folder 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.170
 tae 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.170
 and we give you to accept 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.790
 then we will see all the songs that are in the game for 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.500
 defect then we give it where it says inserm and mailing in the lower left we 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.410
 a box like this will appear in the first box that says are name 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.710
 we put the name of the song but in lowercase and without separating 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.210
 in the second box where it says remove tracy we give it in thickness and we look for the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.120
 file remove but the one that we have transformed and we put it will not come out 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.200
 a warning will come out and we'll accept the gap in the next two boxes 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 let's put the file are then where it says 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.370
 the opposition venue goes the time that the music will sound when the selection 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.419
 m 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:20.500
 in the game 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.230
 we put 10 then where are voices we leave it in zero then where it says my fa and 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.230
 we are going to put the file nights 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.889
 in the next box where it says are we who put the name again 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.839
 of the song and this time we can put it in capital letters and separate 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.129
 then in the next box where it says artist obviously goes the name of the 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.129
 artist 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:03.229
 and in the next box where it says year is the year of music 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:06.749
 if we know it we put it if we do not put any year then in the part 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:11.649
 left ds cuadrito where volume says the first we leave it in 100 the second 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:15.709
 we put it in 95 and the third in 90 and we give it is what there is 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.709
 and we let the program add the song 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:41.349
 it may take 30 to 40 seconds to wait until it says where 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.989
 is that the program ends from adding the music to the game we go to the 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.209

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.169
