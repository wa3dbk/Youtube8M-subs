and it's gonna be like an office

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.250 
and it's gonna be like an office
building<00:05:09.550> like<00:05:09.850> like<00:05:10.180> kind<00:05:10.600> of<00:05:10.630> like<00:05:10.690> one<00:05:11.229> of

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
building like like kind of like one of

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.320 
building like like kind of like one of
the<00:05:11.520> one<00:05:12.520> of<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.669> World<00:05:12.820> Trade<00:05:13.030> Center

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
buildings like kind of like that I don't

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.110 
buildings like kind of like that I don't
know<00:05:15.100> how<00:05:15.190> I'm<00:05:15.280> gonna<00:05:15.370> build<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.669> outside<00:05:16.000> to

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
know how I'm gonna build the outside to

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.800 
know how I'm gonna build the outside to
look<00:05:16.240> like<00:05:16.479> it<00:05:16.630> but<00:05:16.810> I'll<00:05:17.229> think<00:05:17.440> of<00:05:17.530> something

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
look like it but I'll think of something

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.510 
look like it but I'll think of something
we<00:05:19.810> can<00:05:20.020> use<00:05:20.050> a<00:05:20.229> three<00:05:20.770> half<00:05:20.950> steps<00:05:21.100> to<00:05:21.370> make

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
we can use a three half steps to make

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.990 
we can use a three half steps to make
little<00:05:21.790> sliver<00:05:22.360> windows<00:05:23.430> and<00:05:24.430> you<00:05:24.580> guys<00:05:24.729> are

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
little sliver windows and you guys are

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.240 
little sliver windows and you guys are
like<00:05:25.120> I<00:05:25.360> don't<00:05:25.780> I<00:05:26.200> don't<00:05:26.650> know<00:05:26.919> what<00:05:27.070> about

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
like I don't I don't know what about

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.640 
like I don't I don't know what about
your<00:05:27.430> fancy<00:05:28.120> you<00:05:28.810> know<00:05:28.900> building<00:05:29.260> techniques

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
your fancy you know building techniques

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.110 
your fancy you know building techniques
you<00:05:29.740> got<00:05:29.860> to<00:05:29.950> show<00:05:30.100> me<00:05:30.130> that<00:05:30.250> man<00:05:30.550> when<00:05:31.030> I'm

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
you got to show me that man when I'm

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.600 
you got to show me that man when I'm
ready<00:05:31.300> to<00:05:31.390> do<00:05:31.510> it<00:05:32.070> cuz<00:05:33.070> I<00:05:33.190> don't<00:05:33.250> even<00:05:33.400> know
