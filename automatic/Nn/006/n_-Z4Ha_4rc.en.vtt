00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
trying to learn all that you can launch

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.350 
trying to learn all that you can launch
because<00:04:01.340> you<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.460> I<00:04:02.580> do<00:04:02.640> we<00:04:03.000> don't<00:04:03.150> know<00:04:03.240> at

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
because you and I do we don't know at

because you and I do we don't know at
all<00:04:03.530> but<00:04:04.530> we<00:04:04.710> need<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:04.980> teach<00:04:05.130> them<00:04:05.310> where<00:04:05.580> they

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
all but we need to teach them where they

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.290 
all but we need to teach them where they
can<00:04:05.790> find<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.480> information<00:04:06.570> that<00:04:07.110> they<00:04:07.230> need

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
can find the information that they need

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.520 
can find the information that they need
that's<00:04:09.300> kind<00:04:09.570> of<00:04:09.600> what<00:04:09.720> we're<00:04:09.870> here<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.200> do<00:04:10.320> as

the<00:04:22.620> 1980s<00:04:23.490> were<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.610> trying<00:04:24.000> time<00:04:24.330> for

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
the 1980s were a trying time for

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.010 
the 1980s were a trying time for
beekeepers<00:04:25.080> as<00:04:25.410> well<00:04:26.180> then<00:04:27.180> we<00:04:27.330> started<00:04:27.840> with

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
beekeepers as well then we started with

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.630 
beekeepers as well then we started with
back<00:04:28.230> then<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.680> net<00:04:28.860> start<00:04:29.100> studying<00:04:29.490> and

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
back then the net start studying and

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.800 
back then the net start studying and
reading<00:04:29.790> and<00:04:30.030> trying<00:04:30.180> to<00:04:30.240> figure<00:04:30.420> out<00:04:30.630> exactly

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
reading and trying to figure out exactly

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.330 
reading and trying to figure out exactly
what<00:04:31.260> we're<00:04:31.620> gonna<00:04:31.800> have<00:04:31.890> to<00:04:32.010> do<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.220> survive

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
what we're gonna have to do to survive

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.080 
what we're gonna have to do to survive
and<00:04:33.150> then<00:04:33.630> as<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:34.440> years<00:04:34.650> went<00:04:34.860> along<00:04:35.160> we

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
and then as the years went along we

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.970 
and then as the years went along we
realized<00:04:36.420> that<00:04:36.540> our<00:04:36.690> local<00:04:37.080> bees<00:04:37.290> if<00:04:37.770> they

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
realized that our local bees if they

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.970 
realized that our local bees if they
could<00:04:38.250> survive<00:04:38.640> and<00:04:38.970> could<00:04:39.150> be<00:04:39.300> bred<00:04:39.980> through

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
could survive and could be bred through

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.680 
could survive and could be bred through
genetics<00:04:41.430> then<00:04:41.670> we<00:04:41.850> that<00:04:42.150> was<00:04:42.390> what<00:04:42.540> we

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
genetics then we that was what we

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.080 
genetics then we that was what we
thought<00:04:43.010> was<00:04:44.010> what<00:04:44.190> we<00:04:44.310> need<00:04:44.460> to<00:04:44.550> do<00:04:44.730> so<00:04:44.940> in

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
thought was what we need to do so in

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.780 
thought was what we need to do so in
long<00:04:45.480> story<00:04:45.870> short<00:04:46.200> I<00:04:46.470> ended<00:04:47.040> up<00:04:47.430> one<00:04:47.610> with<00:04:47.730> the

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
long story short I ended up one with the

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.040 
long story short I ended up one with the
Russian<00:04:48.090> of<00:04:48.150> me<00:04:48.240> because<00:04:48.570> there<00:04:48.750> are<00:04:48.780> more

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
Russian of me because there are more

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.480 
Russian of me because there are more
colorful<00:04:49.320> mites<00:04:50.660> and<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:52.290> here<00:04:52.680> again<00:04:52.800> when

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
colorful mites and and here again when

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.370 
colorful mites and and here again when
you<00:04:53.610> when<00:04:54.120> we<00:04:54.270> start<00:04:54.540> with<00:04:54.690> Russian<00:04:55.020> leads<00:04:55.200> it

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
you when we start with Russian leads it

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.870 
you when we start with Russian leads it
was<00:04:55.470> almost<00:04:55.650> like<00:04:55.890> we<00:04:56.070> had<00:04:56.190> to<00:04:56.250> learn<00:04:56.370> how<00:04:56.640> to

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
was almost like we had to learn how to

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.730 
was almost like we had to learn how to
be<00:04:57.510> keeping<00:04:57.840> all<00:04:57.930> over<00:04:58.200> again<00:04:58.350> because<00:04:58.440> they

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
be keeping all over again because they

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.950 
be keeping all over again because they
were<00:04:58.830> different<00:04:59.130> from<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.370> Italians<00:04:59.790> and<00:05:00.000> in

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
were different from the Italians and in

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.660 
were different from the Italians and in
so<00:05:01.170> doing<00:05:01.200> it's<00:05:01.650> a<00:05:01.800> it's<00:05:02.040> a<00:05:02.160> different<00:05:02.490> bead

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
so doing it's a it's a different bead

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.520 
so doing it's a it's a different bead
you<00:05:03.090> know<00:05:03.180> they<00:05:03.330> winter<00:05:03.990> with<00:05:04.140> a<00:05:04.170> smaller

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
you know they winter with a smaller

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.580 
you know they winter with a smaller
cluster<00:05:05.040> they're<00:05:05.820> more<00:05:06.060> aggressive<00:05:06.410> but<00:05:07.410> all

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
cluster they're more aggressive but all

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.800 
cluster they're more aggressive but all
said<00:05:08.040> and<00:05:08.160> done<00:05:08.250> they<00:05:08.790> will<00:05:09.000> survive<00:05:09.450> the<00:05:09.630> mite

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
said and done they will survive the mite

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.800 
said and done they will survive the mite
with<00:05:10.350> a<00:05:10.380> little<00:05:10.620> bit<00:05:10.710> of<00:05:10.800> help<00:05:11.390> it's<00:05:12.390> it's<00:05:12.720> a

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
with a little bit of help it's it's a

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.680 
with a little bit of help it's it's a
tough<00:05:13.020> hobby<00:05:13.430> and<00:05:14.430> if<00:05:14.610> you<00:05:14.790> try<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.450> take<00:05:15.630> it

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
tough hobby and if you try to take it

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.930 
tough hobby and if you try to take it
any<00:05:15.870> further<00:05:15.930> than<00:05:16.169> a<00:05:16.290> hobby<00:05:16.850> gets<00:05:17.850> too

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
any further than a hobby gets too

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.620 
any further than a hobby gets too
expensive<00:05:18.270> it's<00:05:18.900> harder<00:05:19.620> to<00:05:20.340> justify<00:05:21.330> what

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
expensive it's harder to justify what

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.600 
expensive it's harder to justify what
you're<00:05:21.720> doing<00:05:21.990> from<00:05:22.110> a<00:05:22.260> dollars<00:05:22.560> or<00:05:22.710> cents<00:05:22.919> and

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
you're doing from a dollars or cents and

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.480 
you're doing from a dollars or cents and
one<00:05:23.850> so<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:25.110> next<00:05:25.320> time<00:05:25.620> you<00:05:25.890> encounter<00:05:26.460> a
