 President of the Mexican Federation of 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.990
 football expressed one of their dreams that 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.550
 Mexico hosted the 2026 World Cup but 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.500
 it turns out that organizing a world cup

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.970
 No number of requirements asked by the fifa 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.760

 of course security guarantees 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.489

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.820
 that have been established in the past 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.320
 years and they are the existence of between 8 and 10 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.110
