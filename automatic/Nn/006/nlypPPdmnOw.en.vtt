00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.590 
checking out 4j Studios twitter feed and
it<00:00:46.680> turns<00:00:47.010> out<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.219> texture<00:00:47.910> pack<00:00:48.120> support

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
it turns out that texture pack support

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.900 
it turns out that texture pack support
is<00:00:48.870> going<00:00:49.500> ok<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.070> they<00:00:50.160> can't<00:00:50.399> actually<00:00:50.489> say

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
is going ok but they can't actually say

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.779 
is going ok but they can't actually say
more<00:00:51.210> at<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> moment<00:00:51.449> now<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.710> know<00:00:53.340> that's<00:00:53.640> not

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
more at the moment now I know that's not

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.330 
more at the moment now I know that's not
really<00:00:54.180> too<00:00:54.809> much<00:00:54.840> information<00:00:55.680> right<00:00:56.309> there

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
really too much information right there

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.630 
really too much information right there
but<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:58.410> reason<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.980> decided<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.520> I'd

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
but the reason that I decided that I'd

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.970 
but the reason that I decided that I'd
make<00:00:59.820> this<00:00:59.940> video<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.480> because<00:01:00.719> as<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.859> all

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980
