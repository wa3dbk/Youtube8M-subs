sea<00:00:28.830> miles<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:31.219> took<00:00:32.219> over<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> J<00:00:33.000> about

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
sea miles and I took over on a J about

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.690 
sea miles and I took over on a J about
two<00:00:33.480> years<00:00:33.719> ago<00:00:33.930> one<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> first<00:00:35.460> problems

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
two years ago one of the first problems

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.319 
two years ago one of the first problems
we<00:00:36.059> had<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:38.100> stabilization<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.180> boat

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
we had was the stabilization of the boat

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.440 
we had was the stabilization of the boat
we<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:39.960> an<00:00:40.079> existing<00:00:40.920> stable<00:00:41.550> stabilization

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
we have an existing stable stabilization

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.639 
we have an existing stable stabilization
system<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.530> underway<00:00:44.149> which<00:00:45.149> was<00:00:45.329> actually

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
system for underway which was actually

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.020 
system for underway which was actually
okay<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:46.860> as<00:00:46.950> soon<00:00:47.160> as<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.399> stopped<00:00:47.789> and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
okay but as soon as we stopped and

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.420 
okay but as soon as we stopped and
anchored<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.829> where<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> problems

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
anchored this is where the problems

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.510 
anchored this is where the problems
began<00:00:51.230> we<00:00:52.230> did<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> first<00:00:52.680> season<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
began we did the first season the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.650 
began we did the first season the
children<00:00:53.940> got<00:00:54.120> sick<00:00:56.090> some<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.180> our<00:00:57.270> charter

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
children got sick some of our charter

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.830 
children got sick some of our charter
guests<00:00:57.930> got<00:00:58.379> seasick<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.390> the<00:01:00.390> boss<00:01:00.629> was

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
guests got seasick and the boss was

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.650 
guests got seasick and the boss was
pretty<00:01:01.079> adamant<00:01:01.199> about<00:01:01.559> me<00:01:01.829> looking<00:01:02.100> into

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
pretty adamant about me looking into

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.329 
pretty adamant about me looking into
finding<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.780> system<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.379> could<00:01:04.619> not<00:01:05.309> only

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
finding a system that could not only

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.780 
finding a system that could not only
work<00:01:05.790> at<00:01:05.970> sea<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.600> could<00:01:07.040> work<00:01:08.040> while<00:01:08.400> at<00:01:08.430> rest

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
work at sea but could work while at rest

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.080 
work at sea but could work while at rest
while<00:01:09.119> at<00:01:09.299> anchor<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.130> did<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> lot<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.700> study

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
while at anchor so I did a lot of study

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.810 
while at anchor so I did a lot of study
and<00:01:12.390> came<00:01:12.780> up<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.290> what<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> fairly<00:01:14.670> new

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
and came up with what is a fairly new

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.810 
and came up with what is a fairly new
system<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:16.439> slightly<00:01:16.770> brought<00:01:17.189> out<00:01:17.369> their

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
system that slightly brought out their

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.090 
system that slightly brought out their
offering<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.270> really<00:01:18.509> compact<00:01:18.960> system<00:01:19.830> which

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
offering a really compact system which

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.280 
offering a really compact system which
we<00:01:20.280> could<00:01:20.520> put<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.880> our<00:01:21.060> existing<00:01:21.659> under<00:01:22.170> our

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
we could put in our existing under our

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.920 
we could put in our existing under our
existing<00:01:22.860> floor<00:01:23.330> hook<00:01:24.330> into<00:01:24.570> our<00:01:24.810> existing

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
existing floor hook into our existing

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.980 
existing floor hook into our existing
hydraulic<00:01:25.860> system<00:01:26.280> which<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.330> meant<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.750> have

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
hydraulic system which is meant I have

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.410 
hydraulic system which is meant I have
to<00:01:28.110> say<00:01:28.320> outstanding<00:01:29.070> results<00:01:31.729> it<00:01:32.729> really<00:01:33.210> has

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
to say outstanding results it really has

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.310 
to say outstanding results it really has
made<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.960> massive<00:01:34.380> difference<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.900> way<00:01:37.049> we

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
made a massive difference to the way we

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.819 
made a massive difference to the way we
run<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.189> boat<00:01:38.400> we<00:01:38.939> traditionally<00:01:39.799> have<00:01:40.799> been

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
run the boat we traditionally have been

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.310 
run the boat we traditionally have been
going<00:01:41.280> into<00:01:41.549> marinas<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.150> night<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.750> found<00:01:42.990> now

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
going into marinas at night we found now

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.230 
going into marinas at night we found now
that<00:01:43.770> we're<00:01:43.920> spending<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.340> lot<00:01:44.369> more<00:01:44.610> time<00:01:44.850> at

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
that we're spending a lot more time at

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.840 
that we're spending a lot more time at
anchor<00:01:45.570> because<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.950> go<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.250> places<00:01:47.610> that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
anchor because we can go to places that

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.539 
anchor because we can go to places that
yes<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.350> bit<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.619> swell<00:01:49.860> put

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
yes there is a little bit of swell put

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.090 
yes there is a little bit of swell put
the<00:01:50.670> zeros<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.450> we're<00:01:52.320> spending<00:01:52.560> our<00:01:52.860> time

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the zeros on and we're spending our time

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.819 
the zeros on and we're spending our time
in<00:01:53.340> nature<00:01:53.720> outside<00:01:54.720> under<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.110> stars<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
in nature outside under the stars in a

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.510 
in nature outside under the stars in a
bay<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:57.000> basically

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
bay so basically

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.569 
bay so basically

before we put the side power slide the
system<00:02:16.819> in<00:02:16.970> was<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.989> effect<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.500> would
