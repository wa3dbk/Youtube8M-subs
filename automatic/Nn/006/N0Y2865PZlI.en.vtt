change all these raw materials have to

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.640 
change all these raw materials have to
be<00:02:02.950> imported<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:04.330> that<00:02:04.510> keeps<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:05.020> cost<00:02:05.290> up

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
be imported and that keeps the cost up

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.430 
be imported and that keeps the cost up

off the ground right now we because of

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
the cost prohibitive nests we have to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.900 
the cost prohibitive nests we have to
sell<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.840> higher<00:02:14.710> end<00:02:14.980> market<00:02:15.220> where<00:02:15.670> this

sell to a higher end market where this

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.810 
sell to a higher end market where this
material<00:02:16.120> should<00:02:16.600> be<00:02:16.690> available<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.170> everyone

now<00:02:18.820> there<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.120> bill<00:02:19.450> in<00:02:19.480> Congress<00:02:20.080> that

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
now there is a bill in Congress that

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.110 
now there is a bill in Congress that
would<00:02:20.350> legalize<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.340> growing<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.000> the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
would legalize the growing and the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.300 
would legalize the growing and the
processing<00:02:22.960> of<00:02:23.070> industrial<00:02:24.070> hemp

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310

essentially<00:02:24.910> take<00:02:25.210> it<00:02:25.330> off<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.600> list<00:02:25.810> of

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
essentially take it off the list of

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.620 
essentially take it off the list of

controlled substances states like North

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.330 
controlled substances states like North
Dakota<00:02:28.990> have<00:02:29.200> already<00:02:29.500> done<00:02:29.740> that<00:02:29.770> but<00:02:29.980> they

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
Dakota have already done that but they

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.700 
Dakota have already done that but they
can't<00:02:30.580> get<00:02:30.760> past<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.540> federal<00:02:31.930> law<00:02:32.110> Emilia

can<00:02:39.130> tell<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.490> biggest<00:02:39.850> reason<00:02:40.209> is<00:02:40.300> for

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
can tell you the biggest reason is for

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.510 
can tell you the biggest reason is for
health<00:02:40.690> concerns<00:02:41.160> conventional<00:02:42.160> building

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
health concerns conventional building

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.310 
health concerns conventional building
products<00:02:43.030> can<00:02:43.180> give<00:02:43.360> off<00:02:43.540> toxins<00:02:44.110> like

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
products can give off toxins like

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.470 
products can give off toxins like
formaldehyde<00:02:44.770> of<00:02:45.220> course<00:02:45.459> which<00:02:45.970> get<00:02:46.180> trapped

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
formaldehyde of course which get trapped

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.320 
formaldehyde of course which get trapped
in<00:02:46.750> today's<00:02:47.020> airtight<00:02:47.650> construction<00:02:48.490> so

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
in today's airtight construction so

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.240 
in today's airtight construction so
contractors<00:02:49.930> say<00:02:50.080> families<00:02:50.560> are<00:02:50.709> requesting

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
contractors say families are requesting

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.430 
contractors say families are requesting
hemp<00:02:51.459> materials<00:02:51.940> for<00:02:52.450> health<00:02:52.660> benefits<00:02:52.840> alone

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
hemp materials for health benefits alone

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.380 
hemp materials for health benefits alone
so<00:02:53.770> we'll<00:02:53.920> see<00:02:54.130> if<00:02:54.280> this<00:02:54.459> federal<00:02:54.970> bill<00:02:55.180> can

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
so we'll see if this federal bill can

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.730 
so we'll see if this federal bill can
get<00:02:55.540> passed<00:02:55.750> they<00:02:55.900> might<00:02:56.050> see<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.230> lot<00:02:56.410> more<00:02:56.620> of

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
get passed they might see a lot more of

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.560 
get passed they might see a lot more of
them<00:02:56.890> yeah<00:02:57.160> mold<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:57.700> mildew<00:02:57.910> resistant

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
them yeah mold and mildew resistant

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.480 
them yeah mold and mildew resistant
sound<00:02:58.750> interesting<00:02:59.320> pretty<00:02:59.530> good<00:02:59.740> yeah<00:03:00.010> all
