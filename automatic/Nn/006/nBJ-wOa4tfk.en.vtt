00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
best buy because everybody believes in

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.750 
best buy because everybody believes in
the<00:02:11.810> hype<00:02:12.080> of<00:02:12.110> this<00:02:12.560> recovery<00:02:12.950> but<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:13.340> know<00:02:13.490> the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
the hype of this recovery but I know the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.330 
the hype of this recovery but I know the
recovery<00:02:14.360> is<00:02:14.420> an<00:02:14.630> illusion<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.530> doesn't<00:02:15.950> exist

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340

recovery is an illusion it doesn't exist
and<00:02:16.520> I<00:02:16.640> think<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.090> best<00:02:17.300> buy<00:02:17.510> sale<00:02:18.020> show<00:02:18.500> that

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
and I think the best buy sale show that

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.770 
and I think the best buy sale show that
that<00:02:18.980> average<00:02:19.670> Americans<00:02:20.300> are<00:02:20.540> not
