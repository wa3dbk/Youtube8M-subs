we are at version 18.2 not sure if
that's<00:00:33.030> accurate<00:00:33.300> but<00:00:33.780> that's<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.260> last

catch that video my biggest complaints

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.700 
catch that video my biggest complaints
about<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.670> game<00:00:44.940> had<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.690> do<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> fact

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
about this game had to do with the fact

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.130 
about this game had to do with the fact
that<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.980> game<00:00:47.160> felt<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.300> little<00:00:48.930> too

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
that the game felt one a little too

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.540 
that the game felt one a little too
grindy<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.160> two<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.180> really<00:00:51.870> didn't<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
grindy and two I really didn't like the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.060 
grindy and two I really didn't like the
base<00:00:53.789> building<00:00:54.149> mechanics<00:00:54.809> now<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.590> like

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
base building mechanics now I do like

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.040 
base building mechanics now I do like
the<00:00:56.100> whole<00:00:56.520> crafting<00:00:57.149> station<00:00:57.360> thing<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.930> this

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the whole crafting station thing in this

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.139 
the whole crafting station thing in this
game<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.980> different<00:00:59.309> crafting<00:00:59.730> stations

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
game we have different crafting stations

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.510 
game we have different crafting stations
to<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.600> different<00:01:01.050> things<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.649> totally<00:01:02.340> dig

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
to do different things I totally dig

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.460 
to do different things I totally dig
that<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.730> think<00:01:03.000> that's<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.239> cool<00:01:03.390> thing<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that I think that's a cool thing but the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.100 
that I think that's a cool thing but the
base<00:01:04.680> building<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.339> game<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.939> still<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
base building in this game is still a

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.770 
base building in this game is still a
bit<00:01:07.439> funky<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.369> feels<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.330> don't<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
bit funky it feels like you don't have a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.590 
bit funky it feels like you don't have a
lot<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.020> freedom<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.740> far<00:01:11.400> as<00:01:11.610> how<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.299> can

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
lot of freedom as far as how you can

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.030 
lot of freedom as far as how you can
construct<00:01:13.080> your<00:01:13.170> base<00:01:13.380> because<00:01:13.830> you're

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
construct your base because you're

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.460 
construct your base because you're
building<00:01:14.400> essentially<00:01:14.939> entire<00:01:15.659> rooms<00:01:16.140> or

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
building essentially entire rooms or

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.550 
building essentially entire rooms or
entire<00:01:16.770> sections<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:18.600> hard<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.320> get

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
entire sections and it's hard to get

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.820 
entire sections and it's hard to get
like<00:01:20.009> super<00:01:20.250> creative<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.590> in<00:01:22.590> any

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
like super creative with that in any

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.280 
like super creative with that in any
case<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.490> seems<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.360> developers<00:01:24.990> have

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
case it seems that the developers have

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.649 
case it seems that the developers have
been<00:01:25.650> working<00:01:26.130> hard<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.060> game<00:01:27.330> to

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
been working hard on this game to

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.109 
been working hard on this game to
improve<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.710> they<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.579> done<00:01:29.850> things

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
improve it and they have done things

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.350 
improve it and they have done things
that<00:01:30.680> definitely<00:01:31.680> for<00:01:32.340> me<00:01:32.460> personally<00:01:32.729> have

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
that definitely for me personally have

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.719 
that definitely for me personally have
improved<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> game<00:01:34.110> substantially<00:01:34.979> things

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
improved the game substantially things

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.719 
improved the game substantially things
like<00:01:36.090> when<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.049> upgrade<00:01:37.380> your<00:01:37.680> tool<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.520> get

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
like when you upgrade your tool you get

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.270 
like when you upgrade your tool you get
more<00:01:38.880> resources<00:01:39.150> when<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.900> mind<00:01:40.200> similar<00:01:41.130> to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
more resources when you mind similar to

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.950 
more resources when you mind similar to
how<00:01:41.430> planet<00:01:41.909> explorers<00:01:42.240> worked<00:01:42.600> which<00:01:42.810> I

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
how planet explorers worked which I

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.550 
how planet explorers worked which I
really<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.500> system<00:01:44.149> the<00:01:45.149> armor<00:01:46.140> looks

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
really like that system the armor looks

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.350 
really like that system the armor looks
better<00:01:46.920> than<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.220> did<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.790> was<00:01:47.880> really<00:01:48.149> wonky

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
better than it did it was really wonky

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.710 
better than it did it was really wonky

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
vehicles and like you can go to

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.959 
vehicles and like you can go to
different<00:02:03.090> planets<00:02:03.450> via<00:02:04.140> gate<00:02:04.649> there<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.759> just

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
different planets via gate there is just

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.880 
different planets via gate there is just
a<00:02:06.149> ton<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.600> stuff<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.350> they've<00:02:07.469> added<00:02:07.799> to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.699 
a ton of stuff that they've added to
this<00:02:08.009> game<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.000> think<00:02:09.330> has<00:02:09.569> made<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.560> game

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
this game that I think has made the game

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.430 
this game that I think has made the game
a<00:02:10.950> whole<00:02:11.370> lot<00:02:11.760> more<00:02:12.030> fun<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.959> whole<00:02:13.230> lot

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440

these blueprints in higher level

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.070 
these blueprints in higher level
dungeons<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.640> stuff<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.210> in<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.990> beginning

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080

the higher stuff i assume is going to be
in<00:03:34.020> level<00:03:34.380> 10<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.950> i<00:03:35.310> don't<00:03:35.520> know<00:03:35.580> what<00:03:36.390> the
