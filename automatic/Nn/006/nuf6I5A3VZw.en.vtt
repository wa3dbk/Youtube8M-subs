00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.250
 wand 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:42.510
 make a difference of colors and choose color 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:45.059
 75 clicks click on the white background around 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.899
 white that we have even possible to 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.079
 icon, too, Kohl clicks now turned 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.390
 like that click on selected 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.969
 invest selected turned out here 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.129
 so what we do next choose 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.460
 copy 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:05.400
 go to our picture click 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.140
 insert it turned out like this we do not want 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.510
 so that our fashionable women look there somewhere 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.990
 so even somewhere went to press for the layer 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:23.490
 convert or click tsetor weave 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:27.630
 then we will transform it as ready 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.049
 this thing is ready dummy put it on 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.920
 outskirts turned out like this we do not want 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.310
 to make the wings stand out so we take 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.750
 wings and push straight to her 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.500
 what do next do we reduce 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.680
 dummy and reduce the wings also 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.880
 transform your and transform 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.369
 then again take the wings can still 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.960
 undo right here at the bottom of the fast panel 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.090
 or edit cancel also cetor z 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.640
 take the wings away 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.500
 why they can increase them to me 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.069
 it seems they can be thrown there 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.660
 somewhere 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:15.300
 and for example you can leave it like this but it 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.730
 roughly said to be seen as their 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.310
 you can also transfer if you have 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.940
 a large file can be made differently 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.190
 you can transfer only the wings but how are you 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.349
 see there will be trouble here will even give 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.629
 will choose a different color but so this 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.230
 easier layout immediately transfer can 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:37.500
 tidy up the wings and draw calmly then 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.540
 again do and how you want it already 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.730

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.540
 turn them over there don't know how you want 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.360
 increase reduce it according to you 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.430
