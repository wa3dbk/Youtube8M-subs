you'll<00:07:33.639> probably<00:07:33.789> take<00:07:34.210> a<00:07:34.270> beating<00:07:34.659> the<00:07:34.750> first

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 
you'll probably take a beating the first

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.469 
you'll probably take a beating the first
several<00:07:35.199> online<00:07:35.620> matches<00:07:35.860> that<00:07:36.129> you<00:07:36.220> play<00:07:36.479> the

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 
several online matches that you play the

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:39.129 
territories gameplay is nothing new to

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:40.619 
territories gameplay is nothing new to
us<00:07:39.250> but<00:07:39.699> the<00:07:39.789> implementation<00:07:40.030> of<00:07:40.509> the

00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:40.629 
us but the implementation of the

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:42.480 
us but the implementation of the
class-based<00:07:41.080> loadouts<00:07:41.590> sprinting<00:07:42.370> and

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:42.490 
class-based loadouts sprinting and

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.369 
class-based loadouts sprinting and
flying<00:07:42.550> with<00:07:42.879> the<00:07:43.060> awesome<00:07:43.449> weapons<00:07:43.780> really

00:07:44.369 --> 00:07:44.379 
flying with the awesome weapons really

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:46.920 
flying with the awesome weapons really
makes<00:07:44.560> it<00:07:44.680> quite<00:07:44.889> fun<00:07:45.150> my<00:07:46.150> only<00:07:46.330> problem<00:07:46.539> is<00:07:46.780> it

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:46.930 
makes it quite fun my only problem is it

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.390 
makes it quite fun my only problem is it
costs<00:07:47.229> 60<00:07:47.530> bucks<00:07:47.770> for<00:07:48.039> a<00:07:48.069> repetitive

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 
costs 60 bucks for a repetitive

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.240 
costs 60 bucks for a repetitive
multiplayer<00:07:49.270> only<00:07:49.449> game<00:07:49.780> personally<00:07:50.620> I<00:07:50.979> think

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.250 
multiplayer only game personally I think

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.070 
multiplayer only game personally I think
section<00:07:51.729> 8<00:07:51.849> is<00:07:51.970> a<00:07:52.000> great<00:07:52.300> game<00:07:52.509> for<00:07:52.750> what<00:07:52.840> it<00:07:52.870> is

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 
section 8 is a great game for what it is

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.930 
section 8 is a great game for what it is
but<00:07:53.530> I'd<00:07:53.680> probably<00:07:54.009> wait<00:07:54.400> until<00:07:54.669> the<00:07:54.759> price

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:54.940 
but I'd probably wait until the price

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.279 
but I'd probably wait until the price
drops<00:07:55.240> a<00:07:55.330> bit<00:07:55.479> so<00:07:55.599> that<00:07:55.720> you<00:07:55.840> can<00:07:55.960> keep<00:07:56.139> this

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:56.289 
drops a bit so that you can keep this

00:07:56.289 --> 00:07:57.870 
drops a bit so that you can keep this
one<00:07:56.349> laying<00:07:56.740> around<00:07:56.860> for<00:07:57.460> those<00:07:57.580> times<00:07:57.759> when
