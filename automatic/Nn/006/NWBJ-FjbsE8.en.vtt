00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.180
 hello to all and welcome to the 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.350
 modding chain point fr today 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.310
 we will present a motherboard 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.380
 asus seen as 97 aids and chipsets to 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.150
 97.2 chine theater are felt so 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.310
 all brands have released their 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.449
 own motherboards and that's asus which 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.650
 sticks with the maximus 7 rangers so 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.920
 we will start with the box of course 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.309
 red box we are on the rog range of 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:40.300
 at asus so a maximum 7 put away a 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:43.270
 motherboard in tea format xx which manages 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.399
 so of course the chip 7z 97 again 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.340
 chipset from intel that will allow 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.610
 to welcome new processors to 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.000
 wish them is cool 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.489
 so we stayed 1 on the socket 11.50 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.250
 that with the accounting of others d 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.899
 other processors da gama under the water of 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.000
 the box we find the main assets 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.830
 of the motherboard with supremefx the 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.039
 grating is degraded to 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.259
 specifications and the detail of the 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.720
 inlets out of the back plate on 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.310
 lift the flap and we find a you 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.920
 not the motherboard itself but a 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.810
 photo of this one with a maximum of 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.780
 legend to know the 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.869
 elements the components of which is truffle 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.209
 the maximus 7 put away on the flap on 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.700
 find other details on assets 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:32.560
 of the motherboard and that the kiteboat a 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.860
 little obliged the earthlings on the network and 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.860
 the audio part we pass on the bundle 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.150
 as sure, we find the guide 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.580
 use in English and beg ziff 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.160
 with some pictures some schemas 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.130
 earlier the door sign saying of 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.320
 do not disturb the dvd drivers 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.940
 utilities a whole range of small 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.400
 sticker or to recognize 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.979
 the cables that you set up 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.800
 cables thus sata four tata caps of which 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:07.960
 two to big town b d2 with a shot 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:10.959
 right the bridge sly the yoshis of hamburg 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.310
 is in France and not upholstered and the 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.709
 asses connector that will allow you to 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.870
 facilitate the establishment of catches 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.670
 case now see what 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.790
 looks like this maxim u17 tidy this 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.530
 so a motherboard in dx co2 format 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.020
 red and black colors we are in the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.260
 rog range from asus two big 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.630
 heatsinks for logic 7 and 97 another 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.280
 for the supply stages in addition 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.230
 of the three ports pci-e 1x we have 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.360
 three PCIe 16x ports , both of which 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.250
 red will allow the sly the crossfire 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.370
 the third is managed by the chipset 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.600
 and 87 in 4x 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.489
 we review in more detail the 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.950
 dissipators so whoever covers the 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.769
 chipset g41 17 which features the logo 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.840
 rogge from asus 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.230
 what covers dairy feeds 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.810
 we find the name of the model rangers 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.190
 so six aluminum drummers his 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.930
 heatsinks are also reinforced 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.700
 by plates on the back of the card 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.250
 mother making it possible to rigidify 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.920
 all we have an audio part 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.440
 well isolated from the rest pcb this line 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.000
 yellow which will be backlit so is 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.000
 managed by the supremefx chip 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.260
 with the audio port for the background of 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.290
 case panels so a good black pcb 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.330
 mat it's really nice same level of 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.860
 lines no traces of brown color 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.269
 or whatever it is hard to 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.200
 Chinese 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.989
 we continue with different 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.170
 connectivity with a home staging button 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.590
 or clear tones semos the connectors for 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.129
 basic capital option with asus 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.890
 two jacks of two usb 2.0 ports a 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.590
 fans pre- learned button 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.549
 curd a rpm module and the 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.849
 different connectors for the case 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:04:00.709
 we have six sata ports 6 for sata 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.709
 iii managed by the z90 is 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.630
 then come the internal 3.0 usb port 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.270
 with a second intake of fans 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.760
 antimatter practice these 24 pins 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.070
 with 4 LEDs that allow actually 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.080
 know the startup sequences or 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.690
 August according to the different 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.180
 components on the water we have the button 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:29.280
 start a small button reset the bugs 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.600
 help the button but mocked and two 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.420
 feeding phases that actually manages 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.850
 the four memory slots which will put if 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.100
 we only have two bars on the slots 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.410
 red color red on back to back 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.780
 of the map we have two ports 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.800
 fan that will manage the 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.740
 fans of the CPU and the plug it's 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.720
 more boring rock we find a 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.870
 fan company that wears the 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.060
 total number of catches at 5.1 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.270
 forem 2 which will connect a 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.710
 ssd in this format at the level of 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.080
 connected career we have taking 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.570
 ps of two USB 2.0 jacks a hdmi jack 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.360
 an optical output a vga plug a 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.930
 taken dvi the clercy moscatt occasions 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.140
 four usb ports 3.0 the rj45 jack and 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.090
 gold-plated audio outputs 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:23.130
 we end the turn of this maxim ulset 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:25.050
 rangers by the socket so a jump 14 50 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.860
 that will connect 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:32.990
 intel processors haswell fresh socket 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.990
 which managed by eight phases of feeding 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.110
 this is the end of the presentation 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.629
 of this maximus it is map rowers 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.809
 mother or their color code red and black 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:45.759
 we are still in the rog range 

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:47.830
 the test will appear of course it's also 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:49.169
 modding point fr which I invite you to 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.509
 to visit us 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:54.369
 Thank you for following us and 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:56.439
 Thursday at a next time on the channel 

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:58.889
 of modding point fr to be on heavy 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.889
 thank you
