00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:11.559
 has happened to us 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.850
 it's about love 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.390
 hello very good kids once more 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.360
 here the decks of life plus 93 and today 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.060
 Wake up is a tutorial on how to cut 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.670
 with one hand it's worth in the section 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.910
 magic tutorials here I will upload everything 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.239
 related to copying any 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.000
 tutorial or flourish or in this case as 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.280
 makes the video cut with one hand and for 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.960
 last before I start saying that I 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.210
 you can follow on twitter wrinkles 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.330
 hand habit 23 below is the link the 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.430
 description because follow me because there 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.010
 he will also keep informed of the rise 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.530
 of videos and also if you want 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.550
 mention me some video that goes up and for 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.900
 that I look at it check it and retweet it for 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.880
 they see other people and also 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.030
 can subscribe to your win and so 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.400
 be more and more in this magic 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.229
 saying this I usually say so much that he forgives 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.530
 the voice that I have because I have a cold 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.840
 and we're going to start doing the tutorial 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.229
 how to have a hand for it already 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.930
 shuffles divided into two mass towards 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.630
 half to make it a little easier for 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.210
 the people who say do this this 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.640
 cut a good hand because this would 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.100
 the position is worth the thumb in this 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.100
 position here back middle of canceling in 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.830
 this other and little finger the index to the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.960
 sides are worth the position normally 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.179
 It is always the same and there 's always that 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.860
 leaving in this position results 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.780
 we simply take the top part 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.800
 can even go up a little and 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.800
 leaving that in the bottom part 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.530
 I think that this step simply means 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.210
 to practice a few times and 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.890
 final has to come out piece 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.120
 to the next step we do not have to 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.120
 help from the index to upload 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.840
 the package below 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.769
 until it arrives and it's kind of like 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.769
 campaign tub 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.810
 she is simply leaving shots 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.130
 as I said before these practices 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.720
 you have to do it several times 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.450
 and back maybe we will also be in 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.010
 the same position to start it to 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.470
 to work 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.079
 if really already the health practices to 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.079
 sky you can continue the border 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.350
 well now we will take the part of the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.390
 half letting it fall badly 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.990
 without a help from the other hand has been 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.970
 more up 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.910
 thus 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.730
 for 300 percent but you have to 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.970
 do a little more faster more visually 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.920
 look attractive and beautiful and in this 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.890
 position and we only have to do 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:24.160
 cuts you can do the different way or 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.160
 the circle of waters as 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.020
 you know how to practice it a lot 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.400
 Well, you know what is prevented 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.060
 worth the diga is going to play that had for 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.050
 be on twitter 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:45.970
 you already know above and also above 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.970
 greeting and once more decks 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.020
 but how 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.329
 Thank you
