00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
butterfly I'm going to take a hair pin

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.130 
butterfly I'm going to take a hair pin
I'm<00:02:20.790> going<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:21.000> pick<00:02:21.180> which<00:02:21.360> we<00:02:21.570> want<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.080> use

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
I'm going to pick which we want to use

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.600 
I'm going to pick which we want to use
and<00:02:22.560> I'm<00:02:22.620> going<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.800> try<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:22.980> use<00:02:23.100> this<00:02:23.370> one<00:02:23.580> on

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
and I'm going to try to use this one on

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.760 
and I'm going to try to use this one on
her<00:02:23.910> I'm<00:02:24.720> going<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:24.990> go<00:02:25.110> from<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.380> downward

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
her I'm going to go from a downward

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.160 
her I'm going to go from a downward
angle<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.400> an<00:02:26.490> upward<00:02:26.880> angle<00:02:27.030> underneath<00:02:27.780> that

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
angle to an upward angle underneath that

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.830 
angle to an upward angle underneath that
loop<00:02:28.440> I'm<00:02:29.370> going<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.640> pick<00:02:29.940> up<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.300> piece<00:02:30.570> of

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
loop I'm going to pick up a piece of

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.560 
loop I'm going to pick up a piece of
hair<00:02:31.520> little<00:02:32.520> section<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.000> hair<00:02:33.060> I'm<00:02:33.330> going<00:02:33.510> to

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
hair little section of hair I'm going to

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.740 
hair little section of hair I'm going to
add<00:02:33.750> some<00:02:34.020> pomade<00:02:34.640> just<00:02:35.640> run<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.030> pomade<00:02:36.240> down

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
add some pomade just run the pomade down

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.500 
add some pomade just run the pomade down
a<00:02:37.230> hair<00:02:38.160> strand<00:02:39.200> like<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:41.150> make<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> tiny

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
a hair strand like this make a tiny

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.290 
a hair strand like this make a tiny
little<00:02:42.660> loop<00:02:43.340> slip<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.580> through<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.850> hair<00:02:45.120> pin

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
little loop slip it through the hair pin

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.720 
little loop slip it through the hair pin
and<00:02:45.980> go<00:02:46.980> ahead<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.430> pull<00:02:47.790> gently<00:02:49.640> until<00:02:50.640> you

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
and go ahead and pull gently until you

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.970 
and go ahead and pull gently until you
create<00:02:51.120> kind<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.660> bow<00:02:51.840> effect<00:02:52.260> like<00:02:52.590> we<00:02:52.740> used

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
create kind of a bow effect like we used

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.610 
create kind of a bow effect like we used
in<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.430> bow<00:02:53.520> braid<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.970> want<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:54.990> top<00:02:55.260> one<00:02:55.500> to

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
in the bow braid I want this top one to

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.160 
in the bow braid I want this top one to
be<00:02:55.709> bigger<00:02:55.950> than<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.280> bottom<00:02:56.600> so<00:02:57.600> that's<00:02:57.959> a

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
be bigger than the bottom so that's a

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.560 
be bigger than the bottom so that's a
little<00:02:58.410> lopsided<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:59.040> purpose<00:02:59.459> now<00:03:00.120> for<00:03:00.480> the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
little lopsided on purpose now for the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.000 
little lopsided on purpose now for the
second<00:03:00.959> half<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.380> butterfly<00:03:01.709> we<00:03:01.890> are

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
second half of the butterfly we are

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.260 
second half of the butterfly we are
going<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.190> go<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.490> downward<00:03:02.910> angle

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
going to go in a downward angle

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.229 
going to go in a downward angle
so<00:03:03.480> I'm<00:03:03.540> going<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.780> slide<00:03:03.990> this<00:03:04.230> down<00:03:04.700> from<00:03:05.700> top

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
so I'm going to slide this down from top

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.050 
so I'm going to slide this down from top
this<00:03:06.600> time<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:07.110> bottom<00:03:07.580> I'm<00:03:08.580> going<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.760> pick<00:03:08.910> up

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
this time to bottom I'm going to pick up

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.690 
this time to bottom I'm going to pick up
another<00:03:09.150> section<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.900> hair<00:03:10.220> add<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.280> little

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
another section of hair add a little

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.190 
another section of hair add a little
pomade<00:03:15.650> go<00:03:16.650> ahead<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:16.980> make<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.160> little<00:03:17.459> loop

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
pomade go ahead and make a little loop

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.620 
pomade go ahead and make a little loop
slip<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.470> through<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.830> hair<00:03:20.220> pin<00:03:20.370> hang<00:03:21.209> on<00:03:21.360> to

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
slip it through the hair pin hang on to

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.190 
slip it through the hair pin hang on to
it<00:03:21.780> as<00:03:22.280> we<00:03:23.280> begin<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.790> gently<00:03:24.390> pull<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.050> back

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
it as we begin to gently pull it back

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.729 
it as we begin to gently pull it back
through<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:26.209> create<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.239> second<00:03:27.780> bow<00:03:27.959> that's

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
through and create a second bow that's

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.500 
through and create a second bow that's
going<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.100> kind<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.370> cross<00:03:29.700> underneath<00:03:30.150> our

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
going to kind of cross underneath our

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.840 
going to kind of cross underneath our
first<00:03:30.780> bow<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.260> again<00:03:31.560> I'm<00:03:31.860> going<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:32.640> try<00:03:32.820> to

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
first bow and again I'm going to try to

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.140 
first bow and again I'm going to try to
make<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.209> top<00:03:33.450> loop<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:34.310> little<00:03:35.310> bit<00:03:35.910> bigger

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
make the top loop a little bit bigger

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.540 
make the top loop a little bit bigger
than<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.660> bottom<00:03:36.780> loop<00:03:37.110> so<00:03:37.950> that<00:03:38.130> we<00:03:38.280> really

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
than the bottom loop so that we really

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.220 
than the bottom loop so that we really
accent<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.239> fact<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.750> these<00:03:39.870> are<00:03:39.930> supposed

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
accent the fact that these are supposed

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.699 
accent the fact that these are supposed
to<00:03:40.500> be<00:03:40.590> butterfly<00:03:41.220> wings<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.880> then<00:03:42.840> if<00:03:43.350> you

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
to be butterfly wings and then if you

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.440 
to be butterfly wings and then if you
have<00:03:43.890> any<00:03:44.040> little<00:03:44.310> tails<00:03:44.640> like<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.030> piece

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
have any little tails like this piece

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.210 
have any little tails like this piece

right here you just take a little bobby

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:56.199 
right here you just take a little bobby
pin<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:48.530> slide<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:51.110> down<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.830> hide<00:03:53.100> those<00:03:53.489> ends

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209
