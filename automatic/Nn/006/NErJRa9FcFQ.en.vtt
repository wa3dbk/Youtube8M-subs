00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.560
 beautiful all the guys are piece I 'm here 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.199
 back with another video on gta 5 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.749
 because this time I wanted to show you one 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.790
 what is really interesting or a 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:29.780
 very simple trick for 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:33.640
 in short, take all the vehicles 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.880
 military aircraft or something like that without 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.940
 just be attacked by the police 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:45.010
 then from the military then you will have to 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.010
 replay the easy target mission 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.900
 easy target from a mission of the 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.570
 unknown and crazy 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.570
 and now I will show you 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.130
 george 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:16.140
 flying with cratus okay let's jump here 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.990
 in the beginning we must follow cletus him 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.689
 the atmosphere of chasing wapiti 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:29.539
 as soon as this ends you leave 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.539
 just leave 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:38.899
 and we're going to get an ok vehicle 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:44.299
 this is the first vehicle that happens to me 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:53.179
 ok let's go now we head to fort 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:53.179

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:03.130
 ok arrived at force zanchu do vi 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:05.820
 I will show this one of makeup say ok 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:15.310
 guys it's like come to forzan kudo 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:21.610
 now we will try to enter we see 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:29.140
 entered and he attacks me no one 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:32.739
 as you can see I am inside you see 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.630
 I'm inside look here is also there 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.940
 a year that passes by so 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.940
 quietly without telling me anything 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:47.080
 you see they are inside I can turn 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.730
 anywhere as you like I can take 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.730
 even the vehicles now I will show you 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:06.939
 for example we enter inside 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.939
 the plane 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.099
 see I took the plane no one me 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.459
 attacks practically I can turn like 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.459
 I want 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:43.440
 now on the ground we come to show you 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.440
 I will also take the other vehicles 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.190
 if it is true that if you throw yourself in the air do not 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.190
 you know 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:01.780
 let's see what we can take I wanted 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.220
 take a tank if I find that 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:09.720
 nobody really does not attack me 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.720
 I can just turn around safely 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.040
 then we take back our vehicle e 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.040
 Let's go find a tank 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.560
 then where can an armed dog post 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:42.530
 in here there is no tank 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:42.530
 understanding 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.640
 if not, cras mato is not valid 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.170
 oh well I will take a c 130 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.170
 what's the problem 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:18.230
 take the c130 you see everything so 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.710
 harmless so no one attacks me not 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.710
 no problem 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:33.910
 now only now that he can't do a little 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:33.910
 of maneuvers we go back to the 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.310
 15 I can start from dai 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.389
 Mamma Mia 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.389
 I did it 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:06.020
 see no one nobody tells me 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:10.100
 see nothing tell me he is flying in 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:14.810
 a controlled airspace let's say 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:17.570
 but no one attacks me, so I can 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:26.919
 be very quiet 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:26.919
 on the contrary we land just right 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:37.550
 although I jumped from the area ago 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.730
 the better I try I take a cart 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:47.300
 armed a holy tank does not 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:52.040
 manage to find okay guys I have 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:54.200
 showed this trick to get into 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:59.180
 in strong zan ass without being attacked 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:01.160
 in short, all that police is 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:08.980
 really a nuisance if we want 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:14.270
 so then take a military vehicle 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:15.950
 so it will remain simpler we say ok 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.230
 guys i hope you enjoyed the video 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.570

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:27.680
 something to say then let me say

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:34.750

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:38.060
 easter egg of gta 

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:41.920
