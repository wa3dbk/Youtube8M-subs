 we are about to be national very 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.860
 well we are not seeing how it is 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.200
 combining perfectly is 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.360
 starting to look like a quote taken 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.760
 this is the joke of shawn there is to cremate 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.200
 sugar butter 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.350
 one by one 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.960
 I'm going to beat after each edition with 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.420
 eight enough eggs is worn by this 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.970
 package and this makes it much better more 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.170
 richer cited, that is, outside of 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.220
 refrigerators will last much longer 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.260
 weather 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.940
 needed is is beating this I'm going to 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.980
 put the nuts here in a colander and 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.320
 that is very good because I'm going to put 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.330
 because I want you to have a touch 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.130
 like flour is very important for 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.540
 that they do not see each other to the bottom if 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.790
 we do this way we're going to a 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.530
 coating powder and flour 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.680
 bake that this will serve us to 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.930
 that do not sink us ok and needy 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.930
 we wish a rate of 9 for forgiveness flour 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.700
 and baking powder 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.870
 we have a mold can be round can 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.240
 be of so that after what 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.580
 want 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.580
 and look what happens is the result that 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.910
 I wanted to have the nuts have a 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.910
 cover 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.040
 of flour here I have it so that what 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.739
 can see let's see let's see another 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.739
 egg makes funds of funds 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.819
 so I know what's happening, nothing else 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.330
 is beating and then I'm going to have to 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.670
 stop 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.320
 and as no blade reaches the bottom 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.820
 look no more 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.240
 all this butter is missing 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.220
 combine and when this happens 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.990
 are the results by which of 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.550
 suddenly we do not get the cakes 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.410
 we say but because it did not come out if 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.510
 you were if you do not perfectly measure the 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.220
 sky was not preheated to 350 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.530
 degrees seems 180 billion like 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.930
 always because many times of the order 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.100
 these little tips and well there it is 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.650
 When you are going to do them, it is working 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.380
 towards baking making bakeries 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.200
 pastry is totally a chemistry the 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.940
 chemistry is that they are exactly the 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.000
 measures that are asking us because 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.670
 because when combining flour with 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.860
 egg with the sugar all have their 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.900
 important part inside a cake by 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.670
 example if we not only put more sugar in 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.560
 the one of vido what happens when the sugar 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.130
 it's baked the sugar becomes 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.540
 completely liquid and what happens they fall 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.790
 the warning cakes when they are finished 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.700
 those phases is surely because it 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.430
 we put enough sugar 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.379
 I will put more eggs is a bread that 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.390
 given because he's talking a little bit 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.540
 more but transit we want this 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.540
 time 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.540
 we are ready with that 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.440
 I have my flour also ready and the 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.440
 I'm going to start adding 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.460
 and that 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.640
 at the end of the flour I do not want to leave 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.490
 it was absolutely the same as we said 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.319
 everything is perfectly well calculated 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.270
 and I'm going to upload the speed 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.480
 so that everything is mixed 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.280
 perfectly 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.930
 also an important part of the 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.420
 pastry always have good molds 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.940
 well taken care of and pep and my mom out there 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.139
 they say and I believe and if you are fixed 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.870
 in the big bakeries 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:14.090
 is that molds are never washed 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.159
 because I'm like a fussy eater and 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.199
 I always liked the big ones 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:20.479
 Pastry shops will not be sure to see 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.009
 for the frequent use they have not what 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.620
 they do but these at home we must 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:26.360
 have a good mold and whenever I give them 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.370
 I say start to see it when it 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.319
 release some particle will no longer be 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.909
 really necessary and good molds high 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:37.430
 very good prices a long time ago 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:40.069
 they cost more cake and excellent molds 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.800
 are already worth kilo butter in flour and 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:44.449
 then I put a waxed paper 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.300
 thought will help me a lot for the 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.819
 time to flip it perfectly 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.039
 everything does not stick absolutely nothing and 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:53.870
 it's much easier for me 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:59.020
 look, look like you're still in the background 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.020
 from the bowl there's butter 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.890
 and this here also for me I have 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.530
 here in this butter look nothing more 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:13.320
 all this is very important 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.320
 very important that we start working 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:19.129
 and I already have my nuts here the bad thing that I 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:22.310
 I was telling you a little while ago that please 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:26.370
 be careful please d 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:29.250
 have flour we are ready 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.440
 and good memories have not dawned 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.900

 look there I went for patronage with the 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.430
 nuts did not go to the bottom they stayed 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:23.500
 here stable from the top and 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.330
