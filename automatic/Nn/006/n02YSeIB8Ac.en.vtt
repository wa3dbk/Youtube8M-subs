I'd<00:00:04.890> like<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.130> show<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.640> how<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.180> fix<00:00:08.059> the<00:00:10.490> LCD

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
I'd like to show you how to fix the LCD

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.330 
I'd like to show you how to fix the LCD
that<00:00:11.519> has<00:00:12.179> fallen<00:00:12.570> off<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.320> laptop<00:00:13.620> this

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
that has fallen off the laptop this

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.439 
that has fallen off the laptop this
particular<00:00:14.969> one<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.389> Toshiba<00:00:16.910> let's<00:00:17.910> see<00:00:18.270> what

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
particular one is Toshiba let's see what

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:27.500 
particular one is Toshiba let's see what
the<00:00:18.630> model<00:00:19.199> number<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:22.010> C<00:00:23.269> 65<00:00:25.699> 655<00:00:26.699> D<00:00:27.029> so

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the model number is it is C 65 655 D so

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.990 
the model number is it is C 65 655 D so
C<00:00:27.539> 6<00:00:28.260> 5<00:00:28.500> 5<00:00:28.800> D<00:00:29.189> s<00:00:29.460> 5<00:00:30.210> 2<00:00:31.309> 2<00:00:32.309> 8<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:35.340> what<00:00:35.610> happened

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
C 6 5 5 D s 5 2 2 8 so what happened

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.560 
C 6 5 5 D s 5 2 2 8 so what happened
here<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.899> bad<00:00:37.380> design<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.700> basically<00:00:39.210> have

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
here is a bad design you basically have

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.790 
here is a bad design you basically have
the<00:00:39.980> hinges<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.280> are<00:00:41.399> riveted<00:00:41.850> or<00:00:42.800> screwed

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the hinges that are riveted or screwed

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.670 
the hinges that are riveted or screwed
into<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.550> plastic<00:00:45.530> of<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.149> computer<00:00:48.180> I

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
into the plastic of the computer I

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.010 
into the plastic of the computer I
already<00:00:49.680> prepped<00:00:50.610> before<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> realized<00:00:51.809> I

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
already prepped before I realized I

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.600 
already prepped before I realized I
should<00:00:52.350> probably<00:00:52.559> make<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> video<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.460> this

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
should probably make a video on this

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.069 
should probably make a video on this
it's<00:00:53.850> kind<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:55.760> interesting<00:00:56.760> way<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.510> fix<00:00:57.899> it

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
it's kind of interesting way to fix it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.700 
it's kind of interesting way to fix it
so<00:00:58.730> there<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.850> no<00:01:00.030> way<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.270> reattach<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
so there is no way to reattach it if you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.130 
so there is no way to reattach it if you
put<00:01:04.070> epoxy<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.549> won't<00:01:05.790> hold<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.960> what<00:01:07.110> I

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
put epoxy on it it won't hold so what I

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.710 
put epoxy on it it won't hold so what I
did<00:01:07.260> was<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.770> got<00:01:07.950> longer<00:01:08.250> screws<00:01:08.790> these<00:01:09.510> are

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
did was I got longer screws these are

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.990 
did was I got longer screws these are
the<00:01:09.900> original<00:01:10.710> screws<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.310> were<00:01:11.549> held<00:01:11.850> in

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
the original screws that were held in

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.399 
the original screws that were held in
holding<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.520> basically<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:17.299> metal<00:01:18.409> nuts

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
holding and basically the metal nuts

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.330 
holding and basically the metal nuts
were<00:01:19.860> embedded<00:01:20.759> into<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.509> plastic<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.590> after

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
were embedded into the plastic and after

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.270 
were embedded into the plastic and after
time<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:24.000> wiggled<00:01:24.330> themselves<00:01:24.869> out<00:01:25.280> so

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
time they just wiggled themselves out so

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.300 
time they just wiggled themselves out so
what<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.210> did<00:01:27.330> was<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.930> got<00:01:28.140> longer<00:01:28.409> screws<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.220> I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
what I did was I got longer screws and I

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.870 
what I did was I got longer screws and I
actually<00:01:29.570> went<00:01:30.570> from<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.470> bottom<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.009> half

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
actually went from the bottom and half

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.520 
actually went from the bottom and half
screws<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:35.490> know<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:36.000> through<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.930> I

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
screws just you know going through and I

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.100 
screws just you know going through and I
used<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.130> original<00:01:38.310> nuts<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.210> some<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.930> this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
used the original nuts and some of this

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.179 
used the original nuts and some of this
really<00:01:40.950> good<00:01:41.189> glue<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.270> called<00:01:42.570> goop<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.500> love

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
really good glue it's called goop I love

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.920 
really good glue it's called goop I love
it<00:01:45.229> it's<00:01:46.229> flexible<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.460> holds<00:01:48.149> even<00:01:48.659> when

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
it it's flexible and it holds even when

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.069 
it it's flexible and it holds even when
you<00:01:49.280> have<00:01:50.280> moving<00:01:50.549> parts<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
you have moving parts so I have the

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.209 
you have moving parts so I have the
screw<00:01:55.079> or<00:01:55.290> bolt<00:01:56.009> stubs<00:01:57.799> sticking<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:58.979> there

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
screw or bolt stubs sticking out there

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.270 
screw or bolt stubs sticking out there
and<00:01:59.399> now<00:02:00.119> I'll<00:02:00.509> do<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.049> reverse<00:02:01.530> instead<00:02:02.159> of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
and now I'll do the reverse instead of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.520 
and now I'll do the reverse instead of
having<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.509> nut

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.840 

be<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.950> plastic<00:02:08.490> will<00:02:08.910> have<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.330> not

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
be in the plastic will have the not

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:21.970 
be in the plastic will have the not
outside<00:02:15.709> come<00:02:16.709> on<00:02:16.890> camera<00:02:18.920> yeah<00:02:20.000> okay<00:02:21.000> and

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
outside come on camera yeah okay and

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.350 
outside come on camera yeah okay and
we'll<00:02:22.980> place<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:25.400> just<00:02:26.400> went<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:26.970> picked<00:02:27.180> up

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
we'll place I just went and picked up

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.930 
we'll place I just went and picked up
the<00:02:27.510> screws<00:02:27.810> at<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.260> local<00:02:29.130> hardware<00:02:29.340> store

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
the screws at the local hardware store

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.720 
the screws at the local hardware store
and<00:02:30.780> here<00:02:31.620> are<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.800> nuts<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:34.730> interestingly

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
and here are the nuts and interestingly

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.330 
and here are the nuts and interestingly
enough<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.900> nuts<00:02:37.170> are<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.370> same<00:02:38.760> size<00:02:39.270> as<00:02:40.340> you

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
enough the nuts are the same size as you

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.229 
enough the nuts are the same size as you
would<00:02:41.520> have<00:02:41.820> not<00:02:42.150> sound<00:02:42.630> like<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> VGA<00:02:43.620> or<00:02:44.239> LVT

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
would have not sound like a VGA or LVT

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.000 
would have not sound like a VGA or LVT
port<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:47.190> we<00:02:47.220> just<00:02:47.870> screw<00:02:48.870> them<00:02:49.019> in<00:02:49.200> like<00:02:49.800> that

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
port so we just screw them in like that

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.440 
port so we just screw them in like that
with<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:51.230> computer<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:53.820> size<00:02:54.060> fits

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
with this computer to the size fits

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.580 
with this computer to the size fits
perfectly<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:58.070> this<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.550> other<00:02:59.700> not<00:03:00.590> of

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
perfectly and this the other not of

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.490 
perfectly and this the other not of
course<00:03:04.100> it's<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.250> little<00:03:05.400> tight<00:03:05.850> but<00:03:06.570> it's<00:03:07.290> much

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
course it's a little tight but it's much

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.350 
course it's a little tight but it's much
better<00:03:07.709> than<00:03:08.070> some<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.610> computers<00:03:09.150> I've

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
better than some of the computers I've

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:20.470 
better than some of the computers I've
seen<00:03:14.420> just<00:03:16.910> make<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.150> catch<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:19.140> little<00:03:19.380> bit

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
seen just make it catch a little bit

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.600 
seen just make it catch a little bit
alright<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:22.019> we'll<00:03:22.380> just<00:03:22.410> tighten<00:03:23.070> this<00:03:23.489> side

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
alright and we'll just tighten this side

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.440 
alright and we'll just tighten this side
so<00:03:27.709> now<00:03:28.709> this<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.190> not<00:03:29.430> going<00:03:29.820> anywhere

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
so now this is not going anywhere

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.370 
so now this is not going anywhere
this<00:03:30.840> is<00:03:31.549> this<00:03:32.549> is<00:03:32.760> really<00:03:33.090> strong<00:03:33.329> if<00:03:34.110> it's

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
this is this is really strong if it's

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.590 
this is this is really strong if it's
going<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.650> wiggle<00:03:34.920> itself<00:03:35.549> out<00:03:35.790> it's<00:03:36.360> going<00:03:36.510> to

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
going to wiggle itself out it's going to

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.880 
going to wiggle itself out it's going to
come<00:03:37.440> out<00:03:37.650> with<00:03:38.299> plastic<00:03:39.299> so<00:03:39.959> let's<00:03:40.470> do<00:03:40.739> the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
come out with plastic so let's do the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.430 
come out with plastic so let's do the
other<00:03:41.070> side

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.850 

we'll<00:03:48.100> fix<00:03:48.460> the<00:03:49.000> design<00:03:49.240> floor<00:03:49.990> the<00:03:50.410> total

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
we'll fix the design floor the total

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.820 
we'll fix the design floor the total
cost<00:03:51.160> for<00:03:51.400> these<00:03:51.790> bolts<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.630> knots<00:03:52.930> was<00:03:53.290> three

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
cost for these bolts and knots was three

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.780 
cost for these bolts and knots was three
dollars<00:03:54.990> if<00:03:55.990> you<00:03:56.230> have<00:03:56.500> some<00:03:56.800> laying<00:03:57.100> out<00:03:57.370> and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
dollars if you have some laying out and

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.920 
dollars if you have some laying out and
will<00:03:58.750> be<00:03:58.780> even<00:03:58.990> cheaper<00:03:59.140> than<00:03:59.740> that<00:03:59.950> so<00:04:01.770> but<00:04:02.770> I

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
will be even cheaper than that so but I

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:14.630 
will be even cheaper than that so but I
didn't<00:04:04.930> have<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:05.410> ones<00:04:05.980> that<00:04:06.370> are<00:04:06.520> this<00:04:06.730> long

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:25.530 

good<00:04:18.630> okay<00:04:19.630> so<00:04:20.560> now<00:04:20.830> we<00:04:21.489> have<00:04:22.830> prepared<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:25.030> as

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
good okay so now we have prepared and as

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.740 
good okay so now we have prepared and as
you<00:04:25.660> can<00:04:25.900> see<00:04:26.430> it's<00:04:27.430> working<00:04:27.970> just<00:04:28.000> fine<00:04:28.740> so

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
you can see it's working just fine so

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.660 
you can see it's working just fine so
there<00:04:31.750> you<00:04:31.780> have<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:34.530> hopefully<00:04:35.530> this<00:04:36.250> helps

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
there you have it hopefully this helps

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.830 
there you have it hopefully this helps
somebody<00:04:38.700> keep<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:39.820> computer<00:04:40.090> alive<00:04:40.510> for<00:04:40.780> a

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
somebody keep the computer alive for a

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.500 
somebody keep the computer alive for a
little<00:04:41.080> longer<00:04:41.580> it's<00:04:42.580> just<00:04:42.790> a<00:04:42.880> problem<00:04:43.300> with

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
little longer it's just a problem with

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.410 
little longer it's just a problem with
computers<00:04:44.410> being<00:04:44.650> made<00:04:44.950> so<00:04:45.190> cheap<00:04:45.520> they<00:04:46.210> don't

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
computers being made so cheap they don't

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.900 
computers being made so cheap they don't
want<00:04:46.570> them<00:04:46.660> to<00:04:46.840> last<00:04:47.280> but<00:04:48.280> there's<00:04:48.580> always<00:04:48.790> a

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
want them to last but there's always a

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.820 
want them to last but there's always a
trick<00:04:49.240> to<00:04:49.480> get<00:04:49.660> them<00:04:49.750> to<00:04:49.960> last<00:04:50.110> just<00:04:50.410> a<00:04:50.590> little

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
trick to get them to last just a little

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.270 
trick to get them to last just a little
longer

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
longer

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.730 
longer
thank<00:04:51.580> you
