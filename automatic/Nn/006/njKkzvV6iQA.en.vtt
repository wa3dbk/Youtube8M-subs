00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
think the cities themselves are really

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.199 
think the cities themselves are really
filled<00:02:44.349> at<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.620> reasonable<00:02:45.220> Humane<00:02:45.549> scale<00:02:45.939> for

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
an American city there's lots of green

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.649 
an American city there's lots of green
space<00:02:47.769> plenty<00:02:48.579> of<00:02:48.640> places<00:02:48.819> to<00:02:49.000> go<00:02:49.120> walking<00:02:49.540> or

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
space plenty of places to go walking or

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.869 
space plenty of places to go walking or
get<00:02:49.840> outside<00:02:50.200> I'm<00:02:50.739> really<00:02:51.099> into<00:02:51.430> urban

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
get outside I'm really into urban

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.759 
get outside I'm really into urban
agriculture<00:02:52.480> local<00:02:52.750> foods<00:02:53.140> kind<00:02:53.530> of<00:02:53.590> stuff

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
agriculture local foods kind of stuff

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.830 
agriculture local foods kind of stuff
and<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.430> think<00:02:54.790> that's<00:02:54.939> a<00:02:55.060> movement<00:02:55.299> in<00:02:55.689> general

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
and I think that's a movement in general

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.050
