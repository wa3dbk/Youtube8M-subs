00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.170
 the twenty-eighth edition of the low Aragon started on July 22 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.640
 in the alcañizano circuit of motorland aragón 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.030
 the team there is no fran presented in this edition with three participants 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.379
 Oscar Romero victor in two editions in the category of quads Alberto Prieto 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.040
 also in quads and manuel garcía in motorcycles 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.900
 The philosophy and objectives of the team will be linked to those of its sponsor 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.880
 nobody fran 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.190
 well master is a company 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.170
 of real estate services 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.170
 what we thought was to assemble a team 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.420
 in a 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.630
 discipline these characteristics 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.210
 you have to work a lot of expo where the alert is important 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.950
 where you have to overcome adversity enter a little 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.180
 it could be a bit of a reflection of what the rest of us are demanding 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.100
 in professional life nowadays 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.740
 Alberto Prieto himself was a clear example of this spirit of overcoming 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.200
 and fight 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.369
 the one that participated in the low Aragon with a paralysis in his left arm 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.110
 to see the 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.780
 I have an arm it seems that several made a paralysis of people from 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.300
 to the 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.140
 for it more than just the earthquake of that my first time in the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.650
 fair running on a motorcycle when I still had 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.220
 the two arms 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.750
 basically being what we have done is avatar the quasar those 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.020
 characteristics 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.500
 The management of two bonds of obligation has been worked hard so that the 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.410
 promotion of the area fast 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.660
 I have brake and clutch on the right side 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.880
 and also despite the fact that almost all conventional June aquarium pilots 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.170
 of the signer very badly the trigger for that of 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.690
 d to be able to hold burma 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.230
 Reverse gear 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.040
 the mante abbot moved 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.220
 We declare it placed at the bottom 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.150
 so let's say all the control of the machine took him on the right side 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.600
 that's why fundamentally what I say is no other than 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.470
 to finish because obviously I can not or does not aspire to keep up with the rhythm of the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.079
 pointers 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.840
 at least percent we will be one hundred percent by until I get the 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:19.839
 opposition 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:24.059
 Oscar rosemary was the team's clearest surgical victory 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:29.109
 our goal is to gain category d 4 and be as close as possible to the 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:30.339
 motorcycles 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.339
 everything that is assured is not worth 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.599
 however, we have been talking for two years 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.929
 the now 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.769
 we come to it we must win 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.489
 viadeo we have prepared 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.379
 much better than other years 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.750
 tadeo especially thanks to the sponsors of thanks to alá people 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:50.439
 who has worked very hard 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.439
 was still a lot of sports work will go from preparing the 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:54.979
 quad 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:59.359
 he was very lucky he found front-line material like no 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.389
 month as oil paintings 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.849
 we have a very good material but this year 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.219
 per hundred at the end the tests we have done has been very satisfactory if we have 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.219
 who are not going to have any problems 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.779
 Manuel García, on the other hand, participated without any pressure in terms of 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:18.049
 result and their efforts were aimed at finishing the test 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.699
 It is important that this is put on everything because you can be here 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:22.369
 especially 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.950
 in my case the tenth below 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.359
 I hope to finish if all goes well and God wants 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.909
 ii the time happy percent is the first time because we have a destination 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.469
 little important not to try was is that things change alessio 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:37.299
 this discount is going the race as we all hope 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.150
 and the rest as objectives to finish in the best bottom position the bike is a 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.369
 llama fauna four and a half that to this day 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:47.889
 is the best word pavao moto lipara obama do not be professionally 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.729
 different no but for mercedes the best motorbike if we do not support pop aprimo 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:56.479
 that they also eat it because of collaboration with portovelo, this time 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.399
 one to one is modified actions is a motorcycle that is totally series 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:04.479
 some modifications to avoid the mechanical complication 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.789
 and try to make peach trials that my case because that's what they do 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.539
 try to finish trying 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:13.539
 type bastardee pharaohs this disorder 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.479
 few are the teams that once finished the apple race achieved their 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.750
 initial objectives 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.500
 in this case the members of tna and parana 4 got excellent 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.640
 results with the victory of oscar rosemary in the quads category 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.600
 finishing this low in the second position of the escrache motorcycles where only 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.990
 charaja rajoy answer 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.150
 the relevant fact is that his time of 7 hours 27 minutes and 25 seconds I explained 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.370
 seconds lower than the third classified in the car category 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.370
 the fiscal 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.620
 On the other hand both Alberto Prieto and Manuel García achieved their goal of 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.590
 finish the test prieto arrived at the Plaza del Pilar de Zaragoza in the fifth 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.220

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.930
