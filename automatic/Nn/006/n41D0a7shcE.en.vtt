00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.669
 Welcome to the live running 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.510
 wild of the sixth scum and degenerate 

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:09.530
 as bosses the cartel war years in 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.330
 I would like to thank you for the coming minutes 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.050
 The story mode of this bosses closer 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.940
 explain 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.689
 as usual , the whole thing is demonstrated 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.519
 every man of the server t3 m4 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.050
 as you can see the ktl 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.480
 war years of four different 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.989
 Boss these work much like 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.460
 the terrible thing on assad is that 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.130
 you have to kill each one in turn 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.960
 they have separate health and all 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.660
 heal again as soon as you come in 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.670
 killed the two outer so 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.070
 captain hook on the right and 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.000
 It wants to be on the left side 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.550
 immune 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.530
 that's why they can not be fueled 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.340
 and they have to be the first 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.710
 to be killed 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.130
 the two bosses in the middle so 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.970
 sander and chuck each have one 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.980
 take care of the tanks 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.360
 yes and now we are here too 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.250
 in the middle of the fight 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.579
 We will captain for the first time 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.540
 hook kill this can not be said 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.059
 be fueled 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.040
 it attacks all the time 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.200
 random players you can too 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.790
 by a warning message see there is 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.420
 a captain kirk celebrates in the 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.860
 direction of xxx here has one 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.290
 player met with others 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.659
 together there should be on everyone 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.580
 Cases dodge from these 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.690
 bluish rivers run out of her 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.180
 now here in the picture just now 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.299
 you can see that is a conical one 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.920
 Attack emanates from captain hook and 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.710
 in this area can hold several 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.330
 but we should not be like that 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.650
 soon, tilt often into this facility 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.880
 you can celebrate from the area 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.760
 run out and fail 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.320
 in safety before the shootings 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.049
 Generally your grill should be in order 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.900
 about captain horribilis kassandra 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.280
 and chuck his or you can be the first 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.220
 both if you want to exchange or 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.080
 even the last two only you have to 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.220
 definitely captain hook and want it 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.430
 even kill first 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.470
 the reason why we are around for käpnick 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.549
 he cares that is the federal 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.409
 right now here in the picture 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.320
 surfaced in between times 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.209
 disappears the aldi is so in the shade 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.619
 or similar is that now also in 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.030
 my position on here right now 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.000
 our play figure 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.400
 shoot a bit and make 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.780
 then an explosion that could now 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.490
 just see and disappear in this 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.190
 he quasi and then dives again 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.810
 other game on that is when he's on 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.640
 you turned up and a bit 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.190
 distance from him take this 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.450
 not to get the explosion if he 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.819
 a few seconds later 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.459
 it disappears , unfortunately 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.440
 but not quite possible 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.569
 as soon as her captain orrick so 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.910
 first boss killed the wm-throne 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.290
 have 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.290
 because from this moment gets windows 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.820
 and apple so then the einspieler 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.480
 to pull on what ever 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.910
 before he makes this explosion 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.340
 that means a player or else 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.900
 The melee will be this explosion 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.180
 in any case then off 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.310
 this explosive search is about 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.470
 3700 damage to the so should 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.550
 to be experienced 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.330
 while we are still at the second 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.220
 take care of the bus 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.110
 I go to the others 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.840
 both of which he said here as well 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.940
 need to be refueled 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.510
 zander we will kill as a third 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.120
 has a dilemma raid baff that means 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.010
 he does not move any slower therefore 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.650
 Ideally managed by the tank 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.000
 is this fund with the blue shield 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.880
 something in the background over here 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.489
 That's why the responsible person can see 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.890
 tenk him best on the outer edge here 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.680
 This is the hangge I say in lank 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.269
 always ayten around in a circle 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.100
 the only thing the tank has to look out for 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.079
 is that in between the message 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.350
 Zander has come up with players iks 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.870
 fixed 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.090
 Ideally, that should be the tank itself 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.770
 his because sandra always the player 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.080
 the one closest to him is missing 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.790
 But it can happen 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.970
 that you pass the group while kiting 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.790
 comes and then sander then 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.410
 closer to the other player is if 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.500
 that happens to us at the quasi then 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.210
 should focus on another 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.740
 their mock after one or two seconds 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.420
 and sander bring back on you 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.850
 the fourth and last post federal 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.310
 can also be fueled as I said and 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.540
 We will be the last of these 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.209
 kill many at once 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.890
 unlike most posts the 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.650
 But you should know it that way 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:29.370
 make sure that her one as a tank 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.040
 wall in the back because truck controls 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.540
 the current tenk always gone and if he 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.270
 while bouncing against a wall then 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.700
 the son avanti gets what he wants 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.880
 numb and harm them extra 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.680
 inflicts 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.050
 Just keep in mind that you 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.480
 have no wall behind you and then it is 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.370
 everything OK 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.160
 what through here in the last phase 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.820
 do not be tempted as a tank 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.500
 other 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.720
 Boß must come too close if 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.670
 of course unfavorable if sander 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.170
 Suddenly his target is on the second tank 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.900
 changes and then suddenly one death 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.550
 plain or the like , we'll be the same 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.010
 killed the third bus and so to speak 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.380
 only one left is left 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.540
 as well as her cartel lieutenants 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.000
 regardless of which boss you as 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.100
 You should just kill the last one 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.810
 ignore it and harm it 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.450
 to fall away 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.460
 because no matter which boss then left 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.490
 he will do a lot of harm 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.630
 and you want to kill that possible fast 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.130
 in our case, probably only 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.440
 there is stacks on the the 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.410
 all the time so high up a racing europe 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.080
 By doing so, he will do more harm to you 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.150
 longer he lives 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.319
 who wants his sander last 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.539
 left over 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:44.330
 then it would always something something me 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:46.520
 she either calls the end this is one 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.180
 Attack only goes against the tank and 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.949
 i believe 50 terminiger cast is when the 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.139
 the tank must come on any case one 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.680
 Insert special defensive ability 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.240
 so that he survives the attack 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.639
 that was everything again 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.710
 worth knowing about story mode this 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.870
 sixth and penultimate boss of 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.490
 scum and degeneracy 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.080
 as usual , the whole thing was natural 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.850
 also my textform on ours 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.850
 site ready for aging de read
