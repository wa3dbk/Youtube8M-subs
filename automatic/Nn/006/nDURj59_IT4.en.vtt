00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.010 
a name
nightmare<00:00:44.969> Bonnie<00:00:45.180> which<00:00:45.329> means<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.750> is

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
nightmare Bonnie which means this is

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.139 
nightmare Bonnie which means this is
nightmare<00:00:46.950> Freddy<00:00:47.219> which<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:47.700> some<00:00:47.820> reason

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
nightmare Freddy which for some reason

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.910 
nightmare Freddy which for some reason
he<00:00:48.750> didn't<00:00:48.989> title<00:00:49.230> at<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.620> guess<00:00:49.770> he's

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
he didn't title at that so I guess he's

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.410 
he didn't title at that so I guess he's
wanting<00:00:50.280> us<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.370> find<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.730> about<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:51.059> now<00:00:51.210> so

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
wanting us to find out about this now so

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.610 
wanting us to find out about this now so
I<00:00:51.449> actually<00:00:51.719> did<00:00:51.989> call<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.410> nightmare

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
I actually did call this a nightmare

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.380 
I actually did call this a nightmare
Bonnie<00:00:52.920> last<00:00:53.160> video<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.059> guess<00:00:54.210> that's

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
Bonnie last video and I guess that's

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.729 
Bonnie last video and I guess that's
what<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.629> actually<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.440> must<00:00:55.649> be

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
what it actually is so this must be

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.709 
what it actually is so this must be
nightmare<00:00:56.070> Freddy<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:57.090> must<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.390> nightmare

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
nightmare Freddy this must be nightmare

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.569 
nightmare Freddy this must be nightmare
bonnie<00:00:57.899> which<00:00:58.260> means<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.070> say<00:00:59.250> guess<00:00:59.460> we're

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579
