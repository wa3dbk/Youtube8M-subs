help them survive and thrive what we

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.860 
help them survive and thrive what we
prize<00:02:37.069> is<00:02:37.370> really<00:02:37.609> the<00:02:37.760> honey<00:02:37.939> and<00:02:38.239> we<00:02:38.689> see

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
prize is really the honey and we see

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.509 
prize is really the honey and we see
that<00:02:38.900> these<00:02:39.200> make<00:02:39.469> that<00:02:39.680> but<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.010> really

that these make that but it really

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.050 
that these make that but it really
requires<00:02:40.790> all<00:02:41.299> of<00:02:41.629> those<00:02:41.749> different<00:02:41.959> parts
