this<00:00:03.949> short<00:00:04.160> video<00:00:04.340> I'm<00:00:04.640> going<00:00:04.819> to<00:00:04.910> explain

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.029 
this short video I'm going to explain

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.540 
this short video I'm going to explain
how<00:00:05.300> an<00:00:05.780> attic<00:00:06.080> installed<00:00:06.470> radiant<00:00:07.220> barrier

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
how an attic installed radiant barrier

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.670 
how an attic installed radiant barrier
works<00:00:07.850> all<00:00:08.450> of<00:00:08.690> the<00:00:08.809> heat<00:00:08.990> from<00:00:09.140> the<00:00:09.260> Sun<00:00:09.500> is

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:09.680 
works all of the heat from the Sun is

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.470 
works all of the heat from the Sun is
transferred<00:00:10.190> to<00:00:10.220> earth<00:00:10.460> in<00:00:10.730> the<00:00:10.790> form<00:00:11.300> of
