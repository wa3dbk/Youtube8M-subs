00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
wall right here because the way I

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.410 
wall right here because the way I

he's still working on some bugs and it's

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.360 
he's still working on some bugs and it's
gonna<00:02:25.310> be<00:02:25.549> he<00:02:26.540> sailed<00:02:26.840> 0.7<00:02:27.739> point<00:02:27.920> zero<00:02:28.189> which

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
gonna be he sailed 0.7 point zero which

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.880 
gonna be he sailed 0.7 point zero which
means<00:02:28.400> they<00:02:29.060> they're<00:02:29.629> gonna<00:02:29.720> bypass<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.680> beta

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
means they they're gonna bypass the beta

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.780 
means they they're gonna bypass the beta
I<00:02:31.220> guess<00:02:31.940> or<00:02:32.209> I<00:02:32.629> don't<00:02:32.780> know<00:02:33.549> it's<00:02:34.549> kind<00:02:34.760> of

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
I guess or I don't know it's kind of

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.690 
I guess or I don't know it's kind of
fuzzy<00:02:35.030> but<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.870> know<00:02:36.019> 0.7<00:02:36.799> point<00:02:36.980> zero<00:02:37.250> means

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
fuzzy but you know 0.7 point zero means

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.130 
fuzzy but you know 0.7 point zero means
most<00:02:38.030> likely<00:02:38.540> they're<00:02:38.750> gonna<00:02:38.810> have

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140
