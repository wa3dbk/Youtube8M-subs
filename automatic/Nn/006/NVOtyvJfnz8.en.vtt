 Command, because as I told you I 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.740
 I may not have time but now there's a 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.050
 person who will leave the active command 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.479

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.759

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.560
 multiplatform type galley serve for 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.380

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.200
 according to what they have but I play with 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.149
 this command there is a half is the name is 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.009

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.869

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.789
 strup even goes there stays there as active 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.520
 in command because it's from there that people 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.320
 You will have a better rule thus 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.030
