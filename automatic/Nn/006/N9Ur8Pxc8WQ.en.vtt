that<00:02:56.209> oh<00:02:56.450> good<00:02:56.959> right<00:02:57.709> this<00:02:57.980> is<00:02:58.130> so<00:02:58.310> on<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.580> the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
that oh good right this is so on to the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:08.020 
that oh good right this is so on to the
drug<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.060> greet<00:02:59.270> sort<00:03:06.519> people<00:03:07.519> have<00:03:07.760> said<00:03:08.000> to

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030

use just a killing blow much for videos

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.060 
use just a killing blow much for videos
but<00:03:11.780> i<00:03:11.840> personally<00:03:12.140> think<00:03:12.380> it's<00:03:12.650> quite<00:03:12.769> good

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
but i personally think it's quite good

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.500 
but i personally think it's quite good
to<00:03:13.640> show<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.000> other<00:03:14.930> ways<00:03:15.230> of<00:03:16.450> how<00:03:17.450> the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
to show you other ways of how the

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.960 
to show you other ways of how the
weapons<00:03:18.080> used

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.510 

there's<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.780> spider<00:03:24.080> yeah<00:03:24.500> i<00:03:27.250> think<00:03:28.250> these

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
there's a spider yeah i think these

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.810 
there's a spider yeah i think these
weapons<00:03:29.030> out<00:03:29.210> there<00:03:29.540> we<00:03:30.470> go<00:03:30.590> fishing<00:03:31.340> move<00:03:31.550> I

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
weapons out there we go fishing move I

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.730 
weapons out there we go fishing move I
think<00:03:32.390> these<00:03:32.540> weapons<00:03:33.050> have<00:03:33.260> an<00:03:33.380> increased

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
think these weapons have an increased

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.430 
think these weapons have an increased
critical<00:03:34.280> strim<00:03:34.670> strike<00:03:35.540> right<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.050> this<00:03:36.260> is

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
critical strim strike right so this is

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.410 
critical strim strike right so this is
just<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.770> singular<00:03:37.280> axe<00:03:37.520> obviously<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:38.210> can

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
just a singular axe obviously this can

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.020 
just a singular axe obviously this can
be<00:03:38.510> usually<00:03:38.660> this<00:03:38.900> shield<00:03:39.320> or<00:03:40.310> another<00:03:40.640> axe<00:03:40.820> I

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
be usually this shield or another axe I

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.540 
be usually this shield or another axe I
think<00:03:42.310> no<00:03:43.310> yeah<00:03:44.350> nice<00:03:45.350> one<00:03:45.650> hit<00:03:45.890> on<00:03:45.920> that<00:03:46.190> ski

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
think no yeah nice one hit on that ski

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.120 
think no yeah nice one hit on that ski
there<00:03:46.820> I<00:03:47.020> think<00:03:48.020> a<00:03:48.080> lot<00:03:48.110> of<00:03:48.410> weapons<00:03:48.740> can

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
there I think a lot of weapons can

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.760 
there I think a lot of weapons can
probably<00:03:49.550> do<00:03:49.730> that<00:03:53.050> let's<00:03:54.050> check<00:03:54.350> out<00:03:54.500> some

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
probably do that let's check out some

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:01.410 
probably do that let's check out some
more<00:03:54.800> mobs<00:03:59.170> check<00:04:00.170> out<00:04:00.380> in<00:04:00.590> first<00:04:00.860> person

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
more mobs check out in first person

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.640 
more mobs check out in first person
there<00:04:02.420> we<00:04:02.510> go<00:04:02.630> there's<00:04:02.930> a<00:04:02.990> finishing<00:04:03.350> blow

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
there we go there's a finishing blow

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.940
