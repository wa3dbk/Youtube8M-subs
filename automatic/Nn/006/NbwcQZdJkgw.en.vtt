always kind of fighting for control over
that<00:01:01.190> crossover<00:01:01.670> from<00:01:01.970> one<00:01:02.120> side<00:01:02.300> of<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:02.450> map

that crossover from one side of the map
to<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.870> other<00:01:03.020> my<00:01:03.380> tips<00:01:03.590> for<00:01:03.739> discovery<00:01:04.100> is

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
to the other my tips for discovery is

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.229 
to the other my tips for discovery is
really<00:01:04.339> just<00:01:04.460> learning<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:04.820> layout<00:01:05.059> of<00:01:05.180> the

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
really just learning the layout of the

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.940 
really just learning the layout of the
map<00:01:05.420> understanding<00:01:06.140> how<00:01:06.170> that<00:01:06.380> chasm<00:01:06.770> can

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
map understanding how that chasm can

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.440 
map understanding how that chasm can
impact<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.670> flow<00:01:07.850> of<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.030> game<00:01:08.060> play

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
impact that the flow of the game play

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.030 
impact that the flow of the game play
and<00:01:08.689> always<00:01:09.170> being<00:01:09.320> conscious<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:09.920> the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
and always being conscious of the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.469 
and always being conscious of the
exposure<00:01:10.399> that<00:01:10.579> you<00:01:10.700> have<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:11.150> long-range

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
exposure that you have to long-range

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.539 
exposure that you have to long-range
weapons<00:01:12.020> you<00:01:12.260> might<00:01:12.409> be<00:01:12.590> on<00:01:12.680> a<00:01:12.740> snow<00:01:13.280> bridge
