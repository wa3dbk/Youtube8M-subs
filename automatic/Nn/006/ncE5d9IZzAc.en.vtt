be<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:24.050> repairing<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.199> main<00:00:25.500> line<00:00:25.740> break<00:00:26.099> using

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
be on repairing a main line break using

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.980 
be on repairing a main line break using
a<00:00:27.029> slide<00:00:27.390> repair<00:00:29.060> all<00:00:30.060> right<00:00:30.359> I've<00:00:30.539> drawn<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
a slide repair all right I've drawn a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.709 
a slide repair all right I've drawn a
line<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.500> pipe<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:32.009> demonstrate<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.969> break

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
line on the pipe to demonstrate a break

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.770 
line on the pipe to demonstrate a break
in<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> main<00:00:34.350> line<00:00:34.790> so<00:00:35.790> first<00:00:36.360> thing<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.630> want

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
in the main line so first thing you want

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.330 
in the main line so first thing you want
to<00:00:36.809> do<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.050> make<00:00:37.200> sure<00:00:37.230> your<00:00:37.559> water<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.010> turned

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
to do is make sure your water is turned

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.479 
to do is make sure your water is turned
off<00:00:38.930> but<00:00:39.930> with<00:00:40.110> PVC<00:00:40.469> lock<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.980> doesn't<00:00:41.250> matter

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
off but with PVC lock it doesn't matter

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.209 
off but with PVC lock it doesn't matter
if<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:41.850> wet<00:00:42.090> or<00:00:42.210> dry<00:00:42.410> so<00:00:43.410> if<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.890> stand

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
if it's wet or dry so if you can stand

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.250 
if it's wet or dry so if you can stand
the<00:00:44.520> gushing<00:00:45.300> water<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.899> could<00:00:46.050> actually

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the gushing water you could actually

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.700 
the gushing water you could actually
install<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.250> product<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:49.590> today

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
install the product with it on but today

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.170 
install the product with it on but today
we're<00:00:49.920> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.579> off<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:51.059> our

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
we're going to do it with it off in our

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.020 
we're going to do it with it off in our
demonstration<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.620> I've<00:00:52.829> identified<00:00:53.160> where

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
demonstration so I've identified where

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.330 
demonstration so I've identified where
the<00:00:54.719> cut<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.410> or<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> break<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the cut is and or the break is in the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.849 
the cut is and or the break is in the
line<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.820> then<00:00:57.690> I'm<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.379> cut<00:00:59.300> the<00:01:00.300> pipe

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
line and then I'm going to cut the pipe

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:08.710 
line and then I'm going to cut the pipe
about<00:01:01.859> an<00:01:02.039> inch<00:01:02.309> or<00:01:02.730> two<00:01:04.460> away<00:01:05.460> from<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.000> break

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.640 

using<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.840> PVC<00:01:10.049> cutter<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:11.939> easy

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
using a PVC cutter it's not easy

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.090 
using a PVC cutter it's not easy
sometimes<00:01:13.650> but<00:01:15.170> this<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.380> class<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.920> is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
sometimes but this is class this is

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.570 
sometimes but this is class this is
schedule<00:01:17.490> 40<00:01:17.820> pipe<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.479> little<00:01:18.600> thicker

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
schedule 40 pipe so it's little thicker

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.120 
schedule 40 pipe so it's little thicker
pipe<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> mainline<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:22.439> that's

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
pipe for a mainline so that's that's

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.969 
pipe for a mainline so that's that's
apart<00:01:23.580> there<00:01:23.790> then<00:01:24.180> if<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:25.170> was<00:01:25.409> stationary

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
apart there then if this was stationary

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.580 
apart there then if this was stationary
I'm<00:01:26.430> going<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.670> demonstrate<00:01:26.880> how<00:01:27.479> far<00:01:28.350> back

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
I'm going to demonstrate how far back

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.469 
I'm going to demonstrate how far back
using<00:01:29.220> ace<00:01:29.369> we're<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.000> use<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> side

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
using ace we're going to use a side

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.050 
using ace we're going to use a side
fitting<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.409> side<00:01:31.680> fitting<00:01:32.100> Telescope's

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
fitting this side fitting Telescope's

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.660 
fitting this side fitting Telescope's
depending<00:01:33.990> upon<00:01:34.079> how<00:01:34.650> much<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.189> pipe<00:01:35.400> or

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
depending upon how much of the pipe or

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.730 
depending upon how much of the pipe or
the<00:01:36.270> hole<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.810> you've<00:01:36.960> cut<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.439> need<00:01:37.590> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the hole that you've cut you need to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.100 
the hole that you've cut you need to
fill<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.909> need<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.299> cut<00:01:39.509> back<00:01:39.540> at<00:01:39.930> least

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
fill so you need to cut back at least

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
fill so you need to cut back at least
eight<00:01:40.439> inches<00:01:41.570> for<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.600> fitting<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.110> work<00:01:43.290> so

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
eight inches for the fitting to work so

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.880 
eight inches for the fitting to work so
if<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.430> were<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.670> measure<00:01:44.880> back<00:01:45.180> from<00:01:45.740> where<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
if I were to measure back from where the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.300 
if I were to measure back from where the
break<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.159> back<00:01:47.790> eight<00:01:48.060> inches<00:01:48.479> I'd<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:50.009> here

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
break is back eight inches I'd be here

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.060 
break is back eight inches I'd be here
market<00:01:53.030> right<00:01:53.180> here<00:01:56.560> now<00:01:57.560> I'm<00:01:57.620> going<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:57.890> cut

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
market right here now I'm going to cut

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:09.840 
market right here now I'm going to cut
that<00:01:58.250> again

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.630 

okay<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.150> then<00:02:11.510> I'd<00:02:11.690> remove<00:02:12.190> that<00:02:13.190> part<00:02:13.490> with

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
okay and then I'd remove that part with

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.530 
okay and then I'd remove that part with
the<00:02:13.760> break<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.210> it<00:02:14.360> throw<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.380> away<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:17.360> next
