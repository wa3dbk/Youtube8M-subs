 can we activate the god mode in 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.150

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.710
 normal that is the version of 8 and well 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.210
 the tutorial today is going to deal with this 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.370
 how to activate a god mode of the 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.830
 next way the code I will leave it 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.840
 down electric on the video a 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.030
 explanation of god mode mode 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.850
 to see the settings of all the 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.620
 of all windows 8 that is totally exits 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.180
 Complete information to be 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.740
 looking for the one who best create the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.510
 folder in control panel type but 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.920
 with all the clear information 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.820
 the first thing that we are going to do 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.580
 here 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.890
 will go to the part that says new let's go 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.229
 to select the folder that says 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.470
 folders and here we are going to copy the code 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.030
 I told you before that this will be 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.979
 guzmÃ¡n and there the code will be gone 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.630
 does not have to have any script to the 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.580
 sides does not have to have absolutely 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.490
 nothing of that and the labor moment wants 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.380
 put in and here we create correctly what 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.170
 that is god mode as you can see here 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.850
 next says but not let's 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.350
 enter and as the panel type primer 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.680
 control or removed the information from 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.680
 football 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.799
 the part of him 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.310
 the control panel here as the 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.310
 information 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:51.330
 we will cut the equipment configuration 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.330
 show hide configuration 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.630
 we can review more thoroughly here what else 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.630
 we can find here we can tell the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.070
 File management offline 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.170
 the network connections we are going to make a 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.090
 little bit more down here we can 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.679
 uninstall a program shows the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.050
 programs that are installed in the 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.580
 team for example 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.170
 we check that the programs are 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.210
 installed on the computer if it would be in that 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.250
 it will not change the configuration 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.380
 default device means 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.420
 here totally a control panel but 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.780
 different from what we see in the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.020
 others 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.459
 in the other types of drops in the other 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.990
 type of control panel as we can 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.700
 tell then and here we will have 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.800
 what is soccer that is god mode 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.650
 and we're going to leave it here for you 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.110
 can have the uninstall or see some 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.850
 program that they need in the way god and
