hello dr. Vickie Peterson here I wanted
to<00:00:03.149> answer<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.629> question<00:00:03.899> from<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.980> reader<00:00:05.490> and

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
to answer a question from a reader and

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.849 
to answer a question from a reader and
decided<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.660> do<00:00:06.839> it<00:00:06.870> with<00:00:06.990> video<00:00:07.350> because<00:00:07.740> it

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
decided to do it with video because it

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.560 
decided to do it with video because it
is<00:00:07.980> something<00:00:08.220> that<00:00:08.400> I'm<00:00:08.580> asked<00:00:09.030> frequently

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
is something that I'm asked frequently

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.549 
is something that I'm asked frequently
and<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.469> about<00:00:10.800> green<00:00:11.280> drinks<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.559> green

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
and that is about green drinks and green

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.060 
and that is about green drinks and green
supplements<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.580> use<00:00:15.289> grasses<00:00:16.289> from<00:00:16.680> grains

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
supplements that use grasses from grains

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.400 
supplements that use grasses from grains
that<00:00:17.550> are<00:00:17.940> glutinous<00:00:18.630> grains<00:00:18.960> like<00:00:19.350> wheat

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
that are glutinous grains like wheat

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.359 
that are glutinous grains like wheat
grass<00:00:19.859> barley<00:00:20.369> grass<00:00:20.550> etc<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.949> are<00:00:22.949> these

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
grass barley grass etc and are these

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.040 
grass barley grass etc and are these
safe<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:23.939> someone<00:00:24.150> who<00:00:24.330> has<00:00:24.480> celiac<00:00:24.810> disease

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
safe for someone who has celiac disease

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.679 
safe for someone who has celiac disease
or<00:00:25.470> who<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.769> gluten<00:00:26.099> sensitive<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
or who is gluten sensitive and the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.349 
or who is gluten sensitive and the
answer<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.320> possibly<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:29.519> what<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.910> mean<00:00:30.150> by

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
answer is possibly so what I mean by

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.549 
answer is possibly so what I mean by
that<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.340> when<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.719> sprout<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.750> grain<00:00:34.230> and

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
that is that when you sprout a grain and

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.770 
that is that when you sprout a grain and
the<00:00:35.130> grass<00:00:35.399> starts<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.090> grow<00:00:36.300> from<00:00:36.719> that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the grass starts to grow from that

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.910 
the grass starts to grow from that
sprouted<00:00:37.469> grain<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:39.290> protein<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
sprouted grain the protein the the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.910 
sprouted grain the protein the the
gluten<00:00:41.309> does<00:00:41.879> not<00:00:42.090> develop<00:00:42.809> until<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> grass

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
gluten does not develop until the grass

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.970 
gluten does not develop until the grass
is<00:00:44.219> about<00:00:44.550> two<00:00:45.300> weeks<00:00:45.600> old<00:00:45.930> somewhere<00:00:46.829> between

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
is about two weeks old somewhere between

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.360 
is about two weeks old somewhere between
ten<00:00:47.460> days<00:00:47.700> two<00:00:48.090> weeks<00:00:48.120> old<00:00:48.710> that's<00:00:49.710> when<00:00:49.950> that

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
ten days two weeks old that's when that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.510 
ten days two weeks old that's when that
grass<00:00:50.879> will<00:00:51.600> start<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.320> protein<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.100> it

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
grass will start to have protein in it

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.840 
grass will start to have protein in it
initially<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.420> does<00:00:54.449> not<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.250> really

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
initially it does not so if you really

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.090 
initially it does not so if you really
enjoyed<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.750> wheat<00:00:57.989> grass<00:00:58.260> as<00:00:58.590> an<00:00:58.710> example

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
enjoyed your wheat grass as an example

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.000 
enjoyed your wheat grass as an example
and<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.579> were<00:01:00.289> actually<00:01:01.289> growing<00:01:01.680> it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and you were actually growing it

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.240 
and you were actually growing it
yourself<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:03.170> sprouting<00:01:04.170> your<00:01:04.320> own<00:01:04.500> wheat

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
yourself and sprouting your own wheat

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.840 
yourself and sprouting your own wheat
wheat<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.330> develop<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> grass<00:01:07.159> as<00:01:08.159> long<00:01:08.700> as

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
wheat to develop the grass as long as

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.520 
wheat to develop the grass as long as
you<00:01:08.970> were<00:01:09.060> consuming<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.140> seven<00:01:10.500> to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you were consuming it in the seven to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.649 
you were consuming it in the seven to
ten<00:01:10.920> day<00:01:11.159> area<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.780> should<00:01:12.810> be<00:01:13.380> safe<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
ten day area you should be safe and

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.929 
ten day area you should be safe and
that's<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.990> research<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:17.220> done<00:01:17.729> on

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
that's the research that I have done on

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.960 
that's the research that I have done on
it<00:01:18.119> now<00:01:18.450> when<00:01:19.110> you're<00:01:19.229> buying<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:20.009> drink<00:01:20.640> or

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
it now when you're buying a drink or

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.179 
it now when you're buying a drink or
you're<00:01:21.150> buying<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.659> supplement<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.950> little

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
you're buying a supplement it's a little

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.039 
you're buying a supplement it's a little
different<00:01:23.400> because<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.150> don't<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.509> how<00:01:24.869> old

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
different because you don't know how old

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.920 
different because you don't know how old
the<00:01:25.290> grass<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.070> maybe<00:01:26.729> some<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.750> grass

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the grass is and maybe some of the grass

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.289 
the grass is and maybe some of the grass
is<00:01:28.200> safe<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.710> some<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.130> isn't<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.850> it's

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
is safe and some of it isn't so it's

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.580 
is safe and some of it isn't so it's
it's<00:01:30.570> really<00:01:30.780> risky<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.799> be<00:01:32.670> consuming<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:34.320> my

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
it's really risky to be consuming in my

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.679 
it's really risky to be consuming in my
opinion<00:01:35.009> any<00:01:35.220> product<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.850> has<00:01:35.970> wheat<00:01:36.509> grass

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
opinion any product that has wheat grass

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.960 
opinion any product that has wheat grass
or<00:01:36.930> barley<00:01:37.140> grass<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.890> unless<00:01:38.579> you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
or barley grass in it unless you

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.149 
or barley grass in it unless you
yourself<00:01:39.180> grew<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.049> or<00:01:40.259> maybe<00:01:40.860> you're<00:01:41.130> going

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
yourself grew it or maybe you're going

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.670 
yourself grew it or maybe you're going
to<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.490> Whole<00:01:41.729> Foods<00:01:41.759> or<00:01:42.299> something<00:01:42.750> where<00:01:43.020> they

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
to a Whole Foods or something where they

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.440 
to a Whole Foods or something where they
have<00:01:43.710> trays<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.700> they<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:44.939> exactly

have trays of it and they know exactly

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.260 
have trays of it and they know exactly
when<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.530> grass<00:01:46.740> started<00:01:47.159> growing<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:47.850> other

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
when the grass started growing but other

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.149 
when the grass started growing but other
than<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.930> think<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.590> risk<00:01:49.799> that's

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
than that I I think it's a risk that's

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.940 
than that I I think it's a risk that's
not<00:01:50.369> not<00:01:50.850> worth<00:01:51.090> taking<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.649> certainly

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
not not worth taking you can certainly

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.289 
not not worth taking you can certainly
get<00:01:53.810> green<00:01:54.810> drinks<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.680> green<00:01:56.340> supplements<00:01:57.090> I

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
the risk of maybe getting gluten when we

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.670 
the risk of maybe getting gluten when we
know<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.240> damage<00:02:19.569> that<00:02:19.810> can<00:02:19.959> cause<00:02:20.200> it's

know the damage that can cause it's

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.510 
know the damage that can cause it's
really<00:02:20.980> not<00:02:21.130> worth<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:21.819> I<00:02:22.060> do<00:02:22.330> urge<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:23.080> to

really not worth it so I do urge you to

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
buy from companies if they've got any

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.440 
buy from companies if they've got any

grass in them at all just really double
check<00:02:31.690> because<00:02:31.959> sometimes<00:02:32.470> people<00:02:33.130> say<00:02:33.280> oh<00:02:33.459> I

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
check because sometimes people say oh I

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.430 
check because sometimes people say oh I
mean<00:02:34.120> recently<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:34.600> had<00:02:34.810> an<00:02:34.930> individual<00:02:35.350> who

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
mean recently I had an individual who

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.920 
mean recently I had an individual who
said<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.220> didn't<00:02:36.790> think<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.150> could<00:02:37.270> get<00:02:37.450> gluten

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
said I didn't think you could get gluten

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.449 
said I didn't think you could get gluten
in<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.260> liquid<00:02:38.680> unless<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.220> were<00:02:39.280> drinking

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
in a liquid unless you were drinking

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.300 
in a liquid unless you were drinking
beer<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.300> he<00:02:40.959> knew<00:02:41.080> about<00:02:41.260> beer<00:02:41.560> but<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.160> was

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
beer and he knew about beer but that was

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.630 
beer and he knew about beer but that was
it

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
it

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.059 
it
so<00:02:43.000> sometimes<00:02:43.959> people<00:02:44.110> think<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:44.560> gluten

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
so sometimes people think of gluten

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.530 
so sometimes people think of gluten
being<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.400> food<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.970> not<00:02:46.090> being<00:02:46.330> in<00:02:46.450> a

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540

really do have to look at that because

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.440 
really do have to look at that because
you<00:02:50.890> think<00:02:51.040> oh<00:02:51.220> it's<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.519> green<00:02:51.730> drink<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.239> must

you think oh it's a green drink it must
be<00:02:52.630> healthy<00:02:53.050> not<00:02:53.650> if<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:53.920> green<00:02:54.340> is<00:02:54.489> coming
