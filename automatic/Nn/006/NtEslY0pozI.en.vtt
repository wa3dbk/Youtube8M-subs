I<00:02:38.709> have<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.010> say<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.340> fight<00:02:39.520> seemed

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
I have to say the fight seemed

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.850 
I have to say the fight seemed
particularly<00:02:40.209> between<00:02:40.540> Superman<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.230> Lex

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
particularly between Superman and Lex

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.490 
particularly between Superman and Lex
was<00:02:42.160> was<00:02:42.459> very<00:02:42.850> very<00:02:43.120> intense<00:02:43.600> but<00:02:43.900> for<00:02:44.350> some

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
was was very very intense but for some

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.890 
was was very very intense but for some
part<00:02:44.740> it<00:02:45.670> was<00:02:45.790> also<00:02:46.030> interesting<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.600> see<00:02:46.750> how

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
part it was also interesting to see how

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.900 
part it was also interesting to see how
like<00:02:47.200> how<00:02:47.500> Lois<00:02:47.830> Lane<00:02:48.040> also<00:02:48.459> was<00:02:48.610> given

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
like how Lois Lane also was given

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.420 
like how Lois Lane also was given
superpowers<00:02:49.180> for<00:02:49.570> 24<00:02:49.990> hours<00:02:50.350> as<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:51.010> birthday

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
superpowers for 24 hours as a birthday

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.800 
superpowers for 24 hours as a birthday
present<00:02:51.760> from<00:02:52.000> Superman<00:02:52.450> which<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.630> thought

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
present from Superman which I thought

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.410 
present from Superman which I thought
was<00:02:52.900> very<00:02:52.959> very<00:02:53.500> sweet<00:02:53.740> of<00:02:53.890> him<00:02:54.300> knowing<00:02:55.300> that

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
was very very sweet of him knowing that

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.470 
was very very sweet of him knowing that
he's<00:02:55.570> about<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.990> die<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:57.550> know<00:02:57.670> his<00:02:57.910> 1<00:02:58.209> I

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
he's about to die and you know his 1 I

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.600 
he's about to die and you know his 1 I
guess<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.050> was<00:02:59.140> he's<00:02:59.260> like<00:02:59.290> one<00:02:59.860> wish<00:03:00.190> was<00:03:00.580> to

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
guess that was he's like one wish was to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.360 
guess that was he's like one wish was to
have<00:03:00.910> lowest<00:03:01.360> experience<00:03:02.260> what<00:03:02.980> it's<00:03:03.130> like<00:03:03.190> to

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
have lowest experience what it's like to

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.340 
have lowest experience what it's like to
be<00:03:04.020> him

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
be him

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.350 
be him
you<00:03:05.560> know<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:06.820> I<00:03:06.880> thought<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.239> was<00:03:07.330> that

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
you know and so I thought that was that

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.180 
you know and so I thought that was that
was<00:03:07.630> very<00:03:07.840> very<00:03:08.110> sentimental<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:08.980> very

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
was very very sentimental and very

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.110 
was very very sentimental and very
emotional<00:03:09.430> on<00:03:09.810> Superman's<00:03:10.810> part<00:03:11.910> but<00:03:12.910> yeah<00:03:13.090> I

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
emotional on Superman's part but yeah I

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.509 
emotional on Superman's part but yeah I
mean<00:03:13.239> this<00:03:13.959> this<00:03:14.170> film<00:03:14.440> definitely<00:03:14.650> was<00:03:15.190> was

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
mean this this film definitely was was

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.820

a<00:03:17.860> lot<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.250> emotional<00:03:18.700> factors<00:03:19.150> in<00:03:19.269> there<00:03:19.480> a

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
a lot of emotional factors in there a

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.470 
a lot of emotional factors in there a
bit<00:03:20.500> double-crossin<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.550> know<00:03:21.670> from<00:03:21.910> Solaris

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
bit double-crossin you know from Solaris

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.500 
bit double-crossin you know from Solaris
and<00:03:22.950> as<00:03:23.950> I<00:03:24.130> say<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:24.430> know<00:03:24.700> you've<00:03:24.850> got<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.180> the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
and as I say you know you've got the the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.630 
and as I say you know you've got the the
emotional<00:03:25.930> factor<00:03:26.290> there<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:27.190> then<00:03:27.340> there

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
emotional factor there and then there

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.340 
emotional factor there and then there
was<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.880> Kryptonians<00:03:28.330> that<00:03:28.720> came<00:03:28.930> as<00:03:29.140> well

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
was to Kryptonians that came as well

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.620 
was to Kryptonians that came as well
that<00:03:29.709> popped<00:03:30.400> out<00:03:30.580> of<00:03:30.790> pretty<00:03:31.150> much<00:03:31.300> nowhere

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
that popped out of pretty much nowhere

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.020 
that popped out of pretty much nowhere
but<00:03:32.140> they<00:03:32.290> said<00:03:32.530> they<00:03:32.650> were<00:03:32.709> already<00:03:33.400> distant

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
but they said they were already distant

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.960 
but they said they were already distant
going<00:03:34.420> through<00:03:34.630> space<00:03:35.050> after<00:03:35.920> Krypton<00:03:36.310> was

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
going through space after Krypton was

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.710 
going through space after Krypton was
destroyed<00:03:38.340> then<00:03:39.340> eventually<00:03:39.610> they<00:03:39.910> they're

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
destroyed then eventually they they're

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.710 
destroyed then eventually they they're
both<00:03:40.870> kind<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.709> like<00:03:41.890> fell<00:03:42.250> weak<00:03:42.489> because<00:03:42.730> the

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
both kind of like fell weak because the

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.410 
both kind of like fell weak because the
debris<00:03:44.019> from<00:03:44.320> from<00:03:44.680> Krypton<00:03:45.130> was<00:03:45.420> obviously

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
debris from from Krypton was obviously

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.110 
debris from from Krypton was obviously
highly<00:03:47.260> radiated<00:03:47.920> for<00:03:48.100> them<00:03:48.250> so<00:03:48.519> it

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
highly radiated for them so it

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.390 
highly radiated for them so it
eventually<00:03:49.360> weakened<00:03:50.140> them<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.470> their<00:03:51.190> only

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
eventually weakened them and their only

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.920 
eventually weakened them and their only
way<00:03:51.489> of<00:03:51.670> survival<00:03:52.209> was<00:03:52.329> for<00:03:52.510> Clark<00:03:52.750> was

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
way of survival was for Clark was

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.479 
way of survival was for Clark was
Superman<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.709> send<00:03:53.890> them<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.160> Phantom

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
Superman to send them to the Phantom

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.039 
Superman to send them to the Phantom
Zone<00:03:54.519> even<00:03:55.510> though<00:03:55.600> they<00:03:55.750> pretty<00:03:55.930> much

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049
