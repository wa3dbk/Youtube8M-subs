00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:27.239 
hello and welcome to this After Effects

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.359 
hello and welcome to this After Effects
tutorial<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:28.320> which<00:00:28.650> we're<00:00:28.980> looking<00:00:29.189> at<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
tutorial in which we're looking at the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.790 
tutorial in which we're looking at the
issue<00:00:29.520> of<00:00:29.820> animation<00:00:30.480> lip-sync<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.589> is

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
issue of animation lip-sync that is

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.979 
issue of animation lip-sync that is
creating<00:00:32.519> different<00:00:32.759> lip<00:00:33.120> shapes<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.720> that<00:00:33.870> we

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
creating different lip shapes so that we

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.270 
creating different lip shapes so that we
in<00:00:34.080> shape<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.480> Oshea<00:00:36.480> pan<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:37.379> shape<00:00:37.830> and<00:00:38.010> many

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
in shape and Oshea pan a shape and many

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.520 
in shape and Oshea pan a shape and many
more<00:00:38.489> I'm<00:00:38.699> just<00:00:39.030> using<00:00:39.480> three<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.050> example

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
more I'm just using three for example

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.410 
more I'm just using three for example
and<00:00:40.680> then<00:00:41.190> being<00:00:41.430> able<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.790> switch<00:00:42.239> between

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and then being able to switch between

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.290 
and then being able to switch between
them<00:00:42.809> very<00:00:43.050> quickly<00:00:43.230> when<00:00:44.100> you're<00:00:44.370> sinking<00:00:45.089> to

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
them very quickly when you're sinking to

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.729 
them very quickly when you're sinking to
an<00:00:45.420> audio<00:00:45.690> file<00:00:46.019> that<00:00:46.199> you've<00:00:46.320> brought<00:00:46.470> in

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
an audio file that you've brought in

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.590 
an audio file that you've brought in
from<00:00:47.010> somewhere<00:00:47.460> else<00:00:47.789> into<00:00:48.090> After<00:00:48.360> Effects

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
from somewhere else into After Effects

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.299 
from somewhere else into After Effects
and<00:00:48.840> as<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.500> know<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.890> listen<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> an

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
and as you know you can listen to an

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.760 
and as you know you can listen to an
audio<00:00:50.550> file<00:00:51.059> with<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.480> RAM<00:00:51.840> preview<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.500> 0

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
key on your number pad when you want to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.720 
key on your number pad when you want to
listen<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.500> audio<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.980> then<00:00:56.160> making<00:00:56.399> sure

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
listen to the audio and then making sure

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.189 
listen to the audio and then making sure
that<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> appropriate<00:00:57.300> mouth<00:00:57.660> shape<00:00:58.020> is

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
that the appropriate mouth shape is

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.990 
that the appropriate mouth shape is
showing<00:00:58.500> at<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.949> appropriate<00:00:59.219> time<00:00:59.699> against

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
showing at the appropriate time against

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.470 
showing at the appropriate time against
the<00:01:00.149> audio<00:01:00.510> file<00:01:01.219> so<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.730> tutorial<00:01:02.789> I've

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the audio file so in this tutorial I've

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.570 
the audio file so in this tutorial I've
just<00:01:03.539> got<00:01:03.899> three<00:01:04.140> shapes<00:01:04.440> to<00:01:04.739> make<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.039> simple

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
just got three shapes to make it simple

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.520 
just got three shapes to make it simple
and<00:01:05.670> hopefully<00:01:06.000> not<00:01:06.149> too<00:01:06.330> long<00:01:06.539> but<00:01:07.289> you<00:01:07.440> would

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and hopefully not too long but you would

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.900 
and hopefully not too long but you would
usually<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.070> competition<00:01:08.399> with<00:01:08.759> your

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
usually have a competition with your

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.810 
usually have a competition with your
various<00:01:09.450> mouth<00:01:09.660> shapes<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:11.280> your<00:01:11.490> face

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
various mouth shapes and with your face

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.600 
various mouth shapes and with your face
and<00:01:12.179> your<00:01:12.570> eyes<00:01:12.690> and<00:01:13.380> other<00:01:13.770> bits<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.280> pieces

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
and your eyes and other bits and pieces

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.100 
and your eyes and other bits and pieces
of<00:01:14.640> your<00:01:14.850> character<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.509> can<00:01:15.690> actually<00:01:15.810> do

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
of your character so you can actually do

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.080 
of your character so you can actually do
the<00:01:16.259> lip<00:01:16.380> sync<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.520> move<00:01:17.700> between<00:01:17.880> them

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the lip sync and you move between them

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.150 
the lip sync and you move between them
now<00:01:18.300> I've<00:01:18.420> obviously<00:01:18.630> chosen<00:01:19.080> very<00:01:19.319> big<00:01:19.590> lip

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
now I've obviously chosen very big lip

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.830 
now I've obviously chosen very big lip
shakes<00:01:20.429> just<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.849> demonstrate<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.479> for<00:01:21.720> you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
shakes just to demonstrate this for you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.999 
shakes just to demonstrate this for you
but<00:01:22.020> yours<00:01:22.229> would<00:01:22.380> obviously<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.830> lot

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
but yours would obviously be a lot

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.490 
but yours would obviously be a lot
smaller<00:01:23.250> than<00:01:23.459> this<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.050> as<00:01:25.050> I<00:01:25.140> say<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.319> can

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
smaller than this and as I say you can

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.690 
smaller than this and as I say you can
have<00:01:25.619> many<00:01:25.830> different<00:01:25.979> ones<00:01:26.399> I've<00:01:26.550> only

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
have many different ones I've only

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.430 
have many different ones I've only
chosen<00:01:26.970> three<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.599> can<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.810> up<00:01:27.929> to<00:01:27.959> 15

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
chosen three but you can have up to 15

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.749 
chosen three but you can have up to 15
or<00:01:28.590> whatever<00:01:28.679> different<00:01:29.220> shapes<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.640> you

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
or whatever different shapes and you

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.339 
or whatever different shapes and you
want<00:01:29.910> to<00:01:30.000> be<00:01:30.090> able<00:01:30.149> to<00:01:30.300> go<00:01:30.660> between<00:01:30.840> them<00:01:31.200> very

00:01:31.339 --> 00:01:31.349 
want to be able to go between them very

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:33.440 
want to be able to go between them very
quickly<00:01:31.500> now<00:01:32.369> I'm<00:01:32.489> not<00:01:32.670> actually<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.239> to<00:01:33.330> do

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
quickly now I'm not actually going to do

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.449 
quickly now I'm not actually going to do
the<00:01:33.599> animation<00:01:33.750> part<00:01:34.380> bringing<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.069> audio

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
the animation part bringing the audio

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.070 
the animation part bringing the audio
file<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.149> between<00:01:36.300> the<00:01:36.569> various<00:01:36.899> lip

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
file and going between the various lip

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.080 
file and going between the various lip
shapes<00:01:37.380> what<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.280> want<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> show<00:01:38.789> you<00:01:38.849> is<00:01:39.060> how

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
shapes what I want to show you is how

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.210 
shapes what I want to show you is how
you<00:01:39.300> can<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.899> that<00:01:39.929> the<00:01:40.619> method<00:01:41.039> that's

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
you can do that the method that's

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.460 
you can do that the method that's
involved<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:42.270> switch<00:01:42.539> between<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.110> various

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
involved to switch between the various

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.969 
involved to switch between the various
shapes<00:01:43.770> at<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.610> appropriate<00:01:44.940> time<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.979> then

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
shapes at the appropriate time and then

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.620 
shapes at the appropriate time and then
move<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.459> in<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.819> probably<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.239> a<00:01:48.270> separate

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
move on in a probably in a separate

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.510 
move on in a probably in a separate
tutorial<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.590> show<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.860> how<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.069> create<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
tutorial to show you how to create a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.910 
tutorial to show you how to create a
custom<00:01:51.090> rig<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:52.050> allows<00:01:52.349> you<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.619> very

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
custom rig that allows you to very

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.100 
custom rig that allows you to very
quickly<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.819> animation<00:01:54.209> so<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
quickly do that animation so the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.719 
quickly do that animation so the
appropriate<00:01:55.649> mouth<00:01:55.860> shape<00:01:56.160> shows<00:01:56.459> at<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
appropriate mouth shape shows at the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.210 
appropriate mouth shape shows at the
appropriate<00:01:57.360> time<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.530> we'll<00:01:58.679> show<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.009> two

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
appropriate time so we'll show the two

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.130 
appropriate time so we'll show the two
methods<00:01:59.759> one<00:01:59.819> is<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.209> basic<00:02:00.599> method<00:02:00.899> which<00:02:01.020> is

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
methods one is the basic method which is

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.510 
methods one is the basic method which is
sort<00:02:01.379> of<00:02:01.410> in<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.560> timeline<00:02:02.069> is<00:02:02.099> a<00:02:02.250> little<00:02:02.429> bit

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
sort of in the timeline is a little bit

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.520 
sort of in the timeline is a little bit
fiddly<00:02:02.789> and<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.539> second<00:02:03.869> one<00:02:03.959> is<00:02:03.989> creating

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
fiddly and the second one is creating

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.839 
fiddly and the second one is creating
the<00:02:04.619> Riggin<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:05.009> you're<00:02:05.129> doing<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.399> lot<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.580> work

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
the Riggin if you're doing a lot of work

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:07.639 
the Riggin if you're doing a lot of work
you<00:02:06.149> really<00:02:06.509> want<00:02:06.660> the<00:02:06.720> rig<00:02:06.959> which<00:02:07.289> is<00:02:07.319> a<00:02:07.470> lot

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
you really want the rig which is a lot

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.979 
you really want the rig which is a lot
quicker<00:02:07.910> now<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.030> worth<00:02:09.209> saying<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.720> this

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
quicker now it's worth saying that this

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.710 
quicker now it's worth saying that this
technique<00:02:10.709> works<00:02:10.979> from<00:02:11.310> CC<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.390> way<00:02:12.480> down

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
technique works from CC all the way down

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.740 
technique works from CC all the way down
to<00:02:12.830> cs3<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:14.580> can<00:02:14.730> have<00:02:14.819> any<00:02:14.970> variation<00:02:15.629> of

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
to cs3 you can have any variation of

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.510 
to cs3 you can have any variation of
after<00:02:16.110> effects<00:02:16.349> in<00:02:16.620> between<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.190> works<00:02:17.400> just

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
after effects in between it works just

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.210 
after effects in between it works just
as<00:02:17.790> well<00:02:17.849> in<00:02:18.090> all<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.330> them<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.980> mainly<00:02:19.980> I'm

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
as well in all of them and mainly I'm

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.250 
as well in all of them and mainly I'm
also<00:02:20.489> going<00:02:20.849> to<00:02:20.940> be<00:02:21.060> working<00:02:21.420> in<00:02:21.540> frames<00:02:21.989> at

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
also going to be working in frames at

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.479 
also going to be working in frames at
the<00:02:22.319> moment<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.650> can<00:02:22.739> see<00:02:22.829> my<00:02:22.950> compositions

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
the moment you can see my compositions

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.599 
the moment you can see my compositions
in<00:02:23.670> seconds<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.450> I'm<00:02:25.019> 30<00:02:25.349> seconds<00:02:25.980> but<00:02:26.489> I

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
in seconds and I'm 30 seconds but I

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.190 
in seconds and I'm 30 seconds but I
actually<00:02:26.790> want<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.180> work<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.540> frames<00:02:27.870> now

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
actually want to work in frames now

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.460 
actually want to work in frames now
cs6<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:29.069> CC<00:02:29.580> its<00:02:29.700> control<00:02:30.150> click<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.780> can't

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
cs6 and CC its control click I can't

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.960 
cs6 and CC its control click I can't
quite<00:02:31.680> remember<00:02:31.890> what<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.280> was<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:32.580> previous

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
quite remember what it was in previous

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.850 
quite remember what it was in previous
versions<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.480> might<00:02:33.629> be<00:02:33.780> all<00:02:33.900> click<00:02:34.200> but

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
versions it might be all click but

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.500 
versions it might be all click but
otherwise<00:02:35.069> you<00:02:35.280> need<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.550> get<00:02:35.700> into<00:02:35.879> frames

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
otherwise you need to get into frames

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.229 
otherwise you need to get into frames
just<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.959> make<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.230> slightly<00:02:37.440> easier<00:02:37.849> so<00:02:38.849> this

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
just to make it slightly easier so this

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.540 
just to make it slightly easier so this
is<00:02:39.269> my<00:02:39.540> main<00:02:39.750> composition<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.590> in<00:02:41.160> my<00:02:41.310> main

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
is my main composition and in my main

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.339 
is my main composition and in my main
composition<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.269> would<00:02:42.390> have<00:02:42.510> all<00:02:42.690> my<00:02:42.989> bits<00:02:43.140> and

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
composition I would have all my bits and

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.680 
composition I would have all my bits and
pieces<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.769> face<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.280> eyes<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:45.180> background

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
pieces to face the eyes the background

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.570 
pieces to face the eyes the background
everything<00:02:46.170> but<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.470> would<00:02:46.680> also<00:02:46.800> have<00:02:47.040> all<00:02:47.340> my

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
everything but I would also have all my

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.330 
everything but I would also have all my
mouth<00:02:48.180> shapes<00:02:48.569> so<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.680> would<00:02:49.890> go<00:02:50.069> into<00:02:50.190> the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
mouth shapes so I would go into the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.979 
mouth shapes so I would go into the
competition<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.880> select<00:02:51.269> all<00:02:51.540> those<00:02:51.720> mouth

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
competition and select all those mouth

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.830 
competition and select all those mouth
shapes<00:02:52.760> once<00:02:53.760> they're<00:02:53.940> all<00:02:54.060> selected<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.630> want

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
shapes once they're all selected I want

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.680 
shapes once they're all selected I want
to<00:02:54.989> right<00:02:55.319> click<00:02:55.349> pre<00:02:56.250> compose<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.060> in

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
to right click pre compose and in

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.449 
to right click pre compose and in
previous<00:02:58.110> versions<00:02:58.290> with<00:02:58.769> them<00:02:58.890> all<00:02:59.010> selected

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
previous versions with them all selected

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.210 
previous versions with them all selected
it<00:02:59.580> would<00:02:59.670> be<00:02:59.790> layer<00:03:00.060> pre<00:03:00.360> compose<00:03:01.069> and<00:03:02.069> once

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
it would be layer pre compose and once

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.039 
it would be layer pre compose and once
they're<00:03:02.370> pre<00:03:02.549> compose<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.599> then<00:03:03.690> call<00:03:03.870> them

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
they're pre compose and then call them

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.039 
they're pre compose and then call them
shapes<00:03:04.650> pre<00:03:05.040> comp<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.750> i'm<00:03:06.750> going<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.930> move

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
shapes pre comp and i'm going to move

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.690 
shapes pre comp and i'm going to move
all<00:03:07.260> attributes<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:07.920> i'm<00:03:08.130> going<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.340> open<00:03:08.459> the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
all attributes and i'm going to open the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.280 
all attributes and i'm going to open the
new<00:03:08.819> composition<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:09.510> i'm<00:03:09.599> going<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.750> click<00:03:09.810> OK

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
new composition so i'm going to click OK

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.830 
new composition so i'm going to click OK
there's<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.769> composition<00:03:11.280> opened<00:03:11.670> now<00:03:12.599> i

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
there's the composition opened now i

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.470 
there's the composition opened now i
actually<00:03:13.230> only<00:03:13.799> want<00:03:14.220> each<00:03:14.459> one<00:03:14.489> of<00:03:14.910> these<00:03:15.180> to

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
actually only want each one of these to

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.729 
actually only want each one of these to
last<00:03:15.720> for<00:03:16.110> one<00:03:16.410> frame<00:03:17.069> at<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:18.239> moment<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:18.780> 750

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
last for one frame at the moment is 750

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.259 
last for one frame at the moment is 750
frames<00:03:19.980> but<00:03:20.130> i<00:03:20.190> actually<00:03:20.430> only<00:03:20.730> want<00:03:20.970> them<00:03:21.060> one

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
frames but i actually only want them one

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.330 
frames but i actually only want them one
frame<00:03:21.599> long<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.829> what<00:03:22.920> i'm<00:03:23.010> going<00:03:23.099> to<00:03:23.160> do<00:03:23.310> is

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
frame long so what i'm going to do is

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.610 
frame long so what i'm going to do is
select<00:03:23.610> them<00:03:23.940> all<00:03:24.000> again<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:24.540> holding<00:03:25.530> the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
select them all again and holding the

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.550 
select them all again and holding the
Alt<00:03:25.890> key<00:03:26.130> i'm<00:03:26.549> going<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.420> do<00:03:27.569> the<00:03:27.780> close<00:03:28.290> square

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
Alt key i'm going to do the close square

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.860 
Alt key i'm going to do the close square
brackets<00:03:29.329> that<00:03:30.329> looks<00:03:30.540> like<00:03:30.720> they've

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
brackets that looks like they've

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.170 
brackets that looks like they've
disappeared<00:03:31.440> but<00:03:31.620> if<00:03:31.769> i<00:03:31.829> zoom<00:03:31.860> in<00:03:32.400> right<00:03:32.940> down

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
disappeared but if i zoom in right down

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.629 
disappeared but if i zoom in right down
here<00:03:33.450> you'll<00:03:34.380> see<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.799> actually<00:03:35.340> they're

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
here you'll see that actually they're

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.729 
here you'll see that actually they're
all<00:03:35.790> one<00:03:36.000> frame<00:03:36.359> long<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:37.230> I've<00:03:37.319> cut<00:03:37.530> them<00:03:37.680> down

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
all one frame long so I've cut them down

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.559 
all one frame long so I've cut them down
to<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.100> minimum<00:03:38.430> length<00:03:38.700> they<00:03:38.970> can<00:03:39.150> be<00:03:39.329> and

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
to the minimum length they can be and

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.960 
to the minimum length they can be and
the<00:03:40.380> next<00:03:40.560> thing<00:03:40.739> i<00:03:40.859> want<00:03:40.889> to<00:03:41.040> do<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.250> separate

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
the next thing i want to do is separate

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.120 
the next thing i want to do is separate
them<00:03:42.180> out<00:03:42.299> so<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.230> each<00:03:43.500> one<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.799> them<00:03:43.980> and

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
them out so that each one of them and

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.039 
them out so that each one of them and
you<00:03:44.190> might<00:03:44.340> have<00:03:44.519> 10<00:03:44.819> 15<00:03:45.299> 20<00:03:45.660> whatever<00:03:45.900> they're

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
you might have 10 15 20 whatever they're

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.050 
you might have 10 15 20 whatever they're
going<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.260> be<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.920> separate<00:03:47.400> them<00:03:47.519> out<00:03:47.700> i'm

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
going to be you separate them out i'm

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.819 
going to be you separate them out i'm
going<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.660> go<00:03:48.780> bottom<00:03:49.200> from<00:03:49.380> top<00:03:49.590> but<00:03:49.739> it

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
going to go bottom from top but it

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:50.930 
going to go bottom from top but it
really<00:03:49.980> doesn't<00:03:50.160> matter<00:03:50.340> which<00:03:50.609> way<00:03:50.760> round

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
really doesn't matter which way round

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.660 
really doesn't matter which way round
you<00:03:51.150> go<00:03:51.329> so<00:03:51.810> they're<00:03:51.959> all<00:03:52.139> separated<00:03:52.739> out<00:03:53.010> fire

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
you go so they're all separated out fire

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.030 
you go so they're all separated out fire
one<00:03:54.000> frame<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.780> then<00:03:55.560> i'm<00:03:55.709> going<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:55.889> go<00:03:55.980> to

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
one frame and then i'm going to go to

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.340 
one frame and then i'm going to go to
the<00:03:56.190> last<00:03:56.430> frame<00:03:56.639> chance<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.180> be<00:03:57.269> there<00:03:57.450> n<00:03:57.690> to

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
the last frame chance to be there n to

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.680 
the last frame chance to be there n to
end<00:03:58.590> my<00:03:58.980> work<00:03:59.190> area<00:03:59.489> so<00:04:00.239> it's<00:04:00.359> going<00:04:00.540> around

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
end my work area so it's going around

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.800 
end my work area so it's going around
those<00:04:01.109> three<00:04:01.470> frames<00:04:02.180> right<00:04:03.180> click<00:04:03.569> on<00:04:03.690> the

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
those three frames right click on the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.440 
those three frames right click on the
bar<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.230> then<00:04:05.130> choose<00:04:05.430> trim<00:04:05.850> comp<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.420> work

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
bar and then choose trim comp to work

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.710 
bar and then choose trim comp to work
area<00:04:07.109> and<00:04:07.290> that<00:04:07.769> is<00:04:07.950> now<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.160> three<00:04:08.790> frame<00:04:09.299> long

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
area and that is now a three frame long

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.379 
area and that is now a three frame long
composition<00:04:10.609> you<00:04:11.609> might<00:04:11.760> think<00:04:11.790> that's<00:04:12.120> crazy

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
composition you might think that's crazy

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.089 
composition you might think that's crazy
but<00:04:12.690> this<00:04:12.810> is<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.079> technique<00:04:13.470> we<00:04:13.620> need<00:04:13.799> to<00:04:13.920> use

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
but this is the technique we need to use

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.279 
but this is the technique we need to use
so<00:04:14.910> I've<00:04:15.000> got<00:04:15.150> my<00:04:15.180> three<00:04:15.599> frame<00:04:16.049> long

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
so I've got my three frame long

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.440 
so I've got my three frame long
composition<00:04:16.979> which<00:04:17.220> would<00:04:17.430> be<00:04:17.609> 15<00:04:18.180> frames

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
composition which would be 15 frames

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.500 
composition which would be 15 frames
have<00:04:18.660> you<00:04:18.780> had<00:04:18.959> 15<00:04:19.349> different<00:04:19.560> mouth<00:04:19.950> shapes

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
have you had 15 different mouth shapes

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.850 
have you had 15 different mouth shapes
basically<00:04:21.510> it's<00:04:21.810> got<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.139> be<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.380> length<00:04:22.590> of

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
basically it's got to be the length of

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.310 
basically it's got to be the length of
the<00:04:23.700> number<00:04:24.090> of<00:04:24.240> mouth<00:04:24.450> shapes<00:04:24.840> that<00:04:24.930> you<00:04:25.110> have

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
the number of mouth shapes that you have

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.930 
the number of mouth shapes that you have
to<00:04:25.650> make<00:04:25.800> this<00:04:25.919> particular<00:04:26.190> technique<00:04:26.700> work

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
to make this particular technique work

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.700 
to make this particular technique work
now<00:04:27.840> I'm<00:04:27.960> going<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.139> go<00:04:28.229> back<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.470> the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
now I'm going to go back to the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.320 
now I'm going to go back to the
composition<00:04:29.250> where<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.460> existed<00:04:29.880> and<00:04:30.210> there

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
composition where it existed and there

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.240 
composition where it existed and there
it<00:04:30.450> is<00:04:30.479> tiny<00:04:30.990> little<00:04:31.260> competition<00:04:31.800> or<00:04:32.039> pre

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
it is tiny little competition or pre

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.279 
it is tiny little competition or pre
comp<00:04:32.490> inside<00:04:32.820> my<00:04:33.000> main<00:04:33.150> composition<00:04:33.479> and<00:04:34.020> all

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
comp inside my main composition and all

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.779 
comp inside my main composition and all
my<00:04:34.410> other<00:04:34.560> layers<00:04:34.919> would<00:04:35.160> still<00:04:35.400> be<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.610> full

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
my other layers would still be the full

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.630 
my other layers would still be the full
30<00:04:36.000> seconds<00:04:36.570> long<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:37.020> 750<00:04:37.800> frames<00:04:38.070> which

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
30 seconds long the 750 frames which

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.339 
30 seconds long the 750 frames which
would<00:04:38.849> include<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.690> shape<00:04:39.930> of<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.140> face

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
would include the the shape of the face

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:41.780 
would include the the shape of the face
and<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.590> eyeballs<00:04:40.950> and<00:04:41.039> what<00:04:41.159> have<00:04:41.310> you

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
and the eyeballs and what have you

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.730 
and the eyeballs and what have you
and<00:04:41.880> now<00:04:42.390> on<00:04:42.540> this<00:04:42.780> particular<00:04:43.140> layer<00:04:43.530> I'm

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
and now on this particular layer I'm

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.860 
and now on this particular layer I'm
going<00:04:43.800> to<00:04:44.190> right<00:04:44.490> click<00:04:44.520> on<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:44.940> layer<00:04:45.090> I'm

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
going to right click on the layer I'm

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.020 
going to right click on the layer I'm
going<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:46.080> go<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.200> time<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.920> then<00:04:47.730> going<00:04:47.880> to

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
going to go to time and then going to

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.630 
going to go to time and then going to
enable<00:04:48.330> time<00:04:48.810> remapping<00:04:49.340> now<00:04:50.340> I'm<00:04:50.400> going<00:04:50.580> to

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
enable time remapping now I'm going to

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.520 
enable time remapping now I'm going to
zoom<00:04:50.760> in<00:04:51.210> just<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.510> tad<00:04:51.690> see<00:04:51.930> concedes<00:04:52.230> a<00:04:52.350> little

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
zoom in just a tad see concedes a little

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.440 
zoom in just a tad see concedes a little
bit<00:04:52.650> better<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:53.670> then<00:04:53.850> we've<00:04:53.970> got<00:04:54.000> time

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
bit better and then we've got time

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.000 
bit better and then we've got time
remapping<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:54.990> if<00:04:55.050> I<00:04:55.140> just<00:04:55.170> go<00:04:55.530> through<00:04:55.860> these

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
remapping and if I just go through these

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.390 
remapping and if I just go through these
three<00:04:56.280> frames<00:04:57.060> that<00:04:57.210> you<00:04:57.270> see<00:04:57.480> frame<00:04:57.840> 0<00:04:58.380> to<00:04:59.160> 1

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
three frames that you see frame 0 to 1

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.750 
three frames that you see frame 0 to 1
is<00:04:59.670> the<00:05:00.300> first<00:05:00.960> shape<00:05:01.230> second<00:05:02.010> shape<00:05:02.220> third

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
is the first shape second shape third

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.090 
is the first shape second shape third
shape<00:05:03.060> so<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:04.280> or<00:05:05.280> II<00:05:06.560> okay<00:05:07.560> so<00:05:07.620> they're

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
shape so I or II okay so they're

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.650 
shape so I or II okay so they're
actually<00:05:08.520> based<00:05:08.760> on<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.090> frames<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:09.570> then

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
actually based on the frames and then

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.290 
actually based on the frames and then
nothing<00:05:10.020> more<00:05:10.280> now<00:05:11.280> what<00:05:11.490> we<00:05:11.610> want<00:05:11.730> to<00:05:11.850> do<00:05:12.120> is

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
nothing more now what we want to do is

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.320 
nothing more now what we want to do is
we<00:05:12.450> want<00:05:12.480> to<00:05:12.720> be<00:05:12.900> able<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.320> animate<00:05:13.790> this<00:05:14.790> by

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
we want to be able to animate this by

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.450 
we want to be able to animate this by
using<00:05:15.510> time<00:05:16.020> remapping<00:05:16.440> so<00:05:17.040> that<00:05:17.190> we<00:05:17.280> can<00:05:17.430> have

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
using time remapping so that we can have

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.820 
using time remapping so that we can have
any<00:05:17.820> frame<00:05:18.240> we<00:05:18.480> want<00:05:18.720> at<00:05:18.930> any<00:05:19.050> point<00:05:19.500> in<00:05:19.710> the

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
any frame we want at any point in the

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.890 
any frame we want at any point in the
composition<00:05:20.490> so<00:05:21.330> what<00:05:21.450> I'm<00:05:21.540> going<00:05:21.630> to<00:05:21.690> do<00:05:21.810> is

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
composition so what I'm going to do is

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.090 
composition so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:05:21.960> going<00:05:22.050> to<00:05:22.110> delete<00:05:22.230> this<00:05:22.410> second<00:05:22.920> keyframe

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
I'm going to delete this second keyframe

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.490 
I'm going to delete this second keyframe
because<00:05:23.490> I<00:05:23.550> don't<00:05:23.700> need<00:05:23.820> that<00:05:23.880> one<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.500> I'm

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
because I don't need that one and I'm

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.740 
because I don't need that one and I'm
going<00:05:25.830> to<00:05:26.070> just<00:05:26.430> zoom<00:05:26.790> out<00:05:26.940> a<00:05:27.000> tad<00:05:27.330> now<00:05:27.510> so<00:05:27.570> you

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
going to just zoom out a tad now so you

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.680 
going to just zoom out a tad now so you
can<00:05:27.900> see<00:05:28.140> it<00:05:28.230> and<00:05:28.350> say<00:05:28.830> at<00:05:29.010> 25<00:05:29.490> frames<00:05:29.730> if<00:05:30.600> I

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
can see it and say at 25 frames if I

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.960 
can see it and say at 25 frames if I
went<00:05:30.870> there<00:05:31.200> and<00:05:31.740> I<00:05:31.980> was<00:05:32.070> to<00:05:32.280> have<00:05:32.340> animated

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
went there and I was to have animated

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.450 
went there and I was to have animated
the<00:05:33.690> time<00:05:34.080> remapping<00:05:34.470> and<00:05:34.800> I<00:05:34.920> was<00:05:35.070> to<00:05:35.190> choose

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
the time remapping and I was to choose

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.600 
the time remapping and I was to choose
say<00:05:35.760> to<00:05:36.540> at<00:05:37.200> that<00:05:37.440> point<00:05:37.800> I've<00:05:38.280> got<00:05:38.580> a

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
say to at that point I've got a

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.100 
say to at that point I've got a
different<00:05:38.970> shape<00:05:39.210> however<00:05:39.630> what<00:05:39.870> you<00:05:39.990> will

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
different shape however what you will

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.040 
different shape however what you will
see<00:05:40.350> is<00:05:40.530> I<00:05:40.800> kind<00:05:41.790> of<00:05:41.880> go<00:05:42.120> through<00:05:42.150> other<00:05:42.690> shapes

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
see is I kind of go through other shapes

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.620 
see is I kind of go through other shapes
in<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.350> middle<00:05:43.590> so<00:05:44.550> in<00:05:44.730> control<00:05:45.060> Z<00:05:45.390> to<00:05:45.540> undo

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
in the middle so in control Z to undo

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.950 
in the middle so in control Z to undo
that<00:05:46.050> all<00:05:46.290> i<00:05:46.350> need<00:05:46.830> to<00:05:46.860> do<00:05:47.190> at<00:05:47.340> this<00:05:47.460> point<00:05:47.580> is

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
that all i need to do at this point is

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.000 
that all i need to do at this point is
actually<00:05:48.960> right<00:05:49.200> click<00:05:49.470> on<00:05:49.560> this<00:05:49.680> first

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
actually right click on this first

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.390 
actually right click on this first
keyframe<00:05:50.280> and<00:05:50.990> simply<00:05:51.990> choose<00:05:52.320> toggle<00:05:53.220> whole

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
keyframe and simply choose toggle whole

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.730 
keyframe and simply choose toggle whole
key<00:05:53.610> frame<00:05:53.880> which<00:05:54.690> means<00:05:54.990> that<00:05:55.080> the<00:05:55.260> keyframe

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
key frame which means that the keyframe

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.910 
key frame which means that the keyframe
will<00:05:55.920> hold<00:05:56.310> until<00:05:56.700> i<00:05:57.000> make<00:05:57.240> a<00:05:57.300> change<00:05:57.720> cert<00:05:58.560> 30

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
will hold until i make a change cert 30

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.040 
will hold until i make a change cert 30
frames<00:05:59.370> which<00:05:59.820> is<00:05:59.970> just<00:06:00.090> over<00:06:00.270> one<00:06:00.540> second

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
frames which is just over one second

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.890 
frames which is just over one second
then<00:06:01.380> i<00:06:01.410> can<00:06:01.710> change<00:06:02.010> it<00:06:02.160> to<00:06:02.190> two<00:06:02.580> I've<00:06:03.480> got<00:06:03.810> the

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
then i can change it to two I've got the

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.330 
then i can change it to two I've got the
other<00:06:04.020> one<00:06:04.110> and<00:06:04.380> nothing<00:06:04.710> will<00:06:04.980> happen

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
other one and nothing will happen

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.050 
other one and nothing will happen
between<00:06:06.030> those<00:06:06.390> two<00:06:06.630> keyframes<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.880> so<00:06:08.880> if<00:06:08.970> I

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
between those two keyframes and so if I

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.330 
between those two keyframes and so if I
go<00:06:09.090> forward<00:06:09.480> to<00:06:09.660> 50<00:06:09.960> frames<00:06:10.200> and<00:06:10.590> I<00:06:10.650> take<00:06:10.950> it<00:06:11.100> to

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
go forward to 50 frames and I take it to

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.690 
go forward to 50 frames and I take it to
one<00:06:11.810> I'm<00:06:12.860> going<00:06:13.860> through<00:06:14.070> all<00:06:14.160> the<00:06:14.280> various

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
one I'm going through all the various

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.340 
one I'm going through all the various
different<00:06:15.090> keyframes<00:06:15.540> I've<00:06:15.750> got<00:06:15.990> and<00:06:16.170> they

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
different keyframes I've got and they

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.920 
different keyframes I've got and they
will<00:06:16.500> hold<00:06:16.740> until<00:06:17.220> I<00:06:18.060> get<00:06:18.420> to<00:06:18.450> the<00:06:18.600> appropriate

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
will hold until I get to the appropriate

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.860 
will hold until I get to the appropriate
place<00:06:19.350> now<00:06:20.070> this<00:06:20.460> is<00:06:20.670> fine<00:06:21.060> if<00:06:21.420> you've<00:06:21.780> only

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
place now this is fine if you've only

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.420 
place now this is fine if you've only
got<00:06:22.110> a<00:06:22.140> few<00:06:22.350> mouth<00:06:22.560> shapes<00:06:22.920> and<00:06:23.100> you<00:06:23.250> can

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
got a few mouth shapes and you can

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.610 
got a few mouth shapes and you can
remember<00:06:23.700> what<00:06:24.030> number<00:06:24.480> they<00:06:24.630> are<00:06:24.810> associated

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
remember what number they are associated

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.590 
remember what number they are associated
with<00:06:25.650> so<00:06:26.430> we<00:06:26.550> can<00:06:26.580> see<00:06:26.850> that<00:06:27.000> we've<00:06:27.090> got<00:06:27.120> zero

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
with so we can see that we've got zero

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.080 
with so we can see that we've got zero
is<00:06:27.930> one<00:06:28.170> shape<00:06:28.500> to<00:06:28.740> is<00:06:29.070> another<00:06:29.370> shape<00:06:29.640> one<00:06:29.910> is

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
is one shape to is another shape one is

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.460 
is one shape to is another shape one is
another<00:06:30.420> shape<00:06:30.720> and<00:06:30.870> you<00:06:30.930> might<00:06:31.080> write<00:06:31.260> it<00:06:31.440> on

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
another shape and you might write it on

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.770 
another shape and you might write it on
a<00:06:31.590> piece<00:06:31.620> of<00:06:31.800> paper<00:06:31.920> or<00:06:32.400> whatever<00:06:33.150> to<00:06:33.390> create

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
a piece of paper or whatever to create

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.170 
a piece of paper or whatever to create
that<00:06:34.020> kind<00:06:34.290> of<00:06:34.470> animation<00:06:34.830> which<00:06:35.610> is<00:06:35.760> fine<00:06:36.000> as

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
that kind of animation which is fine as

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.360 
that kind of animation which is fine as
I<00:06:36.270> say<00:06:36.450> as<00:06:36.630> long<00:06:36.870> as<00:06:37.050> you've<00:06:37.230> got<00:06:37.260> the<00:06:38.190> ability

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
I say as long as you've got the ability

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.340 
I say as long as you've got the ability
to<00:06:38.940> be<00:06:39.030> able<00:06:39.120> to<00:06:39.270> remember<00:06:39.540> all<00:06:39.870> the<00:06:40.020> different

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
to be able to remember all the different

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.560 
to be able to remember all the different
key<00:06:40.500> frames<00:06:40.800> but<00:06:41.340> it'll<00:06:41.550> be<00:06:41.640> a<00:06:41.670> lot<00:06:41.970> easier<00:06:42.150> and

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
key frames but it'll be a lot easier and

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.170 
key frames but it'll be a lot easier and
a<00:06:42.720> lot<00:06:42.870> better<00:06:43.110> if<00:06:43.470> you<00:06:43.920> created<00:06:44.280> a<00:06:44.460> custom<00:06:44.700> rig

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
a lot better if you created a custom rig

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.480 
a lot better if you created a custom rig
which<00:06:45.780> gave<00:06:46.050> you<00:06:46.230> the<00:06:46.380> indication<00:06:46.770> at<00:06:47.190> the<00:06:47.310> top

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
which gave you the indication at the top

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.100 
which gave you the indication at the top
of<00:06:47.520> the<00:06:47.670> screen<00:06:47.850> as<00:06:48.120> to<00:06:48.270> all<00:06:48.510> the<00:06:48.780> different

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
of the screen as to all the different

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.020 
of the screen as to all the different
shapes<00:06:49.350> you<00:06:49.500> have<00:06:49.740> and<00:06:49.980> a<00:06:50.400> slider<00:06:50.700> that<00:06:50.880> you

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
shapes you have and a slider that you

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.400 
shapes you have and a slider that you
just<00:06:51.180> slide<00:06:51.419> over<00:06:51.600> the<00:06:51.750> appropriate<00:06:52.200> shape

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410 
just slide over the appropriate shape

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.960 
just slide over the appropriate shape
