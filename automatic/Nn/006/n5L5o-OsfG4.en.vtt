00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.109
 and so we go to the analysis of the agenda 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.240
 open and I was talking about what 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:10.270
 try or we will talk about the offensive 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.010
 jihadist of the fact in iraq we are going to 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.900
 know a little more about who is 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.580
 this terrorist group that before 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.770
 knew as an Islamic state of iraq and 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.990
 the lift and changed its name to state 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.370
 Islamic Iraq and Syria since 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.620
 they captured the second most city 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.810
 important event of iraq mosul on June 10 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.910
 the daes advanced towards the south towards 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.890
 Baghdad confiscating on his way to 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.400
 some cities military bases and 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.960
 assets rich in oil resources in 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.329
 the richest terrorist organization in the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.100
 world controls a large territory that is 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.410
 extends from to the bar in the province 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.210
 oriental from aleo in syria to suleiman 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.070
 beck in the Iraqi province of 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.649
 Salahuddin is made up of jihadists 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.480
 of several Arab countries and their members 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.149
 they are extremely violent 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.399
 disciplined and well armed the 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.880
 analysts estimate that they have the 33 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.860
 thousand 5,000 fighters in 2013 the daes 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.230
 10,000 operations were carried out in 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.940
 irak established control over long 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.670
 strips of silvia and was expelled from to 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.420
 qaeda for continuously challenging the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.060
 legitimacy 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.830
 its cause its military progress the wealth 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.590
 and the media apparatus have helped him 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.270
 succeed in your campaign while the 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.990
 recruits continue to come to the is 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.509
 many of them coming from the west 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.070
 let's launch directly with galp 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.350
 beautiful hamad he is an analyst 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.810
 international organization specialized in 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.780
 Middle East also journalist of the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.430
 signal to nur tb thanks for joining us 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.740
 ghaleb and I ask him the first question 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.009
 besides welcoming him because 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.470
 just now president usa barack 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.740
 obama is deciding this possibility 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.740
 of bombing dax troops in iraq is 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.049
 a coincidence also that this is 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.250
 giving after the Israeli offensive 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:57.410
 against Palestinian forward 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.410
 adriana good days and 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.720
 the government's intention to bomb 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.660
 to elda's troops is I think it 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.600
 inscribes in a fact that these troops 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.200
 They have gone out of hand control 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.910
 that had us about all these groups 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.970
 who has funded and who has created 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.580
 originally with al qaida 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.400
 and today it has been transformed into a 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.310
 uncontrollable monster that is advancing 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.890
 day by day through the territories of the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.790
 Arab countries threatening allies 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.530
 narrow 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:39.730
 US as Saudi Arabia therefore 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:43.590
 I think that obeys the intention of 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.590
 want to bomb these troops 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.980
 Now, you talk about how they left 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.569
 of your hands because because you already 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.330
 we had seen and we have seen that this 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.819
 ages had funding from this one of 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.100
 this country did not give me you believe that usa 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.890
 did not measure the consequences of having a 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.380
 terrorist group of this level the most 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.850
 rich of the world 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.800
 actually what has happened is that 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.510
 USA has commissioned a key job in 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.790
 hand through Saudi Arabia's 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.909
 try turkey 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.299
 to these Salafist terrorist groups or 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:22.579
 javi has completely stopped 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.590
 disguise have nothing to do with the 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:28.819
 Islam 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.420
 and that they really be proud in their 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.700
 power 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.260
 and now you can not stop them so 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.270
 so much now they want to try to stop them 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.120
 somehow in lebanon is it 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:46.319
 fighting they have taken the city of 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.380
 give salt in the valley of the bekaa where 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.970
 are facing the Lebanese army the 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.670
 which has the support of the population 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.440
 Lebanon and the Lebanese diaspora in the 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.800
 world 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.020
 and that's entrance to lebanon actually 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.930
 aims to provoke the reaction 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.390
 of the Lebanese resistance that is 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.600
 paying attention also to what is 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.280
 happening in Palestine with the genocide 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.540
 who is committing israel in the strip 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.090
 of gaza now usa with this reactivate to 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.920
 an invasion or intervention 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.440
 usually in iraq 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.360
 and you have already announced that you wanted 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.139
 enter irak again 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.430
 today the picture is very different with a 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:37.630
 They will be very strong and very close to Iraq 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:42.940
 irak who really wants to achieve a 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:45.040
 stable government despite the fifth 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.980
 columns that have inside that 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.830
 permanently undermine the actions of the 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.730
 Iraqi government 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:57.090
 therefore the USA will see hard 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.930
 this time to enter Iraq and it is not 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.210
 attacking all irak 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.960
 and I think about the situation 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.569
 is through complex 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.550
 that the US seizes the shipment 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.420
 of these troops certain air attacks 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.280
 for 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.280
 or launch attacks against Syria 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:22.360
 silvia is still fighting against 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:25.950
 terrorist troops within the country and 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.410
 nobody knows what the intention may be 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.710
 what we believe at least 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.710
 I believe 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.990
 is that they want to end all the 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.510
 resistance in the region 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.420
 silvia is part of the axis of the 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:45.440
 resistance next to ctera and the 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.360
 Lebanese resistance today Israel is 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.060
 use 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.330
 to the hamas resistance to 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.000
 exterminate the Palestinian people for 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.480
 enter gaza again 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.750
 and obviously everything is inscribed within 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.380
 the same word resistance resistance 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.330
 who do not want more in the Middle East 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:11.510
 against US imperialism 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.130
 European and Israeli Zionism 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.380
 we just see also that in addition to 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.370
 this situation in Iraq this offensive 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.370
 in and 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.300
 The conflicts that are 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.330
 have aroused in recent weeks in 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.650
 afghanistan in libya all this there is a 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.480
 leading relationship between all these 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.320
 conflicts where also symbol that 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.810
 levi's US insurance because here 's a 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.750
 project a new middle east and this 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:41.140
 We have repeated countless times one 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:44.560
 Middle East more fragmented more 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:48.590
 divided in the sax-like style of 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:52.150
 beginning of the 20th century but this time 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:54.419
 and that has been divided into bastions 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.880
 religious 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:07:02.949
 Christians on the one hand muslims other and 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:04.270
 other ethnic groups that are in the region and of 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:08.759
 that way is obviously going to be able 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:12.160
 better control the area take the domain 

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:15.100
 strategic of the region the steps of 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.590
 gas pipelines and pipelines towards evil 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:21.490
 mediterrani from there to europe and 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:24.460
 looking as always attentively 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.350
 towards Russia and China- and specifically 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.970
 towards these markets and the efforts that 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.199
 have these nations made to advance 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.210
 this multipolar world 

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:33.100
 thank you Welsh for this analysis that we 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.880
 do you kindly share them for 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.880
 people open with this
