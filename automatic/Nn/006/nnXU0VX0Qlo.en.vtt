00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
so anyway this is already turning into a

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.380 
so anyway this is already turning into a
bit<00:00:47.380> of<00:00:47.410> a<00:00:47.560> nonsense<00:00:48.100> rambling<00:00:48.579> video<00:00:48.850> the

bit of a nonsense rambling video the

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.990 
bit of a nonsense rambling video the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
and aqueducts after well I had a random

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.360 
and aqueducts after well I had a random
thought<00:00:58.300> the<00:00:58.570> other<00:00:58.719> night<00:00:58.930> I<00:00:59.260> was<00:00:59.680> just

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
well I thought you know what I don't

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.719 
well I thought you know what I don't
want<00:01:10.569> to<00:01:10.659> be<00:01:10.780> enclosed<00:01:11.590> on<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.369> other<00:01:12.490> side

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729

the two external way you've got this
sort<00:01:14.439> of<00:01:14.530> a<00:01:14.619> bank<00:01:14.829> literally<00:01:15.429> either<00:01:15.909> side<00:01:16.299> of

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329

sort of a bank literally either side of
you<00:01:16.659> so<00:01:17.469> I<00:01:17.770> thought<00:01:18.520> right<00:01:18.759> let's<00:01:19.240> go<00:01:19.450> for<00:01:19.630> it

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
you so I thought right let's go for it

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.330 
you so I thought right let's go for it
and<00:01:19.899> as<00:01:20.709> you<00:01:21.069> may<00:01:21.219> know<00:01:21.490> Tilly<00:01:21.880> has<00:01:22.060> got<00:01:22.389> this

and as you may know Tilly has got this

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.309 
and as you may know Tilly has got this
rather<00:01:24.340> or<00:01:24.700> could<00:01:25.060> big<00:01:25.299> rail<00:01:25.569> across<00:01:25.929> the<00:01:26.139> back

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
rather or could big rail across the back

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.980 
rather or could big rail across the back
there<00:01:26.649> so<00:01:27.310> that<00:01:27.549> as<00:01:27.999> soon<00:01:28.270> as<00:01:28.450> you<00:01:28.539> head<00:01:28.719> into<00:01:28.749> a

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
there so that as soon as you head into a

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.230 
there so that as soon as you head into a
tunnel<00:01:29.289> just<00:01:29.740> if<00:01:30.039> you<00:01:30.219> drift<00:01:30.520> over<00:01:30.729> because

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
tunnel just if you drift over because

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.080 
tunnel just if you drift over because
it's<00:01:31.389> so<00:01:31.630> high<00:01:32.109> up<00:01:32.139> and<00:01:32.649> well<00:01:33.310> just<00:01:33.549> something

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
it's so high up and well just something

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.730 
it's so high up and well just something
that<00:01:34.240> sticks<00:01:34.509> out<00:01:34.689> of<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.899> boat<00:01:35.049> effectively

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
that sticks out of the boat effectively

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.919 
that sticks out of the boat effectively
you<00:01:36.369> can<00:01:36.520> imagine<00:01:36.729> you<00:01:37.119> drift<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.599> the<00:01:37.659> side<00:01:37.899> of

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
you can imagine you drift to the side of

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.559 
you can imagine you drift to the side of
the<00:01:38.139> tunnel<00:01:38.349> and<00:01:38.849> flippin<00:01:39.849> Eck<00:01:40.029> it's<00:01:40.329> that

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
the tunnel and flippin Eck it's that

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.959 
the tunnel and flippin Eck it's that
scraping<00:01:41.259> away<00:01:41.409> at<00:01:41.529> the<00:01:41.799> old<00:01:41.950> paint<00:01:42.399> week<00:01:42.639> and

scraping away at the old paint week and

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.149 
scraping away at the old paint week and
well<00:01:43.569> just<00:01:43.779> drags<00:01:44.170> all<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.529> brickwork<00:01:44.950> off

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
well just drags all the brickwork off

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.969 
well just drags all the brickwork off
the<00:01:45.310> tunnel<00:01:45.639> onto<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:46.029> deck<00:01:46.240> with<00:01:46.479> you<00:01:46.689> so<00:01:47.439> you

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
the tunnel onto the deck with you so you

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.440 
the tunnel onto the deck with you so you
know<00:01:48.099> what<00:01:48.340> I'm<00:01:48.520> just<00:01:48.579> going<00:01:48.969> to<00:01:49.149> drag<00:01:49.389> it

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450
