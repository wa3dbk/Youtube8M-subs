along<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.580> me<00:00:26.610> I'll<00:00:27.030> show<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.240> what<00:00:27.420> it's

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
along with me I'll show you what it's

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:43.619 
along with me I'll show you what it's
like<00:00:27.600> it's<00:00:30.020> late

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:50.900 

and<00:00:44.629> here<00:00:44.929> we<00:00:45.079> are<00:00:45.109> at<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:45.559> cell<00:00:45.829> Factory

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.120 

that<00:00:51.910> was<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.480> cell<00:00:52.720> membrane<00:00:53.200> it's<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:53.830> thin

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
that was the cell membrane it's a thin

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.310 
that was the cell membrane it's a thin
flexible<00:00:54.520> layer<00:00:55.030> around<00:00:55.270> the<00:00:55.570> cell<00:00:55.870> it's

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
flexible layer around the cell it's

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.040 
flexible layer around the cell it's
pretty<00:00:56.560> much<00:00:56.680> like<00:00:56.740> a<00:00:56.890> force<00:00:57.250> field

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
and here we are at the nucleus the large

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.940 
and here we are at the nucleus the large
part<00:01:04.540> of<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.690> cell<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.440> holds<00:01:05.740> all<00:01:05.830> the

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
part of the cell it holds all the

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.280 
part of the cell it holds all the
genetic<00:01:06.370> stuff<00:01:06.700> like<00:01:06.880> DNA<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:07.450> controls<00:01:07.990> most

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
genetic stuff like DNA and controls most

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.230 
genetic stuff like DNA and controls most
of<00:01:08.410> the<00:01:08.500> cell's<00:01:08.710> activities<00:01:08.940> it's<00:01:09.940> like<00:01:10.090> the

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
of the cell's activities it's like the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.270

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
heart of a computer without it it just

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.950 
heart of a computer without it it just
doesn't<00:01:12.550> work<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:12.910> it<00:01:13.270> pretty<00:01:13.479> much<00:01:13.570> runs

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
doesn't work and it pretty much runs

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.940 
doesn't work and it pretty much runs
everything<00:01:14.200> else<00:01:14.470> inside<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:15.010> it<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.350> these

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
everything else inside of it and these

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.070 
everything else inside of it and these
are<00:01:18.160> vacuoles<00:01:18.700> small<00:01:19.090> membranes<00:01:19.570> that<00:01:19.690> store

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
are vacuoles small membranes that store

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.480 
are vacuoles small membranes that store

materials such as water salt protons and
carbohydrates<00:01:25.650> pretty<00:01:26.650> much<00:01:26.800> what<00:01:27.130> what<00:01:27.550> any

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
carbohydrates pretty much what what any

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.790 
carbohydrates pretty much what what any
other<00:01:27.940> Factory<00:01:28.720> in<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.869> world<00:01:28.960> would<00:01:29.290> have<00:01:29.470> a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
other Factory in the world would have a

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.130 
other Factory in the world would have a
place<00:01:30.160> to<00:01:30.400> store<00:01:30.880> stuff<00:01:31.330> that<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:31.840> could<00:01:31.960> use

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
place to store stuff that you could use

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.620 
place to store stuff that you could use
for<00:01:32.500> later<00:01:32.800> uses<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:37.180> is<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
for later uses and this is the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.749 
for later uses and this is the
cytoskeleton<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.770> structure<00:01:39.160> that<00:01:39.310> holds<00:01:39.520> up

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
cytoskeleton the structure that holds up

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.520 
cytoskeleton the structure that holds up
the<00:01:39.790> cell<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.210> keeps<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.600> from<00:01:40.630> falling<00:01:41.229> apart

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
the cell and keeps it from falling apart

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.020 
the cell and keeps it from falling apart
just<00:01:41.770> like<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.640> skeleton<00:01:42.910> in<00:01:43.180> a<00:01:43.270> human<00:01:43.690> body

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
just like the skeleton in a human body

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.120 
just like the skeleton in a human body
and<00:01:46.030> this<00:01:46.450> is<00:01:46.630> a<00:01:46.660> lysosome<00:01:47.170> at<00:01:47.619> an<00:01:47.710> organelle

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
and this is a lysosome at an organelle

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.740 
and this is a lysosome at an organelle
that<00:01:48.340> breaks<00:01:48.670> down<00:01:48.820> small<00:01:49.420> things<00:01:49.660> like

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
that breaks down small things like

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.650 
that breaks down small things like
lipids<00:01:50.350> carbohydrates<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.490> proteins<00:01:51.970> into

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
lipids carbohydrates and proteins into

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.300 
lipids carbohydrates and proteins into
small<00:01:52.960> molecules<00:01:53.500> so<00:01:53.680> it<00:01:53.710> could<00:01:53.920> be<00:01:54.039> used<00:01:54.190> in

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
small molecules so it could be used in

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.580 
small molecules so it could be used in
other<00:01:54.460> parts<00:01:54.729> of<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:54.910> cell<00:01:55.240> pretty<00:01:56.110> much<00:01:56.320> like

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
other parts of the cell pretty much like
