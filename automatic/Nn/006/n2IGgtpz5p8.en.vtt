00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
Colosseum it makes sense this location

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.000 
Colosseum it makes sense this location
smile<00:00:15.719> factory<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.320> hidden<00:00:16.590> but<00:00:16.859> at<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
smile factory is so hidden but at the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.950 
smile factory is so hidden but at the
same<00:00:17.190> time<00:00:17.520> that's<00:00:18.000> not<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.240> safest<00:00:18.720> place<00:00:18.930> to

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
same time that's not the safest place to

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.109 
same time that's not the safest place to
have<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> factory<00:00:19.890> like<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.400> underneath<00:00:20.910> it

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
have a factory like that underneath it

Colosseum were such strong fighters

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.500 
Colosseum were such strong fighters
battle<00:00:23.310> but<00:00:23.519> if<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.820> none<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> costume

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
battle but if it is none of the costume

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.089 
battle but if it is none of the costume
there's<00:00:24.689> probably<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.080> very<00:00:25.230> strong<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> layer

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
there's probably a very strong a layer

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.790 
there's probably a very strong a layer
under<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.939> floor<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.720> prevent<00:00:28.260> accidents

under the floor to prevent accidents

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.529 
under the floor to prevent accidents
like<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.340> from<00:00:29.550> happening<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.210> think<00:00:30.420> at

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
like that from happening and I think at

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.269 
like that from happening and I think at
some<00:00:30.570> point<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.140> blind<00:00:31.380> swordsman<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.099> gonna

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
some point the blind swordsman is gonna

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.130 
some point the blind swordsman is gonna
swoop<00:00:32.550> down<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.120> use<00:00:33.540> his<00:00:33.690> ability<00:00:34.050> and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
swoop down and use his ability and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.100 
swoop down and use his ability and
create<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.590> giant<00:00:35.010> hole<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.700> ground

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
create a giant hole in the ground

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.780 
create a giant hole in the ground
revealing<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.290> factory<00:00:37.770> below<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.610> he's

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
revealing the factory below but he's

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.100 
revealing the factory below but he's
gonna<00:00:38.910> take<00:00:39.090> advantage<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> tournament

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
combatants are tired up and I'm pretty

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.240 
combatants are tired up and I'm pretty
much<00:00:45.690> assuming<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.320> blind<00:00:46.649> old<00:00:46.829> man<00:00:46.950> is

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
much assuming that this blind old man is

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.459 
much assuming that this blind old man is
at<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> very<00:00:47.700> least<00:00:48.000> an<00:00:48.300> admiral<00:00:48.750> BC<00:00:49.079> follows

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
at the very least an admiral BC follows

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.529 
at the very least an admiral BC follows
the<00:00:49.739> pattern<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.879> Admirals<00:00:51.390> his

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the pattern of the Admirals his

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.510 
the pattern of the Admirals his
appearance<00:00:52.110> screams<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:53.039> dude<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.399> an

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
appearance screams this dude is an

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.680 
appearance screams this dude is an
admiral<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.000> see<00:00:54.120> looks<00:00:54.270> like<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.480> Japanese

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
admiral we see looks like a Japanese

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.810 
admiral we see looks like a Japanese
actor<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> rest<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> Admirals

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
actor just like the rest of the Admirals

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.130 
actor just like the rest of the Admirals
and<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.600> safe<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> take<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.109> bit

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
and I think it's safe to take it a bit

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.840 
and I think it's safe to take it a bit
further<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.649> assume<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> blind<00:00:59.609> old

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
further and assume that the blind old

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.389 
further and assume that the blind old
man<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.469> fujitora<00:01:01.469> next<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.100> want<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> talk

the hero of the marines
i<00:01:35.549> still<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:35.970> they<00:01:36.150> wouldn't<00:01:36.420> carry<00:01:36.689> out

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
i still think they wouldn't carry out

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.870 
i still think they wouldn't carry out
something<00:01:37.140> like<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.860> know<00:01:38.070> GARP

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
something like that but you know GARP

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.130 
something like that but you know GARP
and<00:01:39.150> fujitora

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
and fujitora

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.560 
and fujitora
are<00:01:40.290> both<00:01:40.680> old<00:01:41.040> men<00:01:41.490> maybe<00:01:41.850> they<00:01:42.090> go<00:01:42.270> back

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
are both old men maybe they go back

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.030 
are both old men maybe they go back
maybe<00:01:42.899> they<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.170> some<00:01:43.409> sort<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.680> connection

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
maybe they have some sort of connection

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.639 
maybe they have some sort of connection
they're<00:01:44.670> good<00:01:44.939> friends<00:01:45.180> at<00:01:45.479> fujitora<00:01:45.990> does

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
they're good friends at fujitora does

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.590 
they're good friends at fujitora does
this<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:47.159> GARP<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:47.880> garb<00:01:48.210> doesn't

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
this for GARP and if garb doesn't

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.270 
this for GARP and if garb doesn't
actually<00:01:48.720> get<00:01:48.960> his<00:01:49.079> hands<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.829> mera<00:01:50.100> mera

actually get his hands on the mera mera

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.100 
actually get his hands on the mera mera
know<00:01:50.490> me<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.820> think<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.329> he<00:01:51.659> might<00:01:51.869> actually

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
know me I think that he might actually

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.039 
know me I think that he might actually
entrust<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.920> Kobe<00:01:53.520> because<00:01:53.880> Kobe<00:01:54.390> has<00:01:54.750> a

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
entrust it to Kobe because Kobe has a

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.289 
entrust it to Kobe because Kobe has a
very<00:01:55.500> strong<00:01:55.920> sense<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.460> justice<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:56.969> like

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
very strong sense of justice just like

very strong sense of justice just like
dart<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.170> feel<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.560> dart<00:01:58.890> could<00:01:59.369> see<00:01:59.670> hope

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
dart and I feel like dart could see hope

to<00:02:03.990> carry<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.369> power<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.939> fruit

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
to carry on the power of that fruit

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.930

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
to the kick-ass comment I could really

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.899 
to the kick-ass comment I could really
see<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.170> actually<00:02:18.040> happening<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.700> in<00:02:18.819> my

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
see that actually happening and in my

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.430 
see that actually happening and in my
chapter<00:02:19.269> of<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.480> talked<00:02:19.750> about<00:02:19.870> how<00:02:20.170> I

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
chapter of you I talked about how I

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.660 
chapter of you I talked about how I
don't<00:02:20.620> think<00:02:20.799> any<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.099> strong<00:02:21.340> has<00:02:21.489> what

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
don't think any of the strong has what

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.520 
don't think any of the strong has what
Gettys<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:22.090> true<00:02:22.269> because<00:02:22.480> they've<00:02:23.110> trained

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
Gettys is true because they've trained

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.229 
Gettys is true because they've trained
so<00:02:23.830> hard<00:02:23.860> for<00:02:24.400> all<00:02:24.489> these<00:02:24.640> years<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.090> get<00:02:25.180> to

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
so hard for all these years to get to

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.030 
so hard for all these years to get to
where<00:02:25.420> they<00:02:25.690> are<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.140> getting<00:02:26.560> uses<00:02:26.890> for

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
where they are and getting uses for

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.320 
where they are and getting uses for
would<00:02:27.129> be<00:02:27.159> like<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.340> free<00:02:27.670> power

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
would be like a free power

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.210 
would be like a free power
well<00:02:28.540> Kobe<00:02:29.019> has<00:02:29.170> trained<00:02:29.530> hard<00:02:29.829> all<00:02:30.010> these

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
well Kobe has trained hard all these

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.110 
well Kobe has trained hard all these
years<00:02:30.459> as<00:02:30.670> well

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
years as well

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.119 
years as well
so<00:02:31.390> wouldn't<00:02:31.810> be<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.989> scene<00:02:32.200> for<00:02:32.440> Kobe<00:02:32.829> yes

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
so wouldn't be the scene for Kobe yes

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.970 
so wouldn't be the scene for Kobe yes
and<00:02:33.400> no<00:02:33.819> Kobe<00:02:34.480> has<00:02:34.690> indeed<00:02:35.079> trained<00:02:35.470> very<00:02:35.829> hard

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
and no Kobe has indeed trained very hard

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.350 
and no Kobe has indeed trained very hard
to<00:02:36.400> get<00:02:36.549> to<00:02:36.700> where<00:02:36.730> he's<00:02:36.970> at

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
to get to where he's at

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.940 
to get to where he's at
I'm<00:02:37.480> not<00:02:37.840> gonna<00:02:38.019> deny<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.440> but<00:02:38.799> at<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.890> same

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
I'm not gonna deny that but at the same

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.360 
I'm not gonna deny that but at the same
time<00:02:39.430> we<00:02:39.940> haven't<00:02:40.209> followed<00:02:40.659> Kobe<00:02:41.379> so<00:02:41.680> closely

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
time we haven't followed Kobe so closely

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.130 
time we haven't followed Kobe so closely
like<00:02:42.519> we<00:02:42.670> have<00:02:42.879> the<00:02:43.030> straw<00:02:43.269> house<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.870> straw

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
like we have the straw house the straw

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.770 
like we have the straw house the straw
hats<00:02:44.379> are<00:02:44.560> practically<00:02:45.010> our<00:02:45.280> family<00:02:46.239> Kobe<00:02:46.660> has

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
hats are practically our family Kobe has

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.210 
hats are practically our family Kobe has
only<00:02:46.930> appeared<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.290> couple<00:02:47.560> times<00:02:47.799> here<00:02:48.099> and

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
only appeared a couple times here and

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.920 
only appeared a couple times here and
there<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.549> I<00:02:48.849> don't<00:02:48.910> think<00:02:49.180> eating<00:02:49.510> aces

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
there and I don't think eating aces

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.530 
there and I don't think eating aces
fruit<00:02:50.230> will<00:02:50.680> detract<00:02:51.220> from<00:02:51.670> his<00:02:52.150> character

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
fruit will detract from his character

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.539 
fruit will detract from his character
progression<00:02:52.720> at<00:02:53.349> all<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.890> think<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.280> actually

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
progression at all I think it actually

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:55.949 
progression at all I think it actually
be<00:02:54.640> an<00:02:54.730> awesome<00:02:55.180> plot<00:02:55.390> point<00:02:55.629> of<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.750> story

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
be an awesome plot point of the story

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.509 
be an awesome plot point of the story
and<00:02:56.260> present<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.829> very<00:02:57.040> interesting

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
and present a very interesting

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.240 
and present a very interesting
antagonist<00:02:58.510> for<00:02:58.900> Luffy<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.440> can<00:02:59.769> picture<00:03:00.069> the

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
antagonist for Luffy I can picture the

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.819 
antagonist for Luffy I can picture the
scene<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.909> GARP<00:03:01.540> giving<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.079> mera<00:03:02.290> mera<00:03:02.409> Nomi

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.770 
scene of GARP giving the mera mera Nomi
to<00:03:03.250> Kobe<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:03.879> would<00:03:03.970> be<00:03:04.030> an<00:03:04.120> awesome<00:03:04.569> scene

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
to Kobe and it would be an awesome scene

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.030 
to Kobe and it would be an awesome scene
because<00:03:05.079> there'd<00:03:05.260> be<00:03:05.319> so<00:03:05.530> much<00:03:05.709> stuff<00:03:05.980> going

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
because there'd be so much stuff going

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.000 
because there'd be so much stuff going
on<00:03:06.459> in<00:03:06.670> his<00:03:07.150> mind<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.690> much<00:03:07.959> mental<00:03:08.409> conflict

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010
