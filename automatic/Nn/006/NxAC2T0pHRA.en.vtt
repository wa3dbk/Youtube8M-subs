00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
those I guess as the corners if you

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.780 
those I guess as the corners if you
swap<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.500> left<00:02:02.689> bottom<00:02:03.689> corner<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:05.280> get<00:02:05.520> the

up like certain games or something all
you<00:03:51.070> have<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.340> do<00:03:51.460> is<00:03:51.640> go<00:03:51.820> in<00:03:51.970> here<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:52.270> the

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
you have to do is go in here to the

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.780 
you have to do is go in here to the
disabled<00:03:52.930> section<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.590> turn<00:03:54.070> it<00:03:54.220> off<00:03:54.430> for

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
disabled section and turn it off for

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.750 
disabled section and turn it off for
that<00:03:55.330> particular<00:03:55.720> app<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:56.800> that<00:03:57.400> way<00:03:57.550> when

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
that particular app and that way when

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.270 
that particular app and that way when
you<00:03:57.910> swipe<00:03:58.180> up<00:03:58.480> you<00:03:58.840> will<00:03:59.080> not<00:03:59.260> get<00:03:59.530> oxxo<00:04:00.070> and

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
you swipe up you will not get oxxo and

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.940 
you swipe up you will not get oxxo and
voc<00:04:00.490> that<00:04:00.820> way<00:04:01.000> which<00:04:01.990> is<00:04:02.170> something<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:02.680> think

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
voc that way which is something I think

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.800 
voc that way which is something I think
that<00:04:03.100> we<00:04:03.220> definitely<00:04:03.430> needed<00:04:04.000> included<00:04:04.660> in

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
that we definitely needed included in

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.600 
that we definitely needed included in
the<00:04:04.930> developers<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.500> course<00:04:06.160> a<00:04:06.370> thought<00:04:06.580> of

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
the developers of course a thought of

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.990 
the developers of course a thought of
that<00:04:06.880> and<00:04:07.770> also<00:04:08.770> if<00:04:09.340> you<00:04:09.459> want<00:04:09.640> to<00:04:09.700> invert<00:04:09.940> your

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
that and also if you want to invert your

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.910 
that and also if you want to invert your
hot<00:04:10.330> corners<00:04:10.840> you<00:04:11.050> can<00:04:11.080> do<00:04:11.380> that<00:04:11.560> but

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
hot corners you can do that but

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.680 
hot corners you can do that but
personally<00:04:12.400> I<00:04:12.459> wouldn't<00:04:12.820> recommend<00:04:13.120> it<00:04:13.450> and

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
personally I wouldn't recommend it and

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.670 
personally I wouldn't recommend it and
on<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.770> quicks<00:04:15.490> the<00:04:15.940> quick<00:04:16.180> launcher<00:04:16.690> if<00:04:16.870> you

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
on the quicks the quick launcher if you

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.000 
on the quicks the quick launcher if you
want<00:04:17.980> all<00:04:18.430> of<00:04:18.489> your<00:04:18.910> applications<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:20.590> show<00:04:20.799> up

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
want all of your applications to show up

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.159 
want all of your applications to show up
down<00:04:21.220> there<00:04:21.370> just<00:04:21.640> turn<00:04:21.880> that<00:04:21.910> on<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.510> now

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
down there just turn that on and now

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.340 
down there just turn that on and now
when<00:04:23.440> you<00:04:23.650> swipe<00:04:24.400> up<00:04:24.729> you<00:04:25.060> get<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.690> list<00:04:25.990> of

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
when you swipe up you get the list of

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.940 
when you swipe up you get the list of
air

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
get those six applications showing but

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.690 
get those six applications showing but
personally<00:04:35.350> I<00:04:35.380> think<00:04:35.560> six<00:04:36.130> is<00:04:36.310> plenty<00:04:36.820> and

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700
