by zxcvbnm KJ or me so yeah that's
really<00:01:06.540> awesome<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.530> basically<00:01:07.650> have

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
really awesome so you can basically have

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.520 
really awesome so you can basically have
newsletters<00:01:08.490> within<00:01:09.420> your<00:01:09.540> server<00:01:09.869> or

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
newsletters within your server or

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.710 
newsletters within your server or
whatever<00:01:10.979> you'd<00:01:11.520> want<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.790> use<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.150> mod<00:01:12.390> for

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
whatever you'd want to use this mod for

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.289 
whatever you'd want to use this mod for
so<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:14.250> really<00:01:14.460> cool<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.119> could<00:01:15.270> have

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
so it's really cool like you could have

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.080 
so it's really cool like you could have
server<00:01:15.659> rules<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.710> could<00:01:16.890> edit

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
server rules on this that you could edit

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.020 
server rules on this that you could edit
but<00:01:18.090> other<00:01:18.240> players<00:01:19.009> didn't<00:01:20.009> or<00:01:20.250> cannot<00:01:20.820> edit

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
but other players didn't or cannot edit

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.660 
but other players didn't or cannot edit
it<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.720> really<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.860> idea<00:01:22.890> also<00:01:23.460> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
it so I really like the idea also you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.310 
it so I really like the idea also you
can<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.509> course<00:01:24.570> you'll<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.110> duplicate

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
can of course you'll have to duplicate

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.530 
can of course you'll have to duplicate
ender<00:01:25.890> books<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.150> want<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.360> duplicate

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
ender books so if you want to duplicate

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.569 
ender books so if you want to duplicate
them<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.170> get<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.380> regular<00:01:28.860> ender<00:01:29.130> book<00:01:29.310> next
