00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
polymer clay obviously i'll be using at

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.880 
polymer clay obviously i'll be using at

around the bottle cap that you're using

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:21.880 
around the bottle cap that you're using
my<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.439> quite<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> large<00:01:07.830> bottle<00:01:08.189> cap

so once you've done that you're going to
take<00:01:26.280> your<00:01:26.610> tag<00:01:27.570> clay<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.380> roll<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:29.010> into

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
take your tag clay and roll it out into

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.290 
take your tag clay and roll it out into
very<00:01:29.910> long<00:01:30.480> and<00:01:30.870> thin<00:01:31.260> coil<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.250> I've<00:01:33.060> already

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
very long and thin coil and I've already

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.720 
very long and thin coil and I've already
done<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.630> because<00:01:34.440> if<00:01:34.830> I<00:01:35.010> did<00:01:35.160> on<00:01:35.370> camera

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
done that because if I did on camera

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.510 
done that because if I did on camera
i'll<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:36.090> take<00:01:36.330> too<00:01:36.570> long<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.400> didn't<00:01:38.400> want

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
i'll just take too long I didn't want

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.900 
i'll just take too long I didn't want
really<00:01:39.000> want<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.330> edit<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.870> video<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.640> I've

done that already you're just going to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:58.100 
done that already you're just going to
double<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.280> over<00:01:46.130> like<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:51.170> then

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.220 

king

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.320 

slice<00:02:04.980> it

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.719 

at<00:02:08.930> the<00:02:09.110> end<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.619> comes<00:02:09.860> two<00:02:10.280> separate

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
at the end so it comes two separate

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.300 
at the end so it comes two separate
pieces<00:02:10.940> are<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.720> same<00:02:11.780> length<00:02:12.290> you're<00:02:13.100> then

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
pieces are the same length you're then

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.020 
pieces are the same length you're then
going<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.790> take<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.510> twist<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:18.140> will

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
going to take it and twist and this will

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:48.370 
going to take it and twist and this will
become<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.440> crust<00:02:21.440> of<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.920> pie<00:02:27.550> sorry

some<00:02:51.760> parts<00:02:52.150> are<00:02:52.300> just<00:02:52.360> some<00:02:52.720> twisted<00:02:53.880> okay

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
some parts are just some twisted okay

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.170 
some parts are just some twisted okay
once<00:02:55.600> you've<00:02:55.870> done<00:02:56.170> that<00:02:56.230> take<00:02:57.630> your<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.940> base

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
once you've done that take your the base

once you've done that take your the base
of<00:03:01.420> your<00:03:01.480> pie<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.260> then<00:03:02.950> just<00:03:03.340> decorate<00:03:04.060> it

with the crust and this will go all

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:25.580 
with the crust and this will go all
around<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:11.640> pie

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.640
