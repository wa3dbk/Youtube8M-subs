 seven habits super easy to follow and 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.320
 does not talk about a superficial change like that 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.780
 as one more to have good 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.360
 relationships between people but speak 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.280
 of a change of the person you can not 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.290
 change a tone but you can change to 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.020
 yourself and when you change you look for the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.410
 world then in this consists in 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.979
 you start your adult that the first three 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:44.030
 habits are going to make a change of your 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.890
 everything is going to be internal and 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.920
 then the other three habits that 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.080
 continue to be therefore the relations of 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.899
 people communication teamwork 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.940
 and then since he worked from soria 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.929
 the last habit that if stored 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:03.070
 store to have a renovation and 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:05.290
 then polish all those habits 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.020
 you were carrying everything has a process 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.479
 you understand with the first and posters with 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.300
 the external then this book will you 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.610
 I highly recommend what you want to know 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.500
 one more point of leadership not only 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.810
 is for organizations are the 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.570
 entrepreneurs but for the parents of 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.870
 family many teachers are served 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.430
 master consultants or just if 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.010
 you want to succeed in your life because you're going to 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.950
 serving too much is recommended and ximo 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.980
 I saw it in my leadership class of my 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.020
 university and it's simply more than being 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.590
 a book they have charged me me 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.050
 I loved it I enjoyed it I did mine 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.140
 super practical is the word is 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.959
 practical and you to the point then I'll 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.910
 I highly recommend Stephen Covey is a 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.680
 doctor who has just died one in the 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:59.320
 2012 and because it influenced drastically 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.440
 all the people who were looking for then be 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.080
 more effective like louis the title one

 highly effective going beyond a lot 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.660

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.700
 a little bit in what is the good subject 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.940
 It consists of seven habits and as I said 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:57.020
 the first three come from you as 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.870
 person and the three seconds is already like 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.480
 to relate to your environment day 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.150
 you are well you already prepare and it is the 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.849
 environment and the last one that row closes 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.280
 is to renew all of these and keep them in 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.370
 order these seven habits are very 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.379
 practical and good I do not know how much 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.019
 talk to you because I do not want to do 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:21.019
 spoiler although I 'm not a spoiler because it's 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.850
 a book that has been applied but is another 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.400
 video explaining each of the seven 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.949
 habits in case you're interested in knowing 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.930
 little bit more of these habits so that 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:33.949
 you see the next video that I'm going to upload 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.530
 and it ensures that each one is a success 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:39.380
 of every virtue that does not have to do or 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.340
 it would be a taste of what it is 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:46.010
 this book then so if you're interested 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.139
 muscle shopping and do it yours 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.960
 go to him because it really is a lot 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:54.650
 reflection is not a book that one reads 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.560
 super fast integrity and but this is 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.949
 a book for you to take your time what 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.580
 read them and then like apply it or 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.080
 it is something true 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.319
 this thin book is totally 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.590
 practical and good not to be long everything 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:14.949
 this as to summarize yours super super 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:19.330
 it's all this good book handles 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:22.569
 habits that are essential for you 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.969
 you can put it into practice or you go to 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.430
 acquire a new behavior change your 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:31.419
 paradigm because you're going to realize that 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:34.479
 you are the owner of you who are the pro 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.819
 active is to make you responsible for 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:40.030
 the answers that you are going to before certain 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:42.460
 stimuli before certain because the environment 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.219
 everything around us you will decide 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.400
 how to act and why some clips will be given 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.810
 super practical as I told you and good 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.960
 I do not want to mention the seven habits 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.110
 for now what 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.900
 in the other in the next video all the 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:01.210
 days and then so that you if you want it 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.210
 buy and be curious and nothing else 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:07.849
 of leadership and personal improvement and 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.889
 well so that it is in a very 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:12.440
 dynamic that is not a boring book like that 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:15.560
 like text so it's not something with 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.289
 practical examples and easy to read you what 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.520
