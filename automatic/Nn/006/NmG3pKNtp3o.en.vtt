looks you can actually get it just by

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.779

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.610 
can see the town halls actually sniper
bolt<00:02:58.270> so<00:02:58.420> I've<00:02:58.510> dropped<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.870> few<00:02:59.020> minions<00:02:59.410> there

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
bolt so I've dropped a few minions there

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.050 
bolt so I've dropped a few minions there
and<00:02:59.800> that's<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.130> main<00:03:00.310> reason<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.640> attack<00:03:00.910> this

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
and that's the main reason I attack this

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.090 
and that's the main reason I attack this
base<00:03:01.120> cuz<00:03:01.510> it<00:03:01.660> is<00:03:01.780> really<00:03:02.140> strong<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:02.620> I

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
base cuz it is really strong and I

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.500 
base cuz it is really strong and I
didn't<00:03:03.310> really<00:03:03.489> look<00:03:03.700> at<00:03:03.850> it<00:03:03.970> much<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.269> wasn't

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
didn't really look at it much I wasn't

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.150 
didn't really look at it much I wasn't
like<00:03:04.630> super<00:03:04.959> prepared<00:03:05.140> or<00:03:05.470> anything<00:03:05.650> but<00:03:06.099> I

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
like super prepared or anything but I

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.009 
like super prepared or anything but I
did<00:03:06.370> notice<00:03:06.610> all<00:03:06.940> these<00:03:07.090> builder<00:03:07.540> Hut's<00:03:07.750> over

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
did notice all these builder Hut's over

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.080 
did notice all these builder Hut's over
here<00:03:08.200> which<00:03:08.380> was<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.620> lot<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.550> percentage<00:03:09.970> in

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
here which was a lot of percentage in

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.940 
here which was a lot of percentage in
one<00:03:10.239> spot<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:10.989> I've<00:03:11.140> just<00:03:11.170> been<00:03:11.500> placing

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
one spot so I've just been placing

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.590 
one spot so I've just been placing
little<00:03:12.220> minions<00:03:12.580> you<00:03:12.700> guys<00:03:12.819> can<00:03:13.030> see<00:03:13.180> in<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.390> few

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
little minions you guys can see in a few

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.210 
little minions you guys can see in a few
spots<00:03:13.810> where<00:03:14.170> they<00:03:14.260> can<00:03:14.440> not<00:03:14.590> be<00:03:14.650> heard<00:03:14.980> just

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
spots where they can not be heard just

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.130 
spots where they can not be heard just
to<00:03:15.819> get<00:03:15.940> some<00:03:16.060> extra<00:03:16.180> percentage<00:03:16.569> there<00:03:16.900> and

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
to get some extra percentage there and

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.930 
to get some extra percentage there and

hounds<00:03:22.810> which<00:03:22.930> probably<00:03:23.170> would<00:03:23.500> have<00:03:23.560> helped

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
hounds which probably would have helped

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.949 
hounds which probably would have helped
make<00:03:23.950> this<00:03:24.130> an<00:03:24.340> even<00:03:24.549> stronger<00:03:24.970> attack<00:03:25.510> but

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959

keep in mind I haven't done this in a

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.690 
keep in mind I haven't done this in a
while<00:03:28.959> so<00:03:29.080> this<00:03:29.410> is<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.620> bit<00:03:29.860> rusty<00:03:30.250> for<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.459> blue

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700

experience with he's got that single
Inferno<00:03:36.489> which<00:03:36.700> is<00:03:36.819> why<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:36.970> attack<00:03:37.330> from<00:03:37.540> this

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
troops pretty much killed all of my

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.630 
troops pretty much killed all of my
troops<00:03:58.870> exclusively<00:03:59.590> like<00:04:00.100> seriously<00:04:00.459> it's

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
troops exclusively like seriously it's

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.250 
troops exclusively like seriously it's
crazy<00:04:00.880> those<00:04:01.150> air<00:04:01.329> sweepers<00:04:01.720> are<00:04:01.870> really

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
crazy those air sweepers are really

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.170 
crazy those air sweepers are really
really<00:04:02.560> strong<00:04:02.620> I<00:04:03.040> didn't<00:04:03.609> realize<00:04:03.880> that<00:04:03.910> you

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
really strong I didn't realize that you

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.550 
really strong I didn't realize that you
actually<00:04:04.480> needed<00:04:04.720> those<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:05.109> thought<00:04:05.350> here

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
actually needed those I thought here

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.140 
actually needed those I thought here
troops<00:04:06.010> were<00:04:06.160> pretty<00:04:06.370> weak<00:04:06.549> but<00:04:06.760> I<00:04:06.850> guess<00:04:07.000> they

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
troops were pretty weak but I guess they

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.670 
troops were pretty weak but I guess they
felt<00:04:07.390> that<00:04:07.540> needs<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.840> throw<00:04:08.019> them<00:04:08.200> in<00:04:08.320> anyway

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
felt that needs to throw them in anyway

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.550 
felt that needs to throw them in anyway
so<00:04:09.310> guys<00:04:09.579> we<00:04:09.880> are<00:04:10.030> sitting<00:04:10.390> at<00:04:10.480> 40%<00:04:11.260> I<00:04:11.350> need<00:04:11.470> to

pretty difficult now I could have came
in<00:04:14.829> from<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.160> top<00:04:15.370> where<00:04:15.519> all<00:04:15.609> my<00:04:15.730> troops<00:04:15.940> were

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.360 
dropped my queen and I came close enough
that<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.169> Queen<00:04:20.410> would<00:04:20.530> shoot<00:04:20.769> this<00:04:20.890> cannon

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
that the Queen would shoot this cannon
