00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
here we are the Dell XPS 16 disassembly

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.789 
here we are the Dell XPS 16 disassembly
for<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.570> we're<00:00:12.809> gonna<00:00:12.929> need<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.469> use<00:00:13.559> two

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
for this we're gonna need to use two

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.570 
for this we're gonna need to use two
different<00:00:13.980> screwdrivers<00:00:16.070> one<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.220> them<00:00:17.369> needs

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
different screwdrivers one of them needs

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.840 
different screwdrivers one of them needs
to<00:00:17.670> be<00:00:17.840> flathead<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.320> one<00:00:19.680> shaped<00:00:20.400> like<00:00:20.820> a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
to be flathead and the one shaped like a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.960 
to be flathead and the one shaped like a
star<00:00:21.650> so<00:00:22.650> first<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.400> all<00:00:23.519> you're<00:00:23.640> gonna<00:00:23.730> want

star so first of all you're gonna want

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.570 
star so first of all you're gonna want
to<00:00:24.029> take<00:00:24.180> off<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.539> battery<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:25.400> to<00:00:26.400> make

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
to take off the battery just to make

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.730 
to take off the battery just to make
sure<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.000> there's<00:00:27.269> no<00:00:27.420> power<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.529> through

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
sure that there's no power going through

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.550 
sure that there's no power going through
the<00:00:28.830> system<00:00:30.019> after<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.109> take<00:00:31.260> out<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
the system after you take out the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.530 
the system after you take out the
battery<00:00:31.740> press<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:33.360> button<00:00:33.420> short<00:00:34.969> to<00:00:35.969> let

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
battery press the on button short to let

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.440 
battery press the on button short to let
all<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.050> remaining<00:00:37.620> power<00:00:38.030> get<00:00:39.030> out<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
all the remaining power get out of the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.490 
all the remaining power get out of the
system<00:00:40.219> then<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.489> take<00:00:41.730> out<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.500> eight

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
system then you take out the eight

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.740 
system then you take out the eight
screws<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.789> two<00:00:45.329> three<00:00:45.840> four<00:00:46.430> five<00:00:47.430> six<00:00:48.090> seven

this we'll use the flat headed

00:00:57.899 --> 00:02:02.180 
this we'll use the flat headed
screwdriver

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.800

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
then you're gonna want to gently pry it

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.310 
then you're gonna want to gently pry it
open<00:02:04.930> from<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.410> back<00:02:06.540> lift<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.720> from<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:07.960> side

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
open from the back lift it from the side

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.010 
open from the back lift it from the side
and<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:09.550> cover<00:02:09.820> comes<00:02:10.210> off<00:02:12.210> then<00:02:13.210> inside<00:02:13.660> you

it<00:03:12.160> done<00:03:12.340> by<00:03:12.550> a<00:03:12.790> professional<00:03:13.709> when<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:14.740> first

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
it done by a professional when I first

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.760 
it done by a professional when I first
took<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.550> out<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.730> completely<00:03:16.000> forgot<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:16.810> pull

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
took it out I completely forgot to pull

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.949 
took it out I completely forgot to pull
this<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.310> took<00:03:18.489> it<00:03:18.670> outside<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.660> broke

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
this and I took it outside and it broke

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.130 
this and I took it outside and it broke
so<00:03:20.020> I<00:03:20.260> had<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:21.270> buy<00:03:22.270> a<00:03:22.300> new<00:03:22.540> one<00:03:24.870> here<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:26.020> just

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
so I had to buy a new one here you just

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.790 
so I had to buy a new one here you just
remove<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:28.120> cable<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.750> you<00:03:29.320> have<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.620> hard

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
remove the cable and you have the hard

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.320 
remove the cable and you have the hard
drive<00:03:30.010> when<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.430> want<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:30.700> replace<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.150> room

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
drive when you want to replace the room

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.360 
drive when you want to replace the room
of<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.600> four<00:03:31.810> screws<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:33.640> just<00:03:34.239> replace<00:03:34.570> the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
of the four screws and just replace the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.620 
of the four screws and just replace the
hard<00:03:36.370> drive<00:03:36.430> bay<00:03:37.140> so<00:03:38.140> then<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.380> hard<00:03:38.620> drive

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
hard drive bay so then you hard drive

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.610 
hard drive bay so then you hard drive
then<00:03:40.630> when<00:03:41.380> you<00:03:41.500> put<00:03:41.709> it<00:03:41.800> back<00:03:43.350> make<00:03:44.350> sure<00:03:44.530> you

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
then when you put it back make sure you

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.780 
then when you put it back make sure you
put<00:03:44.830> it<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.040> right<00:03:45.190> way<00:03:45.340> around<00:03:47.459> put<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.610> back

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
put it the right way around put it back

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.449 
put it the right way around put it back
in<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.510> this<00:03:50.080> you<00:03:50.650> have<00:03:50.770> to<00:03:50.890> make<00:03:51.070> sure<00:03:51.250> that

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
in and this you have to make sure that

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.100 
in and this you have to make sure that
it<00:03:51.670> does<00:03:52.390> that<00:03:52.420> little<00:03:52.840> click<00:03:53.739> sound<00:03:54.040> and

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
it does that little click sound and

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.449 
it does that little click sound and
that's<00:03:56.110> when<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:57.070> know<00:03:57.220> for<00:03:57.430> sure<00:03:57.459> that<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.180> is

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
that's when you know for sure that it is
