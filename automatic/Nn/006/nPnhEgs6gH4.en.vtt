 super funny super bowl super hi 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.410
 my loulous it's worth what good I'm 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.810
 crazy during the summer no but seriously 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.490
 why so much hatred 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.199
 yes it's true we're always on 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.730
 youtube today we find ourselves for 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.880
 a new top 5 that we will talk about 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.280
 fucking fucking roman zombies did 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.559
 never again that or I swear I stumble you 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.149
 had made love pretty blurry no it's 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.700
 not me I 'm the match that we can 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.020
 resume or what for this top 5 I 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.670
 wanted to make you discover if you do not 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.110
 do not know the five games yet 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.420
 arcade that you absolutely must play 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.420
 if you are fans of sounds it's gone 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.710
 at the very first game we will cheat a 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.540
 little bit for the simple and good reason 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.730
 that in fifth position I chose to 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.260
 put not one but two games but I 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.780
 will explain why here at 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.370
 0 and case west before dead rising 2 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.630
 do not go out the developers of the game we have 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.610
 allowed us to bite each other on a 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.260
 arcade game named zero box that turns out 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.580
 simply be his prologue then a 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.200
 once you had bought the game they 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.180
 have redone the same blow with case west 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.830
 but who is obviously his epilogue? 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.570
 basically if you liked charcuter 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.860
 the puck in dead rising and with a 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.420
 life of about four hours 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.890
 do not hesitate to these games are all to 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.610
 able to satisfy your instincts 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.830
 survivalists at dead rising and his 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.430
 fabulous weapon customization me 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.900
 I have a friend 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.190
 after playing I could not 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:43.860
 to stop trying to invent 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:46.390
 evil stuff in fourth position 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.210
 be able to rank all zombies in 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.520
 big carnage multiplayer way if they have 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.050
 very little calypso to present you this 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.880
 game what's better than showing you the 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.990
 local multiplayer images that 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.790
 for me is his greatest asset 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.020
 good you can always play solo 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.030
 but you understand it the goal is 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.470
 to expose a max of zombies in 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.299
 of buffers escape from this hell 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.619
 apocalyptic and you have to read it 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.330
 it's more fun when you play several 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.890
 in this game too you can improve 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.240
 your equipment but more 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.950
 Conventional using menus to 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.600
 each end of the game although it is 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.709
 far from being the best g2 omby all 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.390
 the times and if you feel like 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.160
 to explode handball without taking you 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.230
 head between dark mates make a 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.610
 part I do not know about you but me the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.810
 day where there are this kind of zombies well 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.430
 venerates who try to eat me at 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.319
 least to have a hell of a match under the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.120
 hand I can tell you that I am good 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.350
 in shit I think we're in 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.760
 rule number 1 to survive to 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.470
 zombieland and stamina 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.480
 the first to be passed to the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.970
 pan were the little big pigs 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.800
 3rd position we're going on a game that's 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.060
 from a series which is itself drawn 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.130
 of a comic strip of which I am 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.620
 absolutely fan you will understand it or 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.150
 not a burst ouarguini land in this 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.650
 game you play as an inmate with past tense to 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.000
 these disorders which following an accident of 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.680
 car finds itself delivered to itself 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.090
 in a world filled with my garden 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.890
 as you play, you will have the opportunity 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.660
 to make your own choices what 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.190
 will influence the reactions and the near 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.750
 people around you making 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.459
 sometimes some rather easy choices at 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.900
 firstly turn into a real 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.220
 casting although the game is not 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.170
 graphically a wonder the story 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.670
 however will keep you spellbound by a 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.630
 performance scenario conducted and 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.290
 endearing characters but guys 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.940
 what are you doing 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.320
 no, it's when dia characters 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.700
 endearing yeah that was so 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.739
 moving that brought us closer but me 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.600
 I do not tell you, I feel myself 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.190
 thing that there is a little too much love in 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.420
 this piece for my taste but you do 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.359
 as you want galas from elsewhere 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.980
 when talking about love, we go to the number 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.359
 10 of this ranking which for me is a 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.549
 big favorite I present you the 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.500
 lights seriously I like everything in the 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.329
 cinematic way comic book 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.859
 meat ed in the manner of an excites the 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.959
 take in hand very fast gameplay 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.880
 the atmosphere finally brief killings at 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.680
 first deadline is a game of 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.299
 pretty classic zombies in 2d but if we 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.950
 dig a little we quickly realize that 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.629
 beyond the dark universe 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.069
 a real puzzle with real unique 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.510
 but choices to make to ensure its 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.099
 progression in the game and did not count 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.849
 not finish a line without dying 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.650
 it's impossible 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.239
 in short, I buy my eyes closed in 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.500
 even hoping that developers so 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.030
 a second opus very soon 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.459
 seriously guys this game it's from the 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.879
 atomic bomb that's good enough this time 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.879
 I aim you 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.240
 ok we are already at number one for me 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.250
 it's already a reference arcade in 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.870
 zombie matter alone and leroux 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.100
 all the features of the game 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.590
 which one can play hours I 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.450

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.010

 scenarios and stuffing of living dead 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.350
 with homemade weapons at et cetera 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.360
 etc. 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.920

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.840
 all this and in addition who has a 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.250

 have to find the right technique to 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.500
 all explode finally brief the game is 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.970
 fun while remaining realistic and that's 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.560
