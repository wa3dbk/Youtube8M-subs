it's real nice and durable the
microphone<00:03:11.780> itself<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:14.470> obviously<00:03:15.470> cable<00:03:15.860> the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
microphone itself is obviously cable the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.370 
microphone itself is obviously cable the
same<00:03:16.220> way<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.760> it's<00:03:16.940> actually<00:03:17.269> like<00:03:17.300> a<00:03:17.450> 3.5

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
same way and it's actually like a 3.5

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.740 
same way and it's actually like a 3.5
millimeter<00:03:18.980> jack<00:03:19.070> like<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.269> plug<00:03:20.540> in

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
millimeter jack like that you plug in

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.550 
millimeter jack like that you plug in
that<00:03:21.680> detaches<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.670> attaches<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.360> as<00:03:23.540> far<00:03:24.350> as

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
that detaches it attaches it as far as

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.440 
that detaches it attaches it as far as
plugging<00:03:24.860> it<00:03:25.130> in<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.519> your<00:03:25.640> computer<00:03:25.820> or

will<00:04:13.130> say<00:04:13.400> that<00:04:13.760> this<00:04:14.030> microphone<00:04:14.630> is<00:04:15.620> not<00:04:15.980> a

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
will say that this microphone is not a

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.819 
will say that this microphone is not a
noise<00:04:16.400> cancelling<00:04:17.030> microphone<00:04:17.590> so<00:04:18.590> if<00:04:18.709> you

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
noise cancelling microphone so if you

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.319 
noise cancelling microphone so if you
have<00:04:19.010> it<00:04:19.190> further<00:04:19.549> away<00:04:19.820> from<00:04:19.850> your<00:04:20.180> mouth

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
have it further away from your mouth

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.080 
have it further away from your mouth
kind<00:04:20.690> of<00:04:20.780> like<00:04:20.930> this<00:04:21.200> or<00:04:23.919> it's<00:04:24.919> going<00:04:25.220> to<00:04:25.400> pick

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
kind of like this or it's going to pick

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.580 
kind of like this or it's going to pick
up<00:04:26.120> your<00:04:26.390> voice<00:04:26.600> but<00:04:26.840> it's<00:04:26.990> also<00:04:27.140> gonna<00:04:27.350> pick

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
up your voice but it's also gonna pick

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.200 
up your voice but it's also gonna pick
up<00:04:27.710> all<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.070> other<00:04:28.960> noise<00:04:29.960> in<00:04:30.289> the<00:04:30.380> room<00:04:31.150> so<00:04:32.150> it

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
up all the other noise in the room so it

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.550 
up all the other noise in the room so it
doesn't<00:04:32.479> have<00:04:32.600> that<00:04:32.630> noise<00:04:32.930> canceling

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
doesn't have that noise canceling
