00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.709 
around I actually air dried my hair now
it's<00:00:52.260> only<00:00:52.410> because<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.160> went<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> my<00:00:54.329> mum's<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
it's only because I went to my mum's to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.569 
it's only because I went to my mum's to
get<00:00:54.809> my<00:00:54.899> hair<00:00:55.110> relaxed<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.829> didn't<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.370> my

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
get my hair relaxed and I didn't have my

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.599 
get my hair relaxed and I didn't have my
blow<00:00:56.789> dryer<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.809> let<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.469> air<00:00:58.710> dry<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.309> then

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
blow dryer so I let it air dry and then

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.610 
blow dryer so I let it air dry and then
I<00:00:59.940> thought<00:01:00.359> I'd<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.809> which<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.230> another<00:01:01.440> way

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
I thought I'd do it which is another way

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.200 
I thought I'd do it which is another way
of<00:01:01.649> doing<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.190> mean<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.489> result<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:03.120> we

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
of doing it I mean the result see we

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.149 
of doing it I mean the result see we
have<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> look<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.840> not<00:01:04.350> only<00:01:04.530> different<00:01:04.769> to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
have a look is not only different to

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.399 
have a look is not only different to
have<00:01:05.339> done<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.909> past<00:01:06.020> and<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.260> might

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
have done it in the past and so it might

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.070 
have done it in the past and so it might
be<00:01:07.470> something<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.159> might<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:09.659> forward

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
be something I might do going forward

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.950

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.649 
and so obviously I've been when the
members<00:02:00.310> of<00:02:00.369> an<00:02:00.490> EXO<00:02:00.759> update<00:02:01.090> you<00:02:01.240> can<00:02:01.270> see

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
members of an EXO update you can see

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.109 
members of an EXO update you can see
that<00:02:01.899> you<00:02:02.020> know<00:02:02.110> I've<00:02:02.200> removed<00:02:02.619> those<00:02:03.219> filling

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.940 
that you know I've removed those filling
in<00:02:04.240> so<00:02:04.569> it's<00:02:04.719> looking<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.049> lot<00:02:05.200> more<00:02:05.500> health<00:02:05.770> in

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
in so it's looking a lot more health in

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.729 
in so it's looking a lot more health in
than<00:02:06.100> before<00:02:06.490> I<00:02:06.759> did<00:02:07.689> want<00:02:07.959> to<00:02:08.049> you<00:02:08.649> know

over the last couple of months so it's
kind<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:22.959> there<00:02:23.140> was<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.319> lot<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.560> uneven<00:02:24.190> areas

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
kind of there was a lot of uneven areas

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.000 
kind of there was a lot of uneven areas
of<00:02:24.819> my<00:02:24.970> hair<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:25.510> I'm<00:02:26.079> speaking<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.620> cut<00:02:26.799> more

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.890 
of my hair so I'm speaking to cut more
off<00:02:27.280> but<00:02:27.549> if<00:02:27.640> I've<00:02:27.760> done<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.299> then<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:28.780> would

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
off but if I've done that then I would

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.449 
off but if I've done that then I would
amend<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.290> cut<00:02:29.500> off<00:02:29.650> too<00:02:29.890> much<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.370> I<00:02:30.400> don't

amend that cut off too much and I don't

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.460 
amend that cut off too much and I don't
want<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:30.970> do<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.299> and<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.049> I<00:02:32.079> kind<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.319> just

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470
