one<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.500> believe<00:01:22.979> will<00:01:23.460> see<00:01:23.670> McNish<00:01:24.030> appear<00:01:24.390> and

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
one I believe will see McNish appear and

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.039

the<00:01:25.590> Ferrari<00:01:25.950> comes<00:01:26.369> over<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.090> line<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.810> I

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the Ferrari comes over on line and I

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.810 
the Ferrari comes over on line and I
wonder<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.650> he<00:01:28.799> even<00:01:28.829> knew<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.520> was<00:01:29.670> there

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
wonder if he even knew it was there

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.950 
wonder if he even knew it was there
behind

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
he would have tried to make the pass if

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.300 
he would have tried to make the pass if
