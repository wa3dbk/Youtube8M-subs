00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
kit does not really have an advantage in

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.740 
kit does not really have an advantage in
a<00:00:37.050> PvP<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.649> battle<00:00:38.160> besides<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.969> may<00:00:39.090> distract

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
a PvP in battle besides it may distract

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.319 
a PvP in battle besides it may distract
your<00:00:40.020> enemy<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> couple<00:00:41.160> seconds<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.760> may

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
your enemy for a couple seconds and may

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.000 
your enemy for a couple seconds and may
allow<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.870> get<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> couple<00:00:43.410> hits<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.829> them

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
allow you to get a couple hits on them

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.360 
allow you to get a couple hits on them
before<00:00:44.219> they<00:00:44.550> realize<00:00:44.910> which<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.370> but

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
before they realize which one is you but

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.360 
before they realize which one is you but
the<00:00:47.430> main<00:00:47.879> advantage<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.780> kit<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.260> for

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
the main advantage of this kit is for

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.500 
the main advantage of this kit is for
running<00:00:50.370> away<00:00:50.489> because<00:00:50.910> they<00:00:51.210> will<00:00:51.360> be

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
running away because they will be

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.869 
running away because they will be
hitting<00:00:51.960> all<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.530> clones<00:00:52.770> then<00:00:53.370> try<00:00:53.699> and

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
hitting all the clones then try and

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.910 
hitting all the clones then try and
figure<00:00:54.000> out<00:00:54.149> which<00:00:54.539> one<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.530> that

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
figure out which one is you and that

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.229 
figure out which one is you and that
will<00:00:56.039> hopefully<00:00:56.160> give<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.640> enough<00:00:56.940> time<00:00:56.969> to

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
will hopefully give you enough time to

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.420 
will hopefully give you enough time to
run<00:00:58.050> away<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.440> tower<00:00:58.680> up<00:00:58.920> or<00:00:59.070> whoever<00:00:59.340> else

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
run away and tower up or whoever else

anything it will kill them and it will

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.249 
anything it will kill them and it will
make<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> little<00:01:23.360> explosion<00:01:24.360> sound<00:01:24.659> this

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
make a little explosion sound this

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.920 
make a little explosion sound this
explosion<00:01:25.740> will<00:01:26.100> deal<00:01:26.460> one<00:01:26.880> heart<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.479> damage

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
explosion will deal one heart of damage

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.899 
explosion will deal one heart of damage
although<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.770> will<00:01:28.890> not<00:01:29.100> affect<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.549> terrain

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
although it will not affect the terrain

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.760 
although it will not affect the terrain
so<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.270> won't<00:01:30.420> break<00:01:30.720> any<00:01:30.990> blocks<00:01:31.380> or<00:01:31.560> anything

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
so it won't break any blocks or anything

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.890 
so it won't break any blocks or anything
like<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.640> will<00:01:32.790> drop<00:01:33.090> magma<00:01:33.630> creams

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
like that and it will drop magma creams

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.100 
like that and it will drop magma creams
but<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.320> cannot<00:01:34.590> pick<00:01:34.890> them<00:01:35.070> up<00:01:35.600> these<00:01:36.600> clones

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
but you cannot pick them up these clones

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.670 
but you cannot pick them up these clones
act<00:01:37.470> exactly<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.540> villagers<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.200> can

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
act exactly like villagers so you can

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.350 
act exactly like villagers so you can

good strategy and then trade with these
clones<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.840> get<00:01:46.079> emeralds<00:01:46.680> there's<00:01:47.100> usually

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
clones to get emeralds there's usually

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.090 
clones to get emeralds there's usually
going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.149> at<00:01:48.390> least<00:01:48.689> one<00:01:48.990> clone<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.920> will

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
going to be at least one clone that will

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.700 
going to be at least one clone that will

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
strategies you can tower up and then put

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.600 
strategies you can tower up and then put
one<00:02:22.790> clone<00:02:23.470> inside<00:02:24.470> little<00:02:24.950> tower<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.490> then

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
one clone inside little tower and then

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.490 
one clone inside little tower and then
jump<00:02:25.850> off<00:02:26.030> into<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.420> water<00:02:26.540> but<00:02:27.080> make<00:02:27.470> sure

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
jump off into the water but make sure

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.560 
jump off into the water but make sure
you<00:02:28.340> don't<00:02:28.550> miss<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.850> water<00:02:29.030> because<00:02:29.420> then

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
you don't miss the water because then

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.090 
you don't miss the water because then
you<00:02:29.720> will<00:02:29.870> die<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.470> then<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:30.800> will<00:02:30.920> get

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
you will die and then you will get

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.050 
you will die and then you will get
laughed<00:02:31.430> at<00:02:35.170> yeah<00:02:36.170> laughs<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.830> like<00:02:37.040> that<00:02:37.280> so

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060

guy is trying to get that person you dig

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.949 
guy is trying to get that person you dig
down<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.370> couple<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.940> bucks<00:02:44.180> right<00:02:44.510> beneath<00:02:44.750> the

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
down a couple of bucks right beneath the

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.630 
down a couple of bucks right beneath the
tower<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.410> then<00:02:45.860> when<00:02:46.040> they<00:02:46.190> are<00:02:46.310> trying<00:02:46.459> to

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
tower and then when they are trying to

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.670 
tower and then when they are trying to
come<00:02:46.850> up<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.209> you<00:02:47.420> can<00:02:47.450> snowball<00:02:48.200> them<00:02:48.440> off

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
come up to you you can snowball them off

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.650 
come up to you you can snowball them off
although<00:02:49.489> this<00:02:49.700> doesn't<00:02:49.970> always<00:02:50.300> work

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
although this doesn't always work

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.690 
although this doesn't always work
because<00:02:51.050> some<00:02:51.230> people<00:02:51.530> safe<00:02:51.890> stack<00:02:52.160> but

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
because some people safe stack but

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.310 
because some people safe stack but
people<00:02:52.850> usually<00:02:53.000> only<00:02:53.420> say<00:02:53.720> stack<00:02:54.020> if<00:02:54.200> they

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
people usually only say stack if they

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.080 
people usually only say stack if they
see<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.800> person<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:55.370> tower<00:02:55.580> looking<00:02:55.850> out

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
see the person and tower looking out

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.610 
see the person and tower looking out
them<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:56.630> there's<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.170> pretty<00:02:57.380> good<00:02:57.470> chance

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
them so there's a pretty good chance

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.050 
them so there's a pretty good chance
you'll<00:02:58.070> be<00:02:58.100> able<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.400> take<00:02:58.610> them<00:02:58.760> out<00:02:58.880> the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
you'll be able to take them out the

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.199 
you'll be able to take them out the
snowballs<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.690> they'll<00:02:59.810> die<00:03:00.020> a<00:03:00.050> fall<00:03:00.320> damage

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
snowballs and they'll die a fall damage

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.120 
snowballs and they'll die a fall damage
another<00:03:02.209> thing<00:03:02.540> you<00:03:02.570> can<00:03:02.870> do<00:03:03.080> is<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.890> just

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
another thing you can do is to just

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.390 
another thing you can do is to just
smack<00:03:04.760> down<00:03:05.150> sack<00:03:05.870> down<00:03:06.140> just<00:03:06.650> dig<00:03:06.860> down<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.100> few

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
smack down sack down just dig down a few

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.460 
smack down sack down just dig down a few
blocks<00:03:07.640> away<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.180> have<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.660> love<00:03:08.900> bucket<00:03:09.230> and
