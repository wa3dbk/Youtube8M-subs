00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.250
 hello how 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.920
 I want to welcome you to all those people who have the 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.910
 restlessness 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.349
 of learning to knit 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.019
 with crochet technique 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.359
 tactically in this video I want to give you a little introduction 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.640
 as for the data that is handled and god 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.960
 the team of Lillo 7 are also handled 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.260
 I'm going to talk about what are the tactical lime trees and therefore also what 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.630
 peaceful tone 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.710
 with what you can create 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.970
 i 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.859
 garments 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.050
 beautiful and ante atalanta up to the neck for nothing 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.220
 log 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.020
 i ciro 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.020
 everything you want including dv 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.450
 ok now we're going to start 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.710
 in as much the introduction on the matter to the numbers that are handled 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.450
 the one that this type of crochet 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.650
 the smallest and smallest begins with the high number that is the 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.860
 number 12 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.020
 hence, I asked the number 10 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.740
 then the number 8 then he 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.030
 the 4 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.190
 everything 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.030
 and the double zero 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.840
 finishing with the silver ones there are tone photos that are handled in somewhat the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.660
 piston 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.110
 of gray color 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.979
 percent 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.040
 I think it also depends on the march we buy 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.130
 but that basically knows that the teacher 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.560
 from the hook 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.440
 this agreement to the thread that is unhappy 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.710
 yes he did and he is 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.820
 very correct 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.350
 let's use the thread edit its double zero forgiveness or even says 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.250
 percent 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.700
 tactically 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.920
 is the way you are so much the vegetable tejera we have people 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.799
 let's leave 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.920
 very tight at the beginning when we are teaching 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.690
 but as we go practicing the fabric is loosened or loosened a little 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.990
 given the confidence that there is not has him noel with practice grabbing 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.299
 plus 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.290
 activity 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.659
 then percent if you start knitting 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:03.660
 i 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.920
 a great touch a little bit more correct 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.079
 percent 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.320
 for those who hold the pgr 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.299
 this is very good because the epad facilitate 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.530
 at the time of wanting to agree the ranch for him the chain 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.269
 the cream 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.149
 easy 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:23.849
 percent because we tend dad we are pawning we tend to pull and what 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:24.360
 the rest 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.939
 then the chain that since estimated 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.549
 when the room when not to have it is closing more and then when 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:39.680
 we want to cross the point we are very tight yare with the passage of time that 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.200
 I'm talking about if you guys are engaged 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.850
 acquire is to teach 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.879
 can attend 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.249
 in an easy hour they can learn to weave the chain and maybe if they throw 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:50.879
 desire 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.430
 as long as they practiced 12 pts on the same day 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.310
 are going to have better results when we learn something for the first time is good 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.620
 practice it as often as possible so as not to forget because the lottery 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.799
 alone they are going to go taking it 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.000
 but to whom 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.440
 put them to work then I congratulate them elÃ­as who is pototo 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.820
 I'm practically showing them what the teacher says the thread 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:24.029
 as well as the Danes to use 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:28.199
 are presented to and three hooks is because the lime trees allow us 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.829
 hecker 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.629
 with a little more bluetooh a little bit more 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.549
 thin our cancho 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.239
 in this case this and what is thin bridge that this with thread 12 he 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:38.800
 have 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.049
 an intruder number 8 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.569
 little by little in the tamarind as a Quintana player 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.800
