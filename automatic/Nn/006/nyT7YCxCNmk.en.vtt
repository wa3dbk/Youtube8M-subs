00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:09.269
 Here the mugwort actually grows 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:14.800
 In many places only known as weeds 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:17.320
 an old hebammen herb was se 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.020
 used to regulate menstruation 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.789
 when in the sun the red grows 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.260
 that he symbolizes the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.430
 female human is so the month 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:34.239
 otherwise it is the river for the midwives 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:39.190
 a herb that warms the abdomen and 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:41.200
 in the early stages of the cycle he should 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.640
 to stimulate the ovulation or the 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.410
 stimulate fertility 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:52.180
 in later phases menstruation 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:54.640
 stimulate at foot was taken during 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.280
 The birth of a booze drunk in 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.800
 very specific phase of birth 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.710
 the birth accelerated or that 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.579
 the bundler so the placenta better 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.329
 triggers and is now rediscovered 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.310
 the mugwort opens and warms the 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.079
 abdomen 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.189
 What most people do not know is that it is 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:19.209
 an ancient shaman plant is and 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.490
 she got 

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:23.859
 she was used when she was 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.639
 the flower does not bloom here when she is 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:30.520
 blooms bloom those were 

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:33.669
 The flowers collected have one 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:38.079
 fight against similar fragrance and as rich 

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:40.689
 The upper couple's cross opened 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:43.479
 makes you more alert and receptive 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:46.270
 mentally so it opens up 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.359
 physical level more the abdomen and 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:54.969
 on the mental level opens so 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:59.380
 the upper chaka mugwort was slightly 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:01.779
 already the result ethno botanical 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.150
 researches already in the stone age for 

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:10.070
 smoking taken at shamanic approx 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:13.730
 I call it the oldest of the oldest 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:17.780
 the shaman have herbs and besides 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:23.900
 we still have a mugwort growing here 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:26.630
 have a look on a bit 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.410
 different from the european group though 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.600
 here too he has the silvery we see 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.510
 that and this all silvery 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:45.230
 this is the American cities 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:48.890
 foot of mugwort which is often said to be prairie 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.590
 is made known and in indian 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.890
 Books say it prairie station that will 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.709
 one translates as ointment and many as well 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.900
 two followers and winnetou fans the 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.620
 then begin with garden sage 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.690
 smoke 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.330
 the indians never do that 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.200
 made at the garden sage from the 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.970
 mediterranean area comes and and they knew 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.519
 not him at all but they have with 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.660
 This mugwort art expressed and have him 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:21.250
 just as we used this at foot 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.050
 so it is a Stone Age 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.070
 application it goes up to the stone age 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:31.780
 back the women also have the mugwort 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:36.220
 scattered if someone 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.490
 at birth so in the on the 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.100
 childbed 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.200
 that was designed with mugwort that 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.390
 Incidentally, the Indian women do too 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:51.340
 sacred place will be with beifuÃŸ 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:54.260
 designed so very similar to the 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.590
 see run in the germanic the choice of 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.980
 and wants that then in deep trance 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.380
 went or flew out into the 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.489
 spiritual worlds to very special 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.200
 Winter solstice or summer time 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.180
 summer solstices have either with 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.230
 mugwort smoked or with mugwort 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.650
 rubbed 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.709
 or have wandered around 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.870
 to facilitate the flight 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.340
 the indians are doing exactly the same thing 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.890
 if in the summertime if 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.800
 They go out and hook up with them 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.620
 Hook on the sun wall and then dance 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.050
 until deep transfair so fall the 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.479
 have hooks through the chest some hooks 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.530
 in the back and pull another buffalo 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:47.630
 skull and whistle on eagle whistle 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:51.169
 on eagle bones and dance and dance 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.960
 they are consecrated and then 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.930
 they fall into deep transdia hooks 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.919
 leave and your soul floats 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:05.240
 So that's about dreams and shamanism 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:09.770
 very connected both plants are old 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:12.440
 girl had me in greece 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:16.669
 the goddess of the wilderness for excursions 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.520
 beyond the civilized there 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:24.110
 beyond the hedge the wilderness of 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.570
 the cultured world trend among these 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.770
 excursions all over the world was at 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:34.669
 foot used it should also give protection 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:39.770
 it sells it so it means sells 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:43.150
 Ghosts of the Chinese moxa that are 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.150
 small mugwort globules
