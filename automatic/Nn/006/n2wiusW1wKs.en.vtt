00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.509
 with this tutorial we will be 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.410
 using what is png of cats the 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.540
 which I can leave you in the 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.980
 description of the video now well I'll 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.170
 use this image and I'm going to 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.630
 drag to my work space or 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.150
 be the photo of the model that I will be 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.850
 using for this tutorial once 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.060
 that we have png located I'm going to stretch it 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.250
 so it looks good and I'm going to calculate it 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.840
 how much I'm going to stretch it according to how it's going to 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.340
 stay mounted on my head 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.489
 model without 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.899
 pressing on the 6,500 of the image and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.280
 pushing as it were 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.050
 we can fix what is the 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.730
 image perspective and is 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.950
 are watching now 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.809
 applied the changes and what next 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.250
 I'm going to do is get rid of the rest of the 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.829
 body of the cat that will not serve me 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.530
 for 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.989
 this can be done in two ways the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.089
 first is nothing else using the 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.710
 eraser and erase the entire body of 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.239
 cat that I will not use it and the 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.179
 second is using the tool 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.390
 tie making a selection without letting go 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.870
 the mouse while we squeeze and do the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.340
 figure is 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:13.250
 surrounding the body part of the cat and 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.490
 pressing the delete button of 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.770
 our keyboard we erase all control of 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.320
 to select and here we have how 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.810
 it will be ours now well for 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.390
 locate neither ditches I have a problem and 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.930
 is that I want them to be in perspective 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.690
 that the edit section transform and 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.320
 deform and in this way moving the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.320
 points 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.550
 of the selection we will achieve with a 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.070
 our image and arch it as it would be 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.820
 in the case of the little ears that are going to go 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.820
 over the head 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.720
 once I do that I will select 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.790
 the draft and I'm going to erase between 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.790
 ears to leave alone 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.119
 I'm going to erase those spaces you can not see 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.229
 too much the cut of the eraser and what 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.229
 next we're going to do 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.430
 et double click on our layer and the 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.170
 parallel shadow 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.150
 and we're going to lower it a little bit 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.579
 opacity and fix the angle according to 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.969
 you have the perspective of your 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.969
 image 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.420
 they do not have to touch anything else that's just 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.520
 to give the shadow effect to the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.130
 ears decide to make a new layer 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.050
 let's go to the color palette not without 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.360
 before giving a sum to our ears 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.220
 to work better and we will choose a 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.140
 color with the dropper that we do 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.990
 pressing alt and clicking on the 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.150
 hair color to catch the same 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.630
 color that our hair has and so 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.180
 can pass it over the ears to 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.100
 the sides basically around the 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.380
 edge we are going to lower a little the 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.990
 opacity and maybe we're going to put together we erase 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.270
 where we have left the contour 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.070
 what are we doing and we are going to see that 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.350
 this is going to give an effect as in 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.120
 shadow or fusion between the hair and 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.250
 the little ears so they have a lot 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.290
 care and that they look good for also 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.710
 this case chose a brown and good color 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.140
 picture on the difficulty in the end remember 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.410
 that I would be leaving what the psd is 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.750
 of our little ears 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.070
 the description of the video so they have 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.990
 to enter the video to give in the 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.850
 description and go to download the 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.020
 psd file that you will be able to 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.400
 open 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.680
 the second part this tutorial 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.650
 obviously it is to change the eye color 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.300
 to our best so this we have 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.250
 a little bit of patience because I have more 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.720
 I already work and I hope that they had 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.720
 enjoyed and no more
