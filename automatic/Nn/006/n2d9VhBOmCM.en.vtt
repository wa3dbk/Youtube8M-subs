00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
game or anything I'm not sure what this

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.350 
game or anything I'm not sure what this
is<00:04:27.310> all<00:04:27.430> about<00:04:27.460> but<00:04:27.820> that<00:04:27.940> actually<00:04:28.210> looks

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
is all about but that actually looks

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.760 
is all about but that actually looks
pretty<00:04:28.570> sweet<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:29.080> I<00:04:29.200> guess<00:04:29.380> these<00:04:29.500> are<00:04:29.560> just

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
pretty sweet and I guess these are just

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.830 
pretty sweet and I guess these are just
shelves<00:04:30.160> for<00:04:30.730> them<00:04:30.850> to<00:04:30.970> put<00:04:31.150> their<00:04:31.330> their

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
shelves for them to put their their

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.870 
shelves for them to put their their
equipment<00:04:32.350> and<00:04:32.440> stuff<00:04:32.710> on<00:04:32.920> you<00:04:33.100> know<00:04:33.250> you<00:04:33.760> know

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
equipment and stuff on you know you know

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.310 
equipment and stuff on you know you know
that<00:04:33.910> is<00:04:34.120> this<00:04:34.330> is<00:04:34.420> the<00:04:34.510> away<00:04:34.690> team<00:04:34.900> dressing

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
that is this is the away team dressing

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.530 
that is this is the away team dressing
room<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:36.520> guess<00:04:36.730> this<00:04:36.880> is<00:04:37.000> another<00:04:37.090> VIP

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
room and I guess this is another VIP

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.680 
room and I guess this is another VIP
entrance<00:04:37.900> and<00:04:38.410> I<00:04:39.250> guess<00:04:39.520> this<00:04:39.730> would<00:04:39.880> lead<00:04:40.090> out

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
entrance and I guess this would lead out

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.470 
entrance and I guess this would lead out
into<00:04:41.140> the<00:04:41.410> refs<00:04:41.950> box<00:04:42.430> or<00:04:42.700> whatever<00:04:42.940> this<00:04:43.090> box

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
into the refs box or whatever this box

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.870 
into the refs box or whatever this box
is<00:04:43.750> for<00:04:44.080> I'm<00:04:44.230> not<00:04:44.350> sure<00:04:44.560> that<00:04:44.590> boxes<00:04:45.220> for<00:04:45.430> but

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
is for I'm not sure that boxes for but

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.670 
is for I'm not sure that boxes for but
that's<00:04:46.090> pretty<00:04:46.360> sweet<00:04:46.480> um<00:04:46.810> I<00:04:46.990> guess<00:04:47.170> the<00:04:47.350> the

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
that's pretty sweet um I guess the the

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.560 
that's pretty sweet um I guess the the
guests<00:04:47.980> would<00:04:48.070> be<00:04:48.100> sort<00:04:48.880> of<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.030> same<00:04:49.060> except
