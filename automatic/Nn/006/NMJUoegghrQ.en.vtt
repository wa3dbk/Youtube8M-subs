week<00:00:07.350> with<00:00:07.560> my<00:00:07.710> hernia<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.309> wasn't<00:00:08.790> really<00:00:08.880> sure

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
week with my hernia I wasn't really sure

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.160 
week with my hernia I wasn't really sure
if<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.210> was<00:00:09.269> gonna<00:00:09.420> do<00:00:09.630> this<00:00:09.780> dumbbell<00:00:10.019> chest

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
if I was gonna do this dumbbell chest

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.530 
if I was gonna do this dumbbell chest
press<00:00:10.469> this<00:00:10.830> heavy<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.219> started<00:00:11.759> with<00:00:11.849> 60s<00:00:12.389> and

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
press this heavy I started with 60s and

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.360 
press this heavy I started with 60s and
70s<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.170> then<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.559> felt<00:00:13.830> good<00:00:13.980> enough<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.340> I

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
70s and then I felt good enough that I

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.770 
70s and then I felt good enough that I
thought<00:00:14.580> I'd<00:00:14.700> go<00:00:14.849> for<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.089> full<00:00:15.360> hundred

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
thought I'd go for the full hundred

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.439 
thought I'd go for the full hundred
pound<00:00:16.020> dumbbells<00:00:16.940> now<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:17.970> really<00:00:18.300> had<00:00:18.420> to

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
pound dumbbells now I really had to

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.029 
pound dumbbells now I really had to
concentrate<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:19.020> breathing<00:00:19.199> out<00:00:19.529> when<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:19.949> was

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
concentrate on breathing out when I was

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.769 
concentrate on breathing out when I was
pushing<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.699> breathing<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.449> while<00:00:21.660> I'm

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
pushing and breathing in while I'm

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.420 
pushing and breathing in while I'm
dropping<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.439> weight<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:22.769> I'm<00:00:22.859> using<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.250> lot

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
dropping the weight so I'm using a lot

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.210 
dropping the weight so I'm using a lot
of<00:00:23.550> my<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:24.000> know<00:00:24.029> mental<00:00:24.630> control<00:00:25.099> and<00:00:26.099> my

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
of my you know mental control and my

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.519 
of my you know mental control and my
mental<00:00:26.519> capacity<00:00:27.029> just<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.539> thinking<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.349> how

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
mental capacity just on thinking on how

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.349 
mental capacity just on thinking on how
to<00:00:28.560> breathe<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.460> kind<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.760> screwed<00:00:30.000> me<00:00:30.150> up<00:00:30.240> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
to breathe so kind of screwed me up a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.209 
to breathe so kind of screwed me up a
little<00:00:30.630> bit<00:00:30.750> you'll<00:00:30.960> see<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.230> last<00:00:31.590> rep<00:00:32.040> of

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
little bit you'll see this last rep of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.400 
little bit you'll see this last rep of
the<00:00:32.340> set<00:00:32.669> kind<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.059> fail<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:34.140> think<00:00:34.320> that

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the set kind of fail and I think that

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.080 
the set kind of fail and I think that
was<00:00:34.530> due<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.739> me<00:00:34.980> kind<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.250> just<00:00:35.430> overthinking

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
was due to me kind of just overthinking

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.650 
was due to me kind of just overthinking
about<00:00:37.010> breathing<00:00:38.010> more<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.820> than<00:00:39.059> thinking

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
about breathing more so than thinking

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.319 
about breathing more so than thinking
about<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.079> actual<00:00:40.500> lift<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:42.059> you'll<00:00:42.180> see

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
about the actual lift and you'll see

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.580 
about the actual lift and you'll see
this<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.570> kind<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.780> funny<00:00:42.960> I've<00:00:43.110> start<00:00:43.350> Phil

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
to do any glute work because of my

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.860 
to do any glute work because of my
hernia<00:00:58.859> because<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.579> usually<00:00:59.940> rely<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.270> squats

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
hernia because I usually rely on squats

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.799 
hernia because I usually rely on squats
and<00:01:01.199> really<00:01:01.949> deep<00:01:02.219> leg<00:01:02.550> presses<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.210> actually

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
and really deep leg presses to actually

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.160 
and really deep leg presses to actually
get<00:01:03.960> my<00:01:04.110> glutes<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.650> good<00:01:05.010> workout<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.049> and<00:01:07.049> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
get my glutes a good workout and and you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.270 
get my glutes a good workout and and you
know<00:01:07.290> having<00:01:07.470> been<00:01:07.530> able<00:01:07.710> doing<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.130> because

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
know having been able doing that because

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.070 
know having been able doing that because
of<00:01:08.430> my<00:01:08.490> hernia<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.450> wanted<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.020> I

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
of my hernia and I wanted to see if I

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.750 
of my hernia and I wanted to see if I
could<00:01:10.140> maybe<00:01:10.409> do<00:01:10.619> lunges<00:01:10.920> instead<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.460> squats

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
could maybe do lunges instead of squats

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.890 
could maybe do lunges instead of squats
or<00:01:11.880> des<00:01:12.090> because<00:01:12.390> there'd<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.630> less

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
or des because there'd be less

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.649 
or des because there'd be less
intra-abdominal<00:01:13.350> pressure<00:01:14.189> building<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.939> so

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
intra-abdominal pressure building up so

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.200 
intra-abdominal pressure building up so
I<00:01:16.049> actually<00:01:16.500> threw<00:01:17.130> up<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.460> think<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.090> is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
I actually threw up I think this is

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.590 
I actually threw up I think this is
eighty<00:01:18.540> pound<00:01:18.960> barbell<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:21.180> just<00:01:21.390> really

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
eighty pound barbell and I just really

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.260 
eighty pound barbell and I just really
concentrated<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.890> very<00:01:23.070> slow<00:01:23.640> going

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
concentrated on going very slow going

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
concentrated on going very slow going
through<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> heel<00:01:25.049> allowing<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.040> glute<00:01:26.400> to

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
through the heel allowing my glute to

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.590 
through the heel allowing my glute to
relax<00:01:28.290> fully<00:01:29.100> stretch<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.970> then<00:01:30.210> fully

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
relax fully stretch and then fully

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.760 
relax fully stretch and then fully
contract<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.520> I<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.820> say<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.140> it<00:01:34.140> was<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.439> lot

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
contract and I can say that it was a lot

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.499 
contract and I can say that it was a lot
different<00:01:34.950> than<00:01:35.250> my<00:01:35.400> regular<00:01:35.579> leg<00:01:36.119> days<00:01:36.329> have

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
different than my regular leg days have

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.010 
different than my regular leg days have
been<00:01:36.750> because<00:01:37.229> my<00:01:37.439> legs<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.040> my<00:01:38.100> glutes<00:01:38.729> are

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
been because my legs and my glutes are

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.170 
been because my legs and my glutes are
sore<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.320> whole<00:01:40.560> different<00:01:40.920> way<00:01:41.490> which<00:01:42.060> is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
sore in a whole different way which is
