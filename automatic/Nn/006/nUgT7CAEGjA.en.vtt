00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.010
 it just does not present its air of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.740
 sportsmanship also presents you a 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.890
 completely changed front of his 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.850
 predecessor since it now integrates the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.689
 bumper looks like a harmony between 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.420
 the bumper and the back and 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.059
 it is also covered facing and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.519
 they help the aerodynamics something 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.000
 interesting of this reason is that now 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:41.309
 it has a much more aerodynamic field 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.910
 how to conserve there is some 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.750
 muscle well featured integrated the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.230
 grill and in turn also to your lights 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.780
 of line technology that also help 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.699
 have better physical appearance to the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.649
 catalysis of this fourth generation 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.320
 of the next safor the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.890
 freedetermination presents you with a way 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.770
 conical that go from the top 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.960
 to the bottom of everything that 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.540
 is the body of the vehicle 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.570
 we have one of the most notorious change that 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.780
 you can perceive with this is the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.780
 compact and urban it's about 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.240
 the answer the tire that 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.240
 habitually I was not used to 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.930
 Rafael who would have put in his gate 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.950
 back today the reason in this style will 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:42.390
 gives an air more urban city and what 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:46.280
 what they did was that they placed key 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.280
 spare in this position 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.500
 following the continuity 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.920
 the boot load is large but 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.490
 on the path of power also bring down 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:05.369
 the seats at 60 40 to thus have a 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.369
 better space here 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:13.099
 do not 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.099
 believe me the seats folded 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.000
 Ample space can provide you 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:28.050
 if they carry another discovery we are in 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.850
 the part this second row 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.730
 large 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:37.030
 has space for the knee 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.360
 we have one 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.620
 handle here which we can 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.620
 synchronize the seats 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.819
 in front of back if we want straight 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.300
 the distance between the head here 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:03:00.330
 we have an armrest that we can 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:03.190
 in other water bottles the conduit 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.820
 as a companion 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.530
 in the second row of spacious seats 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.770
 so three people know 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.770
 perfectly 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:22.800
 the first was on day 7 also imparts 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:27.090
 dt rafo which then shows some 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:31.260
 seats of very fine quality has 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:35.120
 the water can be placed here and the 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:39.990
 water posture here we have a space 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.200
 that we can have other cell phones 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.190
 the key here 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.190
 here offers 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.010
 a relaxed arm 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:56.860
 the cabin here we can have a 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:01.200
 box can not like in the water any 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.200
 object that we need and equality 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.780
 it has a lot of compartment here we have 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.780
 also a small 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.740
 of passion that can serve to 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.830
 equality any small object then 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:22.410
 well it has a vanguard style we see 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:27.070
 which has a high quality materials 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:31.020
 on the board to give us a freshness 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.840
 as nice as now 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.560
 to perceive the driving style of 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.560
 this fourth generation 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.500
 of this rap 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:54.090
 driving dynamics have 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.090
 they are excellent since they allow to have a 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.090
 visibility 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.360
 in panoramic view from above 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:13.660
 dynamic smooth driving 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.660
 allows you to have agility 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.399
 the curve well 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:26.080
 yes 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.080
 and it suits the situation 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:36.419
 this fourth generation of the rafal now 

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:38.759
 has come a little more sophisticated already 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:44.660
 that allows to have two types of 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:47.900
 normal driving and one sport 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.930
 besides that it has the systems of 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.140
 security that allows you in any 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.140
 situation 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.610
 some slip 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:06.370
 acquire 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.370
 in the streets in the glasses 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:15.409
 and it can be highlighted 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:18.589
 what is the sound from the outside 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:21.219
 the fields have been reduced 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:21.219
 considerably 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:28.600
 so that the user the owner of 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:32.460
 tecario have a better harmony between him 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.460
 between the cabin did 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.030
 and the production 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.030
 ah 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.979
 the fourth generation is now available 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.320
 in the American market through its 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:54.889
 exclusive office that is alert 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.889
 commercial
