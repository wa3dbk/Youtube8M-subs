00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
it's not quite as cold in the South but

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.349 
it's not quite as cold in the South but
not<00:01:02.100> feeling<00:01:02.430> great<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.910> given<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> rain

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
not feeling great and given the rain

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.630 
not feeling great and given the rain
that's<00:01:03.570> around<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.170> only<00:01:04.619> gradually<00:01:05.129> easy<00:01:05.400> to

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
that's around and only gradually easy to

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.070 
that's around and only gradually easy to
eat<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:05.909> even<00:01:06.150> into<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> afternoon<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.900> think

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
eat so even into the afternoon I think

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.929 
eat so even into the afternoon I think
we'll<00:01:07.170> still<00:01:07.350> notice<00:01:07.799> some<00:01:08.280> bits<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.670> pieces

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939

maybe a few snow showers that means I
