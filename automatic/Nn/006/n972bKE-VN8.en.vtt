00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 in the past video we looked at the figure 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.310
 bebop well now let's see 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.310
 on rokstedi 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.009
 his packaging is exactly the same 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.590
 let's just open it 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.720
 Rocksteads outside the package immediately we see that 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.580
 he is very good on his feet without a stand 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.320
 his shoes are absolutely 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:30.080
 monotone brown but looks 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.080
 it's okay pants 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.140
 type camouflage 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.880
 very nice look at the shell 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.780
 sides 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.630
 sand look how made his shirt 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.000
 and the shirt is as if just unpainted 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:58.470
 Part of the figure I donâ€™t know well or 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.900
 bad but looks rather strange also 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:07.440
 its small ornaments if it can be so 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:09.240
 call grenade ammunition behind also 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.720
 can see the continuation of this very 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.890
 ribbons 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.640
 ammunition green handkerchief on his 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.220
 right hand 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.760
 well let's look at the most interesting 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.760
 on his face 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.570
 the sculptor is made very well at least during the day 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:32.220
 also what bebop figures are missing 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:38.420
 some kind of additional painting but how 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.420
 see very cool wrinkles teeth 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:50.060
 he came out so angry little eyes 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.390
 principle very nice but not like that 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.660
 cute like classic rocksteady 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.460
 see who 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:02.680
 cutie on his head some 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.230
 o mg exactly g look okay this helmet 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.990
 is og but these glasses are here 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.820
 just also green plastic though 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.660
 packaging is drawn as if they 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.130
 painted here you see proof 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.810
 the image they are painted 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.240
 our companion's casco is taken off and here 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.910
 so he looks without his head 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.470
 the dressing is also very pretty now 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.260
 let's look at his accessories 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.870
 All too stand true now with 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.110
 the inscription of course Rockstead here it is 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.070
 compared with the stand of a turtle like this 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.770
 that video you can see the difference what 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.370
 of them it looks nicer next 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.810
 here's a big knife just out of gray 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.709
 there is no painting plastic as well 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.709
 huge machine gun 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.890
 here they are together right next to some 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.990
 Contra turns out very pleased that 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.970
 used different bodies that is 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:11.160
 look grendel he will be bigger 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.510
 could just buy for make and even hands 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.780
 see this thinner this thicker 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:22.370
 absolutely two different figures 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.370
 but together they look just super 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.970
 size comparison here is our new 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.629
 classic rockstar and classic rock 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.870
 style and they are both cool guys and here it is 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:40.269
 Our Rocksteady with a bug 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.340
 I already complained about the size of the previous one 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.580
 review so who hasn't watched go 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.880
 on the link in the description and see well or 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.360
 click on the annotation here are our villains 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.489
 All together, I will show once again that these 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.560
 the figures look very cool with 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.709
 figures help series from nickelodeon and 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.760
 there are already new figures new turtles 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.430
 on this animated series 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.340
 and they should look even better with 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.590
 what are you going to have to take with these thugs 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.750
 as you can see for yourself these two 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.780
 the figures look great together and 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.890
 looks great with smaller figures with 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.729
 smaller bugs 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.579
 and with my brothers in the line something 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:25.210
 It does not look good but the pros are bigger 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.380
 than cons so very very successful 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.389
 replenishment in the collection 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.389
 I advise everyone not to eat on the shelves 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.460
 stores also have a cavity on the internet 100 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.710
 there are poods in online stores now 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.419
 where are they just not of course not 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.669
 forget to like to write 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.720
 comments with you were zik 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.720
 peace for everyone
