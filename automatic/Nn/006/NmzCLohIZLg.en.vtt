got me interested in the engineering
aspect<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.160> it<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.550> be<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.880> excited<00:02:03.390> about

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
aspect of it to be that excited about

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.870 
aspect of it to be that excited about
science<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.140> technology<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.950> was<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.340> an

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
science and technology it was just an

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.120 
science and technology it was just an
eye-opener<00:02:06.300> make<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:07.290> learn<00:02:07.410> leadership<00:02:07.710> and

eye-opener make you learn leadership and
communication<00:02:08.460> being<00:02:09.330> able<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.540> develop<00:02:10.200> that

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
communication being able to develop that

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.410 
communication being able to develop that
skill<00:02:10.679> at<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.950> young<00:02:11.130> age<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.610> appreciate<00:02:12.210> it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
skill at a young age and appreciate it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.170 
skill at a young age and appreciate it
is<00:02:13.160> really<00:02:14.160> great<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.550> workforce<00:02:14.850> later

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
is really great in the workforce later

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.870 
is really great in the workforce later
on<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.570> definitely<00:02:16.380> did<00:02:16.590> not<00:02:16.620> know<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.430> wanted<00:02:17.820> to

be<00:02:17.970> an<00:02:18.060> engineer<00:02:18.210> before<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.810> did<00:02:18.960> first<00:02:19.170> no

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
be an engineer before I did first no

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.680 
be an engineer before I did first no
