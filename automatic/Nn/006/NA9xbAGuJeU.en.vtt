00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.410 
shirt does a lot here's the view of the
side<00:01:18.009> and<00:01:18.280> what<00:01:18.609> I<00:01:18.639> find<00:01:18.939> interesting<00:01:19.119> about

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
side and what I find interesting about

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.819 
side and what I find interesting about
this<00:01:19.689> design<00:01:19.990> is<00:01:20.229> that<00:01:20.259> they<00:01:20.469> had<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.649> mud

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
this design is that they had the mud

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.279 
this design is that they had the mud
guards<00:01:21.130> facing<00:01:21.549> inside<00:01:21.909> and<00:01:22.210> that's<00:01:23.109> actually

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
guards facing inside and that's actually

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:24.749 
guards facing inside and that's actually
not<00:01:23.469> a<00:01:23.590> bad<00:01:23.649> way<00:01:23.920> to<00:01:23.950> built<00:01:24.219> because<00:01:24.340> it<00:01:24.579> gives

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
not a bad way to built because it gives

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.029 
not a bad way to built because it gives
you<00:01:24.939> some<00:01:25.479> options<00:01:25.600> on<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.049> outside<00:01:26.350> for

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
you some options on the outside for

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.050 
you some options on the outside for
example<00:01:27.159> like<00:01:27.490> at<00:01:27.579> the<00:01:27.639> front<00:01:27.819> here<00:01:27.939> they

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
example like at the front here they

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.950 
example like at the front here they
added<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.329> bracket<00:01:28.630> piece<00:01:28.780> for<00:01:28.899> the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
added the bracket piece for the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.449 
added the bracket piece for the
headlights<00:01:29.229> I<00:01:29.499> think<00:01:30.009> that<00:01:30.130> looks<00:01:30.280> really

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:30.459 
headlights I think that looks really

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:32.699 
headlights I think that looks really
good<00:01:30.729> here's<00:01:31.509> the<00:01:31.630> view<00:01:31.749> of<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.929> top<00:01:32.139> and<00:01:32.590> this

have them attached to the handlebars so
what<00:01:37.810> I<00:01:37.840> recommend<00:01:38.229> is<00:01:38.289> you<00:01:38.319> put<00:01:38.530> them<00:01:38.590> in

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
what I recommend is you put them in

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:40.080 
what I recommend is you put them in
there<00:01:38.889> and<00:01:39.219> you<00:01:39.459> have<00:01:39.579> them<00:01:39.670> lean<00:01:39.819> back<00:01:40.060> a

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
there and you have them lean back a

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.120 
there and you have them lean back a
little<00:01:40.450> bit<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:41.229> just<00:01:41.259> push<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.709> handlebars

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
little bit and just push the handlebars

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.899 
little bit and just push the handlebars
into<00:01:42.429> his<00:01:42.549> hands

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
into his hands

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.730 
into his hands
and<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.479> usually<00:01:43.600> works<00:01:43.840> pretty<00:01:43.929> well<00:01:44.139> see

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
and that usually works pretty well see

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.010 
and that usually works pretty well see
not<00:01:45.340> too<00:01:45.459> bad<00:01:45.609> and<00:01:46.450> here's<00:01:46.689> the<00:01:46.749> view<00:01:46.899> of<00:01:46.959> the

front right here we have a clip and

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.219 
front right here we have a clip and
that's<00:01:49.029> where<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.329> can<00:01:49.389> store<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.929> fire

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
piece just to sit right on top of the

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.330 
piece just to sit right on top of the
great<00:02:16.209> part<00:02:16.450> right<00:02:16.569> there<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:18.129> is<00:02:18.220> what

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
great part right there and this is what

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.119 
great part right there and this is what
the<00:02:18.400> complete<00:02:18.670> set<00:02:18.849> looks<00:02:19.030> like<00:02:19.920> pretty<00:02:20.920> neat

the complete set looks like pretty neat

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.009 
the complete set looks like pretty neat
right<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.760> now<00:02:22.150> we<00:02:22.209> can<00:02:22.420> move<00:02:22.510> on<00:02:22.659> to<00:02:22.780> the

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
right and now we can move on to the

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.550 
right and now we can move on to the
recommendations<00:02:25.110> overall<00:02:26.110> I'd<00:02:26.260> say<00:02:26.290> it's<00:02:26.530> a

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
recommendations overall I'd say it's a

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.869 
recommendations overall I'd say it's a
pretty<00:02:26.650> good<00:02:26.890> set<00:02:27.129> when<00:02:27.459> it<00:02:27.549> comes<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.790> the

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
pretty good set when it comes to the

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.789 
pretty good set when it comes to the
value<00:02:28.150> though<00:02:28.299> it's<00:02:28.510> just<00:02:28.629> okay<00:02:29.019> we<00:02:29.590> have<00:02:29.709> a

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
value though it's just okay we have a

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.380 
value though it's just okay we have a
price<00:02:29.980> per<00:02:30.159> piece<00:02:30.310> ratio<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.939> twelve<00:02:31.239> cents

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
price per piece ratio of twelve cents

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.910 
price per piece ratio of twelve cents
per<00:02:31.569> piece<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.049> we're<00:02:32.260> getting<00:02:32.379> about<00:02:32.650> three

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
per piece and we're getting about three

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.410 
per piece and we're getting about three
to<00:02:33.069> four<00:02:33.250> dollars<00:02:33.400> for<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:33.760> parts<00:02:34.030> here<00:02:34.180> not

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
to four dollars for the parts here not

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.149 
to four dollars for the parts here not
including<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.780> minifigure<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.650> firefighter

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
including the minifigure the firefighter

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.039 
including the minifigure the firefighter
himself<00:02:36.549> is<00:02:36.670> worth<00:02:36.819> about<00:02:36.970> three<00:02:37.540> dollars<00:02:37.690> so

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
himself is worth about three dollars so

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.289 
himself is worth about three dollars so
it's<00:02:38.620> about<00:02:38.739> average<00:02:38.950> for<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.519> set<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.180> this

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
it's about average for a set of this

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.420 
it's about average for a set of this
size<00:02:40.540> but<00:02:41.440> ideally<00:02:41.799> you<00:02:42.040> want<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.220> small

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
size but ideally you want a small

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.250 
size but ideally you want a small
discount<00:02:42.819> when<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.000> get<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.299> and<00:02:43.510> when<00:02:44.170> it

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
discount when you get it and when it

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.809 
discount when you get it and when it
comes<00:02:44.349> to<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.590> play<00:02:44.739> value<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.250> would<00:02:45.519> say<00:02:45.700> it's

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
comes to the play value I would say it's

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.789 
comes to the play value I would say it's
excellent<00:02:46.209> because<00:02:46.540> for<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.260> small<00:02:47.470> set<00:02:47.709> we

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
excellent because for a small set we

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:48.899 
excellent because for a small set we
have<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.920> lot<00:02:48.099> of<00:02:48.129> accessories<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:48.700> go<00:02:48.819> with

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
have a lot of accessories that go with

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.910 
have a lot of accessories that go with
it<00:02:49.060> as<00:02:49.269> just<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.810> lot<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:49.959> fun<00:02:50.170> just<00:02:50.409> by<00:02:50.500> itself

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
it as just a lot of fun just by itself

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.860 
it as just a lot of fun just by itself
I<00:02:51.069> do<00:02:51.640> wish<00:02:51.879> that<00:02:51.909> it<00:02:52.180> came<00:02:52.329> with<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.540> little

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
I do wish that it came with a little

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.809 
I do wish that it came with a little
tree<00:02:53.200> for<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.709> play<00:02:53.889> with<00:02:54.040> as<00:02:54.129> well<00:02:54.310> but

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
tree for you to play with as well but

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.009 
tree for you to play with as well but
just<00:02:55.030> by<00:02:55.150> yourself<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.569> think<00:02:55.750> it's<00:02:55.870> really

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
just by yourself I think it's really

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.050 
just by yourself I think it's really
good<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:56.530> it's<00:02:57.099> definitely<00:02:57.340> my<00:02:57.549> first<00:02:57.730> choice

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
good and it's definitely my first choice

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.699 
good and it's definitely my first choice
