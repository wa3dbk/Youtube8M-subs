00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.480 
follow up you know pictures a bit of
pudding<00:00:14.240> same<00:00:15.240> for<00:00:15.389> both<00:00:15.420> teams<00:00:15.809> but<00:00:16.310> we're<00:00:17.310> so

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
pudding same for both teams but we're so

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.980 
pudding same for both teams but we're so
good<00:00:17.730> when<00:00:17.910> we<00:00:18.029> get<00:00:18.210> into<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.570> attacking

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
good when we get into that attacking

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.990 
good when we get into that attacking
mode<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:20.010> know<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.279> levels<00:00:20.640> could<00:00:20.789> even

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
mode and you know that levels could even

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.400 
mode and you know that levels could even
first<00:00:21.270> off<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.779> thought<00:00:21.960> all<00:00:22.109> over<00:00:22.289> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
first off but I thought all over the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.370 
first off but I thought all over the
pitch<00:00:22.590> we<00:00:23.300> we<00:00:24.300> were<00:00:24.750> scored<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
pitch we we were scored one in the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.710 
pitch we we were scored one in the
second<00:00:25.800> half<00:00:25.920> la<00:00:26.070> thought<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.310> were<00:00:26.430> better

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
second half la thought we were better

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.790 
second half la thought we were better
but<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:27.869> were<00:00:27.990> better<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.439> second<00:00:28.769> half

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
but we were better in the second half

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040 
but we were better in the second half
than<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> first<00:00:29.429> time<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.539> if<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.720> sounds

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
than the first time and if it sounds

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.920 
than the first time and if it sounds
like<00:00:31.080> I'm<00:00:31.410> being<00:00:31.590> critical<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.780> understand<00:00:33.780> it

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
like I'm being critical I understand it

testing<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:39.390> know<00:03:39.540> but<00:03:39.870> we<00:03:40.050> have<00:03:40.140> standards

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
testing you know but we have standards

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.930 
testing you know but we have standards

behind<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:44.310> think<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.330> case<00:03:45.360> where<00:03:45.750> if

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
behind I think this is the case where if

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.210 
behind I think this is the case where if
player<00:03:47.460> isn't<00:03:48.170> acting<00:03:49.170> then<00:03:49.740> they<00:03:49.890> played

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
player isn't acting then they played

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.340 
player isn't acting then they played
behind<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.640> ready<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.940> leave<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:51.840> job<00:03:51.870> this
