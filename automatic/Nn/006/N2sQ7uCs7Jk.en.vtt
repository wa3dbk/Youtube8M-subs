00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
going to happen so the lower the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.110 
going to happen so the lower the
subscription<00:01:01.530> price<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.070> less<00:01:02.370> likely<00:01:02.699> this

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
subscription price the less likely this

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.750 
subscription price the less likely this
thing<00:01:03.390> will<00:01:03.600> work<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.589> $30<00:01:05.159> subscription

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
thing will work if it's $30 subscription

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.520 
thing will work if it's $30 subscription
price<00:01:05.939> which<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.450> publishers<00:01:06.990> will<00:01:07.140> embrace

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
price which the publishers will embrace

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.820 
price which the publishers will embrace

come out you know and you at least hear
what<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.619> they're<00:01:34.829> offering<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.790> we

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
what it is that they're offering so we

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.940 
what it is that they're offering so we
don't<00:01:36.360> even<00:01:36.509> know<00:01:36.750> what<00:01:37.079> Sony's<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.860> to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
don't even know what Sony's going to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.280 
don't even know what Sony's going to
offer<00:01:38.100> what<00:01:38.820> type<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.119> price<00:01:39.420> point<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.049> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
offer what type of price point it is and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.260 
offer what type of price point it is and
what<00:01:40.950> games<00:01:41.250> are<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.820> offered

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
what games are going to be offered

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.749 
what games are going to be offered
ultimately<00:01:42.899> whenever<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.890> comes<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.579> beta

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
ultimately whenever it comes out of beta

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.639 
ultimately whenever it comes out of beta
so<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.149> think<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.540> should<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:45.810> least<00:01:46.049> get<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.439> few

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
so I think we should at least get a few

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.950 
so I think we should at least get a few
more<00:01:46.829> details<00:01:47.040> before<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:48.180> decide<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.780> just

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
more details before we decide to just

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.590 
more details before we decide to just
torpedo<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.649> right<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.880> gate<00:01:51.119> you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
torpedo it right out of the gate you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.899 
torpedo it right out of the gate you
know<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.079> something<00:01:52.290> where<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.310> only

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
know if it's something where it's only

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.030 
know if it's something where it's only
like<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> yearly<00:01:54.570> subscription<00:01:55.290> model<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.799> would

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
like a yearly subscription model I would

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.219 
like a yearly subscription model I would
definitely<00:01:56.250> not<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:57.990> something

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
definitely not do it if it's something

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.719 
definitely not do it if it's something
where<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.530> could<00:01:58.680> pay<00:01:58.890> for<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.219> may<00:01:59.340> be<00:01:59.399> liked

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
where you could pay for it may be liked

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.999 
where you could pay for it may be liked
