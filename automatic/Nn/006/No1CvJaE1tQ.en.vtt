brush though you can import photos but
it<00:00:51.660> really<00:00:51.870> isn't<00:00:51.989> all<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.230> useful<00:00:52.590> photos

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
it really isn't all that useful photos

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.920 
it really isn't all that useful photos
sometimes<00:00:53.460> weren't<00:00:53.910> even<00:00:54.059> import<00:00:54.420> properly

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
sometimes weren't even import properly

sometimes weren't even import properly
you<00:00:55.260> could<00:00:55.469> take<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> picture<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> Vita's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
you could take a picture with the Vita's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.189 
you could take a picture with the Vita's
camera<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.449> sometimes<00:00:57.690> doesn't<00:00:58.170> work

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
camera but that sometimes doesn't work

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.020

either<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.800> real<00:00:59.250> nice<00:00:59.399> feature<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
either a real nice feature is the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.369 
either a real nice feature is the
ability<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.480> zoom<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.050> out<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.289> your

in to get more precise with your drawing
however<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.330> really<00:01:06.420> counterproductive

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
however it's really counterproductive

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.050 
however it's really counterproductive
that<00:01:07.380> there's<00:01:07.619> no<00:01:07.740> real<00:01:08.040> way<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.310> tell<00:01:08.729> where

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
that there's no real way to tell where

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
paint Park featured a handy magnifying

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.520 
paint Park featured a handy magnifying
glass<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.000> showed<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> exact<00:01:12.960> contact

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
glass that showed the exact contact

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.380 
glass that showed the exact contact
point<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.950> where<00:01:14.100> you're<00:01:14.220> drawing<00:01:14.460> zooming<00:01:15.299> in

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.789 
point of where you're drawing zooming in
doesn't<00:01:15.659> really<00:01:15.780> help<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.170> completely<00:01:16.650> as

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
doesn't really help this completely as

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.469 
doesn't really help this completely as
your<00:01:16.950> finger<00:01:17.250> or<00:01:17.369> stylus<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.939> still<00:01:18.210> getting

your finger or stylus is still getting
in<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> way<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.259> show<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.650> point<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.040> contact

in the way to show the point of contact
another<00:01:21.119> thing<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.450> bugged<00:01:21.689> me<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.049> that

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
another thing that bugged me is that

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.810 
another thing that bugged me is that
drawing<00:01:22.530> over<00:01:22.860> what<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.159> already<00:01:23.490> drew<00:01:23.700> in

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
drawing over what you already drew in

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.730 
drawing over what you already drew in
the<00:01:23.850> same<00:01:24.090> color<00:01:24.360> makes<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> color<00:01:25.229> darker

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the same color makes the color darker

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.859 
the same color makes the color darker
people<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.330> if<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.509> don't<00:01:27.720> you

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
people do like this but if you don't you

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.719 
people do like this but if you don't you
