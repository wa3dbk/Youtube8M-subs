cards<00:02:19.510> we<00:02:19.629> have<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.870> three<00:02:20.109> rank<00:02:20.379> of<00:02:20.530> cards

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890

lung<00:02:21.370> rank<00:02:21.969> up<00:02:22.120> limited<00:02:22.629> barians<00:02:23.260> for<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:23.709> I

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
lung rank up limited barians for so I

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.280 
lung rank up limited barians for so I
think<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.159> the<00:02:24.250> best<00:02:24.459> one<00:02:24.670> because<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.750> is

think this is the best one because it is

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.259 
think this is the best one because it is
restrictive<00:02:26.980> but<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.459> doesn't<00:02:27.939> matter<00:02:28.060> in

three-generation force just because the

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.099 
three-generation force just because the
ecology<00:03:22.030> concerns<00:03:22.389> with<00:03:22.569> this<00:03:22.659> are<00:03:22.840> just<00:03:22.989> too

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
ecology concerns with this are just too

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.280

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
good which I'll go on to in a minute

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.689

playing<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.379> three<00:03:26.530> forbidden<00:03:27.010> lands<00:03:27.190> in<00:03:27.489> one

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:27.699 
playing the three forbidden lands in one

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.069 
playing the three forbidden lands in one
of<00:03:27.790> my<00:03:27.849> previous<00:03:28.030> videos<00:03:28.209> someone<00:03:28.780> said<00:03:29.049> that

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
of my previous videos someone said that

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.409 
of my previous videos someone said that
they<00:03:29.799> don't<00:03:29.949> like<00:03:30.129> Lance<00:03:30.400> in<00:03:30.760> this<00:03:31.000> because<00:03:31.299> it

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
they don't like Lance in this because it

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.170 
they don't like Lance in this because it
goes<00:03:31.599> against<00:03:32.109> the<00:03:32.229> Utopia<00:03:32.680> cards<00:03:33.010> do<00:03:33.699> utopia

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
goes against the Utopia cards do utopia

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.539 
goes against the Utopia cards do utopia
quips<00:03:34.449> and<00:03:34.689> while<00:03:35.199> that's<00:03:35.379> kind<00:03:35.739> of<00:03:35.889> true<00:03:36.189> if

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
quips and while that's kind of true if

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.520 
quips and while that's kind of true if
you<00:03:36.909> don't<00:03:37.209> get<00:03:37.359> utopia<00:03:37.930> out<00:03:38.079> then<00:03:38.379> you're

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
you don't get utopia out then you're

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.679 
you don't get utopia out then you're
stuck<00:03:38.829> with<00:03:39.159> the<00:03:39.519> equips<00:03:40.150> in<00:03:40.299> hand<00:03:40.479> doing

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
stuck with the equips in hand doing

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.439 
stuck with the equips in hand doing
nothing<00:03:41.079> so<00:03:41.769> being<00:03:42.370> able<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.639> just<00:03:42.879> lance<00:03:43.120> and

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
nothing so being able to just lance and

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.210 
nothing so being able to just lance and
say<00:03:43.659> okay<00:03:43.900> we'll<00:03:44.049> all<00:03:44.079> equip<00:03:44.470> them<00:03:44.709> anyway<00:03:45.069> and

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
say okay we'll all equip them anyway and

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.219 
say okay we'll all equip them anyway and
then<00:03:45.609> once<00:03:46.030> a<00:03:46.150> tent<00:03:46.329> and<00:03:46.479> once<00:03:46.659> my<00:03:46.840> turn<00:03:46.989> ends

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:47.229 
then once a tent and once my turn ends

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.429 
then once a tent and once my turn ends
then<00:03:47.620> they<00:03:47.739> become<00:03:48.009> live<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.689> so<00:03:49.689> yeah<00:03:49.870> your

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 
then they become live and so yeah your

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.170 
then they become live and so yeah your
main<00:03:50.620> goal<00:03:50.859> is<00:03:51.040> to<00:03:51.159> get<00:03:51.280> utopia<00:03:51.790> there<00:03:52.000> to

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
main goal is to get utopia there to

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.030 
main goal is to get utopia there to
actually<00:03:52.599> or<00:03:52.870> your<00:03:53.079> earth<00:03:53.229> sees<00:03:53.530> in<00:03:53.680> general

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:56.409 
just to get them out and to accompany

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:57.749 
just to get them out and to accompany
that<00:03:56.590> as<00:03:56.769> well<00:03:56.889> we<00:03:57.009> have<00:03:57.129> two<00:03:57.220> three<00:03:57.430> mystical

Space<00:03:57.970> typhoon<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:59.310> final<00:04:00.310> two<00:04:00.489> spells<00:04:00.759> are

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
Space typhoon the final two spells are

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.460 
Space typhoon the final two spells are
two<00:04:01.239> instant<00:04:01.720> fusion<00:04:01.870> I've<00:04:02.049> dropped<00:04:02.169> it<00:04:02.319> down

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
two instant fusion I've dropped it down

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.039 
two instant fusion I've dropped it down
to<00:04:02.620> two<00:04:02.829> just<00:04:03.129> because<00:04:03.250> of<00:04:03.459> space<00:04:04.389> constraints

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
to two just because of space constraints

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.080 
to two just because of space constraints
but<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.620> card<00:04:05.829> is<00:04:05.949> still<00:04:06.099> amazing<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:06.849> it

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
but the card is still amazing so it

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.849 
but the card is still amazing so it
works<00:04:07.299> really<00:04:07.509> well<00:04:07.599> with<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.930> deck<00:04:08.109> then

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
works really well with the deck then

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.349 
works really well with the deck then
going<00:04:09.040> into<00:04:09.189> the<00:04:09.310> traps<00:04:09.609> we<00:04:09.939> have<00:04:10.060> three

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
going into the traps we have three

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.449 
going into the traps we have three
reckless<00:04:10.750> greed<00:04:10.900> we<00:04:11.349> want<00:04:11.650> speed<00:04:12.040> we<00:04:12.340> need

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
reckless greed we want speed we need

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.409 
reckless greed we want speed we need
consistency<00:04:13.269> so<00:04:13.780> therefore<00:04:14.169> we<00:04:14.439> play<00:04:14.680> three<00:04:15.040> I

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
consistency so therefore we play three I

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.490 
consistency so therefore we play three I
don't<00:04:16.419> play<00:04:16.539> obviously<00:04:16.720> Jiu<00:04:17.019> ality<00:04:17.349> for

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
don't play obviously Jiu ality for

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.990 
don't play obviously Jiu ality for
consistency<00:04:18.039> because<00:04:18.190> it<00:04:18.430> goes<00:04:18.579> against<00:04:18.880> the

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
consistency because it goes against the

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.750 
consistency because it goes against the
deck<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.479> still<00:04:20.440> played<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.829> three<00:04:21.070> XYZ<00:04:21.310> block

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
deck I still played the three XYZ block

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.760 
deck I still played the three XYZ block
and<00:04:22.029> it's<00:04:22.900> just<00:04:23.200> two<00:04:23.440> goods<00:04:23.770> like<00:04:24.190> it

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
and it's just two goods like it

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.129 
and it's just two goods like it
I<00:04:25.919> can't<00:04:26.460> rave<00:04:26.729> on<00:04:26.910> about<00:04:26.940> this<00:04:27.240> card<00:04:27.479> more<00:04:27.780> in

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
I can't rave on about this card more in

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.770 
I can't rave on about this card more in
this<00:04:28.500> deck<00:04:28.740> because<00:04:28.949> it<00:04:29.160> works<00:04:29.310> perfectly<00:04:29.819> if

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
this deck because it works perfectly if

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.809 
this deck because it works perfectly if
you<00:04:30.960> are<00:04:31.139> with<00:04:31.379> utopia<00:04:31.949> then<00:04:32.220> your<00:04:32.460> your

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:32.819 
you are with utopia then your your

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.760 
you are with utopia then your your
materials<00:04:33.330> don't<00:04:33.539> really<00:04:33.720> care<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.319> you<00:04:34.620> can

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
materials don't really care and you can

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.920 
materials don't really care and you can
kind<00:04:34.979> of<00:04:35.039> use<00:04:35.190> as<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.430> last-ditch<00:04:35.819> to<00:04:36.449> stop<00:04:36.780> your

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
kind of use as a last-ditch to stop your

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.089 
kind of use as a last-ditch to stop your
opponent<00:04:37.229> from<00:04:37.289> doing<00:04:37.560> something

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
opponent from doing something

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.580 
opponent from doing something
I<00:04:38.129> played<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.090> one<00:04:39.240> XYZ<00:04:39.509> Vail<00:04:39.960> are<00:04:40.229> bumped<00:04:40.500> it

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.649 
I played the one XYZ Vail are bumped it
down<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:40.919> one<00:04:41.159> just<00:04:41.460> because<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.729> can<00:04:42.060> search<00:04:42.360> it

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659 
down to one just because I can search it

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.740 
down to one just because I can search it
and<00:04:43.190> it's<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.310> really<00:04:44.669> nice<00:04:44.789> card<00:04:45.120> so<00:04:45.569> many

cannot be targeted by card effects like
it's<00:04:57.539> just<00:04:57.720> so<00:04:57.870> good<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.440> then<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:58.830> final<00:04:59.159> one

one Leo arms reason I play this is

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.680 
one Leo arms reason I play this is
because<00:05:11.069> I<00:05:11.099> have<00:05:11.550> star<00:05:11.909> drawing<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:12.479> I<00:05:12.539> also

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
have instant fusion so technically I can

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.790 
have instant fusion so technically I can
go<00:05:15.030> into<00:05:15.180> it<00:05:15.419> just<00:05:15.449> to<00:05:15.690> search<00:05:15.900> those<00:05:16.229> equips
