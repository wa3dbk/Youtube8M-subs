Welcome to Point TV. Today we're 
walking in Tartu with the Pentax Q. 

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:18.347
A couple of videos back we promised 
to take some images with it.

00:00:19.693 --> 00:00:27.770
Pentax includes a standard lens with this camera 
which has 1.9 aperture, multi-coatings and

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:36.846
internal focussing. The thing I like the  most 
about this lens is the superfast autofocus.

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:47.144
I can take quick snapshots without worrying
and it only takes a quarter of a second to focus.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:52.550
Pentax Q is a charming little camera because
it has interchangeable lenses. This means

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:58.472
that I can use a tele lens if this prime
lens is not enough.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:04.762
I had it somewhere in my pockets... here it is!

00:01:13.847 --> 00:01:15.298
And done.

00:01:16.016 --> 00:01:20.969
I put on the tele lens to shoot this cafe
over there. I wanted a composition with colourful

00:01:21.504 --> 00:01:28.255
twigs and heaps of leaves to frame the
image so to speak.

00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:35.472
In addition this camera has a quick dial to
select what I want.

00:01:35.953 --> 00:01:45.065
Now I want a square image format. This lens
is a manual focus lens.

00:01:45.548 --> 00:02:00.905
I press the OK button to focus. Let's include
this tree in the image. Here you have it.

00:02:06.514 --> 00:02:10.616
Now you see it, now you don't. Now  you see it...

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:19.252
My hands are not much of a stabilizers.

00:02:21.577 --> 00:02:27.968
Pentax Q gives you full manual control
just like SLR cameras. In the Manual mode

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:33.203
you can change ISO and shutter speed
to suit your needs. You can use faster

00:02:33.668 --> 00:02:38.450
shutter speeds to capture children playing with
leaves but there are no children here.

00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:40.765
Lauri, throw some leaves.

00:02:44.326 --> 00:02:46.943
Yes, a nice image.

00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:52.343
Maybe I already said that but I like the
compactness of the Pentax Q.

00:02:53.564 --> 00:02:57.125
This is probably what I like the
most about this camera.

00:03:07.668 --> 00:03:19.451
Some time ago Ardo used the Tamron 10-24mm lens
to capture this church in one frame.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:27.251
I can do the same. Pentax Q has a fish-eye lens
for this purpose.

00:03:34.954 --> 00:03:43.917
Ardo succeeded in fitting this church in one frame.
I believe I can do the same from not so far.

00:03:56.371 --> 00:04:02.105
This one is a manual focus lens as well but
focussing is easy because the camera enlarges

00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:09.232
the central part of the image. Wow, I can't fit it
from that close. Have to take a step backwards.

00:04:27.031 --> 00:04:39.163
Let's capture the presidential car with the fish-eye
 so that the security guys won't even notice.

00:05:07.405 --> 00:05:14.416
There is a load of digital filters in the Pentax Q
which enable you to be creative.

00:05:14.933 --> 00:05:19.256
All those effects can be assigned to the quick dial.

00:05:20.414 --> 00:05:25.037
The dot on this dial has no effect and numbered
positions 1 to 4 can have effects assigned.

00:05:54.355 --> 00:05:58.278
When Pentax Q was announced, there was much picking
at its' small sensor.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:06.568
The sensor size is similar to compact cameras
but I must say, that Pentax Q is not

00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:11.403
really a hybrid camera - it is a compact camera
with interchangeable lenses.

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:18.006
In this class it's totally unique. There are no
other cameras to compete with.

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:21.084
If you need Pentax Q, you don't need a hybrid.
