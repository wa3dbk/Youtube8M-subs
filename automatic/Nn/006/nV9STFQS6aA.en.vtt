00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.290
 and finish eating the girlfriends kisses in 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:09.509
 the shortest possible time is not 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.509
 allowed to use hands only 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:17.200
 constipated we go with that we owe the rest 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.810
 and just in case the girl kiss that 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.940
 choose both have to eat is not that 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.010
 one start with one and the other with the other 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.200
 not the idea is that one by one both 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.860
 they begin to eat the kisses we give to both 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.660
 the same both the same is to say you 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.000
 they start here they both have to 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.450
 eat this kiss we see half the half 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.450
 each 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.660
 Good night as he wants to eat it 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.660
 yes alone 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.950
 the order is a rule the two have to 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:00.610
 eat this finish this without your hands 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.140
 go to the next the two ok if not from 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.879
 otherwise it would not be in pairs them 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.439
 we will put each one on his side to see 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.120
 understood all Macarena have understood 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.010
 why 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.820
 but day to see that they do not understand has been 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.820
 conversed with panthers 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:31.330
 in an exact way and 321 hands combat 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.550
 we can not use auto hands 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.230
 use your hands as a miss 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.230
 they can not use their hands 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
 Macarena 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.450
 8 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.679
 I do not want Antonio who helped me 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.930
 overcome 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.709
 after six months they have been quite fast 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.709
 to be unfinished 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.810
 because it comes first 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.000
 then good 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:39.620
 point for the couple consisting of 8 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.620
 pretty fast and here is a problem 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.000
 unfortunately current and na does not have to be 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.750
 the competition with me because it says that 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.560
 he can not do it for three problems 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.569
 journalist what's happening what happened 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.500
 it's not that I do not want to compete 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.500
 with Juan Pablo 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.239
 please 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.239
 excuse me 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.070
 well I have a very severe husband and it would be 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.410
 my last in combat so that's why this 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.480
 is a commercial cut is minimal comma 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.480
 because combat is here and has come
