00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.189
 despite the fact that line 12 of the metro of the 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.480
 Mexico City has been investing in 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.850
 largest public works in america 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.709
 latina ' less than three months from 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.299
 inauguration still does not comply with the 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.039
 necessary infrastructure to give 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.410
 service for people with disabilities 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.859
 according to the complaint that the deputy of the 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.269
 pan pri if the legislator will see it like this 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.220
 He made a tour with means of 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.810
 communication to demonstrate that the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.880
 facilities do not comply with 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.009
 accessibility needs for 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.840
 users who use wheelchairs will 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.730
 It is very complicated to use the subway 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.309
 but the people who have a 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.440
 permanent disability face 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.899
 all these limitations so 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.989
 daily and I think it must be a policy 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.379
 public government in the city 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.379
 guarantee accessibility 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.440
 in areas of line 12 the stairs 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.480
 installed electric to raise a 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.190
 person in a wheelchair still not 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.660
 are ready while some 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.160
 workers say that the time of 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.320
 Response to help them change 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.600
 address is 2 minutes the boss of 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.580
 11th street station ensured that still 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.590
 they do not give them the keys to use 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.850
 this mechanism so if there was not 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.640
 cameras when is the reaction time 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.970
 to help a person 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.260
 a specific time 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.260
 with two more months 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:27.360
 they have informed us that they have made caves 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.360
 but this one 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.960
 in the same way some of the 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.610
 stations on line 2 are not 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.869
 adapted to be used by 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.869
 elderly people 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.320
 the legislators of the federal district 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.730
 they exhorted the metro authorities to 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.450
 meet the requirements in 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.450
