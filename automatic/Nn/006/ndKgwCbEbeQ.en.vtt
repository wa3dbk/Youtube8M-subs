00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello and singing for a little info 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.060
 video about simcity my twitter 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.120
 they already have follower follower 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.780
 how I am with 70 since yesterday 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.610
 Eve 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.320
 Now it's time for me to be with you 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.519
 here on youtube times in me with 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.440
 a short video 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.630
 I agree that I have one 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.330
 checklist makes it looks like this or 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.470
 no matter how well I like it and 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.029
 then from the checklist 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.840
 decide whether I was a let's play-making 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.960
 now looks like it's feared 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.000
 the game just does not run well 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.130
 that's because of it all 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.590
 do not you know one for sin city one 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.110
 permanent internet connection needs 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.969
 even if you are a single player 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.040
 plays and the consequence of it is 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.620
 of course that now on the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.590
 release-tag that started at 0 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.879
 clock 1 everyone wants to play and the server 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.160
 under the load accordingly 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.809
 collapse us release was 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.690
 The day before yesterday there was the same debacle 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.390
 and at the moment it does not run the world 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.829
 reasonable so I have everything possible 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.890
 to get error messages already 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.659
 Sometimes you can even at the lancia 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.530
 no server select partially comes 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.600
 into the game 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.490
 no his cities do not load partially 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.950
 you can not create new cities 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.070
 partly if you do it someday 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.170
 team after hours of waiting and 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.909
 Dozens try on a city too 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.009
 It can quite happen that 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.200
 the city is not saved because 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.729
 it not only needs a 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.590
 permanent internet connection around 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.710
 to play singleplayer too 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.450
 cities are stored on the server and 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.450
 not locally on the hard drive there is 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.170
 So do not chance the game offline too 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.850
 play 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.259
 Of course, many have said well now 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.329
 is clear 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.710
 In an online game you have to do that 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.439
 expect that in the release days 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.820
 problem prevails that I conditionally 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.280
 First of all, it is not true 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.840
 necessarily said that this must be so 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.990
 and second, he is simply not 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.210
 online games city ​​is a game that can 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.820
 I play singleplayer without me 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.020
 have something to do with others and be there 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.700
 no permanent internet connection 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.369
 needed unless someone does as well and and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.030
 maxis and programmed play by house 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.340
 from around a concept that just 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.890
 the whole condition that you are permanent 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.930
 must be online and that will be as 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.390
 feature sold though it was just 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.970
 just a great stop 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.950
 copy protection measure is and in consequence 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.489
 of course many possibilities of course 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.290
 opens the game for and maxis 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.000
 continue to control and to 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.500
 market and I say one time 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.890
 to exploit a bit 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.980
 So to summarize the moment 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.370
 I can not recommend the game too 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.739
 buy simply because of the reason 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.900
 It is guaranteed that the game will work 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.000
 there is a good chance on it 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.100
 The next day it calms down 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.360
 but is not guaranteed at the moment 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.310
 nobody can guarantee it 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.910
 there are far too many here 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.180
 problems to say in the beginning yes that 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.170
 game you can get and if it is 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.269
 good or not 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.700
 the 12 hours I played now 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.019
 I have the beta me though 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.780
 looked at but now the full version 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.640
 unfortunately only very briefly I can 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.739
 I simply do not want to 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.860
 I want to say a little bit 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.810
 bring in and yes let's see when that 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.579
 maybe works today maybe 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.380
 tomorrow maybe only in a week 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.890
 but I want to play just before 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.600
 then she will get a checklist 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.130
 and then we'll see if you can let it 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.030
 play but after the current 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.570
 state of things 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.720
 with such measures as always on the 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.870
 in and similar I would have to say 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.510
 Everyone thinks very well whether he 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.810
 in the future by that this game 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.459
 buys it continues to promote such 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.370
 measures taken by manufacturers 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.109
 will be for us as consumers only 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.480
 disadvantages and only 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.430
 restrictions or 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.220
 but say no i do not buy and show 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.620
 So I would like to have it differently 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.600
 want in a single player title 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.329
 I can and do play offline 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.209
 forced to be constantly on the internet too 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.920
 his and thus well not only anyway 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.140
 the opportunity to give me perfect too 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.829
 but also the game of 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.810
 front to back yes after all rules of 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.710
 art to market, and so to speak 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.199
 expand 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.539
 So I am in the sense 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:31.479
 dissatisfied definitely with the start because 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:35.169
 it just double proves that always 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:37.419
 on drm is a huge problem and easy 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.610
 well not really reasonable 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.080
 works and as I said only 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.110
 disadvantages and none 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.660
 single advantage and for that 60 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.240
 have put euro for the game well 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.759
 but as I already that that fits 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.130
 and that not only of me higher 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.530
 yes it was unexpected and we stop that 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.690
 Capacities on because it was clear to everyone 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.940
 that it will not work and 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.880
 Just shows to just prove it 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.320
 yes that the situation is problematic and 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.099
 that in the future if you have nothing 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.259
 do it 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.389
 only going to get worse then 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.610
 In the sense I prefer everything dear 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:16.349
 all good until the next time shooting 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.349
 sharp you think and dad
