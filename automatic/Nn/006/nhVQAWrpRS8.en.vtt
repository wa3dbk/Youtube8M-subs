00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
start with enough sustains from his his

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.950 
start with enough sustains from his his
passive<00:01:26.100> gives<00:01:26.700> him<00:01:26.880> twenty<00:01:27.420> percent<00:01:27.630> spell

to come out to the left to the left

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.449 
to come out to the left to the left
everybody<00:03:42.350> start<00:03:43.350> binding<00:03:43.530> probably<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.340> the

everybody start binding probably to the
right<00:03:44.670> though<00:03:44.940> when<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.299> comes<00:03:45.510> out<00:03:45.660> we'll<00:03:45.900> see

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
right though when it comes out we'll see

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.949 
right though when it comes out we'll see

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
where pure finds himself on the outside

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.140 
where pure finds himself on the outside
of<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.139> minion<00:03:49.380> wave

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.600 
of the minion wave
is<00:03:50.209> consistently<00:03:50.780> pooling<00:03:51.260> intense<00:03:52.069> micro

ability<00:03:53.239> is<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:54.430> mechanics<00:03:55.430> on<00:03:55.549> those

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
ability is the mechanics on those

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.800 
ability is the mechanics on those
tormented<00:03:57.319> soils<00:03:58.180> likes<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.420> which<00:03:59.569> the<00:03:59.780> world

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
tormented soils likes of which the world

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.259 
tormented soils likes of which the world
has<00:04:00.200> never<00:04:00.349> seen<00:04:00.530> but<00:04:00.950> as<00:04:01.370> for<00:04:01.670> trace<00:04:01.939> though

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
has never seen but as for trace though

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.819 
has never seen but as for trace though
right<00:04:02.510> now<00:04:02.659> he<00:04:02.720> just<00:04:03.049> has<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.290> make<00:04:03.470> sure<00:04:03.709> that

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
right now he just has to make sure that

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.710 
right now he just has to make sure that
he<00:04:03.890> puts<00:04:04.099> himself<00:04:04.250> in<00:04:04.519> a<00:04:04.610> good<00:04:04.790> enough<00:04:05.030> spot<00:04:05.360> as

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
he puts himself in a good enough spot as

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.420 
he puts himself in a good enough spot as
far<00:04:05.959> as<00:04:06.079> the<00:04:06.170> wave<00:04:06.319> positioning<00:04:06.890> is<00:04:06.980> concerned

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
far as the wave positioning is concerned

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.569 
far as the wave positioning is concerned
so<00:04:08.150> you<00:04:08.390> can<00:04:08.599> get<00:04:09.019> a<00:04:09.079> a<00:04:09.560> positioning<00:04:10.280> advantage

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
so you can get a a positioning advantage

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.160 
so you can get a a positioning advantage
in<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:10.879> lane<00:04:11.030> that'll<00:04:11.390> punish<00:04:11.720> pier<00:04:11.989> for

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
in the lane that'll punish pier for

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.170 
in the lane that'll punish pier for
going<00:04:12.349> back<00:04:12.470> to<00:04:12.650> base<00:04:12.769> earlier<00:04:13.220> it's<00:04:13.970> kind<00:04:14.150> of

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
going back to base earlier it's kind of

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.120 
going back to base earlier it's kind of
a<00:04:14.239> mouthful<00:04:14.569> to<00:04:14.629> say<00:04:14.720> let's<00:04:15.079> get<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.319> idea<00:04:15.590> if

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
a mouthful to say let's get the idea if

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.400 
a mouthful to say let's get the idea if
here<00:04:16.579> is<00:04:16.759> first<00:04:17.090> is<00:04:17.389> forced<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:17.989> go<00:04:18.079> back<00:04:18.109> to

going to hit his chart while he's gone

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.409 
going to hit his chart while he's gone
it's<00:04:22.039> gonna<00:04:22.160> lose<00:04:22.370> a<00:04:22.490> couple<00:04:22.669> of<00:04:22.850> minions<00:04:23.150> and

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
it's gonna lose a couple of minions and

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.510 
it's gonna lose a couple of minions and
