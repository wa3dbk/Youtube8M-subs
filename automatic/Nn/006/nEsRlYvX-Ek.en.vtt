00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
in college and got I was part of the

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.220 
in college and got I was part of the
club's<00:02:56.250> on<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.459> draft<00:02:56.849> I'm<00:02:57.239> going<00:02:57.689> to<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.930> little

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
club's on a draft I'm going to a little

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.319 
club's on a draft I'm going to a little
mini<00:02:58.409> camp<00:02:58.650> they<00:02:58.799> have<00:02:58.980> up<00:02:59.250> in<00:02:59.489> Philadelphia

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
mini camp they have up in Philadelphia

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.080 
mini camp they have up in Philadelphia
and<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.200> think<00:03:01.409> there<00:03:01.530> was<00:03:01.620> like<00:03:01.680> 25<00:03:02.340> hopefuls

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
and I think there was like 25 hopefuls

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.199 
and I think there was like 25 hopefuls
there<00:03:03.569> that<00:03:03.870> they<00:03:04.019> invited<00:03:05.000> because<00:03:06.000> they

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
there that they invited because they

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.300 
there that they invited because they
picked<00:03:06.450> me<00:03:06.540> out<00:03:06.599> of<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:07.439> I<00:03:07.799> think<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.220> if

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
picked me out of that I think that if

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.179 
picked me out of that I think that if
they<00:03:08.459> drafted<00:03:08.879> 3<00:03:09.720> or<00:03:09.810> 4<00:03:10.019> people<00:03:10.409> to<00:03:10.650> cover<00:03:10.829> so

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
they drafted 3 or 4 people to cover so

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.170 
they drafted 3 or 4 people to cover so
it<00:03:11.519> was<00:03:11.670> pretty<00:03:11.849> hard<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.209> get<00:03:12.329> in<00:03:14.000> it's<00:03:15.000> pretty
