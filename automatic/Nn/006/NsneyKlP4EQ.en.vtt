00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.160
 By entering 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.160
 I was really surprised 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:07.230
 How is she looking for 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:10.569
 I'm really glad I was able to put it in 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.319
 Speaking of the previous opening 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:21.000
 Speaking of the opening that goes, but it is a photo collection 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:24.290
 The other really that the same or another at all in Naku' Kimara is fundamental 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.030
 So I already gave up 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.120
 Two of this is 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:34.069
 I was really happy to have two dogs 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:37.430
 Drospla 's sticker 's handle this is a sign here and it's not so bad 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.610
 I was so happy because I liked Shu- chan . 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:47.030
 Deura is- 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:48.540
 It's like this is a color that is really reflective, but it's like this 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.250
 It is cool 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.220

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.440
 That's right 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.500
 Shi-chan 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.720
 The popularity of is amazing 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.470
 Those who are asking for this also saw it on twitter 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.670
 It is also exchange 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:17.860
 I was really happy because I thought it was a difficult kanji 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:23.200
 A little bit of that I am 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.590
 It was because I thought a little Toka Na Did me put bought smartphone case of Sea-chan 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.430
 But the 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.830
 I think it is different 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.390
 in this case 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.390
 I am really grateful to those who put in a truly thankful support 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.920
 dvd is 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.819
 I was in the case like this 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.260
 There is a label 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.260
 There is no doubt that there is 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.960
 A little because there is very strong reflection of Bukkake chestnut people in Nji 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.230
 Ah 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.569
 But once 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.980
 When 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:07.270
 The jacket looks like this The jacket on tv looks like this 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.920
 Wolf's Intruding Key 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.960
 It feels like 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.160
 Even week-chan is yes because one closest behind 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.560
 Yes Yes I'd not seen at all 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:35.680
 I would like to see it with Vovrey 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:38.949
 Because I have an anu, if only an antcha 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:44.830
 In the section I think I'm glad 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:50.689
 Because I showed the cover a while ago , I would like to go from here 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:57.540

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:21.480
 Even though my hair is very cute, it is my favorite bright hair color 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:24.720
 Insanely cute and crazy 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:29.040
 In particular, the knee of the White Day Another really 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.740
 That I'd think it was Yabaka' taking the centralization 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.380
 Shi-chan Ano 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:39.790
 Oh dear 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:45.850
 I wonder if I took it off 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:47.300
 The day before also because it was wearing clothes that are a little transparent thought I what Kaonaka not 10/10 car Tan 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:52.490
 but 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:54.350
 I was really surprised when I saw it and I was really broken. 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.650
 Is 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:03.090

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:07.020

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:10.020

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.100
 I'll say I'll be waiting because I'll do my best 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:17.050

 Words like saying thank you to 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:27.409
 I was leaving it for a while, but then it wasn't that time to go there 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:32.220
 that 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:37.110
 I was so surprised that I was so excited. 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:45.259
 Is another great at something like that when things so amazing cute face 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:49.050
 It was a feeling that I could see it many times overwhelmingly even though I could not think of it as a reality that I can not believe 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:53.430
 So I'm fine Shi-chan is that 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:55.569
 If you think your belly is cute even if it becomes Ponyo 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:07:01.659
 Well rather towards over there 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:07:07.419

 Maybe 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:20.569
 I think it's easy to get fat 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:23.200
 That the Sea-chan say train until there is 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:24.210

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.580
 Then 

00:07:52.409 --> 00:08:02.050
 It is a result of opening, but what time is random underlayment 

00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:05.770
