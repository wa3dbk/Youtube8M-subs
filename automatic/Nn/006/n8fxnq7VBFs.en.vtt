00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
turn this into a block so if your editor

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.530 
turn this into a block so if your editor
actually<00:03:43.860> text<00:03:44.280> by<00:03:44.490> a<00:03:44.520> little<00:03:44.970> bit<00:03:45.060> block<00:03:47.540> okay

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
actually text by a little bit block okay
