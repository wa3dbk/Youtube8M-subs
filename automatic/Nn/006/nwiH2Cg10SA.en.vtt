you<00:02:09.349> wouldn't<00:02:09.590> typically<00:02:10.099> do<00:02:10.369> it's<00:02:10.580> a

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
you wouldn't typically do it's a

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.660 
you wouldn't typically do it's a

mid-mounted v12 six six litre but it's

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.400 
mid-mounted v12 six six litre but it's
turbocharged<00:02:14.450> again

turbocharged again

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.230 
turbocharged again
just<00:02:16.250> because<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.700> power<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.180> the

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
just because of the power and the

just because of the power and the

delivery of power that we wanted we've

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
done a 50:50 weight distribution and

weight bias if you like to the car as

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
well and a really beautiful engine

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.710 
well and a really beautiful engine
layout<00:02:27.470> also<00:02:27.770> in<00:02:28.520> terms<00:02:28.820> of<00:02:29.090> how<00:02:29.660> the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
brake horsepower and that would give us

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.690

the<00:03:07.790> car<00:03:07.970> kind<00:03:08.240> of<00:03:08.300> picks<00:03:08.540> off<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.020> it's<00:03:09.800> if

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
the car kind of picks off and it's if

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.800 
the car kind of picks off and it's if
you<00:03:10.370> don't<00:03:10.550> know<00:03:10.610> how<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.820> break<00:03:11.300> early<00:03:11.630> enough

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
you don't know how to break early enough

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.990 
you don't know how to break early enough
you'll<00:03:12.050> be<00:03:12.250> hitting<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.400> walls<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:13.820> stuff

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
you'll be hitting the walls and stuff

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.760 
you'll be hitting the walls and stuff
but<00:03:14.210> then<00:03:14.360> one<00:03:14.660> if<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:15.110> know<00:03:15.290> if<00:03:15.530> you<00:03:15.620> know

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
but then one if you know if you know

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.290 
but then one if you know if you know
what<00:03:15.920> you're<00:03:16.070> doing<00:03:16.250> in<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.430> game<00:03:16.460> it's<00:03:16.880> it's

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
what you're doing in the game it's it's

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.449 
what you're doing in the game it's it's
a<00:03:17.420> joy<00:03:17.600> to<00:03:17.780> drive<00:03:17.930> it<00:03:18.590> kind<00:03:18.800> of<00:03:18.860> reminds<00:03:19.190> me<00:03:19.310> on

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
a joy to drive it kind of reminds me on

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.330 
a joy to drive it kind of reminds me on
when<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.390> formula<00:03:21.230> cars<00:03:21.650> started<00:03:22.070> appearing

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
when the formula cars started appearing

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.430 
when the formula cars started appearing
in<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.640> game<00:03:22.850> first<00:03:23.240> when<00:03:23.660> I<00:03:23.750> had<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.050> that

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
in the game first when I had to that

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.790 
in the game first when I had to that
experience<00:03:24.830> that<00:03:24.890> rush<00:03:25.330> through<00:03:26.330> your<00:03:26.480> body

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
experience that rush through your body

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.900 
experience that rush through your body
excitement<00:03:27.800> I<00:03:27.950> kind<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.370> feel<00:03:28.550> that<00:03:28.580> when<00:03:28.880> I

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
excitement I kind of feel that when I

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.460 
excitement I kind of feel that when I
went<00:03:29.360> when<00:03:29.570> I<00:03:29.600> drive<00:03:29.840> this<00:03:29.959> car<00:03:30.170> in<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.350> game

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
went when I drive this car in the game

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.460 
went when I drive this car in the game
the<00:03:30.920> wheels<00:03:31.190> themselves<00:03:31.520> again<00:03:32.270> the<00:03:33.050> faster

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
the wheels themselves again the faster

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.680 
the wheels themselves again the faster
you<00:03:33.560> go<00:03:33.770> then<00:03:34.160> what<00:03:34.940> you<00:03:35.090> really<00:03:35.300> need<00:03:35.570> from

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
you go then what you really need from

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.750 
you go then what you really need from
the<00:03:35.810> wheel<00:03:35.990> is<00:03:36.140> a<00:03:36.170> flat<00:03:36.440> disc<00:03:36.740> but<00:03:37.400> obviously

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
the wheel is a flat disc but obviously

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.370 
the wheel is a flat disc but obviously
when<00:03:37.910> you're<00:03:38.060> driving<00:03:38.450> slowly<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.170> going

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
when you're driving slowly and going

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.949 
when you're driving slowly and going
through<00:03:39.590> a<00:03:39.620> slow<00:03:39.980> cornering<00:03:40.790> system<00:03:41.300> you<00:03:41.810> need

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
through a slow cornering system you need

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.229 
through a slow cornering system you need
to<00:03:42.140> cool<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.920> brakes<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.370> need<00:03:43.550> to<00:03:43.670> feed<00:03:43.970> air

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
to cool the brakes I need to feed air

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.300 
to cool the brakes I need to feed air
through<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.780> wheels<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.170> brakes<00:03:45.500> so<00:03:46.190> we

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
through the wheels to the brakes so we

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.240 
through the wheels to the brakes so we
have<00:03:46.459> this<00:03:46.610> unusual<00:03:46.959> turbine<00:03:47.980> system<00:03:48.980> whereby

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
have this unusual turbine system whereby

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.000 
have this unusual turbine system whereby
at<00:03:49.760> slow<00:03:50.090> speeds<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.660> turbines<00:03:51.110> open<00:03:51.590> to<00:03:51.800> suck

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
at slow speeds the turbines open to suck

which<00:04:13.910> is<00:04:14.150> really<00:04:14.630> represented<00:04:15.260> of<00:04:15.380> Aston

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.720 
Martin but what we've done is
deconstruct<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.709> light<00:04:18.919> if<00:04:19.160> you<00:04:19.310> like<00:04:19.489> and

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
deconstruct the light if you like and

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.480 
deconstruct the light if you like and
there<00:04:20.270> are<00:04:20.390> tiny<00:04:20.660> light<00:04:21.080> pipes<00:04:21.470> which<00:04:22.310> would

normally be hidden by a lens which
actually<00:04:24.740> form<00:04:25.039> the<00:04:25.310> light<00:04:25.520> so<00:04:25.760> they're<00:04:25.910> like

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
actually form the light so they're like

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.879 
actually form the light so they're like
at<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.390> end<00:04:26.510> of<00:04:26.750> these<00:04:26.870> thin

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
look at the front of the car it's based

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.260 
look at the front of the car it's based
around<00:04:39.379> what<00:04:39.620> we<00:04:39.740> will<00:04:39.889> call<00:04:40.099> our<00:04:40.280> s<00:04:40.520> curvature

around what we will call our s curvature

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.659 
around what we will call our s curvature
but<00:04:41.810> that<00:04:41.930> s<00:04:42.110> curvature<00:04:42.740> is<00:04:42.919> generating<00:04:43.490> all

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
but that s curvature is generating all

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.520 
but that s curvature is generating all

the form and the language at the front
of<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.740> car<00:04:45.979> but<00:04:46.580> it's<00:04:46.669> there<00:04:46.819> not<00:04:47.060> just<00:04:47.419> for

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
of the car but it's there not just for

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.350 
of the car but it's there not just for
the<00:04:47.659> looks<00:04:47.870> it's<00:04:48.199> also<00:04:48.409> there<00:04:48.740> for

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
the looks it's also there for

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.939 
the looks it's also there for
aerodynamics<00:04:50.360> and<00:04:50.509> it's<00:04:50.659> there<00:04:50.870> to<00:04:51.080> cool<00:04:51.680> the

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
aerodynamics and it's there to cool the

aerodynamics and it's there to cool the
radiator<00:04:52.430> packs<00:04:52.819> as<00:04:53.030> well<00:04:53.060> so<00:04:53.419> that<00:04:53.569> the<00:04:54.110> mouth

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:54.379

radiator packs as well so that the mouth
is<00:04:54.740> actually<00:04:55.120> exactly<00:04:56.120> right<00:04:56.599> in<00:04:56.840> terms<00:04:57.020> of

haunches and the shoulder which is
typically<00:05:17.659> a<00:05:17.779> sonata<00:05:18.259> but<00:05:18.889> because<00:05:19.669> it's

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
typically a sonata but because it's

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.179 
typically a sonata but because it's
mid-engine<00:05:20.689> typically<00:05:21.560> you<00:05:21.620> need<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:21.800> massive

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:22.189 
mid-engine typically you need a massive

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.540 
mid-engine typically you need a massive
aperture<00:05:22.909> or<00:05:23.120> Inlet<00:05:23.779> intake<00:05:24.710> to<00:05:24.979> cool<00:05:25.279> the

engine<00:05:25.669> but<00:05:26.659> we've<00:05:26.840> hidden<00:05:27.110> all<00:05:27.349> of<00:05:27.529> that

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
engine but we've hidden all of that

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.040

underneath<00:05:28.129> these<00:05:28.460> flying<00:05:28.819> buttresses<00:05:29.449> so<00:05:29.930> it

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
underneath these flying buttresses so it

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.230 
underneath these flying buttresses so it
