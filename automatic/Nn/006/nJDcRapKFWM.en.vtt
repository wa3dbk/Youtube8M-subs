that's what's on right now my lip liner
isn't<00:03:48.530> real<00:03:48.709> defined<00:03:49.130> because<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:49.459> had<00:03:49.610> been

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760

faded but i think i'll add a little bit
more<00:03:52.160> lip<00:03:52.400> liner<00:03:52.640> because<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.209> is<00:03:53.360> a<00:03:53.390> lighter

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959
