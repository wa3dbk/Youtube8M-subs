00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
let's put this on one side and let's

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.510 
let's put this on one side and let's
keep<00:01:16.040> diving<00:01:17.020> so<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.170> first<00:01:18.440> thing<00:01:18.620> is<00:01:19.070> the

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
keep diving so the first thing is the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.720 
keep diving so the first thing is the
camera<00:01:20.510> strap<00:01:20.780> which<00:01:21.260> is<00:01:21.470> basically<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.430> same

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
camera strap which is basically the same

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.120 
camera strap which is basically the same
version<00:01:23.480> as<00:01:24.020> other<00:01:24.890> alpha<00:01:25.760> cameras

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
version as other alpha cameras

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.040 
version as other alpha cameras
unfortunately<00:01:28.130> it's<00:01:28.220> not<00:01:28.750> branded<00:01:29.750> in<00:01:29.900> any

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
unfortunately it's not branded in any

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.560 
unfortunately it's not branded in any
way<00:01:30.290> to<00:01:31.130> specific<00:01:31.640> model<00:01:32.320> and<00:01:34.570> underneath

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
way to specific model and underneath

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.370 
way to specific model and underneath
there<00:01:36.350> is<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.620> first<00:01:36.860> nice<00:01:37.220> surprise<00:01:38.380> which

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
there is the first nice surprise which

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.430 
there is the first nice surprise which
is<00:01:39.650> not<00:01:40.400> just<00:01:40.850> one<00:01:41.090> but<00:01:42.250> two<00:01:43.250> batteries<00:01:44.170> in<00:01:45.170> the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
is not just one but two batteries in the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.270 
is not just one but two batteries in the
same<00:01:45.710> way<00:01:45.920> as<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.250> Alpha<00:01:47.030> 7s<00:01:47.780> came<00:01:48.740> with<00:01:49.100> two

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
same way as the Alpha 7s came with two

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.320 
same way as the Alpha 7s came with two
batteries<00:01:49.690> so<00:01:50.690> this<00:01:50.900> is<00:01:50.930> probably<00:01:52.330> something

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
batteries so this is probably something

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.899 
batteries so this is probably something
to<00:01:53.570> do<00:01:53.810> with<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.110> fact<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:55.580> video

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
to do with the fact that the video

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.790 
to do with the fact that the video
recording<00:01:56.390> for<00:01:57.050> this<00:01:57.230> camera<00:01:57.440> is<00:01:57.590> quite

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
recording for this camera is quite

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.649 
recording for this camera is quite
important<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.490> as<00:01:59.000> we<00:01:59.150> know<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.450> video

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
important and as we know the video

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.680 
important and as we know the video
recording<00:02:00.080> eats<00:02:00.729> battery<00:02:01.729> for<00:02:01.909> breakfast<00:02:02.330> so

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
recording eats battery for breakfast so

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
recording eats battery for breakfast so
it's<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.470> very<00:02:03.500> good<00:02:03.770> thing<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.159> have<00:02:04.400> to<00:02:05.710> there

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
it's a very good thing to have to there

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.080 
it's a very good thing to have to there
is<00:02:06.830> also<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:08.709> a/c<00:02:09.709> adapter<00:02:09.739> so<00:02:10.580> if<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:10.909> want

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
is also the a/c adapter so if you want

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.800 
is also the a/c adapter so if you want
to<00:02:11.209> power<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.810> camera<00:02:12.200> from<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.730> mains

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
to power the camera from the mains

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.540 
to power the camera from the mains
which<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.349> also<00:02:16.680> good<00:02:17.300> I'm<00:02:19.040> pretty<00:02:20.040> sure<00:02:20.280> but<00:02:20.520> I

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
which is also good I'm pretty sure but I

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.510 
which is also good I'm pretty sure but I
have<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.880> verify<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.250> first

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
have to verify that this is the first

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.979 
have to verify that this is the first
alpha<00:02:24.000> camera<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.599> can<00:02:24.780> also<00:02:25.160> power<00:02:26.989> via

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
alpha camera that you can also power via

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.009 
alpha camera that you can also power via
USB<00:02:29.540> but<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.569> have<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.900> double<00:02:31.170> check<00:02:31.200> this

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
USB but I have to double check this

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.199 
USB but I have to double check this
let's<00:02:34.019> have<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.650> look<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.190> accessory<00:02:36.000> box

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
let's have a look in the accessory box

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.020 
let's have a look in the accessory box
now<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.140> first<00:02:37.470> thing<00:02:37.709> which<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.819> quite

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
now the first thing which is quite

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.740 
now the first thing which is quite
disappointing<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.140> charger<00:02:41.060> which<00:02:42.060> looks

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
disappointing is the charger which looks

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.440 
disappointing is the charger which looks
like<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.440> cheaper<00:02:44.160> version<00:02:44.190> compared<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.300> the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
like a cheaper version compared to the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.370 
like a cheaper version compared to the
one<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.920> found<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.160> Alpha<00:02:47.489> 7s<00:02:48.380> there's

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
one that I found in the Alpha 7s there's

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.070 
one that I found in the Alpha 7s there's
only<00:02:49.620> an<00:02:50.519> LED<00:02:51.319> to<00:02:52.319> indicate<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:53.610> charge

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
only an LED to indicate the charge

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.259 
only an LED to indicate the charge
whereas<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.290> one<00:02:55.769> in<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.250> Alpha<00:02:56.489> 7s<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:57.060> got

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
whereas the one in the Alpha 7s you got

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.100 
whereas the one in the Alpha 7s you got
three<00:02:57.630> different<00:02:58.530> LED<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.459> you<00:02:59.519> have<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.110> kind

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
three different LED so you have a kind

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.640 
three different LED so you have a kind
of<00:03:01.260> an<00:03:01.349> indication<00:03:01.799> of<00:03:02.720> how<00:03:03.720> much<00:03:03.900> your<00:03:04.230> your

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
of an indication of how much your your

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.000 
of an indication of how much your your
batteries<00:03:05.099> charged<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:06.319> let's<00:03:07.319> see<00:03:09.830> there<00:03:10.830> are

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
batteries charged so let's see there are

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.789 
batteries charged so let's see there are
two<00:03:11.510> leads<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:13.080> european<00:03:13.799> version<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:15.799> the

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
two leads the european version and the

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:23.440 
two leads the european version and the
UK<00:03:17.220> one<00:03:19.519> there<00:03:20.519> is<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.420> cable<00:03:21.720> guard<00:03:22.170> for<00:03:23.100> the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
UK one there is the cable guard for the

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.229 
UK one there is the cable guard for the
hdmi<00:03:24.450> lead<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:26.459> avoid<00:03:26.730> breaking<00:03:27.209> the

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
hdmi lead to avoid breaking the

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.000 
hdmi lead to avoid breaking the
connection<00:03:27.570> on<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.109> camera<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:28.769> this<00:03:28.980> is

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
connection on the camera so this is

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.330 
connection on the camera so this is
definitely<00:03:29.459> another<00:03:30.140> nod<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.799> video<00:03:32.220> of

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
definitely another nod to the video of

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.300 
definitely another nod to the video of
functionalities<00:03:33.090> of<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.359> camera<00:03:33.690> which<00:03:34.310> are

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
functionalities of the camera which are

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.680 
functionalities of the camera which are
important<00:03:37.100> actually<00:03:38.510> actually<00:03:39.510> there<00:03:39.660> are

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
important actually actually there are

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.039 
important actually actually there are
two<00:03:39.810> set<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.410> leads<00:03:40.640> so<00:03:41.640> there<00:03:41.819> are<00:03:41.910> two<00:03:42.209> eat

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
two set of leads so there are two eat

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.129 
two set of leads so there are two eat
you<00:03:43.290> plugs<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.730> UK<00:03:45.150> plugs<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.690> little<00:03:46.049> bit

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
you plugs and to UK plugs a little bit

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.530 
you plugs and to UK plugs a little bit
of<00:03:46.260> an<00:03:46.350> overkill<00:03:46.590> if<00:03:47.010> you<00:03:47.220> ask<00:03:47.400> me<00:03:48.650> hey<00:03:49.650> it's

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
of an overkill if you ask me hey it's

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.210 
of an overkill if you ask me hey it's
included<00:03:51.540> in<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.810> price<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:54.799> yeah<00:03:55.799> that's<00:03:55.980> it

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
included in the price and yeah that's it

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.309 
included in the price and yeah that's it
and<00:03:56.430> then<00:03:56.970> we<00:03:57.239> have<00:03:59.329> the<00:04:00.329> camera<00:04:00.720> itself<00:04:00.810> let's

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
and then we have the camera itself let's

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:10.110 
and then we have the camera itself let's
see<00:04:01.500> if<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:01.709> can<00:04:03.950> free<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.459> camera<00:04:05.910> from<00:04:06.980> box

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.949 

it<00:04:10.690> definitely<00:04:11.290> feels<00:04:12.180> substantial<00:04:13.180> in<00:04:13.810> your

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
it definitely feels substantial in your

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.890 
it definitely feels substantial in your
end<00:04:15.359> much<00:04:16.359> much<00:04:16.690> more<00:04:16.959> than<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:18.900> previous

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
end much much more than the previous

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.830 
end much much more than the previous
generation<00:04:20.609> models<00:04:24.090> so<00:04:25.090> of<00:04:25.330> course<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.810> looks

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
generation models so of course it looks

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.330 
generation models so of course it looks
and<00:04:26.790> feels<00:04:28.470> very<00:04:29.470> much<00:04:29.710> like<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:30.310> alpha<00:04:30.790> 7<00:04:31.180> and

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
and feels very much like the alpha 7 and

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.100 
and feels very much like the alpha 7 and
2<00:04:33.840> so<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.020> actually<00:04:35.350> the<00:04:35.770> second<00:04:37.110> camera

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
2 so this is actually the second camera

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.430 
2 so this is actually the second camera
in<00:04:38.290> the<00:04:38.440> range<00:04:38.620> to<00:04:39.010> use<00:04:39.220> this<00:04:39.400> new<00:04:39.669> design

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
in the range to use this new design

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.960 
in the range to use this new design
which<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:41.620> personally<00:04:41.949> really<00:04:42.490> really<00:04:42.789> like

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
which I personally really really like

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.360 
which I personally really really like
and<00:04:43.330> I<00:04:43.510> think<00:04:43.720> it's<00:04:43.900> much<00:04:44.080> much<00:04:44.380> better<00:04:44.740> much

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
and I think it's much much better much

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.460 
and I think it's much much better much
improved<00:04:46.110> compared<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.260> first

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
improved compared to the first

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.879 
improved compared to the first
generation<00:04:48.300> both<00:04:49.300> in<00:04:49.419> terms<00:04:49.570> of<00:04:49.840> feel<00:04:50.560> and

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
generation both in terms of feel and

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.700 
generation both in terms of feel and
also<00:04:51.400> functionality<00:04:52.300> because<00:04:52.419> it's<00:04:52.750> much<00:04:52.990> it

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
also functionality because it's much it

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.980 
also functionality because it's much it
feels<00:04:54.039> much<00:04:54.280> better<00:04:54.490> in<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.910> end<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.750> shutter

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
feels much better in the end the shutter

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.090 
feels much better in the end the shutter
button<00:04:56.110> is<00:04:56.530> actually<00:04:57.210> and<00:04:58.210> in<00:04:58.510> the<00:04:58.660> right

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
button is actually and in the right

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.930 
button is actually and in the right
place<00:05:00.100> now<00:05:00.370> and<00:05:02.070> yeah<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.220> only<00:05:03.310> difference

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
place now and yeah the only difference

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.500 
place now and yeah the only difference
with<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:04.930> alpha<00:05:05.289> 7r<00:05:05.800> sorry<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:06.850> alpha<00:05:07.090> 7<00:05:07.360> mar

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
with the alpha 7r sorry the alpha 7 mar

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:13.110 
with the alpha 7r sorry the alpha 7 mar
2<00:05:07.750> is<00:05:08.020> this<00:05:08.380> new<00:05:09.389> viewfinder<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:12.880> it's<00:05:13.030> the

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
2 is this new viewfinder so it's the

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.730 
2 is this new viewfinder so it's the
same<00:05:13.150> ole<00:05:13.810> at<00:05:14.490> 2.4<00:05:15.490> million<00:05:15.729> pixel<00:05:16.240> panel<00:05:16.740> but

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
same ole at 2.4 million pixel panel but

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.570 
same ole at 2.4 million pixel panel but
the<00:05:17.830> optics<00:05:18.220> itself<00:05:18.669> it's<00:05:19.539> new<00:05:19.780> so<00:05:20.260> it<00:05:20.710> will<00:05:21.010> be

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
the optics itself it's new so it will be

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.379 
the optics itself it's new so it will be
bigger<00:05:22.180> and<00:05:22.919> sharper<00:05:23.919> probably<00:05:24.280> but<00:05:25.150> I'm

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
bigger and sharper probably but I'm

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.740 
bigger and sharper probably but I'm
gonna<00:05:25.900> definitely<00:05:26.770> update<00:05:27.010> you<00:05:27.340> on<00:05:27.400> that<00:05:27.750> so
