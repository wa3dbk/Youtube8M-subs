00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.269
 so we are here on the cebit at msn 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.189
 to guest and the diagnosis there will be 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:10.700
 Now tell me something about the new ones 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.629
 gaming mainboards by msi is so great 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.629
 an extension of our portfolio 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.420
 one sees also at additional 70 ag the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.890
 65, for example, is so supreme 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.800
 we what we currently offer 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.190
 who for the first time here in front 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.230
 you can see it has something design 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.410
 a little differentiated from what came from us 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.900
 have blue black are usually 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.060
 so dns have or even yellow and black 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.980
 for the overclocker mainboard those have 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.850
 we now the funds 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.190
 red and black are built with the 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.480
 make as an image and that special 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.920
 offer is not natural of course not only 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.109
 the optics but also features the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.699
 We have here for example now 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:59.059
 kinderland in 2209 windows 8 complete 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.159
 is and makes sure I have a good one 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.680
 ping has and no one ladder into 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.869
 come play you can use 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.430
 on the other side is the sound 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.320
 blaster cinema integrates the leading 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.060
 also ensures differentiation of the noise 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.530
 I sound like an entertainment 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.920
 example on the battlefield have 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.700
 while during the battle 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.140
 I can then become a given person 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.560
 wonderful with my mates too 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.850
 to chat 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.000
 as another there is also the 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.000
 gaming keyboard that means at the end 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.860
 Ports are special gold backed 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.540
 available that provide connections for 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.680
 So I often plug in and unplug 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.150
 if i can for example on the near 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.990
 Bad the driver often times the place 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.530
 switch 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.210
 that is still reliable again and again 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.650
 make the connection without that 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.200
 something breaks is very important 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.730
 history 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.130
 The most important thing is that we move 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.500
 not here in the high-end area what the 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.990
 Price concerns but that are quite 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.370
 reasonable prices a bit higher than that 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.440
 standard mainboards but still 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.540
 affordable high quality of course 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.060
 with msi military class a certification 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.270
 after the american military grass 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.960
 standard so that the quality is 100 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.430
 percent 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.430
 ok great thanks
