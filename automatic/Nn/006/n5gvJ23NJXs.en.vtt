now<00:00:00.390> one<00:00:00.930> of<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.110> most<00:00:01.310> misunderstood<00:00:02.310> and

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
now one of the most misunderstood and

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.930 
now one of the most misunderstood and
often<00:00:03.330> overlooked<00:00:04.250> subtleties<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.279> this<00:00:05.609> kick

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
often overlooked subtleties to this kick

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.049 
often overlooked subtleties to this kick
is<00:00:06.150> that<00:00:06.839> that<00:00:07.230> hand<00:00:07.529> position<00:00:08.040> okay<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.940> is

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
is that that hand position okay that is

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.930 
is that that hand position okay that is
what<00:00:09.179> we<00:00:09.269> call<00:00:09.480> leaning<00:00:09.900> them<00:00:10.050> out<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.820> lot<00:00:11.820> of

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
what we call leaning them out a lot of

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.490 
what we call leaning them out a lot of
guys<00:00:12.059> will<00:00:12.330> do<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.570> lean<00:00:12.750> out<00:00:12.929> coming<00:00:13.170> out<00:00:13.349> of

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
guys will do the lean out coming out of

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.010 
guys will do the lean out coming out of
the<00:00:13.559> kick<00:00:13.790> but<00:00:14.790> very<00:00:15.000> few<00:00:15.240> people<00:00:15.420> understand

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
the kick but very few people understand

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.590 
the kick but very few people understand
that<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:16.410> as<00:00:16.619> important<00:00:17.279> if<00:00:17.369> not<00:00:17.400> more<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:17.789> to

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
that it's as important if not more so to

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.720 
that it's as important if not more so to
do<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.840> lean<00:00:19.020> out<00:00:19.199> going<00:00:19.949> into<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.310> kick

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
do the lean out going into the kick

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.340 
do the lean out going into the kick
when<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> say<00:00:21.390> lean<00:00:21.600> out<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.140> mean

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
when I say lean out this is what I mean

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.439 
when I say lean out this is what I mean
if<00:00:22.470> he<00:00:22.560> comes<00:00:22.800> forward<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.029> leaning<00:00:24.359> them

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
if he comes forward this is leaning them

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.800 
if he comes forward this is leaning them
out<00:00:24.830> okay<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.859> simply<00:00:26.400> check<00:00:27.269> their<00:00:27.480> forward

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
out okay I simply check their forward

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.929 
out okay I simply check their forward
momentum<00:00:27.930> momentum<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:29.550> come<00:00:29.699> back<00:00:29.730> to

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
momentum momentum and then come back to

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.160 
momentum momentum and then come back to
my<00:00:30.029> fighting<00:00:30.330> position<00:00:30.359> I'm<00:00:30.630> not<00:00:30.660> doing<00:00:31.019> this

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
my fighting position I'm not doing this

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.620 
my fighting position I'm not doing this
I'm<00:00:31.410> not<00:00:32.160> leaving<00:00:32.550> anything<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:32.910> there<00:00:33.120> for

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
I'm not leaving anything out there for

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.709 
I'm not leaving anything out there for
them<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.870> fight<00:00:34.260> off<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.670> okay<00:00:35.670> I'm<00:00:36.270> not<00:00:36.480> trying

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
them to fight off of okay I'm not trying

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.709 
them to fight off of okay I'm not trying
to<00:00:36.930> muscle<00:00:37.200> them<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.649> push<00:00:37.860> them<00:00:38.100> back<00:00:38.719> that

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
to muscle them and push them back that

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.420 
to muscle them and push them back that
might<00:00:39.960> work<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.260> some<00:00:40.469> cases<00:00:40.710> if<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> person

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
might work in some cases if the person

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.100 
might work in some cases if the person
smaller<00:00:41.760> you're<00:00:42.090> bigger<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.390> stronger<00:00:42.629> if

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
smaller you're bigger and stronger if

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.540 
smaller you're bigger and stronger if
they're<00:00:43.320> off-balance<00:00:43.860> sometimes<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.370> does

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
they're off-balance sometimes that does

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.549 
they're off-balance sometimes that does
work<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.420> that's<00:00:45.809> not<00:00:45.989> my<00:00:46.110> point<00:00:46.320> I'm<00:00:46.530> not

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
work but that's not my point I'm not

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.990 
work but that's not my point I'm not
trying<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.280> what<00:00:47.460> I'm<00:00:47.579> trying<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.879> do

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
trying to do that what I'm trying to do

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.020 
trying to do that what I'm trying to do
is<00:00:48.210> maintain<00:00:48.930> my<00:00:49.410> own<00:00:49.440> distance<00:00:49.950> lean<00:00:50.789> him<00:00:50.910> out

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
is maintain my own distance lean him out

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.569 
is maintain my own distance lean him out
to<00:00:51.239> check<00:00:51.480> his<00:00:51.600> forward<00:00:51.870> momentum<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.579> some

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
to check his forward momentum in some

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.279 
to check his forward momentum in some
cases<00:00:53.820> even<00:00:54.030> if<00:00:54.360> he's<00:00:54.570> throwing<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:55.020> straight

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
cases even if he's throwing a straight

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.400 
cases even if he's throwing a straight
right<00:00:55.469> hand<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:56.370> will<00:00:56.579> stop<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.600> majority

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
right hand this will stop the majority

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.709 
right hand this will stop the majority
of<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.559> momentum<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.520> just<00:01:00.449> leaning

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
of that momentum just that just leaning

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.110 
of that momentum just that just leaning
them<00:01:00.899> out<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.320> see<00:01:01.640> that<00:01:02.640> becomes<00:01:02.969> very

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
them out you see that becomes very

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.289 
them out you see that becomes very
critical<00:01:03.660> when<00:01:03.870> I'm<00:01:04.019> throwing<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.439> kick<00:01:04.710> I

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
critical when I'm throwing this kick I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.300 
critical when I'm throwing this kick I
can't<00:01:06.299> emphasize<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.869> enough<00:01:07.049> punch<00:01:07.920> beats

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
can't emphasize this enough punch beats

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.420 
can't emphasize this enough punch beats
kick<00:01:08.869> again<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> paradox<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> tie<00:01:11.130> kick

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
kick again the paradox to the tie kick

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.330 
kick again the paradox to the tie kick
is<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.510> most<00:01:12.540> powerful<00:01:12.900> kick<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
is it is the most powerful kick and the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.039 
is it is the most powerful kick and the
most<00:01:14.520> dangerous<00:01:14.880> weapon<00:01:15.299> potentially<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.960> be

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
most dangerous weapon potentially to be

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.140 
most dangerous weapon potentially to be
hit<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.520> but<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.640> also<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.030> easiest

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
hit with but it's also the easiest

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.850 
hit with but it's also the easiest
weapon<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.840> defend<00:01:19.110> against<00:01:19.560> if<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.740> know

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
weapon to defend against if you know

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.440 
weapon to defend against if you know
what<00:01:20.040> you're<00:01:20.189> doing<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
what you're doing and one of the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.359 
what you're doing and one of the
simplest<00:01:21.840> ways<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.409> defend<00:01:22.799> against<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.159> big

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
simplest ways to defend against this big

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.920 
simplest ways to defend against this big
kick<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.119> simply<00:01:24.479> throw<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.659> right<00:01:24.900> hand

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
kick is a simply throw the right hand

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.719 
kick is a simply throw the right hand
straight<00:01:25.259> down<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> middle<00:01:25.650> you'll<00:01:26.549> almost

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
straight down the middle you'll almost

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.120 
straight down the middle you'll almost
always<00:01:26.970> beat<00:01:27.360> them<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.470> protect<00:01:28.950> myself

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
always beat them so I protect myself

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.370 
always beat them so I protect myself
minimize<00:01:29.820> my<00:01:30.000> transition<00:01:30.540> again<00:01:30.630> by<00:01:31.049> leaning

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
minimize my transition again by leaning

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.929 
minimize my transition again by leaning
them<00:01:31.500> out<00:01:31.590> now<00:01:32.040> let<00:01:32.189> me<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.369> show<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.579> real

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
them out now let me just show you real

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.850 
them out now let me just show you real
slow<00:01:33.090> again<00:01:33.329> what<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.869> looks<00:01:34.049> like<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.439> go

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
slow again what this looks like I go

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.319 
slow again what this looks like I go
into<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.250> kick<00:01:35.430> leading<00:01:35.729> them<00:01:35.820> out<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.150> see

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
into the kick leading them out you see

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.090 
into the kick leading them out you see
here<00:01:36.509> I'm<00:01:36.600> protected<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.619> I'm<00:01:37.770> out<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
here I'm protected like I'm out of the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.469 
here I'm protected like I'm out of the
kick<00:01:38.250> lean<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.610> mouth<00:01:38.790> back<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.390> my
