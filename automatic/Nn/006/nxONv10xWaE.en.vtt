00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.819
 then first you have to take the 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.589
 baking paper with saucer maybe not 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.480
 Christmas 6 January as in my case 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.349
 that you make us look like shit with the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.759
 guests a small cup a cheese of the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.279
 very light sweet and sour peppers 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:23.900
 too much of a night snack as in mine 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.900
 case a knife a teaspoon 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.369
 optional balsamic vinegar protocol 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.260
 frosting shirt short by some vague 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.510
 let's shit what's good I'll put it 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.070
 you will be sure the parmesan 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.739
 reggiano is the mind that touches and 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.370
 Parmesan then Scorgiano for 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.160
 small bag of Parmesan cheese and made two 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.079
 mountains above the map form a 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.910
 It would be the largest and the smallest but 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.200
 in my case I had to make the sayings that 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.079
 because as you see I took a 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.350
 skimpy piece of parchment paper the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.500
 practically genius of evil 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.559
 after that if you have used clean fingers 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.040
 fingers to do to spread it and do 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.610
 two yellows in the roundest possible 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.860
 trying not to get them caught in the middle 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.020
 I recommend a little smaller than that 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.610
 is the saucer of the taxina e 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.710
 the other bigger one that will become the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.710
 same cup made of Parmesan 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.850
 crush well the thickness must be 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.310
 more or less than 3 mm we say maybe also 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:37.590
 a little less and then put them in the oven 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:40.020
 microwave for 20 seconds at 624 there is a 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.329
 once finished you will see them a little darker 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.369
 a term because they stand out anyway 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.040
 all their oil come off the one floor 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.990
 I 'm slow when it's still hot 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.060
 will remain hard forever leaning over 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.439
 the inverted cup you see mine 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.210
 little one so a little came 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.049
 little bag but you can make it bigger 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.210
 the track 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.549
 keep it pressed until you do 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.350
 it hardens and the other one holds it in 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.920
 plates for resting on the plate of 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.509
 presentation of the appetizer that you will make 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.180
 in this way it will be the saucer of 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.440
 cup of parmesan cheese 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.900
 once it has cooled a 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.260
 little and better than all but I have 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.120
 had sbrescia a usual year 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.310
 flip from with the basket of 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.020
 parmesan cheese and at this point the institution have 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.630
 sold while what you want one 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.390
 cheese and ham tender compass 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.380
 in this case I put the pieces of a 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.080
 the cheese then I take the cheese 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.390
 with listen to struggling little pieces of 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:48.130
 cheeses we put them in not 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:51.420
 it has nothing to do with it, so note ok 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:57.360
 a whole cheese in a wafer 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:00.190
 after which I take the lightest 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.830
 pepper a bit like aldo giovanni 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.019
 giacomo you remember well in the evening then 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.530
 however in the morning dead mice here they are 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:12.370
 same if I can get the peppers 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.340
 they ca n't do it you can see it with the 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:23.320
 push paper push maybe good good 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:26.280
 lofra I take a pepper and with a knife 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.820
 I also cut what you are in 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:36.610
 nine hundred tomato and touches of 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:38.950
 sky pepper taste inside the trash 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.160
 however you can name 2000 variants 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.320
 type olive tomato and ricotta canister 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.000
 mouth that seems really good to me 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.100
 whatever I think even with shit 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.019
 I'm point ok 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:58.989
 and at this point you can do it 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:04:01.870
 see but it's nice that or not that 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.810
 obviously as they discover it at 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.820
 beauty of one in the night to eat me 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.269
 ciardi parmesan with cheese ne 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:17.739
 lose numbers with such finesse 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:19.479
 just like a queen of three lost companies 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.660
 the risky mouth I am really 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.500
 just like if I didn't see it 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.910
 bell 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.139
 with my mouth still full I put it on 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:35.099
 other food in the mouth pieces of cheese 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:40.530
 that the collapse everywhere thanks that 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:43.160
 sucks and oh well 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.160
 hello beautiful
