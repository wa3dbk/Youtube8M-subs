00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 the lama is not astonished 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.100
 after all, you do not see something like that 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.109
 all days 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.750
 and also the geese are completely out of the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.120
 cottage you already see unusual 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.009
 from the new ones but who so much fun 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.320
 he does not have to eat 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.300
 on 20 July, the two were armored 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.359
 exits here 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.020
 the previous owner had it in 1974 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.000
 acquired 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.199
 At the time, the animals were still standing 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.689
 not under species protection 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.429
 In former times you could buy them everywhere 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.869
 which existed in every pet shop reproducing 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.489
 Tortoise has never been 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.260
 thought how big they become 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.790
 most of the time they did not grab that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.620
 to grow old and become so tall 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.600
 you have to man that man ever where 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.760
 she has said she has good 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.930
 what they would not have been 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.510
 so big old 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.950
 but the former owner a retiree 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.390
 she now had health 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.120
 give up 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.190
 about 70 centimeters long and just under 50 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.350
 kilo heavy that's already stately 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.360
 Measures and an end is far from it 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.370
 in sight the turtles are straight 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.899
 40 years old or better said 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.899
 boys because they can be more correct 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.000
 attitude to 150 years old 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.520
 especially hot, it should ideally 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.900
 Finally, the turtles come 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.990
 originally from africa 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.790
 you need the 30 in winter 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.799
 degree plus that means right temperature 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.450
 because then they have desert 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.009
 Now you can do that in the summer 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.270
 those without problems keep the outside 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.530
 brown larger gehge 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.810
 as they have it is currently in the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.090
 Quarantine sit we have it several 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.970
 tests made due to parasites 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.200
 worm cures and so on and I think 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.340
 that time they will not 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.619
 the next ones will be mediated 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.360
 it will be a bigger one 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.460
 against them they may be to our 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.869
 donkeys on the sand space on the target 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.030
 they feel great there 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.920
 that's big enough for them to walk 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.110
 You can dig there in winter 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.299
 here is still too cold for the animals 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.549
 a suitable accommodation will be sought 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.799
 could be a zoogeschÃ¤ft in the emergency 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.409
 close the two record that would be 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.009
 but only a transitional solution we 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.479
 We would like to have a zoo zoo where 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.329
 it also be kept right 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.040
 legally held or best we 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.200
 stop africa or have southern countries 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.580
 in the park in southern countries where they are 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.100
 stay outside all year long 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.720
 can 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.670
 which is not the case with us in the region 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.770
 is possible until a new home 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.840
 the turtles are found with 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.000
 the nearly 300 other animals on the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.160
 stay at gnadenhof and stay as long as possible 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.100
 it means to continue feeding first 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.080
 but especially grass or even salad 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.630
 the new one, by the way, tastes good on the 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.310
 We hear names of Siegfried and Roy 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.110
 long considered how do we call them 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.020
 many animals took over 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.340
 We have already set many names 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.560
 music many novelties have come to mind 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.530
 they went roy also had 74 at that time 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.660
 Siegfried started roy who make 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.760
 Animal welfare also contributes to species protection 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.050
 their tigers and there we said there 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.980
 they have there with people fits perfectly 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.510
 Siegfried and Roy is not that look 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.880
 heartbreaking hopefully finds itself 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.650
 soon a big and above all warm one 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.650
 new home for Siegfried and Roy
