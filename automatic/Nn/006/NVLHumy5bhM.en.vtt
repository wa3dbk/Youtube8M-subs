00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.449 
this could work to my advantage because
some<00:03:28.079> people<00:03:28.380> might<00:03:28.500> just<00:03:28.769> rot<00:03:28.950> full<00:03:29.190> call

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
some people might just rot full call

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.699 
some people might just rot full call
teams<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.940> declare<00:03:30.239> me<00:03:30.450> there<00:03:31.049> go<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.349> swaps

players out and put random Silver's it

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.449 
players out and put random Silver's it
now<00:03:34.319> you<00:03:34.380> will<00:03:34.560> listen<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.889> state<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.160> summer

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
now you will listen the state of summer

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.250

teams which have rocked up in this

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.710 
teams which have rocked up in this
series<00:03:37.470> near<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:37.919> stat<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.370> near<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.239> end<00:03:39.480> as

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
series near the stat and near the end as

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.020 
series near the stat and near the end as
well<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.169> I<00:03:40.889> think<00:03:40.980> messes<00:03:41.400> up<00:03:41.489> chemistry<00:03:41.940> and

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
well and I think messes up chemistry and

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.370 
well and I think messes up chemistry and
it<00:03:42.090> messes<00:03:42.239> up<00:03:42.389> their<00:03:42.630> thinking<00:03:43.079> as<00:03:43.230> well

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
it messes up their thinking as well

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.140 
it messes up their thinking as well
because<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.650> taking<00:03:44.010> out<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.609> players<00:03:44.849> they're

because I taking out to players they're

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.000 
because I taking out to players they're
