00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
and Lana has to keep Amy protected but

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.480 
and Lana has to keep Amy protected but
neither<00:00:28.199> character<00:00:28.740> has<00:00:28.890> ever<00:00:29.070> been<00:00:29.250> trained

neither character has ever been trained
to<00:00:29.550> fight<00:00:29.810> so<00:00:30.810> their<00:00:30.990> first<00:00:31.260> reflex<00:00:31.529> will

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
to fight so their first reflex will

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.580 
to fight so their first reflex will
often<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.399> avoid<00:00:32.520> fighting<00:00:33.260> for<00:00:34.260> example

often be to avoid fighting for example
here<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.100> would<00:00:35.219> be<00:00:35.340> ridiculous<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.880> try<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
here it would be ridiculous to try and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.410 
here it would be ridiculous to try and
fight<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> soldier<00:00:37.020> with<00:00:37.140> all<00:00:37.320> his<00:00:37.500> ammo<00:00:38.059> so<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
fight a soldier with all his ammo so the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.819 
fight a soldier with all his ammo so the
easiest<00:00:39.480> solution<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.530> avoid

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
easiest solution is to avoid

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.700 
easiest solution is to avoid
confrontation<00:00:45.079> throughout<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> game<00:00:46.410> you
