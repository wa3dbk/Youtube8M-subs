00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
onto the head pipe you hold it in place

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.920 
onto the head pipe you hold it in place
while<00:02:14.200> he<00:02:14.349> tightens<00:02:14.680> up<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.890> two<00:02:15.040> nuts<00:02:15.930> and

you just want to get on about
three-quarters<00:02:18.250> tight<00:02:18.489> at<00:02:18.970> this<00:02:19.180> point<00:02:19.420> just

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
three-quarters tight at this point just

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.610 
three-quarters tight at this point just
to<00:02:19.690> get<00:02:19.810> everything<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.440> can<00:02:20.530> get

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
to get everything so you can get

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.160 
to get everything so you can get
everything<00:02:20.830> started<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.640> lined<00:02:21.880> up<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:23.080> we're

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
everything started and lined up so we're

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.970 
everything started and lined up so we're
not<00:02:23.200> going<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.470> tighten<00:02:23.590> them<00:02:23.739> all<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.920> way

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980

you probably be able to line up your mid
in<00:02:28.600> tail<00:02:28.750> pipes<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.500> now<00:02:29.590> we're<00:02:29.709> just<00:02:29.739> gonna

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
in tail pipes and now we're just gonna

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.530 
in tail pipes and now we're just gonna
tighten<00:02:30.670> right<00:02:30.760> here<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.090> don't<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.360> over

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
plans pretty easily it doesn't need a

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.570 
plans pretty easily it doesn't need a
lot<00:02:34.510> of<00:02:34.630> pressure<00:02:34.900> just<00:02:35.350> get<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.620> snug<00:02:36.280> you

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
lot of pressure just get it snug you

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.009 
lot of pressure just get it snug you
make<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.819> even<00:02:37.090> on<00:02:37.180> both<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.540> can<00:02:37.660> see<00:02:37.870> that

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
make it even on both you can see that

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.000 
make it even on both you can see that
there's<00:02:38.170> an<00:02:38.290> even<00:02:38.500> number<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.709> threads

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
there's an even number of threads

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.270 
there's an even number of threads
sticking<00:02:39.970> out<00:02:40.239> from<00:02:40.450> each<00:02:40.599> side<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.830> kind<00:02:42.160> of

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
sticking out from each side and kind of

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.550 
sticking out from each side and kind of
want<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.430> make<00:02:42.549> it<00:02:42.700> even<00:02:42.940> on<00:02:43.000> both<00:02:43.060> sides<00:02:43.560> go

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
want to make it even on both sides go

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.990 
want to make it even on both sides go
back<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:44.980> forth<00:02:45.190> between<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.519> two<00:02:45.640> different

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
back and forth between the two different

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.720 
back and forth between the two different
sides<00:02:46.209> as<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.569> tighten<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.959> up

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.880 

so<00:02:55.239> now<00:02:55.330> with<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.629> FMF<00:02:56.080> there's<00:02:56.290> no<00:02:56.410> gasket

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
so now with the FMF there's no gasket

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.020 
so now with the FMF there's no gasket
between<00:02:57.040> it's<00:02:57.280> just<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.489> metal<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.910> metal

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
between it's just a metal to metal

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.059 
between it's just a metal to metal
slipped<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.629> so<00:02:59.379> you<00:02:59.470> just<00:02:59.590> got<00:02:59.709> to<00:02:59.769> get<00:02:59.860> make
