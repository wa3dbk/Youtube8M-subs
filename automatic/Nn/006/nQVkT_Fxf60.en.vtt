00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.100
 Hello dear visitors of ours 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.790
 site garden world I came here review 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:20.060
 on one video that we shot 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.570
 that we talk a lot about diseases and 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.029
 garden pests 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.040
 I would like more about flowers and which 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.619
 insert joy about fruits like 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.989
 reap the crop unfortunately we 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.810
 we live in this area and for good reason 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.109
 called the zone of risky farming 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.820
 this is our middle band here such 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.969
 natural conditions that would seem 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.370
 grow and nothing should very sharp 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.030
 temperature variations are special at the end 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.570
 of the summer 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.239
 now here is a very hot day we have 5 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.109
 August night is already cold 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.589
 strong race 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.719
 Naturally these diseases they strongly 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.059
 spread and here's to something 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.699
 grow in our conditions of course you need 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.100
 know what diseases to protect 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.350
 plant how to do it and generally like these 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.930
 diseases look here let's go now and 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.530
 look at the village you in the greenhouse with 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.450
 cucumbers and tomatoes then here is that 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.520
 principle against the rules on very many 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.490
 gardeners so grow out of savings 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.270
 places just feel sorry for putting two greenhouses 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:30.020
 him in such greenhouses very often 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.020
 breeding conditions are created 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.660
 various fungal diseases and now 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.590
 we have three more weeks raining and 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.990
 so the air is even on the street of oil plates 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.290
 and humidity is literally one hundred percent she 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.470
 Now the sun keeps here 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.440
 warms 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.440
 and here it is evaporation literally floating 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.540
 everything is like in the south near somewhere sea where 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.510
 nothing dries and 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.630
 This condition such when here in the greenhouse 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.930
 heat and humidity there is no airing though 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.000
 like this wide open both doors no 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.030
 airing because of the streets too 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.090
 draws moisture disease 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.980
 cucumber quite a lot they all have 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.670
 most of them have fungal 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.450
 nature and fight with him about need 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.000
 in exactly the same ways itâ€™s just 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.000
 use fungicides ie means 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.680
 to fight fungal diseases 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.900
 since cucumbers ripen in us 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.170
 every day here you see they hang here 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.870
 both small and large soaps two days they 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.480
 collected there they have some tremendous here 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.670
 and naturally no chemical 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.069
 fungicides we now do not use 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.069
 we can because the minimum term 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.860
 expectations that is the period when you can 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.860
 pick cucumbers after processing any 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.459
 fruit after processing chemical feet qi 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.190
 Giving is 10 days naturally if 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.530
 we will wait for our cucumbers to grow 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.709
 with melon and will be tasteless unfit 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:08.180
 processing therefore remains only 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:10.790
 phytosporin olli ren from biological 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.890
 means gamai.ru such biological 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.930
 drugs 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.150
 they can spray the plant but they 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.410
 will have action only if 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.150
 when the total humidity is not very high and 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.299
 it is clear that under such conditions as I 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.970
 told already created about now they 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.310
 poorly helps developing diseases here 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.250
 white rot for example or ble white 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:40.130
 mold and you often call it something 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:42.859
 akin to gray gray mold mid li 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.470
 on strawberries when she is so fluffy 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:48.130
 becomes there gray in this fluff and on 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.370
 cucumbers it is pure white here look 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.930
 the initial phases of the disease it affects 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.690
 and the ovary 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.269
 and here it begins sv. which is not 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.640
 it falls down and the weather is very wet he 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.760
 begins to rot here disputes here 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.310
 this white rot and begins the growth of these 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.930
 dispute and then sporulation 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.980
 she is already brown it means there 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.739
 disputes ripen 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.769
 here is such a white fluffy tangle 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.780
 can grow also affects leaves 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.660
 hits branches 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.580
 especially in the forks of the stems settles 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.229
 it's white days let's go and 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:30.230
 let's see what we 've done here but here 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:33.020
 look still here such ovaries 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.330
 here, too, died here, here, too, she 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.720
 It starts with the stump where these were 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:42.110
 removed yellow leaves may be affected 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.380
 be some other diseases here 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.460
 we have here since we processed 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.130
 still tried 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.910
 here so that the airing was good and 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.460
 everything here here is not very much but 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.250
 you can still see here find here 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.570
 just such a typical thing when it 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:07.930
 white mold it starts here is the place 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:11.390
 where was the leaf cut here if not 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.610
 delete these infected leaves 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.640
 this is such a straight vata literally 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.280
 grows up in these affected places 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:23.750
 most unpleasant when here we are here 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:26.420
 Now we will find a place with you 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.470
 nasty when it is white mold it 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.500
 settles 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:34.040
 Now here was a place I and 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.200
 laughed but he died this mushroom but all 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.480
 equally he did his pretentious things 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.910
 look at this whole stalk 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.950
 all this stalk will have to be cut off 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.530
 I have already cut it off especially for you 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.490
 left you to see it is 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.900
 here and here is likely to be 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.770
 decay all this 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.880
 will die 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:58.970
 here too the center of defeat of this white 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.610
 Mold white rot where here it is 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.830
 settles on a piece of paper 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.440
 if it's not all clean the leaves are not 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.620
 cut the stems do not cut turns out 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:13.250
 literally white fluff here, too, he's on 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.410
 here it started literally 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.170
 two days ago we contacted these 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.650
 amazed things here if you can see it 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:25.400
 it turns out such a white pig already 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:29.420
 It begins with white fluff. 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.520
 do how to process our plants i 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:35.860
 he said that by chemical means 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:39.009
 You can not use so take 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:42.369
 phytosporin dissolve it according to the instructions 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:46.839
 and spray the plant naturally 

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:49.449
 better to spray in places where we 

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:52.149
 You looked here passed these here pockets 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:55.569
 contamination and concentration can even be 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:59.860
 do more than it says there 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:07:02.740
 packaging, but to such a greenhouse with 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.009
 cucumbers and jump enough here 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.229
 here 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:10.029
 I have dissolved the bottles here 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:13.529
 enough of such a bottle and go 

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:19.330
 and sprinkle here on the back 

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:20.349
 set is set up here the sample inverse 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:26.309
 side sheet 

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:34.330
 does not want to work and now these are all 

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:37.419
 pockets where start affected where the stems 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:39.430
 your order is amazed and generally it's like 

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:41.409
 prevention against any risks for 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:45.279
 living here can be powdery 

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:47.529
 dew and downy mildew and others 

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:49.930
 some kind of blotch anise 

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:52.059
 has a fungal nature that is here 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:54.159
 so you can protect now 

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:56.589
 cucumbers from the disease they are still 

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:59.189
 will continue to give you another crop 

00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:59.189
 until the end of September
