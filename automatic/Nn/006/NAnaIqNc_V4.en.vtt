change up the quality settings and stuff
to<00:02:13.840> make<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.140> less<00:02:14.350> laggy<00:02:14.650> if<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.100> have<00:02:15.250> leg

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
to make it less laggy if you have leg

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.130 
to make it less laggy if you have leg
problems<00:02:15.790> yeah<00:02:16.360> oh<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:19.240> seeds<00:02:19.570> kind<00:02:20.020> of

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
problems yeah oh and the seeds kind of

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.010 
problems yeah oh and the seeds kind of
cool<00:02:20.800> i<00:02:20.830> guess<00:02:21.070> so<00:02:21.550> i'll<00:02:21.940> put<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.420> seed<00:02:22.690> in<00:02:22.720> the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
cool i guess so i'll put the seed in the

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.479 
cool i guess so i'll put the seed in the
description<00:02:23.740> or<00:02:25.290> yeah<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.500> open<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.980> notation

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
description or yeah and open a notation

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.699 
description or yeah and open a notation
upright<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.239> now<00:02:29.519> of<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:31.090> seed<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:32.530> could

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
upright and now of the seed so you could

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.750 
upright and now of the seed so you could
go<00:02:32.830> and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.759 

probably<00:02:36.760> yeah<00:02:37.480> that's<00:02:37.659> pretty<00:02:37.870> cool<00:02:38.049> lava<00:02:38.349> up

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
probably yeah that's pretty cool lava up

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.589 
probably yeah that's pretty cool lava up
here<00:02:39.219> oh<00:02:40.650> ok<00:02:41.650> well<00:02:41.889> that's<00:02:42.879> the<00:02:43.180> only<00:02:43.420> non

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
here oh ok well that's the only non

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.410 
here oh ok well that's the only non
solution<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.409> I<00:02:44.650> know<00:02:44.709> of<00:02:45.209> might<00:02:46.209> be<00:02:46.389> another

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
solution that I know of might be another

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.270 
solution that I know of might be another
