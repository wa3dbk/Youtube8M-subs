00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.899
 that goes with a video on the subject 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.550
 growth hormones and meal timing 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.980
 at that time the timing actually means 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.049
 in principle when he what yes or when 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.219
 he does not care and the topics are relative 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.630
 strongly coupled with each other though 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.369
 Actually, I just want to on in the video 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.710
 the growth or here now briefly on 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.170
 Of course, the meal frequency can be one 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.240
 separate video rausbring case should 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.920
 So the topic is of interest first 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.050
 once growth hormones are there, yes 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.080
 many myths now arise 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.620
 about this legendary about this 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.410
 fabled weekend growth hormones 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.770
 and even the people think each other 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.710
 Of course, 11 makes its platform without 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.030
 growth, ie muscle growth and that 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.070
 can not be bad that can only 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.590
 be good for muscle he is clear 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.360
 and they say something like that after that 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.460
 training no carte food or before 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.789
 do not go to bed to eat 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.120
 just the growth hormone production 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.980
 can maximize 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.750
 and also determined as far as you can 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.699
 of course google no longer a problem why 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.159
 why the biochemical processes 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.600
 I do not want to explain you 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.659
 finja everyone is of course free 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.490
 not there to inform 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.840
 but in any case somehow said 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.030
 now after training before 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.970
 do not eat cups or eat anything 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.650
 which influences the training year 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.060
 our hormone balance so strong that 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.640
 even the upper body with grows yes 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.810
 growth will be released without 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.210
 because investors frees cetera pp and 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.740
 always so always when 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.680
 people such an argument bring that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.240
 somehow euro hormone are affected 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.829
 could already assume that the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.960
 people simply have no idea 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.759
 Hormone in the normal range have no 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.049
 influence on the body compositions 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.030
 that means as much as muscles 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.829
 build up or degrease 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.250
 that means even if you write your texts 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.530
 reflects the normal normal area 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.149
 is in the regulatory impact is 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.409
 by ten percent yes if it somehow 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.299
 fidget and give something just that 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.790
 testosterone production of you from you 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.469
 it would not increase by ten percent 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.390
 Ten percent more muscles mean it 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.890
 in itself would not mean more 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.399
 maybe a little bit more placebo 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.200
 but in itself it would not help 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.080
 nothing brings and the same is true 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.330
 for insulin or for adults as well 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.830
 that means somehow trying hormones too 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.569
 yes manipulate themselves today in the 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.050
 normal range is easy 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.090
 no sense 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.760
 So lately I have not been last 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.620
 I made a video about it and 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.910
 because you wrote yes blah blah blah 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.290
 that's not true at all but when I see him 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.850
 but I'm too low then you are 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.660
 not normal it is about the 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.910
 normal range 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.220
 if you are 180 years old yes yes 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.400
 Also only 20 grams of fat for 200 years 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.260
 the vulture is and knows three percent 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.160
 Body fat rom is running then you are not 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.380
 more in the normal range 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.330
 the testosterone and there you have 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.519
 also disadvantages and think first and then 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.709
 Writing normal range is as well from 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.480
 two to eight no idea how the 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.290
 unit as in the region so be in 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.510
 this normal range 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.340
 then bring a little more 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.350
 percent of person no longer 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.300
 if they really really the massive 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.800
 experience the effects of the hormones yes 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.530
 then you really need to stop 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.750
 much more than what i'm doing 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.860
 normal range is in your system 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.600
 and you can not do it 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.220
 supplements or not yet create 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.200
 with a good geneticist otherwise 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.840
 times approaching but then you have to stop 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.940
 to conduct hormones from the outside of exogenously 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.920
 Out in the body into your system 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.980
 Introduce per month 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.390
 so try the testosterone and 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.970
 insulin or growth hormones too 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.709
 Manipulating simply means 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.040
 wasted energy might as well 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.450
 do not do anything else 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.100
 are then another language 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.739
 learn japanese chinese will be you 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.540
 bring more than you were tempted too 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.980
 That's why they do this 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.290
 whole growth hormone story 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.220
 actually recognize are very short around 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.799
 to summarize it 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.600
 but what more special because in the 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.239
 For example, growth mode is not missing 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.670
 Knowledge is that growth hormones alone 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.590
 not really good at that is that is called 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.420
 you can talk to her open in 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.359
 high doses and would not be anabolic 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.019
 Effect experienced at testo that is quite 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.750
 different 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.340
 You can also do that very clearly with it 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.489
 but there you have very very strong in one 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.900
 Flat near insulin istanbul his 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.849
 body actually and yes 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.400
 that is alone stop as I said not 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.229
 is really strong in the sense of 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.269
 Anabolic is therefore in the sense of 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.460
 muscle building but only if you 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.080
 test takes then he shoots both 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.330
 that means it goes by itself 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.340
 will be super growth hormones alone for 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.350
 muscle building not and both together 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.740
 works outstanding even more powerful 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.030
 as the test alone yes even if you 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.440
 somehow out of the normal range 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.740
 somehow come with the supplement 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.479
 Could he do that for muscle building? 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.070
 bring not just because grow to 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.539
 Fashion is not really comfortable 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.580
 Sole one , yes, yes 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.430
 on the subject of meals frequency years 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.440
 frequency not be frequency timing 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.330
 many of you think okay so how 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.350
 Can we be the most homologous one? 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.430
 do not influence anyway 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.289
 So what I like them after the 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.090
 To influence training is extreme 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.280
 hard at all the dirt asks for it 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.080
 yes I say so long for the 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.030
 training that you actually insulin 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.830
 output can be very heavy 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.300
 can provoke compared to when 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.919
 one did not train because of that 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.449
 Generally all these hormone stuffs too 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.030
 influence is just eating extremely 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.560
 hard you can barely stop and second is 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.900
 even if you could it would be next to 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.660
 normal range and then would be warns for 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.780
 Us usually means the principle that 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.500
 meal timing completely i do not care 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.030
 make it very short 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.970
 you should actually keep you short 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.680
 namely meal timing refers 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.789
 In my opinion two things I am 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.940
 do not think that it is complete 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.169
 is unimportant but two things would 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.229
 I would actually be threefold 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:45.440
 restrict and very short prosthesis 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.270
 maximally accelerate maximum power in 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.370
 provide training and just try 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.710
 his show appetite for example like that 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.139
 it's good to regulate that means 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.940
 as much as it does not matter if i do 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.409
 an hour before the calwer in hessen it 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.909
 but then I am for all the cards 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.770
 the whole meal becomes really slower 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:01.849
 it may not cost a maximum 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.889
 accomplish services 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:05.659
 and that's why it makes sense 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.340
 to somehow bring a timing that one 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.440
 just not before training everything is 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:13.520
 On the other hand, I can say too 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.210
 also make little sense in training everything 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.999
 to it 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.949
 So you have to stop in the sense halt 

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:21.990
 look how far can you just maximum 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:25.050
 provide performance how can you 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.340
 him the maximum protein synthesis janko 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.499
 I do not want to recommend either 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.629
 now always 24 hours to fast to 

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:33.330
 example yes that means time too 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:35.580
 no one already suspects it somewhere 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.439
 and the third we just brings the eyes 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.029
 next one we feed on the 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.409
 he is hungry all day if he has 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:42.449
 In the morning you can without having 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:43.770
 still there is a lot and in the evening you have 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.879
 mostly hungry and then you have none 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.650
 calorie freedom then you stop 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:48.810
 probably crowded that one 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.460
 just not so good in the plan itself 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.460
 can hold and then makes frequency 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.319
 Frequency and timing are absolute rather 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.729
 or otherwise if you just do not put anything in 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:58.020
 I will not get it then 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:00.000
 try my meals in two 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.680
 to eat all over the hours 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.090
 I would be distributed throughout the day 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.520
 try because it is just a 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.099
 It is easier to eat a lot 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.930
 So at larger period is gutted 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:12.089
 you will be in ten meals more 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.930
 Eating is one of the very whole 

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:15.870
 just 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.069
