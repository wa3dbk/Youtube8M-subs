00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.390
 Yes Hello Ikebe musical instrument My name is Ribore Akihabara up floor gk Nakaizumi 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.940
 Today thank you 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:14.320
 today 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:18.539
 The equipment that will be explained is this first arc pt bs 1 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.570
 It becomes equipment called a programmable switcher. 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.850
 When you say whether be something called roughly 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:32.369
 Up to 5 effectors a 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:36.110
 Remember the 2 combinations of 5 stones and switch it with one action at a time 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.110
 Become a switcher to do 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.520
 At first I think that I will explain while taking account of the fact that 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.750
 This manual programmer is the first to enter 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.110
 Shake mode 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:59.329
 It is 8 switches too It is first cut in red 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:05.790
 Manual mode Manual mode 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:12.030
 It is a function to turn on and off each effector instead 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:15.630
 As for this function, effectors with different heights and different switches are used instead of this 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:22.180
 As we have the same sense of the same height 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:27.220
 It is something that can be switched to this way to Kari 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:33.940
 Then I would like to copy the explanation to the programmable mode first 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:36.820
 The program is the one I mentioned earlier, but the combination from two to up to five 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:42.460
 It will be a function that will be called in the action 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:45.130
 First and explains that what is mean by such the one that contains 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.600
 Here's how the effector you are using now 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.710
 Because it will be displayed in LED 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.710
 At first it is clean system 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:02.750
 me 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:07.090
 Things suddenly more strong shaking and squirrel torsion from this sound took 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:11.510
 If you become like go to the patch will move to those that had been prepared it 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.150
 re a yes 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.050
 me 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.760
 Te returns Hmm 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.760
 Hm 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:35.520
 I will explain how to set the bank here 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:37.800
 First First, you want to use any in the effector say rises from No. 1 to No. 5 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.290
 Please choose in the second place 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.189
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.189
 First of all distortion 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:54.620
 Digital day If you want to put this in the top of the bank 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:59.629
 It is a manual program button here . 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:02.300
 If you do so, it blinks like this, so if you want to put it on the floor , step on the bank location with your foot 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:07.580
 Please 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:10.260
 Now that will be so to you and 3 set squirrel torsion and a company of the case to the bank City 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.659
 The downset is complete 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.659
 A in it from No. 1 to No. 5 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:23.480
 It will be the flow that you combine it with your choice and use it 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:26.470
 There are 5 banks available so here is the bank button 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.570
 The person who got the version blinked 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:36.580
 In this case, the child will be switching banks from the city next time 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:39.100
 If you want to go to Bank No. 2 against the first, if you want to go to No. 2 or 3 , press the cat 3 format 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:45.390
 First you will press this a 2 format 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:49.380
 Then, this time, every second time in the bank says whether to select a program 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:54.210
 At the top it will be to him it is that you do best 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.830
 It becomes superfluous say that program 1 in bank 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:01.660
 Yup 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:06.250
 If you want to return to No. 1, you can return to the position of the city ​​if you can return to the first one and so on 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:11.050
 And there is a function of one or paralysis does not now setting is 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.800
 Control Out Provides a signal to switch the amplifier channel 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.140
 Ne 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.420
 Here is this 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.320
 Loop 5 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:25.100
 Loop child has it also as a function 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:26.120
 I think that the switch of ctl and the loop has a seat in the slide bar towards this back panel 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.460
 I will 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.720
 And if we will towards the ctl to switch it no longer tells distribution itself of the loop 5 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.090
 I will do it 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:41.919
 It becomes possible to send the switching signal of the amplifier which is the older brother channel 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.169
 Channel switching amps and switching effectors While intermingling this 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.569
 Eh 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.569
 That very high sound making is possible 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.199
 And of course such a form heat transfer in some of you also equipped with a break-out 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:04.130
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:06.980
 In but was tuned while producing 10 tuning is possible Imaoto This Mon 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:11.680
 If you want to do this mute switch 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.680
 When I this is is is here I am reading there and since they are already with 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:21.440
 In this way it allows you to leave tuning temperature 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:23.090
 Japan is by all means useful when you stand by silently between songs such as mc 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:29.180
 I think if you can 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:32.040
 Built-in A or power supply arrangement of the of to the picture built-in effect board in the direction of here 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:37.950
 The one that is the choice of cable 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:41.060
 I think today each store specialists will of in the cage and fortunately or if you can contact us 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.060
 Thank you very much
