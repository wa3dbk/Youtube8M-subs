00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
it's almost embarrassing kind of but it

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.449 
it's almost embarrassing kind of but it
is<00:03:27.580> it's<00:03:27.910> still<00:03:28.209> really<00:03:28.450> cool<00:03:28.780> but<00:03:29.080> if<00:03:29.530> they

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
is it's still really cool but if they

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.850 
is it's still really cool but if they
punched<00:03:30.850> over<00:03:31.060> I<00:03:31.570> think<00:03:31.840> all<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.170> instead<00:03:32.800> of

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
punched over I think all the instead of

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.140 
punched over I think all the instead of
just<00:03:33.010> punching<00:03:33.340> over<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.580> two<00:03:33.730> letters<00:03:34.030> they

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
just punching over the two letters they

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.060 
just punching over the two letters they
screwed<00:03:34.420> up<00:03:34.540> i<00:03:34.630> think<00:03:34.660> they<00:03:34.900> punched<00:03:35.260> over<00:03:35.440> the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
screwed up i think they punched over the

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.850 
screwed up i think they punched over the
full<00:03:36.310> name<00:03:36.519> now<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.030> it's<00:03:38.019> hard<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.350> see<00:03:38.620> unless

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
full name now so it's hard to see unless

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.259 
full name now so it's hard to see unless
you<00:03:39.040> really<00:03:39.190> look<00:03:39.459> at<00:03:39.610> it<00:03:39.760> now<00:03:39.850> but<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.150> is<00:03:40.239> a

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
you really look at it now but it is a

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.030 
you really look at it now but it is a
little<00:03:40.480> bolder<00:03:40.930> than<00:03:41.080> it<00:03:41.230> was<00:03:41.350> before<00:03:41.500> so

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
little bolder than it was before so

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.190 
little bolder than it was before so
there's<00:03:42.550> one<00:03:42.850> like<00:03:43.209> I<00:03:43.300> said<00:03:43.480> one<00:03:43.690> camera<00:03:44.170> angle

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.780 
there's one like I said one camera angle
or<00:03:44.530> is<00:03:44.620> kind<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:44.860> funny<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.130> look<00:03:45.340> at<00:03:45.519> but<00:03:45.670> if

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
or is kind of funny to look at but if

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.449 
or is kind of funny to look at but if
you're<00:03:45.880> just<00:03:46.000> looking<00:03:46.090> at<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.510> I<00:03:47.200> guess<00:03:47.769> right

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459
