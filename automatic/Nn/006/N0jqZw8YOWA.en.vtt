see<00:06:27.639> the<00:06:27.760> browser's<00:06:29.100> they<00:06:30.100> both<00:06:30.250> power<00:06:30.490> up

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
see the browser's they both power up

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.250 
see the browser's they both power up
pretty<00:06:30.880> quickly<00:06:31.350> and<00:06:32.350> let's<00:06:32.470> try<00:06:34.050> the<00:06:35.050> New

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
pretty quickly and let's try the New

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.360 
pretty quickly and let's try the New
York<00:06:35.410> Times<00:06:35.500> real<00:06:35.919> quick<00:06:36.100> what<00:06:36.639> should<00:06:36.790> pop<00:06:36.970> up

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
York Times real quick what should pop up

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:46.710 
York Times real quick what should pop up
and<00:06:39.370> let's<00:06:39.580> try<00:06:39.729> it<00:06:39.790> over<00:06:40.030> here

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.240 

okay<00:06:47.440> then<00:06:47.620> i'll<00:06:47.710> push<00:06:47.860> these<00:06:47.980> at<00:06:48.130> the<00:06:48.160> same

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
okay then i'll push these at the same

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.940 
okay then i'll push these at the same
time<00:06:48.520> you<00:06:48.610> can<00:06:48.760> see<00:06:48.910> just<00:06:49.120> how<00:06:50.020> fast<00:06:50.350> they're

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:52.950 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.380 

so<00:06:53.950> you<00:06:54.010> can<00:06:54.130> see<00:06:54.250> the<00:06:54.340> desire<00:06:54.610> loaded<00:06:54.970> a<00:06:55.060> tad

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390 
so you can see the desire loaded a tad

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.990 
so you can see the desire loaded a tad
bit<00:06:55.600> quicker

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.990 

probably<00:06:58.720> due<00:06:58.840> to<00:06:58.870> the<00:06:59.130> 1<00:07:00.130> Giga<00:07:00.370> her<00:07:00.520> process

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
probably due to the 1 Giga her process

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.880 
probably due to the 1 Giga her process
ER<00:07:01.090> and<00:07:01.900> then<00:07:02.560> let's<00:07:03.040> take<00:07:03.160> a<00:07:03.190> look<00:07:03.430> at<00:07:03.870> the

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:04.890 
ER and then let's take a look at the

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.780 
ER and then let's take a look at the
pinch<00:07:05.890> to<00:07:06.040> zoom<00:07:07.470> just<00:07:08.470> nice<00:07:08.620> classic<00:07:09.610> on<00:07:09.730> the

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:09.790 
pinch to zoom just nice classic on the

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.730 
pinch to zoom just nice classic on the
iphone<00:07:10.090> then<00:07:10.960> we'll<00:07:11.080> look<00:07:11.170> at<00:07:11.320> it<00:07:11.440> on<00:07:11.590> the

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:11.740 
iphone then we'll look at it on the

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:18.960 
iphone then we'll look at it on the
desire<00:07:16.200> right<00:07:17.200> that's<00:07:17.500> screen<00:07:17.800> so<00:07:18.640> we<00:07:18.700> can<00:07:18.760> see

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:18.970 
desire right that's screen so we can see

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:26.700 
desire right that's screen so we can see
close-ups<00:07:19.450> of<00:07:19.570> this<00:07:23.160> so<00:07:24.160> you<00:07:25.090> can<00:07:25.240> see<00:07:25.390> the<00:07:25.710> the

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:26.710 
close-ups of this so you can see the the

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.700 
close-ups of this so you can see the the
clarity<00:07:27.160> on<00:07:27.190> the<00:07:27.400> AMOLED<00:07:27.850> it's<00:07:28.090> really<00:07:28.360> nice

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:28.710 
clarity on the AMOLED it's really nice

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.650 
clarity on the AMOLED it's really nice
in<00:07:29.710> much<00:07:29.920> much<00:07:30.280> sharper<00:07:30.760> colors<00:07:31.210> I'm<00:07:31.480> sure

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:31.660 
in much much sharper colors I'm sure

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.450 
in much much sharper colors I'm sure
with<00:07:31.870> a<00:07:31.900> with<00:07:32.350> the<00:07:32.440> iphone<00:07:32.710> for<00:07:32.980> that<00:07:33.220> would

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:33.460 
with a with the iphone for that would

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.430 
with a with the iphone for that would
all<00:07:33.580> change<00:07:33.610> with<00:07:34.000> it<00:07:34.680> 326<00:07:35.680> or<00:07:35.919> retina<00:07:36.220> display

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 
all change with it 326 or retina display

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.670 
all change with it 326 or retina display
whatever<00:07:38.440> they're<00:07:38.770> calling<00:07:38.950> it<00:07:39.660> so<00:07:40.660> overall<00:07:41.590> I

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 
whatever they're calling it so overall I

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.640 
whatever they're calling it so overall I
think<00:07:41.800> both<00:07:42.610> devices<00:07:43.000> are<00:07:43.180> great<00:07:43.990> devices<00:07:44.290> I

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:44.650 
think both devices are great devices I

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.340 
think both devices are great devices I
think<00:07:45.550> the<00:07:45.640> iphone<00:07:45.940> 4<00:07:46.360> comes<00:07:46.990> out<00:07:47.140> will<00:07:47.320> be

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:47.350 
think the iphone 4 comes out will be

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.710 
think the iphone 4 comes out will be
much<00:07:48.310> more<00:07:48.550> of<00:07:48.669> a<00:07:48.730> battle<00:07:49.090> for<00:07:49.240> the<00:07:49.300> desire<00:07:49.690> and

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720 
much more of a battle for the desire and

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.480 
much more of a battle for the desire and
I'm<00:07:49.990> not<00:07:50.110> sure<00:07:50.140> it<00:07:50.740> would<00:07:50.860> be<00:07:51.010> able<00:07:51.070> to<00:07:51.250> handle

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:51.490 
I'm not sure it would be able to handle

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.610 
I'm not sure it would be able to handle
it<00:07:51.580> but<00:07:52.450> in<00:07:52.540> terms<00:07:52.570> of<00:07:52.870> this<00:07:52.960> battle<00:07:53.320> I<00:07:53.380> think

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:53.620 
it but in terms of this battle I think

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.510 
it but in terms of this battle I think
the<00:07:53.770> desire<00:07:54.390> edges<00:07:55.390> out<00:07:55.540> the<00:07:56.440> iphone<00:07:56.770> 3gs<00:07:57.340> in

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 
the desire edges out the iphone 3gs in

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.620 
the desire edges out the iphone 3gs in
