00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.340
 or the free market food now that 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.260
 does not work what is the droid motorola 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.610
 they are nike 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.610
 sad national 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.980
 and what is included in the equipment 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.980
 obviously it is 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.510
 your box 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.510
 the cable of him 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:31.420
 for boozer for projects for 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.800
 create the tablet htc hd mini mini tablet 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.610
 and its wall charger 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.610
 your ballots 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.230
 and well the team will have a lot 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.030
 the month of using it meets a new 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.030
 that have their half 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.790
 and therefore specifically speaking the 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.140
 jesus team 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:59.500
 in its hardware we find that this is 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:02.800
 has a dual-core 1.2 processor 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:07.140
 on a 4.3-inch screen both 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:11.250
 touch with your buttons here so 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.300
 Regulatory Android with two 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.300
 options the back and the search 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.790
 remove with a camera with the 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.900
 8 megapixel resolution with 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.860
 full hd 1080 pixel recording 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:31.880
 like the screen plays the video 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:37.659
 in high definition flash led its 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.210
 distilled microphone and product speaker 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.740
 something very good for this team is the 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.180
 recordings of the microphones account 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.490
 with me here back 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.060
 another here front for the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.240
 yes we are 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.229
 talk about the video we can improve served 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.920
 here its 3.5 jack connector its cable 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:04.360
 mini usb your input hdmi 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.180
 and on that side his front camera 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.140
 and it looks like it's 1.3 megapixels its 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.490
 Proximity notifications etc 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.490
 and good a screen 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.510
 as I mentioned four proven points 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.420
 at the moment the team has the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.710
 jingle grade 2.306 next to 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.460
 connect the lighting handling 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:35.770
 directly with the motorola 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.480
 and good its own interface of them 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.270
 it's a little 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.430
 different than what happened week 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.870
 while notifications 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.870
 and well well, really 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.340
 have one can acquire saying access 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.450
 to 10 of the brand for example the webtop 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:02.049
 for for this for a buyer with 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.549
 different options of the hdmi and so on 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.439
 in terms of storage that counts 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.439
 with an internal memory of 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:18.530
 8 8 gb expandable obviously with account 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.530
 with its lots here on this side 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.990
 yes 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.549
 for microsd to turn that also 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.549
 has its slot for the micro sim 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.159
 The equipment is designed with material that 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:43.349
 speak tough shelf just like 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.349
 this spill resistant 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.450
 of water 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.060
 the design for action of the previous one is 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:58.849
 then only in the 900 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:01.040
 in 1900 and is that this account has already been 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.680
 of having is a little more force the other 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.130
 side pulls out it cuts because it has a 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.660
 300 battery 3300 from 1000 amperes 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:14.569
 which gives considerable autonomy the 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.780
 battery compared to other equipment 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.579
 so basically you are using 3G and yes if 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.830
 it lasts two days or so 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.870
 or if they say some are very doubtful that 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.419
 may be using in the wifi and 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.300
 all everything and I will roughly complete them 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.210
 practically giving the maximum user 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.050
 and if you notice the difference in finding 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.199
 of all other equipment 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.760
 how can your interfaces be seen 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.860
 property 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.700
 of the motorola but we do not really know 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.480
 what is 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.480
 Your camera 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:56.590
 and exquisite 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:59.980
 it's quite practical he has 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.930
 where do the autofocus expropriate is 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.290
 autofocus because while we 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.260
 we say this is also on par in the 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.620
 video we should do the same the 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:14.090
 movement of being recorded 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.090
 in using the secondary camera 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:23.150
 and we have different options quite 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.150
 useful has account with sun 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.230
 pretty good 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.370
 We wanted was to change 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.580
 for example a recording if we want 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:43.990
 approach this as an iphones guy like that is 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:47.350
 the sun is quite practical for when 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:52.200
 we want to focus on aspects 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.200
 and good was the camera 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.399
 practically then you get to know the 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.919
 large teams find programs 

00:05:56.399 --> 00:06:00.919
 all your abilities 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.450
 this works perfectly with the network 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.730
 3g obviously of cancer management and 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.520
 for example the speakers the player 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:16.310
 if it fits a bit compared to the 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.310
 others have many practices 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:24.540
 and the susana speaker quite discreet 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.540
 at last 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.060
 when this happens more or less in what 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.090
 includes the equipment 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.480
 also has gb.ram which gives 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.670
 quite 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.249
 and good these situations regarding the 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.649
 hardware 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:45.829
 and what's interesting this team is a 

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:49.489
 more equipment for those who need 

00:06:45.829 --> 00:06:52.579
 something for absorbed and also great 

00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:54.080
 battery capacity and well that would be 

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:56.060
 all 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.520
 any doubt or lack are of the 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.520
 inheritance and thank you very much for your attention
