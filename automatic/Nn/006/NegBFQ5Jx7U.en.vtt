well<00:03:26.670> this<00:03:26.849> shoe<00:03:27.060> after<00:03:27.450> he<00:03:27.540> comes<00:03:27.750> with<00:03:28.049> a

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
well this shoe after he comes with a

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
built-in velcro tab on the back and I

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.119 
built-in velcro tab on the back and I
think<00:03:33.540> that's<00:03:33.659> really<00:03:33.900> cool<00:03:34.140> pretty<00:03:34.890> simple

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
think that's really cool pretty simple

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.059 
think that's really cool pretty simple
concept<00:03:35.519> but<00:03:36.560> someone<00:03:37.560> had<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.709> come<00:03:37.829> up<00:03:38.040> with

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
concept but someone had to come up with

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.789 
concept but someone had to come up with
it<00:03:38.310> first<00:03:38.549> so<00:03:38.909> ultra<00:03:39.599> did<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:39.959> one<00:03:40.769> other

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
it first so ultra did it one other

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.080 
it first so ultra did it one other

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
feature with the Lone Peak 1.5 is this

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.619 
feature with the Lone Peak 1.5 is this
flap<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.750> extends<00:03:46.319> out<00:03:46.500> from<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.160> outsole

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
behind the heel altar calls this a trail

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.819 
behind the heel altar calls this a trail
runner<00:03:52.370> basically<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.489> is<00:03:53.640> supposed<00:03:54.180> to

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
runner basically it is supposed to

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.800 
runner basically it is supposed to
enhance<00:03:55.829> your<00:03:56.160> balance<00:03:56.910> control<00:03:57.569> and

enhance your balance control and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.399 
enhance your balance control and
stability<00:03:58.340> say<00:03:59.340> when<00:03:59.519> you're<00:03:59.640> coming<00:03:59.940> down<00:03:59.970> a

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
stability say when you're coming down a

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.899 
stability say when you're coming down a
steep<00:04:01.409> singletrack<00:04:01.950> descent<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.609> making

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
steep singletrack descent and making

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.360 
steep singletrack descent and making
tight<00:04:03.120> switchback<00:04:03.629> turns<00:04:03.900> are<00:04:04.859> something

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
tight switchback turns are something

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.180 
tight switchback turns are something
along<00:04:05.489> those<00:04:05.609> lines<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:06.359> I<00:04:06.890> don't<00:04:07.890> know<00:04:07.950> if<00:04:08.069> it

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
along those lines I I don't know if it

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.000 
along those lines I I don't know if it
really<00:04:08.370> does<00:04:08.549> anything<00:04:08.849> or<00:04:09.120> not<00:04:10.010> be

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
really does anything or not be

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.369 
really does anything or not be
interesting<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:11.700> try<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.239> shoot<00:04:12.540> without<00:04:13.019> the

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
interesting to try to shoot without the

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.159 
interesting to try to shoot without the
flat<00:04:13.590> bone<00:04:13.799> there<00:04:13.950> maybe<00:04:14.129> trim<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.519> off<00:04:14.780> but<00:04:15.780> it

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
flat bone there maybe trim it off but it

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.110 
flat bone there maybe trim it off but it
certainly<00:04:16.410> doesn't<00:04:16.709> negatively<00:04:17.010> affect<00:04:18.000> the

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
certainly doesn't negatively affect the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.969 
certainly doesn't negatively affect the
performance<00:04:18.299> of<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.810> shoe<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.799> might

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
performance of the shoe and it might

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:32.960 
performance of the shoe and it might
have<00:04:20.010> some<00:04:20.430> advantage

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.610 

so<00:04:33.970> just<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.360> sum<00:04:34.570> up<00:04:34.600> here<00:04:34.990> some<00:04:35.470> of<00:04:35.560> the

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
so just to sum up here some of the

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.470 
so just to sum up here some of the
performance<00:04:36.190> features<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:36.700> really<00:04:37.270> liked

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
performance features I really liked

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.440 
performance features I really liked
about<00:04:37.630> this<00:04:37.960> shoe<00:04:38.700> definitely<00:04:39.700> a<00:04:39.910> bomber

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
about this shoe definitely a bomber

I'm<00:05:32.380> super<00:05:32.740> psyched<00:05:32.920> on<00:05:33.160> the<00:05:33.310> shoe<00:05:35.070> could<00:05:36.070> be

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
I'm super psyched on the shoe could be

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
the first zero drop shoe that I ended up

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.990 
the first zero drop shoe that I ended up
going<00:05:38.470> wrong<00:05:38.800> in<00:05:38.980> the<00:05:39.070> mountains<00:05:39.430> with<00:05:39.610> I

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
going wrong in the mountains with I

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.470 
going wrong in the mountains with I

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
think with its stability with the zero

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.880 
think with its stability with the zero
drop<00:05:43.750> and<00:05:44.410> wide<00:05:44.860> stable<00:05:45.490> platform<00:05:45.730> and<00:05:46.890> that

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
drop and wide stable platform and that

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.980 
drop and wide stable platform and that
sacrificing<00:05:48.700> cushion<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:49.600> underfoot

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
sacrificing cushion and underfoot

protection<00:05:50.140> it<00:05:50.680> could<00:05:50.830> make<00:05:51.010> a<00:05:51.040> great<00:05:51.280> fast

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
protection it could make a great fast

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.050 
protection it could make a great fast
