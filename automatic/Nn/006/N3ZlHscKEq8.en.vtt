00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.130

 the presentation is still flat 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.460
 and that you fit 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.700
 I think so 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.670
 unique concept is with 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.810

 became the platform 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.969
 so we can't whine 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.489
