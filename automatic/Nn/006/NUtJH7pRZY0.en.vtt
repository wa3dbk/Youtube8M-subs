00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
confusing now as we all know if we take

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.050 
confusing now as we all know if we take
11<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:37.470> subtract<00:02:37.830> five<00:02:38.099> from<00:02:38.129> it<00:02:38.489> we<00:02:38.610> get<00:02:38.760> six

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
11 and subtract five from it we get six

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.990 
11 and subtract five from it we get six
that's<00:02:39.720> how<00:02:40.050> we'll<00:02:40.260> remember<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.739> day
