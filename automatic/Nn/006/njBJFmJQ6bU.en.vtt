00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.030
 in the second video I want to tell you 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.080
 how it is implemented 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.730
 implemented phone functionality 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.079
 operating system android 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:11.179
 use of gas for this purpose 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.079
 prepared a second apparatus 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.199
 security who will make calls from 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.259
 which will be a complex price 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.579
 this unit 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:21.169
 let's begin now 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.339
 there are two main job databases 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.339
 details this is functional 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.820
 in the call history and from here you can 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.939
 fall age will not dial the number 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:32.660
 force 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.780
 and old auto character hastily 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.780
 contacts 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.390
 click next go to history 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.190
 calls 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.190
 call history is incredibly simple 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.380
 here is the Russian language 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.380
 not tsitseron fouls order 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.830
 in which they were committed 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.780
 and Lebanon 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.640
 interesting below the oldest 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.900
 no sorting and no filtering 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.020
 messenger if 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.820
 not one person calls 250 shot 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.820
 ranked these calls in a row 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.720
 and if that is glad this question is what 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.100
 can 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.700
 clip on contact and 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.960
 drink a beer card and in 2008 either dial 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.970
 the number of the translation for the memory reported by those who 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.820
 either do something else 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.490
 if you click on the street 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.600
 here it is 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.680
 the call to that number will begin 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.960
 in which call history is saved 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.630
 now number dial number on games 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.950
 Rybinsk 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.660
 as you know 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.660
 with the mandate is not implemented here that is 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.520
 I can't do the numbers 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.410
 automatically produce 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.380
 by contact 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.030
 cant chair 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.180
 This means nothing 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.880
 here help documents can 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.660
 just keep some number 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.910
 which was recorded mashkin spot which 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.810
 are needed 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.600
 but also there is a demagogue 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.930
 visa classic driver 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.890
 but let's say 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.670
 at the megaphone 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.009
 even such sad news 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.939
 the device supports if a day but 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.059
 half 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:16.979
 if a 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:18.699
 our request assumes 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:19.709
 instant 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.400
 instantly bytes of information is valid 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.420
 balance asterisk that they decide who you are not 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.349
 get a lot 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.519
 very reminded of swagger lattice 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:27.619
 and further 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:29.869
 percentage getting to the window 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:32.419
 actionable interface 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.949
 plate looked balance deuce petition 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.949
 not just something else 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:41.539
 but that's all 

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.889
 Kherson head no tools 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.229
 which will allow me 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.909
 put a roller one two and so on 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.489
 everything is logical that nothing should be 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.489
 press day 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.329
 enjoy what you saw 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.739
 actually all 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.469
 sometimes not very happy note 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:58.799
 move on 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.799
 self-serving cups subscription is not necessary 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:05.129
 in my opinion 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.739
 note that this episode 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.459
 giant inscription cues years 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.609
 which doesn't even fully fit the peak 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.259
 percent 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:16.189
 as usual contacts represented 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:16.870
 lists 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.709
 on top of 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.739
 two buttons start contract someone else 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.029
 contact or otherwise 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:22.289
 My profile 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:25.379
 with the bear next are contacts 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.579
 collected signatures certain letters but 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:28.389
 here 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.489
 your attention dental contacts 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.689
 thank you lattice and further all the rest 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:35.689
 office rival right name last name 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.659
 human phone display already 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.620
 inside the cartoon that's probably not needed 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.109
 for someone plus 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:43.659
 in my opinion 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.969
 looks nice functionality 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:47.419
 it's not bad too 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:48.889
 contact card looks like this 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:49.979
 way 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.049
 a mystery 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.809
 all information is boring screen habit 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:57.209
 rims 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.259
 huge part by fit exactly 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.009
 half remains empty 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:03.129
 for the time being he doesn't know why so 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:04.209
 done 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.399
 Apparently the developers 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:10.509
 what is it beautiful 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:11.829
 there is 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.180
 hamsters floor multiple screens main 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.699

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.349
 proper lists 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.349
 in Moscow now search 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.659
 this issue 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:25.990
 farther 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.229
 such is shooting 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.279
 gather here 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:32.279

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.710
 In this case, I have 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.349
 about something from two hundred places of the event 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.509
 and the last fight is often 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.590
 used contacts 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.860
 which cost the last either 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.300
 who often called r 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.469
 in which I often called 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:56.650
 Here is the address book 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.580

 is this 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.460
 to bow 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.819
