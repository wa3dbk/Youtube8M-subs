00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.460
 Hi everyone, how are you today's video? 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.560
 be teaching you to do a hairstyle 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.050
 I like to use both the 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:29.279
 day to day how much to go out to some 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:33.730
 place and such that it is a kanu in the form of 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.380
 life and always there with a ponytail 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.310
 then to make this hairstyle before but 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:43.510
 what we will need is you 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:47.710
 these are a hair clip I think 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.380
 so that each of silicone and amateur 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.880
 hair then to begin I think the 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:58.710
 People have to do is share the 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.710
 What do you want the mohawk to be? 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.570
 and that this part of that only so the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.580
 size you want to freeze more 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.690
 movie brings finer you like more 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.690
 broad stride 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.730
 I'll keep looking forward enough 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.730
 what 's in the mirror of us 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.350
 So we hold the work close. 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.049
 to hold the rest of the hair to 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.049
 Can we make the alliance? 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:50.060
 the event there are now we will start to 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.920
 to dance then just divide here a 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.920
 section of the front of the hair 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.290
 divided into three parts and start 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:11.580
 braiding is now going to 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:17.450
 People are going to pick up a lock from the left. 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.450
 add that and go over 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.099
 imagine right and go over 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.650
 and do this until you finish everything 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.650
 this hair we had separated 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:09.340
 And then when your hair is done, make a 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.340
 normal braid until finished 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.550
 it's just 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.170
 use that silicone handle 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.269
 1 to 1 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:55.170
 now it 's done we'll let go 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.170
 the hair and make the ponytail 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:33.889
 I like to put on the amateur so 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.650
 full of details and such or if you 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:40.479
 want to pass also gives the hair on 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.479
 around him to get the same hair 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:59.300
 there now as I have many of these 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:03.280
 shorter hair and I'll pass 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.280
 a little spray to hold 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.889
 I at the end is at the discretion of each 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:46.889
 a transit we made 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:51.300
 You can also release it or leave it in 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:54.419
 ends up being a detail in the support of 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.479
 horse and then this is the end result 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.889
 I really hope you liked it.
