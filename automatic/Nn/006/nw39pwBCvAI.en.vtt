00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.719
Na na na  na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:17.400
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.480
A honeymoon ever done

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.480
with the man you married when you were twenty
years

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.230
eaten by a compact fire
and proud in claim damages

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.680
Who was to be married for many years
and had recently decided

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.680
Now he does not have birthdays
He lives in a photo album

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.090
Last day past
inside the giant iron

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.090
Losing a son, a husband
Losing a father, a brother

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.940
Stuck tapes and sparks
without the facilities to extinguish the fire

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.940
Many families turned into butterflies fire
for people who denies salary

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:11.539
Thyssen
Thyssen

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:17.659
you will answer in a day
Thyssen

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.659
Thyssen
with the tribute of sleep

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:31.959
Sixteen hours on duty
The hours are hot steps

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:40.799
Without the memory of the day
Without the noise of the sun

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.909
Rollers who eat human lives
to fatten profit

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.159
deafs to the expectations and endless vigils
for food and clothes and rent

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.159
Names remain suspended
like nails on dark

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.560
Even the back of the months
sweats a dry suicide

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.200
Thyssen
Thyssen

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.329
you will answer in a day
Thyssen

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.779
Thyssen
with the tribute of sleep
