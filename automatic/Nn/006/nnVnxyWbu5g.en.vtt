00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.330
 the tutorial of the classroom and here we are going to 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.610
 learn how to put and take the ball 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.070
 let's start spinning in a ball in 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.420
 We are going to throw the waist for the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.900
 left 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.700
 to maintain with an average speed the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.770
 moment we go to you to get it out 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.960
 is to put the right hand back 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.300
 and we will upload it by passing it 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.680
 in front of us upwards the 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.990
 movement that we are going to do with the hand 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.360
 will start with the right hands the 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.210
 let's put back with the hand with the 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.660
 forgiveness palm up and when I 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.660
 when we change it, the palm will remain 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.160
 turning this movement in front 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.370
 we're going to start by putting your hand 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.320
 right stuck in the back and the ula 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.210
 ula is you will be playing the hand 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.110
 whenever I go back there is 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.110
 when you should take out 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.520
 has been from each hand and when there is a 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.520
 fence and back there is 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.150
 and the palm since going back up 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.860
 and opposite 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.140
 the next move that we're going to 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.430
 to do is to put it in, let's do what 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.220
 same as we did with the right hand 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.500
 but we're going to do it the other way around 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.420
 when in a bull go opposite we go to 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.820
 raise the left hand with the palm 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.500
 turning around with us that's how 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.360
 let's grab the classroom when I go 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.830
 in front of us we put the hand and we lower it is 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.630
 the same movement that we did with the 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.940
 right that happened in front of us 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.760
 but now the left does 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.900
 opposite things depends on us 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.900
 and it will reach back 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.400
 good this was from a classroom tutorial 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.740
 I hope you have served many 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.120
 two other tips and they are very easy 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.120
 practice and play badly
