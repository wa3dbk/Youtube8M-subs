00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
so the next thing we want to look at is

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.959 
so the next thing we want to look at is
the<00:02:01.409> white<00:02:01.619> arrow<00:02:01.860> tool<00:02:01.979> what<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:02.579> can<00:02:02.729> do<00:02:02.850> with

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the white arrow tool what we can do with

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.800 
the white arrow tool what we can do with
this<00:02:03.380> pretend<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.500> trace<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.950> object<00:02:05.399> here

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
this pretend you trace this object here

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.150 
this pretend you trace this object here
if<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.899> click<00:02:07.049> away<00:02:07.259> now<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.619> can<00:02:07.799> click<00:02:08.009> on

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
if you click away now you can click on

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.339 
if you click away now you can click on
individual<00:02:08.670> anchor<00:02:08.940> points<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.479> manipulate

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
individual anchor points and manipulate

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.040 
individual anchor points and manipulate
them<00:02:10.970> with<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> lighter<00:02:12.300> 02

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
them with the lighter 02

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.440 
them with the lighter 02
look<00:02:13.890> here<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.430> can<00:02:14.670> actually<00:02:14.940> click<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.300> this

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
look here I can actually click on this

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.090 
look here I can actually click on this
and<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:17.280> can<00:02:17.460> now<00:02:17.640> manipulate<00:02:17.820> point<00:02:18.480> by<00:02:18.630> point

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
and I can now manipulate point by point

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.370 
and I can now manipulate point by point
but<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.220> shape<00:02:20.490> looks<00:02:20.520> like<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:22.260> that's

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
but the shape looks like so that's

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.310 
but the shape looks like so that's
pretty<00:02:22.560> powerful<00:02:23.000> if<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.120> have<00:02:24.270> actually<00:02:24.870> i'm

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
pretty powerful if I have actually i'm

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.960 
pretty powerful if I have actually i'm
going<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.530> create<00:02:25.680> an<00:02:25.830> ellipse<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.400> see<00:02:26.820> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
going to create an ellipse and see the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.070 
going to create an ellipse and see the
difference<00:02:28.790> if<00:02:29.790> i<00:02:29.910> click<00:02:30.150> here<00:02:30.540> on<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:30.690> point

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
difference if i click here on this point

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.950 
difference if i click here on this point
now<00:02:31.290> get<00:02:31.560> handlebars<00:02:32.480> because<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.660> isn't

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
now get handlebars because this isn't

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.720 
now get handlebars because this isn't
this<00:02:34.080> as<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.290> curved<00:02:34.560> object<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.400> now<00:02:35.580> i<00:02:35.610> can

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
this as a curved object so now i can

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.580 
this as a curved object so now i can
actually<00:02:36.510> manipulate<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:37.080> ellipse<00:02:39.590> like

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
actually manipulate this ellipse like

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.550 
actually manipulate this ellipse like
this<00:02:40.740> effectively<00:02:41.220> minimal<00:02:41.610> arms<00:02:42.560> that's

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
this effectively minimal arms that's

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.180 
this effectively minimal arms that's
just<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.800> good<00:02:43.950> option<00:02:44.130> know<00:02:44.490> about<00:02:46.040> that<00:02:47.040> you

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
just a good option know about that you

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.890 
just a good option know about that you
can<00:02:47.340> do<00:02:47.460> so<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.300> next<00:02:48.330> thing<00:02:48.510> we<00:02:48.660> want<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.840> look

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
can do so the next thing we want to look

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.170 
can do so the next thing we want to look
at<00:02:49.110> are<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.830> ninth<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.280> Linda<00:02:50.670> scissor<00:02:50.880> school

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
at are the ninth to Linda scissor school

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.510 
at are the ninth to Linda scissor school
that's<00:02:51.540> under<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.810> eraser<00:02:52.290> tool<00:02:52.320> so<00:02:53.160> you

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
that's under the eraser tool so you

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.240 
that's under the eraser tool so you
click<00:02:53.730> it's<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.120> tear<00:02:54.510> off<00:02:54.600> menu<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.830> eraser<00:02:56.190> is

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
click it's a tear off menu the eraser is

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.030 
click it's a tear off menu the eraser is
pretty<00:02:56.910> simple<00:02:57.150> just<00:02:57.480> go<00:02:57.960> into<00:02:58.200> anything<00:02:58.560> you

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
pretty simple just go into anything you

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.180 
pretty simple just go into anything you
hover<00:03:00.000> over<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.600> click<00:03:00.660> down<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.350> hold<00:03:01.560> this

hover over and click down and hold this
one<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:03.330> race<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.810> give<00:03:03.960> you<00:03:04.080> some<00:03:04.260> blank

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
one to the race and give you some blank

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.070 
one to the race and give you some blank
space<00:03:04.760> so<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.030> more<00:03:06.480> important<00:03:06.810> thing<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:06.990> the

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
space so the more important thing is the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.520 
space so the more important thing is the
scissor<00:03:07.320> tool<00:03:07.560> if<00:03:08.550> I<00:03:09.260> have<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.350> object
