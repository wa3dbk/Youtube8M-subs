00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 250 million years ago in our 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.040
 planet earth there were some forms of 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.650
 awesome life these are known 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.110
 as dinosaurs these animals managed 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.630
 dominate the earth for a long time 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.730
 they existed from dwarf hunters the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.850
 size of a chicken until giant 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.430
 herbivores of 60 meters managed to dominate 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.180
 terrestrially land in the air 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.250
 and in the ocean but 65 million ago 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.500
 years a meteorite hit the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.050
 terrestrial atmosphere causing a great 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.850
 explosion and an energy wave ever 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.829
 felt by no other animal and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.890
 blocking sunlight for many 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.950
 years thus ending the planet of the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.880
 dinosaurs 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.500
 but 65 million years later 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.780
 scientists from all over the planet have done 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.890
 a great discovery that would change to 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.890
 world completely 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.800
 sir we have found the DNA of the 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.019
 last species and males and females already 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.320
 are ready to be sent to mount 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.320
 yes already 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.330
 but what nobody imagined happened 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.610
 ah 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.019
 or not
