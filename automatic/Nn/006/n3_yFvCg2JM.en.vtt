 a cup of coffee with a good glass of wine today 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.390
 without time being the master of our time 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.250
 I know many people who constantly complain about perkins live 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.560
 below their standard level of how they would like p 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.630
 there are many people who would like to have a higher quality of life than 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.880
 the current one 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.500
 but you know how they behave like what they do 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.940
 nothing speaks and that's it 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.430
 there are only a few people who start to do chat 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.069
 something to you to really reach 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.490
 the goals he set himself 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.390
 many people believe that change is a long and arduous journey I have 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.169
 made of sacrifices by force of will 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:14.489
 but is not so 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.489
 change can take place in the Enlightenment 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:23.429
 have you ever been an old coach athlete at a time of the season 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:27.299
 sporting where everything was going but everything was right 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.009
 whatever myths do succeeded 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.799
 luca toni when he became top scorer in the Serie A championship 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.959
 with the Florentine jersey at the 2005 2006 contract season a goal made 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.169
 4 in the Italian cup winning the golden shoe 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:49.519
 he said in an interview that something like this has never happened to him 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.799
 that just touched the cream with any part of the body though 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.089
 open mistakes or valgus faces 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:03:00.399
 the following year iwata interview luca toni said that he also had 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:02.239
 the place type experience 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.019
 and that is that unfortunately there are days when everything goes wrong 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.659
 days of time 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.849
 where any initiative 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.129
 if one takes it cut 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.019
 any attempt that one ends up with nothing 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.839
 that you are already 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:24.300
 during the game you are spitting you can also shoot important a thousand times 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.679
 but that is a drug 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:32.019
 where the difference lies and yet it was the same person 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:38.519
 he had within himself the possibility of always having the same resources as 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.479
 he would have thrown them out first 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.939
 even from the most hopeful 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:43.989

 and then I have others I want to find linens, do the most beautiful things 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.079
 of the most basic things the big difference 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.929
 but sought for the logical xico condition 

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:08.389

 in which he is at that time I have at that time the person 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:18.370

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.520
 they make us move with clay 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.479

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.050

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.570
 positivity and negativity 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.580
 never been a situation where a person maybe your wife a little 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.520
 higher 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.240
 he replied in a bad way without you having done anything so serious 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.870
 believe that person communicates 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.289
 oh ask 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.029
 to everyone always that way 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.240
 yes it is true there are also 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.900
 of the people they have 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.180
 an ugly temper 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.749
 they are grumpy 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:41.050
 from birth 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.830
 but it is more likely that up to that moment that person who has you 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.729
 he answered hypothetically badly he had the bad day 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.570
 but from those who took a fine 5 minutes first time quarrel 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.059
 with someone around you do 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:00.430
 basically it cannot be said that a bad person 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.509
 simply when you have replied in a bad way maybe you find one 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:08.509
 mood 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:13.340

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.319
 to change your status from 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:21.409
 Understanding moods is the key to understanding this change 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:24.580
 to add lecce to extinction 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.509
 our behavior 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:30.130
 and therefore our actions there is what we do 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.530
 and the result of the state of mind in which we find ourselves in that moment of the 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.240
