00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
five years ago despite any different do

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.830 
five years ago despite any different do
you<00:00:01.860> think<00:00:02.070> in<00:00:02.190> it<00:00:02.310> and<00:00:02.520> so<00:00:02.669> how<00:00:02.850> hey<00:00:03.330> well<00:00:03.689> it's

couples should raise their hands against
each<00:01:50.250> other<00:01:50.960> but<00:01:51.960> that's<00:01:52.170> my<00:01:52.439> own<00:01:52.619> personal

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
each other but that's my own personal

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.539 
each other but that's my own personal
opinion<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:53.759> i<00:01:53.820> also<00:01:54.090> don't<00:01:54.780> believe<00:01:55.740> that

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
opinion but i also don't believe that

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.580 
opinion but i also don't believe that
people<00:01:57.030> should<00:01:57.060> take<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.810> law<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.259> their<00:01:58.409> own

people should take the law in their own

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.700 
people should take the law in their own
hand<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.220> impose<00:02:00.060> penalties<00:02:00.869> when<00:02:01.380> they<00:02:01.560> have

hand and impose penalties when they have

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.570 
hand and impose penalties when they have
no<00:02:01.890> authority<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.580> do<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.140> but<00:02:04.140> again<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.770> mean

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
no authority to do so but again I mean

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.609 
no authority to do so but again I mean
that's<00:02:05.700> because<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.690> my<00:02:06.780> background<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.590> a

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619
