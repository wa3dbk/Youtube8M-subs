00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.049
 I hope you are beautiful 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.630
 super well welcome again in the 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.490
 today's video I bring you this tutorial is 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.849
 a makeup in neutral tones with a 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.770
 touch of color ideal to wear this 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.529
 look in summer or for those people 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.300
 who do not like to wear that much color 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.220
 that wants to incorporate something like that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.350
 if you want to know how to recreate what 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.390
 from there and start for me the most 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.039
 important is to apply a first pre-base 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.050
 in the face and I like this one 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.489
 smartbooks because it helps me soften the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.130
 appearance of my story also makes 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.050
 that the base last longer the base than 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.899
 I will be using that network show of 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.870
 amazonia in clay fundation it seems to me that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.730
 the tone is so johnny or something like that 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.739
 I remember and then apply by tapping 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.719
 towards the face and this technique has been 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.190
 proved and really that is the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.829
 pretty natural color there was 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.710
 surprised because the average color 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.170
 perfect my skin tone the following goes 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.379
 to be apply the concealer and in this 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.629
 case I used the urban dike the naked 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.129
 skin concealer you can use 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.600
 any concealer you have at home 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.280
 you do not have to use this but 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.799
 the coi or lately he was using and 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.390
 I love texture, it's not 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.310
 not at all heavy as I have already 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.049
 I am going to apply it in all the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.409
 areas where I want to correct and at the same 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.360
 Illuminate time and loose what I did 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.610
 was to blur it with the same brush with 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.170
 that diffuses the advance and really that 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.850
 I would have looked for another brush or a 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.729
 sponge vibrant time because it deserves 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.350
 facilitated a lot the work for 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.390
 seal the concealer I will use the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.820
 color remove until you know see if the tone 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.200
 It's banana and I like to seal it 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.030
 immediately after applying the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.310
 corrector because in this way he avoided 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.830
 that I'm quartet and as for the face 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.500
 I'm going to seal it with this compact base 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.600
 study fix again the tone in that 42 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.149
 but you can use a powder 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.479
 translucent a loose powder or that of its 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.479
 preference 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.100
 to bring a little more color and 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.090
 warmth to my face and to use this 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.130
 browser 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.619
 in fact freites chocolate light is the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.930
 half tan and I love how it smells 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.280
 delicious causes you eat it I'm going to 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.770
 apply in areas where naturally 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.450
 the sun touches my face like I 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.130
 I really would have tanned because 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.020
 that is the effect we are looking for and 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.510
 is the 3 that I have told you that goes 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.760
 front in cheek and below the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.380
 line of my jaw to see that 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.569
 aspect outlined to my nose I'm going to 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:28.010
 use the habana tone and font that comes 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.420
 in the control that is no longer like this I'm going 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.800
 to apply to the sides of my bridge 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.230
 nose because I like that effect 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.850
 profiled and also lately what 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.040
 I was applying below my lip 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.700
 because that shadow effect there goes to 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.870
 be like my lips are like this more 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.310
 pronounced more puÃ±adito I do not know how 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.170
 explain it 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.120
 the same tone that I used to 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.890
 I'm going to use my nose 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.010
 to make outline on my face because 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.530
 I want to highlight what is the height of 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.500
 my cheeks I want to give more angles to 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.680
 face and to make this one more drastic 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.420
 with its contour use again the 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.420
 banana tone and will apply it just 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.890
 under the bone of my cheek and by 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.480
 over the jawbone to 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.870
 do it like a contour well 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.370
 definite and pronounced regarding the eye 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.069
 They know that I like to advance this step 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.069
 off camera so that was 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.709
 precisely what I did and now 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.420
 I have one eye ready and as we apply 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.310
 tests on the face so that our 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.590
 makeup last longer I like to apply a 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.260
 test action paint for that theme the tone 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.299
 it's software around the eyelid and then 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.400
 the most to find with an eye shadow on 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.440
 cream tone to come with our 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.870
 first shadow of transition that is 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.060
 now anastasia soda returns to choose the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.650
 palette is the skillful but any shade 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.599
 that you have in this tone works 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.459
 and we're going to apply it over the 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.440
 basin building color from little to 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.910
 little until the desired intensity is reached 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.920
 to give more depth we are going to 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.870
 use a darker shade that 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.960
 I used scene also of the same 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.580
 palette or any shade of reddish brown 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.140
 or more intense that you have at home 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.090
 they will work and they will apply 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.310
 with a smudge brush 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.660
 directly in the basin and with the same 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.950
 think that they applied the color of 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.750
 transition what they are going to do is 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.700
 blur both colors so you do not 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.770
 see a separation but everything looks 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.690
 more blur of dark clear for 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.070
 illuminate the area below our that 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.989
 I used that shadow from above to the 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.299
 left the screen tone that is the same 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.700
 shadow that I used to seal the pre 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.650
 base in the eye you excellence can 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.680
 leave the place yes but I applied that 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.780
 shadow that is in pink tone dita cakes 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.390
 well clarita in what is the eyelid 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.700
 to give it a little more that neutral effect 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.080
 and now if we come with the color and what 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.750
 we are going to do is delineate the line of 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.080
 water and use that nix elton jumbo is 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.580
 co combat is a green apple what 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.600
 apply it as I told you the line of 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.000
 water and the base of my eyelashes 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.430
 inferior and securitas looks disastrous 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.410
 but then that sealed it with a shadow 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.930
 green also from the same palette is a 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.449
 green apples and live is called more expensive 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.000
 and what I did was seal all the pencil and 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:03.360
 then apply it below so that it does not 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.430
 I ran and as we blur 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.870
 up the color I like to blur this 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.789
 green that does not look like that 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.199
 you finished a shelter but you 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.229
 was degrading what I did was mix 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.729
 orange soda with 100 and a brush up and what 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.919
 what I did was review it where 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.630
 it ended just the green shadow to this 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.060
 point what remains is to make an outline 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.139
 so kitty and I used lately 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.090
 I was using a lot of eyeliner 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.820
 liquid I do not know because I feel like I'm 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.110
 facilitates a little more the stroke or maybe 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.509
 either because the eyeliner is the one 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:34.449
 dried up and it was like sticky taffy 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:36.639
 I do not know is chosen from the liquid is from 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:38.259
 in why yes and it only costs two dollars in 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.900
 huelva so I was not wrong with 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:43.629
 he the following is this abundant mask 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.059
 of tabs and if you want it obviously 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:47.830
 then false eyelashes and here it did not happen 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:50.289
 something that I want to show you without wanting 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.939
 wanting to hit me the tab still fresh 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.620
 of mask in the eyelid what they 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:55.210
 I want to comment is do not remove it from 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.460
 A wait that dries follow their own 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.439
 so we come with an illuminator I have 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.819
 to be using be back in wild 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:02.529
 screams I do not remember the name the ions 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:04.300
 down and we will apply it in what 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:06.309
 what is the tear to illuminate this 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.599
 area then we take a complexion and 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:08.889
 we're just going to pass it where we 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.710
 we play with the cool mask and 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.779
 magically it is removed without disaster there 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.400
 And what I was doing was adding 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.810
 a little bit of that black shadow with a little 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.360
 more of siena to give you even greater 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.300
 intensity to mark more the basin and 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.069
 then what I did was blur the 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.479
 that lines are not visible again 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.430
 marked that you go from the most 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:30.350
 dark as I told you until the lightest 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.870
 but everything so without marks 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.850
 and that's how our girl looks neutral 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.560
 with a touch of color me off camera 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.840
 I had placed the false eyelashes 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.180
 you are using the iconic the house of 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.550
 life lately are my favorites this 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.780
 like fiebrÃº wah with these lashes I'm going to 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.820
 continue when the rest what I did 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.340
 was to apply an illuminator that's from 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.870
 pop color and I do not remember the name either 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.940
 I am disinformation of the products 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.200
 I'm using, I leave them there 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.020
 down in the description box like this 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.030
 do not worry about that in terms of 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.580
 the lips was super difficult and 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.960
 had two options in mind a dark and 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.300
 a clear and tell me by the number action 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.100
 one that were clear or neutral lips 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.670
 and what I did was use a lipstick 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:13.010
 neutral that is pop color cookie and 

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:15.650
 I put a lip gloss on it 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.960
 cosmetic gerard or wine in line that is 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.540
 the same company the tone is salmon and the 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.540
 combination of both gives me a perfect
