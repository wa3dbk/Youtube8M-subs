the<00:01:27.990> construction<00:01:28.619> these<00:01:29.189> skid<00:01:29.460> plates<00:01:29.670> are

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the construction these skid plates are

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.600 
the construction these skid plates are
gonna<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.030> 3/16<00:01:30.930> anodized<00:01:31.590> aluminum<00:01:32.250> you're

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
gonna be 3/16 anodized aluminum you're

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.010 
gonna be 3/16 anodized aluminum you're
gonna<00:01:32.729> see<00:01:32.909> them<00:01:33.030> available<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.479> black<00:01:33.780> as

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
gonna see them available in black as

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.380 
gonna see them available in black as
well<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.650> silver<00:01:35.070> you'll<00:01:35.549> also<00:01:35.729> notice<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
well as silver you'll also notice and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.520 
well as silver you'll also notice and
it's<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.630> all<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.960> these<00:01:37.079> but<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:37.350> really

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
it's on all of these but it's really

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.990 
it's on all of these but it's really
clear<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.100> silver<00:01:38.400> one<00:01:38.520> over<00:01:38.729> here<00:01:38.909> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
clear on the silver one over here and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.090 
clear on the silver one over here and
this<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.119> off<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.420> Yamaha<00:01:39.869> Tenere<00:01:40.110> take<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> look

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
this is off of Yamaha Tenere take a look

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.010 
this is off of Yamaha Tenere take a look
at<00:01:41.189> those<00:01:41.280> welds<00:01:41.790> they're<00:01:42.240> going<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.420> use<00:01:42.630> TIG

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
at those welds they're going to use TIG

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.380 
at those welds they're going to use TIG
welds<00:01:43.439> not<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.310> because<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:44.850> gonna<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.210> as

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
welds not just because it's gonna be as

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.210 
welds not just because it's gonna be as
strong<00:01:45.570> as<00:01:45.899> MIG<00:01:46.140> welds<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:46.860> what<00:01:46.979> TIG

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
strong as MIG welds but really what TIG

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.039 
strong as MIG welds but really what TIG
welding<00:01:47.579> does<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.390> really<00:01:48.720> gives<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.020> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
welding does is it really gives you a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.870 
welding does is it really gives you a
nice<00:01:49.409> clean<00:01:49.860> finish<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.490> get<00:01:50.700> something

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
nice clean finish so you get something

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.399 
nice clean finish so you get something
that<00:01:50.939> when<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.119> put<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.570> your<00:01:51.750> big<00:01:51.930> expensive
