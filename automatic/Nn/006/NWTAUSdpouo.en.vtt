00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.200
 on the way and wanted to be healthy 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.519
 feed because now is the summer though 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.280
 On the way you will not always find so good 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.960
 things and many have asked me what 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.029
 I like that when I'm on the road 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.250
 and that's why I have a video here 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.050
 times from morning to night show as my 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.300
 Day looks where I shop everywhere 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.859
 go and where he is not because I am yes 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.439
 also a teacher and I do not have so much 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.179
 time to look everywhere where you are good 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.309
 what can eat but I have a few 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.719
 I would like to tell you some great tips 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.989
 and then you can do this summer too 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.850
 get your beach figure started doing 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.829
 my day always with a nice one 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.100
 have delicious coffee from nespresso there 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.289
 I encapsulate so l'espresso 12 I do 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.480
 always for a cup and then there's 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.820
 whipped cream that has high 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.489
 fat percentage and in my paleo diet 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.890
 It's about being always good to me 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.840
 take and not like many women of 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.270
 maybe avoid it 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.180
 yes important when losing weight is the fat 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.720
 second is my delicious hot 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.610
 Lemon water with frugal shazam 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.189
 I'll link you here below 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.770
 video you can buy and indeed 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.009
 chia sahm contain a lot of omega 3 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.990
 fatty acids and help you lose weight 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.400
 the hot water is poured here 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.380
 and I have half a lemon left 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.960
 it's super stimulating 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.890
 fat burning at generally really good 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.659
 to be the cia 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.000
 I always drink a lot in the morning 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.820
 so here again my 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.710
 green Japanese traveled left finds 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.079
 her back down here in the infobox 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.030
 just pour hot water over it 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.759
 Also this tea is great for the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.290
 burning fat and just let yourself so 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.899
 to pull up to two minutes 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.610
 that's enough if you take the longer 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.799
 pull it then he seems rather tired 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.930
 or you will 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.700
 faster, always very short 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.009
 let it go here then it starts with 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.290
 My breakfast was a fresh one 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.420
 condrey with delicious flax seeds 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.880
 different types of fruit and whole 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.159
 important I have back here to 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.350
 fat burning and delicious coconut 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.069
 Coconut flakes you actually get in 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.510
 to buy every supermarket 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.760
 yes, after the training I have 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.319
 supplied with protein and here always 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.349
 my tip i always go to the 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.450
 fresh counter to kaisers and look what 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.860
 just to the offer is because with me must 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.510
 it be organic meat 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.939
 Here you can still see me 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.670
 Another tuna salad bought at 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:33.099
 two bananas and as I said 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.200
 paléo balls I have from the 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.269
 bought the fresh counter you can see here 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.879
 which always pays so in everyone 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.849
 Actually, everyone likes fresh food too 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.980
 buy or at every butcher in the evening 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.799
 Then there was my last meal 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.829
 was this here that turkey with 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.480
 fresh basil from our garden 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.459
 and I did noodles but 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.129
 not any noodles but 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.530
 I make special paléo noodles 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.750
 zucchini and I cut myself 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.970
 very thin strips lies completely 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.859
 short in hot water then the so 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.260
 a bit soft and then you have like 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.000
 such a noodles noodles replacement but 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.319
 Much better because we always 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.040
 take care that we as possible 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.409
 a lot of vegetables a day yes tomato sauce 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.560
 simply tomato paste passed tomatoes 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:23.260
 everything is nicely spiced and flavored 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.090
 that then made my poor bread eat yes 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.319
 that's just an example what 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.180
 I eat the day 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.209
 you see I eat a lot I eat 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.949
 especially healthy i nibble myself and 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.160
 eat me especially good too 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:37.629
 fat fed because I try the 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.069
 carbohydrates as possible from mine 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.430
 to get vegetables 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.980
 and very little noodles or almost none 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.410
 Noodles rice also shun less or 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.840
 also to abandon bread completely like 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.579
 said to drive the paléo rail when 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.470
 you still have questions about mine 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.480
 eat around my diet or to my 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.400
 I would ask you for training that you 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.500

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.239
 then I will help you, good us 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.560
