just been through it's over T and the
only<00:00:27.779> problem<00:00:28.169> we're<00:00:28.289> having<00:00:28.319> earlier<00:00:29.039> with

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
only problem we're having earlier with

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.909 
only problem we're having earlier with
it<00:00:29.640> at<00:00:29.759> the<00:00:29.880> moment<00:00:29.909> is<00:00:30.569> it<00:00:30.810> does<00:00:31.019> tend<00:00:31.409> to<00:00:31.560> cut

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
it at the moment is it does tend to cut

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.810 
it at the moment is it does tend to cut
out<00:00:32.720> when<00:00:33.720> it<00:00:33.840> comes<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.829> traffic<00:00:35.070> lights<00:00:35.250> or

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
out when it comes to traffic lights or

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.920 
out when it comes to traffic lights or
Junction<00:00:36.780> they<00:00:37.620> shouldn't<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.930> it

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
Junction they shouldn't do that it

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.720 
Junction they shouldn't do that it
should<00:00:40.200> light<00:00:40.530> up<00:00:44.030> now<00:00:46.310> what<00:00:47.310> that<00:00:47.550> would

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
should light up now what that would

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:56.980 
should light up now what that would
indicate<00:00:48.500> is<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.560> the<00:00:49.860> carbs<00:00:51.050> dirty

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.830

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.660 
just remove the rio grande muraille for
the<00:01:31.409> moment<00:01:31.829> because<00:01:31.920> I've<00:01:32.100> been<00:01:32.219> a<00:01:32.280> little

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the moment because I've been a little

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.099 
the moment because I've been a little
bit<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.850> work<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.210> shock<00:01:33.450> absorbers<00:01:37.609> sue

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109 
bit of work on the shock absorbers sue

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:40.700 
bit of work on the shock absorbers sue
be<00:01:40.109> finished

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
be finished

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.849 
be finished
I<00:01:41.689> had<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.899> completely<00:01:45.170> clean<00:01:46.170> down<00:01:47.299> sent<00:01:48.299> down

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
I had to completely clean down sent down

00:01:48.859 --> 00:02:06.149 
I had to completely clean down sent down
and<00:01:50.060> respray<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.950> exhaust<00:01:53.310> pipe

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.250 

then<00:02:06.789> what<00:02:07.149> you<00:02:07.270> have<00:02:07.329> to<00:02:07.479> do<00:02:07.840> is<00:02:08.830> special

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
then what you have to do is special

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.240 
then what you have to do is special
slightly<00:02:11.260> more<00:02:11.470> expensive<00:02:13.680> high<00:02:14.680> temperature

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
slightly more expensive high temperature

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.680 
slightly more expensive high temperature
paint<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:18.640> it's<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.819> job<00:02:19.030> well<00:02:19.180> worth<00:02:19.360> doing

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
paint but it's a job well worth doing

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.259 
paint but it's a job well worth doing
because<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.319> was<00:02:20.470> rusty<00:02:20.950> it's<00:02:21.790> still<00:02:21.970> one<00:02:22.150> or

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
because it was rusty it's still one or

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.880 
because it was rusty it's still one or
two<00:02:22.390> traces<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.989> probably<00:02:23.260> needs<00:02:23.410> do<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.620> again

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
two traces it probably needs do it again

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.740 
two traces it probably needs do it again
actually<00:02:26.640> but<00:02:27.640> it's<00:02:27.760> better<00:02:27.940> than<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.269> was

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:42.750 

ask<00:02:31.620> for<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.390> remaining<00:02:33.390> crow<00:02:34.220> on<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.280> bike
