00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.980
 I'm going to show you how to get one 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.990
 waterfall braid 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.549
 i made a divorce something in it 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.039
 in the middle a little to the left and julia 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.900
 has a lot on it so I can go to the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.850
 side 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:33.210
 if the hair is a length q just the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:40.110
 front bring no here a tuft of hair 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:47.070
 look that split in two and you go 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:51.289
 orbit each other at a time though 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.289
 then grab a tuft from the top 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.520
 you let them pick between the two 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.520
 full and then you twist more 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.369
 its pluck from the top 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.090
 drop the break between and then 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.090
 twitch again 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.460
 and so too nice of those tufts in between 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 on 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.469
 or 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.310
 well how can you do some things 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.990
 can go all the way around and up to and including 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.049
 the other side 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.850
 You can also say I stop halfway and 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.459
 I pack on the other hand I go 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.340
 do the same and then I do the flowers 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.230
 on you can do this in two days is that 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.410
 you did slightly higher and you did it 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.489
 do it yourself again 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.599
 actually have a lot here 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.599
 possibilities 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:30.730
 in this case I'm gonna get him stuck here 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.730
 with an elastic band 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.590
 so that's a side and now I'm actually going 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.180
 do it yourself 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.920
 on the other hand and I like it 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.930
 if it's a bit of shaving cream 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:03.880
 comes out and that there is then a flower 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:06.880
 how could something so difficult to see stars 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.880
 to turn 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.890
 it is this first time 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.690
 come back 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.299
 that of rubber band 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.300
 such a contrast 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.479
 look three at the button 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.570
 just don't have a waterfall
