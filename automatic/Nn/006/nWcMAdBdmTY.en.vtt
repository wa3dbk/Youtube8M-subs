00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.080
 simply the technician informed us that 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.420
 the sun or Tuesday afternoon he us 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.299
 He says he only meets inform 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.270
 that the directive is already tired of 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.759
 us and that he does not love us and 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.810
 that he complies with informing that he does not 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.810
 we will continue on campus 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.160
 the current technician was informed that 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.160
 we are not going to break our 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.559
 contract because apart from the way 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.420
 we are being taking either campus 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.480
 at no time he approached some 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.019
 directive to reach an agreement or 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.150
 send you a letter of dismissal 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.440
 then we if we do not show up 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.839
 the training also fulfilling 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.079
 our our contract we could leave 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:54.120
 meanwhile then 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.620
 we would continue to see Maya training 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.329
 Do not give us clothes that do not leave us 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.059
 between the dressing room we have to continue 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.390
 fulfilling and now the stadium 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.890
 present civilian but be attend 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.289
 to not look bad for non-contractual 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.640
 not the other one, we'll have guidelines 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:10.020
 from the guild we are very well 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.080
 advised 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.670
 we will see what 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.830
 that things are done in a good way 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.350
 truly 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.310
 for all this it happened in a row 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.310
 because we are 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.750
 we are from here of the state I stayed 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.050
 good lucid caribbean but represented the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.050
 state 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.060
 and the name that you have so that you 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.579
 do these things 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.320
 in this way no less regrettable 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.470
 we hope that 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.710
 let the boys take a letter in business 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.200
 and that I know 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.590
 do not lend themselves to this, not because 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.820
 things are going to keep happening yes yes no 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.850
 if you do not step forward because in 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.710
 true the situation that the team that 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.799
 I lived back there as we go 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.109
 things doing it for the guild 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.799
 we get important things 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:10.379
 let's hope it does not happen again 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.120
 and well, I'm really calling you 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.610
 mayor of the state governor who already 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.140
 you see that today the 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.310
 training for lack of 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.400
 of food in the restaurant was passed to 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.920
 the morning at 5 in the afternoon when 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.050
 when that can not happen a team and 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.830
 that's good the consequences of that 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.740
 we did the steps today in 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:42.060
 the morning the technician change 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:46.990
 not the speech but it says something that does not 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.330
 said yesterday yesterday what 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.090
 that now also goes through a theme of the 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.150
 that will not allow us to enter 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.860
 dressing room and he will not give clothes 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.299
 and that will do everything possible so that 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.370
 we can not enter the stadium 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:04.129
 where in the end 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.310
 the subject of the technician also gives me a lot 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.230
 I dislike too much because because 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.400
 final ended ratifying so that it came 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.980
 when we already leave in this way 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.069
 that is after we fight the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.439
 everyone's rights 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:24.120
 As I say to you, it 's just a 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.120
 retaliation on the part of managers
