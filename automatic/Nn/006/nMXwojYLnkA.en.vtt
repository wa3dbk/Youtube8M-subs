00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
lot of training I guess lots of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.010 
lot of training I guess lots of
different<00:01:08.940> kinds<00:01:09.179> of<00:01:09.240> things<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.690> hard<00:01:09.929> for

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
different kinds of things it's hard for

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.260 
different kinds of things it's hard for
me<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.289> remember<00:01:10.459> it's<00:01:11.459> hard<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:11.789> me<00:01:11.910> to<00:01:12.060> know

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
me to remember it's hard for me to know

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.870 
me to remember it's hard for me to know
what<00:01:12.539> to<00:01:12.569> what<00:01:13.170> training<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.679> did<00:01:13.740> because<00:01:14.280> my

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
what to what training I did because my

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
what to what training I did because my
coach<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.569> worked<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:15.959> close<00:01:16.140> together<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
coach and I worked so close together and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.469 
coach and I worked so close together and
I<00:01:16.649> put<00:01:16.860> my<00:01:17.009> trust<00:01:17.039> in<00:01:17.369> him<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.789> he<00:01:18.330> basically

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
I put my trust in him so he basically

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.089 
I put my trust in him so he basically
tells<00:01:18.899> me<00:01:18.990> what<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.319> and<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.530> do<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.860> no<00:01:20.069> I

00:01:20.089 --> 00:01:20.099 
tells me what to do and I do it no I

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:21.740 
tells me what to do and I do it no I
don't<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.520> weights<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:20.940> I<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.209> lot<00:01:21.300> of<00:01:21.539> stuff

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
don't do weights but I do a lot of stuff

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.199

off<00:01:21.929> the<00:01:21.990> climbing<00:01:22.500> wall<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.890> climb<00:01:23.399> probably

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:24.209 
off the climbing wall I climb probably

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.180 
off the climbing wall I climb probably
like<00:01:24.360> 60<00:01:24.690> 70<00:01:25.110> percent<00:01:25.440> and<00:01:25.560> then<00:01:25.709> the<00:01:25.830> rest<00:01:26.039> is

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
like 60 70 percent and then the rest is

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.130 
like 60 70 percent and then the rest is
training<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.729> use<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> peacemaker<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.660> lot<00:01:27.899> to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
training I use a peacemaker a lot to

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.809 
training I use a peacemaker a lot to
make<00:01:28.259> sure<00:01:28.380> my<00:01:28.470> fingers<00:01:28.770> are<00:01:28.860> strong<00:01:29.039> and<00:01:29.220> also

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
make sure my fingers are strong and also

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.510 
make sure my fingers are strong and also
to<00:01:30.030> try<00:01:30.660> and<00:01:30.780> rehab<00:01:31.470> my<00:01:31.619> fingers<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.130> well<00:01:32.280> when

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
to try and rehab my fingers as well when

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.100 
to try and rehab my fingers as well when
I<00:01:32.550> do<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.910> injured<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.420> think<00:01:33.810> that's<00:01:33.929> really

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
I do get injured I think that's really

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.260 
I do get injured I think that's really
important<00:01:34.739> to<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.399> on<00:01:35.489> the<00:01:35.610> fingerboard<00:01:35.910> and

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
important to be on the fingerboard and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.029 
important to be on the fingerboard and
doing<00:01:36.660> things<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.929> are<00:01:37.080> controlled<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.890> can

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
doing things that are controlled you can

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.919 
doing things that are controlled you can
also<00:01:38.160> gain<00:01:38.399> a<00:01:38.459> lot<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.700> strength<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.179> way<00:01:39.330> and

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
also gain a lot of strength that way and

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.139 
also gain a lot of strength that way and
I<00:01:40.289> do<00:01:40.349> a<00:01:40.470> lot<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.649> stuff<00:01:41.429> from<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> gimme<00:01:41.910> craft

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
I do a lot of stuff from the gimme craft

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:43.969 
I do a lot of stuff from the gimme craft
work<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.509> well<00:01:42.660> and<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.140> try<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.500> mix<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> up

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
work as well and I try and mix it up

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.770 
work as well and I try and mix it up
quite<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> lot<00:01:44.489> well<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.910> thought<00:01:45.179> I<00:01:45.209> do<00:01:45.330> my<00:01:45.599> coach

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
quite a lot well I thought I do my coach

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.419 
quite a lot well I thought I do my coach
does<00:01:46.050> so<00:01:46.289> I'm<00:01:46.410> pretty<00:01:46.770> much<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.069> see<00:01:47.220> whatever

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
does so I'm pretty much to see whatever

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.999 
does so I'm pretty much to see whatever
he<00:01:47.849> tells<00:01:48.000> me<00:01:48.300> to<00:01:48.330> I<00:01:48.750> think<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.739> don't<00:01:49.890> know

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
he tells me to I think that I don't know

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.080 
he tells me to I think that I don't know
him<00:01:50.099> it's<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.310> we're<00:01:50.399> taking<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.759> seriously

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
him it's that we're taking it seriously

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.669 
him it's that we're taking it seriously
maybe<00:01:51.300> it's<00:01:51.509> just<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.929> opportunity<00:01:52.560> is

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
maybe it's just that the opportunity is

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.859 
maybe it's just that the opportunity is
that<00:01:52.860> there<00:01:53.130> aren't<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.729> many<00:01:53.789> coaches<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
that there aren't so many coaches and

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.109 
that there aren't so many coaches and
climbing<00:01:55.289> not<00:01:55.830> an<00:01:56.069> elite<00:01:56.369> level<00:01:56.489> anyway<00:01:56.940> and

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
climbing not an elite level anyway and

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.089 
climbing not an elite level anyway and
it<00:01:57.209> it<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.720> difficult<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.410> find<00:01:58.560> someone<00:01:58.950> who

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
it it is difficult to find someone who

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.130 
it it is difficult to find someone who
you<00:01:59.250> work<00:01:59.459> well<00:01:59.700> with<00:01:59.729> it<00:02:00.420> took<00:02:00.599> mark<00:02:00.929> and<00:02:01.080> I<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
you work well with it took mark and I a

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.869 
you work well with it took mark and I a
long<00:02:01.379> time<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.830> learn<00:02:01.979> how<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.399> work<00:02:02.700> together

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:02.879 
long time to learn how to work together

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:05.270 
long time to learn how to work together
because<00:02:03.300> it<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.569> relationship<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.739> and<00:02:05.069> you

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
because it is a relationship so and you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.859 
because it is a relationship so and you
have<00:02:05.429> to<00:02:05.580> nurture<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.060> look<00:02:06.300> after<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.750> and

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
have to nurture it and look after it and

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.990 
have to nurture it and look after it and
we've<00:02:07.560> really<00:02:08.069> found<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.399> balance<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.879> works

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
we've really found a balance that works

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.420 
we've really found a balance that works
well<00:02:09.300> for<00:02:09.330> us<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:09.929> it's<00:02:10.500> not<00:02:10.709> easy<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.280> I'm

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
well for us but it's not easy and I'm

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.070 
well for us but it's not easy and I'm
sure<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.790> would<00:02:11.910> agree<00:02:11.970> with<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.810> I

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
sure you would agree with that and I

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.570 
sure you would agree with that and I
don't<00:02:13.140> think<00:02:13.320> I'm<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.560> very<00:02:13.830> easy<00:02:14.100> person<00:02:14.340> to

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
don't think I'm a very easy person to

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.310 
don't think I'm a very easy person to
work<00:02:14.730> with<00:02:14.910> but<00:02:15.330> somehow<00:02:15.540> he<00:02:15.690> puts<00:02:15.990> up<00:02:16.110> with<00:02:16.200> me

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
work with but somehow he puts up with me

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.860 
work with but somehow he puts up with me
so<00:02:16.530> that's<00:02:16.650> good<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.330> but<00:02:18.330> yeah<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.480> don't<00:02:18.600> know

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
so that's good and but yeah I don't know

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.990 
so that's good and but yeah I don't know
if<00:02:19.020> if<00:02:19.680> it's<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.070> that<00:02:20.310> there<00:02:20.640> are<00:02:20.760> many

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
if if it's just that there are many

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.190 
if if it's just that there are many
coaches<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.540> that's<00:02:21.690> why<00:02:21.810> there<00:02:21.990> are<00:02:22.080> many

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
coaches so that's why there are many

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.690 
coaches so that's why there are many
athletes<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:22.770> mark<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.400> were<00:02:23.520> lucky

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
athletes but mark and I were lucky

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.220 
athletes but mark and I were lucky
enough<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.970> find<00:02:24.060> each<00:02:24.360> other<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.600> like<00:02:25.080> a

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
enough to find each other and like a

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.750 
enough to find each other and like a
close<00:02:25.500> enough<00:02:25.740> vicinity<00:02:26.220> for<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.460> to<00:02:26.580> work

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
close enough vicinity for it to work

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.540 
close enough vicinity for it to work
well<00:02:27.030> but<00:02:27.540> yeah<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.140> was<00:02:28.350> already<00:02:29.010> making<00:02:29.280> world

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
well but yeah I was already making world

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.610 
well but yeah I was already making world
cup<00:02:29.760> finals<00:02:30.150> without<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.660> coach<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.350> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
cup finals without a coach but the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.640 
cup finals without a coach but the
amount<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.550> has<00:02:32.700> brought<00:02:33.120> me<00:02:33.240> on<00:02:33.420> is

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
amount that it has brought me on is

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.900 
amount that it has brought me on is
unbelievable<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.800> it's<00:02:34.920> hard<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.250> describe<00:02:35.520> I

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
unbelievable and it's hard to describe I

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.120 
unbelievable and it's hard to describe I
think<00:02:36.210> I<00:02:36.360> guess<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.080> shows<00:02:37.260> what<00:02:37.560> he<00:02:37.740> can<00:02:37.920> do

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
think I guess it shows what he can do

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.860 
think I guess it shows what he can do
and<00:02:38.310> then<00:02:38.460> yeah<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:38.970> think<00:02:39.180> it's<00:02:39.480> definitely

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
and then yeah I think it's definitely

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.290 
and then yeah I think it's definitely
changing<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.440> sport<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:40.920> yeah<00:02:41.730> be<00:02:41.940> excited

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
changing the sport and yeah be excited

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.640 
changing the sport and yeah be excited
to<00:02:42.390> see<00:02:42.420> where<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.750> can<00:02:43.020> gets<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.350> with<00:02:43.440> more

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
to see where it can gets it with more

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.260 
to see where it can gets it with more
research<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.190> more<00:02:44.280> money<00:02:44.550> put<00:02:44.910> into<00:02:45.090> the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
research and more money put into the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.270 
research and more money put into the
research<00:02:45.540> behind<00:02:45.840> on<00:02:46.290> how<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.560> train<00:02:46.920> how<00:02:47.220> to

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
research behind on how to train how to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.310 
research behind on how to train how to
get<00:02:47.490> better<00:02:47.640> at<00:02:47.910> climbing<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.870> think<00:02:49.080> it's

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
get better at climbing so I think it's

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.990 
get better at climbing so I think it's
gonna<00:02:49.440> be<00:02:49.590> really<00:02:49.740> exciting<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.400> guess<00:02:50.790> it's

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
gonna be really exciting I guess it's

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.370 
gonna be really exciting I guess it's
different<00:02:51.060> every<00:02:51.540> year<00:02:51.570> because<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.110> have<00:02:52.260> to

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
different every year because you have to

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.810 
different every year because you have to
juggle<00:02:52.560> injuries<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.370> have<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.640> juggle

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
juggle injuries and you have to juggle

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.490 
juggle injuries and you have to juggle
your<00:02:54.000> training<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.690> also<00:02:55.020> what<00:02:55.170> else<00:02:55.320> is

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
your training and also what else is

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.160 
your training and also what else is
going<00:02:55.770> on<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:56.010> your<00:02:56.100> life<00:02:56.280> but<00:02:57.210> for<00:02:57.870> me<00:02:58.020> this

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
going on in your life but for me this

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.110 
going on in your life but for me this
year<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.440> definitely<00:02:59.130> tape<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.640> little<00:02:59.940> bit

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
year I definitely tape it a little bit

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.180 
year I definitely tape it a little bit
but<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:00.990> get<00:03:01.290> yeah<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.500> don't<00:03:01.560> really<00:03:01.860> know<00:03:02.010> why<00:03:02.160> I

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
but I get yeah I don't really know why I

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.410 
but I get yeah I don't really know why I
did<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.520> think<00:03:02.670> my<00:03:02.760> training<00:03:03.060> sessions<00:03:03.330> were

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
did I think my training sessions were

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.510 
did I think my training sessions were
shorter<00:03:03.840> but<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.319> don't<00:03:04.620> know<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.890> tend<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.340> have

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
shorter but I don't know I tend to have

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.860 
shorter but I don't know I tend to have
quite<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.790> lot<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.000> fun<00:03:06.150> when<00:03:06.330> I'm<00:03:06.420> training<00:03:06.630> and

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
quite a lot of fun when I'm training and

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.910 
quite a lot of fun when I'm training and
that's<00:03:06.990> one<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.260> most<00:03:07.380> important<00:03:07.770> things

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
that's one of the most important things

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.250 
that's one of the most important things
for<00:03:08.160> me<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.460> to<00:03:08.670> enjoy<00:03:09.060> climbing<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.840> if<00:03:10.140> I'm

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
for me is to enjoy climbing and if I'm

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.780 
for me is to enjoy climbing and if I'm
not<00:03:10.290> enjoying<00:03:10.860> training<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.340> climbing<00:03:11.670> I

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
not enjoying training and climbing I

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
think my coach just kicks me back onto

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.600 
think my coach just kicks me back onto
the<00:03:13.170> wall<00:03:13.290> makes<00:03:13.560> me<00:03:13.650> do<00:03:13.740> a<00:03:13.770> load<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.130> knows<00:03:14.370> and
