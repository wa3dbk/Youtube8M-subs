 life and learn the secrets 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.929
 of society and the economy 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.420
 those of politics and media like us 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.390
 to be concealed 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.390
 why, yes, maybe you should not 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.210
 So now know why it comes and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.910
 it does not accompany the wars moore 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.420
 friends of the classic malt bottle with 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:37.559
 14 years old indigenous balanced 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:41.370
 balanced space page yes why 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.680
 why they come together 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.390
 popular answer in hamburger harbor 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.450
 stands a banana crooked bending machine 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.940
 that makes the track to groups I know 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.809
 I made children ask adults 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.300
 like some apples and why 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.590
 why it sometimes smaller than you stay 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.469
 We were the example of the case but is 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.570
 smaller than praise yes because you are a woman 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.490
 why are women smaller than men 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.200
 as a genetic condition why is that ? 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.689
 genetically conditioned and I do not know 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.890
 No idea what to do with the smart 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.020
 to think about it 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.310
 questioning that may be the case 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.090
 child, there's something else 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.330
 they do not answer 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.930
 but you see where she goes I have 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.030
 ultimately sold my old car and 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.450
 Why did I sell often has broken 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.420
 and why was it often broken just because of it 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.009
 was old and why was it because yes 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.229
 I do not want to buy a new one and why 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.869
 We will not buy a new one because of me 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.299
 the prices for too expensive and why 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.549
 I think the prices are excessive 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.000
 yes because it is already so bad 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.200
 yes why should not that be better 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.030
 as in the same company stood 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.439
 why do not you buy from other company 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.729
 yes because all the same thing 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.729
 the same suppliers get caught 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:03.000
 you will not find a solution here we turn 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.149
 us in a circle already on the first 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.149
 question 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.520
 I imagine more than one answer 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.660
 by due because it is still old why 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.980
 I sell my car because the 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.000
 workshop is so bad that's right 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.530
 maybe I ask too much of that 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.450
 automobile 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.910
 Well , I may be asking for that 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.440
 runs properly and is silent or 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.060
 because that's how I use it too 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.350
 that's not really true now 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.060
 I then have my workshop at the 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.070
 sabotage got me things 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.530
 swapped that did not break dare 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.180
 then even near the things where 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.380
 have exchanged something else 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.130
 sabotage that then soon again 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.110
 broke down 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.240
 the workshop had to go that was because of it 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.400
 they were totally busy and 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.150
 not too long the broke so that 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.960
 I did not even notice 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.430
 Going that would be another 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.860
 They noticed that they went there too 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.340
 one is a broke broke now is one 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.690
 new on it itself likes many of the 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.280
 Employees are the same and now 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.720
 you do not have those from the top 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.080
 sabotaged or we have from below 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.430
 sabotage dangerous thing if it is the 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.900
 We sabotaged cooperation from below 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.360
 to protect a workplace that 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.150
 bit small-minded and shortsighted 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.140
 have made difficult now we go 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.820
 move away from the car the usual 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.390
 Frankish Saxon form finds youth 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.860
 No jobs why close 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.940
 why do we have that with the pisa study? 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.600
 badly finished 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:30.380
 why do doctors strike why? 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.140
 We see so little pension in the future 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.110
 I do not order a ticket to the football wm anything 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:40.790
 ask and deliver on these questions 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.989
 our media simple answers why 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.610
 we do not need any from minsk national 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.690
 the entrepreneurs are so greedy and 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.830
 exploitative the second level this 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.180
 yes but the youth say so 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.690
 poorly trained is also hears 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.370
 one yes now another level 2 and then 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.200
 in the pisa study you get to 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:03.350
 Answer yes to the pisa study is wrong 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.459
 so if we ask this deeper 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.810
 want to have answered then 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.070
 not just the normal media 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.760
 then you need the media 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.500
 lower 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.280
 I do not mean our usual 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.079
 news magazine of the printed 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.870
 papers every week manage the 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.250
 hardly deliver anymore 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.540
 You have to go in there deeper 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.300
 you have to look for books 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.590
 you read different sources until you get 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.949
 then form your own opinion 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.750
 can 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.280
 which is not steered by anyone now 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.470
 is because something wants to achieve 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.570
 so but so get a weekly 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:40.010
 they are there until level 3 or 4 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.680
 on this why ladder an answer and 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:47.120
 Now if you're on the level seven 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.880
 Eight come and look for answers there 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.460
 and they would be in the population 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:58.449
 then have it available 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:01.010
 So you revolutionize the why ladder 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.900
 Giving up if you ask for a long time and you 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.539
 the questions answered themselves and also 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.930
 after digs for answers to this question 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.930
 to get 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:13.849
 if it's an incredibly strong one 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.470
 Reply to my car 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.150
 to come back I have a car there 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.280
 Bought 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:23.020
 I have to wait three weeks for a species 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.550
 waiting schedule says the resulting 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.840
 customer unfriendly and so on me 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.880
 I see it differently I have one 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.020
 a few times why asked why do I have to 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.990
 three weeks to wait 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.960
 yes, because there in the orbit of 100 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.310
 kilometers only a workshop gives because 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.800
 there all snake stand to 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.389
 inspection date because the no 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.860
 Dates have where to go for an extra 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:45.979
 Repair someone in between 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.510
 Could because so many inspections on 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.039
 day durchge that the to the 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.389
 inspection fee more money 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.400
 earn as if they were any 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:56.510
 replace components later 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.280
 they bring their cars or keep their cars 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.580
 cars between inspections easy on 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.580
 to run 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.349
 if you ask why do you need three 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.090
 then wait weeks for the inspection 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.389
 you can not find the negative answer 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.650
 which is found at level 1 or 2 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:15.260
 but then you find an answer 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.620
 the level seven or eight namely where 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.400
 the money is earned for the 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.650
 the cars driving more money than the 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.850
 other workshops with standing 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:30.150
 cars more money earn as a fact 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:32.729
 carpenter as this may sooner because 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.300
 Collar more 14 years old thank you 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:35.300
 for watching
