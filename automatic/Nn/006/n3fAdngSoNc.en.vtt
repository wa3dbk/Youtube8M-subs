00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:03.370
 hello everyone here you have for the subcontractors goal meters for 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.080
 iphone on a sweeping and care like shouting so we come back now after 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.419
 a small period of absence since m 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.740
 corvette Christmas more and more on the scene 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.289
 there are birthdays in the pack during the holiday start period 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.329
 so we could not make videos but now we're back a fashion 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.390
 we have to represent again videos is usually three 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.769
 weekly videos like her 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:30.789
 so it's gone 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.030
 today you talk about the app that's called is greener more 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.210
 so could judge drop a moisture 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.280
 other cities 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.280
 so I was talking about the octopus this heat and good density 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.380
 so I'm happy that the project is also ideal 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.990
 drunk had real manure 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.990
 signals that lived three weeks 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.310
 search macway and we will try 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.340
 they also broke 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.340
 here it is now that prices are rising more 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.550
 so it's a bonus 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.080
 so she is paying this app 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.960
 and besides, it's a shame that 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.960
 but we'll finally take it, I'll learn it from the month 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.460
 with killed m 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.460
 with keek his suitcases 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.579
 already i'm just going to tell you what it's used for before most of 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.270
 you download it while you can not use it 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.170
 so she will be celebrating to lock the app 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.270
 so percent when someone does not agree with that assumes that you 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.440
 lend your 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.350
 your iphone up to date to impose an epic 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.979
 I did not want it to be a good message I'd like you to know 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.810
 for having locked by a fair application message the application 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.290
 messages photos etc 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.290
 against the application 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.820
 so items like what thank you for buying the product 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.029
 the nautical club the passport from the colander ditches 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:18.479
 so my opinion is first to show how we change of world sometimes a 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.189
 shortly before showing how it works 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.949
 so when you go into settings click on the little more 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:29.469
 but if you forgot your posture click on for the passport otherwise 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.979
 you click on jeanne-mance good evening so we did not say his name 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.279
 excellence in place on the front line 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.279
 so it's not enough everywhere 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.389
 he cuts 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.969
 in Afghanistan a colander 24 new trades 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:53.119
 he does not make a recipe so she is not about to fall 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.119
 so he is now new patients or what do I know 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.539
 we leave to others must follow the application brings with it 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:02.960
 the boat 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.099
 I wanted to create a small conversion lock look good 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.099
 in a quarter of an hour job because of the application 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.849
 so there is for all types of applications 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.049
 but those that can not be removed those that have been using for three months 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.519
 we can order or burglaries in process to lock riglaire 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.529
 so you click on the little comrade you see who changes color 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:25.300
 who from the road 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.389
 so I perfect 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.409
 we could leave the mode of displacement 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.869
 nicole permanently medical would be a pity 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:33.189
 boom he asks you 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.139
 he asks you for botox 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.139
 especially that this an important stock the old password 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.479
 in his lair and then I do 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:44.789
 sunday it's not going to work authentication done 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:47.789
 however, this choice 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.989
 the new crime of vehicle theft 

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:57.339
