00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 It was here that the 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.490
 no exit being juan manuel lÃ³pez 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.570
 when he was the best in his category in 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.330
 that moment itself undefeated a record 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.529
 impressive almost all won by 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.330
 knockout and comes wandering out here and you 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.289
 stole the show sometimes 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.900
 it's the ninth time 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.970
 now seen I called the when I was going to 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.710
 fight against the machine co and he gave me 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.230
 I encourage you to feel like what it is like 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.780
 possible that a platoon two fights in the 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.160
 fight for a world title and that it 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.350
 he was the champion and that brings him all the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.250
 half-hearted desire and everything is another 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.170
 Puerto Rican more good, this is 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.820
 a job and it's the rival that touched me 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.790
 now another Puerto Rican has to 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.860
 give you have to prepare to give a 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.019
 great show and the one that is better 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.839
 prepared that is the victorious no I do not 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.970
 I consider myself an executioner as many say 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:03.199
 out there winners to god have I had 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.840
 luck 16 that the preparation to which I 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.000
 has led to winning the fights but I did not 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.759
 I feel nothing Puerto Rican executioner of 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.829
 the one that is it and today and one of all that 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.049
 to leave everything to river 7 was his thorn 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.730
 to achieve a rematch against Miguel 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.400
 angel and garcÃ­a 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.710
 and if I stay spine because I was 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.300
 very bad seeing first the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.920
 first five or six rounds but now 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.470
 is starting to come back and goes and goes 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.660
 going up how that has affected you because 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.250
 we know that in the same way that the 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.080
 is fallen many times merits 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.690
 raised to win to achieve or yes 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.880
 because they are careless that I have had this 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.690
 can fight that they also hit hard 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.490
 and then one as he says is not from 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.980
 iron or plastic also also 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.980
 feels and also goes to the canvas 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.710
 it's like everything because it grabs enel.it 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:54.580
 up but I feel good you worry 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.310
 in a certain way that there is a decision 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.380
 localista something that favors rocky a 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.760
 defining moment of the fight for 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.980
 only but it worries all 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.160
 boxers who live here out are 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.800
 they are rivals where in the house 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.200
 of the rival not but you have to do the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.110
 things well nothing clearly for 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.210
 that there is no such controversy as 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.950
 considers 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.410
 in rocky martÃ­nez as a rival in this 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.400
 occasion was a tough rival 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.720
 and it's not going to be easier to see him fight 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.650
 it has good punch 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.280
 and you have to be very careful to make sure 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.010
 I know it's going to be a difficult fight 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.050
 like all the ones I've had this game 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.200
 it was like many when he puts cards and 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.350
 made possible if all that we are going to be able to 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.980
 score but not the size rivals 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.590
 ranked world champions 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.120
 and there's nothing left but to prepare for 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.130
 do things well and be and victories 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.840
 for the body of the body as it says 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.570
 was the body of anger when up 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.160
 here and I feel good still if I 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.670
 they arrived but a fighter who hit 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.170
 strong has a heavy hand and this 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.120
 can happen to anyone you get well 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.739
 and you and you up 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.150
 but there are many players who have had 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:18.170
 the heavy hand with you the most 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.540
 If that's the way it is, you can not have 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.550
 rivals touched that really has very 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.850
 good punch and 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.450
 and they hit me but spare and it's 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.450
 he saw ahead
