00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.559
 Jim is your race course at some cracks 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.179
 another new LED complete here 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.550
 my channel as remy you see of course 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.380
 sometimes people on youtube very quickly or 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.090
 would rather win some money in that way 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.829
 you let me go the same today 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.869
 trying in a live video is player 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.820
 prefer to press the interchange button of course 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.240
 fashion warm 3 and we have the once your 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.900
 Striking glass with the period never finished 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.699
 one thing is about frost and the predator 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.230
 missal and let's see if this 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.559
 being able to go as quickly as possible 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.629
 to win 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.090
 and there is a very simple tactic 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.920
 of course use s for that anyway 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.090
 help because with s02 of course very quickly 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.410
 the kills to take what does not everything 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.410
 to do with you 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.260
 with just your wafer costs 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.850
 of course also and second it is 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.949
 try to walk around a place 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.269
 worrying sponge to have that control 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.559
 I under my control and wallet the 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.940
 because when I get everyone up like the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.219
 tension just look 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.860
 and the third you keep strips and call them like that 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.670
 quickly as possible so dirty dirty dirty 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.440
 kempen 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.880
 so that does all then you can fly 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.840
 you simply report within three 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.890
 minutes win I have it very often 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.630
 done 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.190
 it is a very easy tactic 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.530
 just need to know 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.530
 of course how to implement it 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.810
 I dare miss my peace again and again 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.459
 then you just have the rest of you 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.140
 Scorsese may soon get back there 

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:26.160
 first go to a safe place 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.989
 are of course before your pen it 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.050
 then you would die there i must again 

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:33.390
 again and this is therefore not a safe one 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.800
 place well so boy nice thought 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.800
 goddamn cookies 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.500
 I just had to go to this side of the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.729
 Folders that breed good spawn someone with me 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.259
 but of course we have to 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.060
 Name relaxed because calorie likes me 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.739

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.020
 anyway now don't go wrong come on 7 2 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.580
 we already have 7 kills to win but me 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.869
 mom scoresby salem because if you score 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.160
 system then I want to show how 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.959
 many things can turn around but that is 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.310
 really not normal much ok we go this one 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:06.810

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.459
 where I stand now and therefore what 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.239
 more difficult truss place between tensioning net 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.239

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.630

 With six eyes, the phone was now still 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.160
 jesus about if is the kills get that 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.420
 you the PVV behind it automatically 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.400
 Jannecke agrees about Smarty Kiyoh 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.750

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.950
 player hello friend 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.510
 just don't keep going just 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.620
 stay above round gates for reason 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.690
 because those gates for raider is one 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.800
 friend you must remember your pevo de 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.910
 counter ls &amp; co 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.470
 are now three minutes to the beasts 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.750
 because at the start I am a bit annoying 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.370
 death natures 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.140
 and now everyone goes killer p team goes 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.700
 shake something about the wrong one and you 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.810
 of course there are also disputes 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.040
 you can also just walk away from one 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.070
 portable reason because you actually have one 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.270
 no longer necessary because they span naturally 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.500
 quite near me 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.060
 do you want something about is also in the 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.560
 air so you need just something 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.450
 about they let fly at the places where 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.940
 they can get a lot of kills that is 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.020
 just in the middle of the man 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.280
 then try shooting from the sky as well 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.180
 that it tells us what they can do then 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.010
 they die 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.060
 then 3 kills and comics do everything now me 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.650
 hoof itself nothing to do endeavors 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.120
 one my wallet dar 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.980
 come on out and one two three 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.180
 he walks away he helps crazy but which 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.709
 now agree is about wash do it 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.910
 once was over before the final kill 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.400
 karma runs that form 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.990
 yes thank you did you win this way 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.250
 so it is easy to be very fast 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.660
 to win free-for-all 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.550
 throw the reason portable on the spot 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.590
 where you are spawned as one 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.000
 stay around is paul hope one will see 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.590
 if they are in your port again and again 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.630
 operators planet can know exactly where 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.640
 they run through a short broader and number 3 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.080
 do you really want streets that are in the 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.190
 air don't fly where you have to go 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.810
 are predator missiles than one 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.650
 exception and win the potty 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.260
 super super fast very easy tactic 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.850
 he works super well and i would say 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.200
 test me choose for yourself 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.930
 except people look strange of course 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.200
 not even bring up kim again my 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.200
 mind 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.400
 I
