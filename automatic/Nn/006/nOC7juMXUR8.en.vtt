00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.370
 one of the most important issues and 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.830
 also that has brought much controversy 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.139
 within the analysis of this code 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.179
 criminal integral is the decriminalization of 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.469
 abortion then about his position taking in 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.360
 account that within the official block 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.879
 there are situations and positions 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.140
 opposed between oficialista is a 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.090
 democratic movement can 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.710
 positions that they want by decision 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.769
 only I think that seeing very clearly in the 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.740
 campaign when those people that now 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.480
 are we know that abortion was taken 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.210
 to photos with me to win the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.680
 elections and they knew with the position read 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.390
 our national development plan in 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.440
 which must do our action that 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.270
 do not cause so the town 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.579
 Ecuadorian where people talk about 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.890
 decriminalize abortion on the contrary 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.940
 the constitution says defend the life of 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.859
 the conception 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.570
 We talked very clear anything 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.190
 that is part of that life is simply 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.519
 betrayal and that seems to be 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.070
 happening in assembly they were taken 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.960
 decisions within the block that calls 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.750
 eat the corrupt press I say the 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.250
 24 and May not me cost me a lot 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.890
 more work 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.199
 those of loyalties and betrayals of 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.420
 supposed friends that the successes of the 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.590
 dispensing enemies that are taken 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.500
 decisions in the mouth talking about 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.300
 democracy then they make decisions and 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.210
 then they do the opposite to see 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.770
 If you take the opportunity, look at the one 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.710
 do whatever you want 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.880
 and never approve the decriminalization of 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.460
 abortion beyond what is stated in 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.650
 current law is more if it continues this 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.680
 extradition and freedoms if tomorrow 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.000
 evidence not something that is very 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.890
 regrettable that is happened in the block 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.899
 the country I will present my resignation to 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.399
 charge studying an exclusive destroy 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.830
 fed up with this 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.660
 fed up and deal with people who say a 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.119
 thing does another thing that talks about democracy 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.280
 to tell you where the national plan is 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.990
 of development when the people voted 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.240
 Ecuadorian that puts its 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.720
 principles and we all have principles and 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.009
 here is more of a major project in a 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.960
 project that is doing it with the 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.090
 people last if they are things so 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.759
 conscience that they send the substitute to 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.040
 to vote what can not be is to betray 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.550
 decisions that have been made between the 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.899
 vessel 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.689
 very clear positions that launches country 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.329
 submitted to the country so not the end 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:17.040
 and if they achieve a group of people very 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.980
 illegals 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.780
 doing very well what they want me to do 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.489
 I will immediately submit my resignation to 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.159
 charge because for the abortion I'm 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.390
 willing in my principles also for 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.340
 defend life I am willing to 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.109
 give up this in history will know 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.890
 judge president you are alluded to 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:37.680
 the analysts elected a little before 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.829
 that is the value there is a code of ethics 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.049
 that normally there are issues 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:45.030
 of principles where we can present 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.549
 an objection everyone the mind the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.340
 conscientious objection will abstain not 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.599
 they will present the alternate is 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.030
 our mind a movement within the 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.980
 block to change the decision on the 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.810
 back that is simply tradition a 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.819
 stabbing at the entrance to one's own with the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.739
 revolutionary process and the president 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.079
 of the republic I insist and I am exhausted 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.510
 this was the mara rodeos rodeos and all 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:10.250
 that people so long to the 20 loves and 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.250
 continue this and I'm exhausted
