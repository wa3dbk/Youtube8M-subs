00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.490
 We are battlefront or one in greater you 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.429
 gaming and we're going to play a battle in 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.109
 abu plains one of the maps that maybe 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.310
 are not my favorites but that is 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.109
 well enough to give him some 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.779
 variety so let's catch them at 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.609
 rebels and we're going to catch the slider 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.669
 let's see if we can get to the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.710
 speeder there is and at the moment I'm not going to 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.910
 wait for allies to arrive 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.010
 I'm going out first to try 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.780
 make as this may damage 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.660
 vehicle is a bit light bone not 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.250
 Holds so much but is very good with the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.650
 attack power that has 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.560
 well there is one that has been killed only 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.560
 with colliding with me ostia asia 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:57.550
 oysters that busting me fuck 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:00.309
 the incredible beautiful love mother that 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.710
 I just told you that the bandage 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.400
 of this vehicle nothing very good and of 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.630
 fact that this payment has destroyed me 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.830
 fuck often man that today I'm casting 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.230
 here right now web 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.140
 change improves the rebel vanguard that 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.230
 they have missile launchers and it's brutal 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.380
 you get closer 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:27.810
 mahony a very good excellent 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.810
 but death bastard fuck what 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.939
 you have to have let's see around here if 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.039
 this time this man can shoot well 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.899
 over that shot well from side and 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.310
 calculating a bit the trajectory and has 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.799
 released two missiles but still did not 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.490
 has finally given us to ride also 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.200
 in one of these 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.050
 from here you can not shoot but you 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.500
 move one pretty fast 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:56.610
 the taking of age can that macho cojones 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.310
 macho hit him on the feet 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.300
 now fuck like I'm going to make sure 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.850
 see if we're still going to finish 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.890
 losing of course the rebels in 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.039
 all the maps of 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.170
 of this kind of those that there are of sti 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.170
 spiders end up giving the empire because 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.200
 and the rebels are tremendously 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.420
 lower 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.660
 and if I hit the apple with the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.060
 what 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.220
 I'm doing this video right now because 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.000
 well at least he has not stolen this 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.940
 the turret is already an advance 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.530
 and see if I rescue some position from 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.940
 control 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.380
 there they are it seems that capturing the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.030
 imperial so I'm going to approach 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.670
 see what I can do 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.420
 runs bugger runs to see here 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.470
 imperial we are going well that is nothing more 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.470
 get there and there is no imperial 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.390
 ojito ojito good a motorcycle five for 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.470
 one of mine no no no 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.420
 what the fuck 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.640
 the Imperials are beginning to steal 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.950
 turrets in an incredible way that 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.740
 it seems quite interesting because never 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.030
 I've seen them really steal turrets or 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.680
 never to be seen in that situation of 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.230
 plan come to the area that is 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.640
 controlled by my side and take the 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.860
 turrets to shoot from close up 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.220
 in case I'm going to try to get there fast 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.700
 castrato booking and this one that has a 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.190
 hunger bonus power as it is not 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.050
 it really is the imperial pilot but 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.790
 Well, I have 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.490
 nothing does me good the shit is a 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.230
 mortar no but not good 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.270
 no direct attack you have to wait 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.270
 let 's say it 's ice 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.510
 radio what the fuck what disgusting faction 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.480
 trunk the only one that I like is this what 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.950
 I say that I like this but it is that we 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.560
 It serves as shit because the aim 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.450
 it does not allow you to point 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.450
 has been fixed on the two missiles 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.990
 and everyone goes to a place totally 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.370
 different and that there was everything 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.740
 still and more now it has gone well 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.130
 but he came to launch a goal that 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.170
 is moving and neither of coÃ±a 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.110
 and what really gets to use 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.330
 this faction very very well but nothing the 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.459
 You are tremendously superior 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.680
 against the order spiders and say 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.750
 they have a lot of firepower but heard 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.420
 facing the enemy to charge me in 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.480
 hand-to-hand combat let's say even 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:30.500
 waters because there was infantry 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.520
 but welcome to dspm the mangled 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.520
 have died and bastard 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.630
 what the hell there's more here 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.540
 see you bastard and there are only six left 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.040
 fix 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.810
 there are some maps where is 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.360
 unbalanced and the federation wins 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.770
 clones and such but all 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.690
 maps on which are the empire the 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.650
 rebellion the imbalances are a lot 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.650
 more obvious 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.090
 fuck you notice I played fucking 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.220
 ass this time is true but they have been 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.159
 98 other imperialists that is that the 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.050
 they have taken a serious stand with ball and 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.849
 even so he has killed five and look at himself 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.650

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.199
 one that has died ten tickets and has 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.580
 killed an incredible mother of mine or a 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.560
 advice trying to play with the 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.990
 rebels jesus is veron so I have you 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.990
 liked and see you in the next
