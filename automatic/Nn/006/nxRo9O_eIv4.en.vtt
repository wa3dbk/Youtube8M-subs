00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.889
 I am me, I am back in the 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.530
 channel we are in a new video more in 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.020
 this case we are going to try a new video 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.150
 of ideas so that others wolford or 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.160
 good more than ideas also things that 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.140
 can enter the game there are quite a few 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.000
 rumors of this and the good truth then 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.100
 it's one thing that many people think about and that 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.019
 you can get to the final game name 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.640
 treats is already done if you can then 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.070
 enter in some other DLCI since it is 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.930
 something quite logical and that or not because 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.920
 It can not be so good, you know 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.870
 that in this series you can send me 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.610
 your ideas so that I ask them to 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.980
 mail that you have in the description of 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.680
 georgia steals gmail.com where good 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.629
 I have many ideas the demand looks at me 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.190
 a lot of videos talking about them 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.989
 because there are many ideas that the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.579
 people that we then point out are met and 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.379
 they get into the game so good that 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.500
 let's talk in this case I will talk 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.360
 of the royal prestige are the 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.070
 prestige what good that I'm seeing 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.840
 in these photos another photo fame it is not 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.699
 real are as prestigious as BolÃ³n those of 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.560
 great master the reds the yellows 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.510
 sorry but this time lasts and then 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.880
 say that there were 15 prestige 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.760
 this is possible uncle because there is the 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.410
 little thing I do not really know if this is going to 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.970
 get in and you know that there are 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.060
 15 normal prestige after 15 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.220
 great teacher's prestige something like that and 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.720
 later would these prestigious is 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.910
 a very interesting thing because 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.220
 you know that prestige this I do not know 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.570
 what are the golden prestige called 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.580
 they give a weapon because the prestige it gives 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.910
 it's an elite weapon you know they have 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.100
 put royalty weapons imagine that 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.770
 put 15 chase more that is to say a 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.440
 unique color 45 prestige and that the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.520
 prestige number 31 of prestige number 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.870
 45 give a royal weapon more then the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.310
 true that it would be quite typical 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.640
 you know all the ones that have gotten 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.370
 example in the prestige number 31 you get 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.680
 the value ti 7 performed in 32 of 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.380
 royalty and it's still one of you know that 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.450
 there are only 10 weapons perform the game by 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.100
 so there were 5 prestigios where not 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.229
 had nothing do not have any weapons 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.220
 this is where a thing comes into play 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.649
 that I was also thinking during 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.000
 a long time and also said michael and 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.610
 with at the time he said to put 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.790
 remastered weapons 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.050
 of other colors they told him to put in it 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.150
 so well I do not know what they are 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.560
 waiting but imagine you put 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.970
 also like the ones you're seeing in 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.340
 screen is totally this credit 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.020
 of these images are obviously fake and 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.970
 They are images that made Mr. Jan 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.680
 efe - happened and told me you'll see how to 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.020
 final the most used initiation to the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.640
 use two so nothing credit for it 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.440
 it has been made grows in photoshop but 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.680
 Well, it suits my hair very well 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.130
 explain what what I have you that 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.170
 explain 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.750
 imagine an mp7 that has me weapons 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.280
 new those of mastering the mind nothing 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.959
 more comfort but they put them under the 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.090
 category of the legendary everything points 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.459
 what are the gloves would be the pic and ximo 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.200
 and I already tell you that everything points to that 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.360
 it's going to happen that now he gets the most 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.920
 new and they will put them in royalty 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.720
 because I do not think there is a category 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.580
 nothing more than for 10 weapons and the most 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.980
 sure is that there are metal or more weapons 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.450
 royalty is for example weapons like 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.100
 that of p11 there are no weapons that have not 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.750
 received is a royalty model 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.360
 those weapons, the safest thing is that they go to 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.310
 this category more royalty guns and 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.830
 also weapons like for example could 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.650
 being the one for example makes it 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.630
 like shadow stone the living room cdt or 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.950
 good that they are things that really have 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.400
 invented we are going to invent this case 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.960
 brief but it would be that not arms by 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.430
 example of others with crosses of hacr 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.560
 mp7 barrett of that ere 50 does not arms 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.790
 so typical for more than they would already 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.280
 I tell you that he already said that he was going to 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.170
 do michael with deep and it would be very very 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.640
 likely to put him in the category 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.530
 of legendary so I think that 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.320
 it would be pretty good or imagine 15 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.910
 prestige plus 10 royalty weapons that you 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.970
 give in the top ten prestige and 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.790
 after the prestige number 36 to 40 of 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.300
 forgiveness from 41 to 45 on those principles 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.220
 who sell weapons such as acr 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.750
 legendary mp7 legendary fame 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.580
 legendary the truth that it would be something very 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.440
 very epic and that to me at least 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.970
 would love to follow kids has been 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.620
 this video this is the video I already tell you 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.450
 that you have below in the description the 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.860
 mail where you can pass me many 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.590
 things I do, I think it's a good 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.720
 idea I will comment on a video and I will give you 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.489
 totally filter to you so 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.510
 nothing's worth has basically been all 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.790
 these videos but that you liked 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.470
 leave a good one I like and see you 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.740
