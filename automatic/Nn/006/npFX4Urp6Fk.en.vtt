we're<00:00:02.850> seeing<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.240> shape<00:00:03.480> model<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:03.990> Vesta

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
we're seeing a shape model of Vesta

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.099

Vesta<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.830> large<00:00:11.580> object<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> main<00:00:12.690> belt

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
Vesta is a large object in the main belt

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.580 
Vesta is a large object in the main belt
with<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> diameter<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.509> 575<00:00:15.509> kilometers<00:00:16.289> and

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
with a diameter of a 575 kilometers and

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.200 
with a diameter of a 575 kilometers and
a<00:00:17.250> shape<00:00:18.029> which<00:00:18.270> bulges<00:00:18.869> at<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.380> equator<00:00:20.210> when

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
a shape which bulges at the equator when

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.689 
a shape which bulges at the equator when
we<00:00:21.330> look<00:00:21.570> at<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> South<00:00:22.080> Pole<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.470> Vesta<00:00:23.070> we

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
we look at the South Pole of Vesta we

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.390 
we look at the South Pole of Vesta we
see<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> large<00:00:24.300> circular<00:00:24.930> depression<00:00:25.400> which

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
see a large circular depression which

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.070 
see a large circular depression which
scientists<00:00:26.910> believe<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.390> caused<00:00:27.660> by

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
scientists believe is caused by

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.160 
scientists believe is caused by
collision<00:00:28.619> with<00:00:29.189> another<00:00:29.220> object<00:00:30.170> this
