will pop hood see if I get into this

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:30.439 
will pop hood see if I get into this
thing<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:19.340> seems<00:00:20.340> rusting<00:00:20.760> everywhere

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.190 

pop<00:00:31.449> the<00:00:31.630> hood

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.670 

now<00:00:38.200> say<00:00:38.470> they<00:00:42.690> conceived<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:44.140> government<00:00:44.590> of

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
now say they conceived the government of

00:00:44.680 --> 00:01:14.880 
now say they conceived the government of
the<00:00:44.800> day

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.960 

get<00:01:15.430> your<00:01:15.640> business

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
get your business

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:33.710 
get your business
very<00:01:17.150> very<00:01:17.800> back<00:01:18.800> bowl

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.350 

you<00:01:33.900> drive<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.410> bit<00:01:34.440> more

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:46.380 

the<00:01:37.630> passenger<00:01:38.110> side

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.230 

in<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:46.750> cow

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.240 

but<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.630> head<00:01:50.840> is<00:01:50.869> quite<00:01:51.500> a<00:01:51.530> ways<00:01:51.710> back<00:01:51.979> from

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
but the head is quite a ways back from

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.609 
but the head is quite a ways back from
the<00:01:52.369> actual

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
the actual

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.130 

that<00:01:55.189> one's<00:01:55.399> ready<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.700> pop<00:01:55.939> I<00:01:56.420> think<00:01:56.960> the

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
that one's ready to pop I think the

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.630 
that one's ready to pop I think the
hitches<00:01:57.560> break<00:01:57.770> off

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:09.150 

that's<00:02:01.880> typical<00:02:02.420> for<00:02:02.600> these

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.690 

and<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:09.610> guess<00:02:09.760> the<00:02:09.940> fix<00:02:10.270> for<00:02:10.390> this

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
and I guess the fix for this

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.850 
and I guess the fix for this
is<00:02:12.000> not<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.900> fool<00:02:13.080> around<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.500> try<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.680> take

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
is not to fool around and try to take

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.890 
is not to fool around and try to take
the<00:02:13.980> other<00:02:14.129> side<00:02:14.400> photos

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.860 

to<00:02:20.319> cut<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.650> heads<00:02:20.829> off<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.549> that<00:02:21.689> we<00:02:22.689> could

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
to cut the heads off so that we could

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.660 
to cut the heads off so that we could
pull<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.620> exhaust<00:02:23.890> off

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670

Wheldon on the end of it hope for the

Wheldon on the end of it hope for the

those on the team job it's pretty

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.559

the<00:02:50.860> four-point<00:02:51.310> eat<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:51.760> five-point<00:02:52.240> trees

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
the four-point eat the five-point trees

the four-point eat the five-point trees
in<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.930> sick<00:02:53.140> leaves<00:02:53.350> all<00:02:53.620> has<00:02:53.890> us<00:02:54.130> from<00:02:54.370> with

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
in the sick leaves all has us from with

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.460 
in the sick leaves all has us from with
the<00:02:54.730> exhaust<00:02:55.060> metal<00:02:55.510> both<00:02:55.720> braking

the exhaust metal both braking

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.740 
the exhaust metal both braking
anyway

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.230 

millions<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.590> people<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:01.920> there

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
millions of people that there

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.850 
millions of people that there
probably<00:03:02.630> have<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.930> same<00:03:02.960> problem<00:03:03.560> on<00:03:03.650> their

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
probably have the same problem on their

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.880 
probably have the same problem on their
trunk

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.089 

not<00:03:09.130> leaking<00:03:09.460> now

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.740 

I<00:03:12.129> think<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.790> bolt<00:03:13.000> go<00:03:13.150> broke<00:03:13.420> when<00:03:13.599> the

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
I think the bolt go broke when the

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.030 
I think the bolt go broke when the
transmission<00:03:14.200> had<00:03:14.439> to<00:03:14.530> compose<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:14.830> get

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
transmission had to compose to get

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.809 
transmission had to compose to get
rebuilt

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.699 

just<00:03:18.420> trying<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.989> get<00:03:19.109> the<00:03:19.260> exhaust

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.010 

put<00:03:22.069> it<00:03:22.160> not<00:03:22.280> stress<00:03:22.640> on<00:03:22.849> it<00:03:22.880> although<00:03:23.690> they<00:03:23.959> do

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
put it not stress on it although they do

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.380 
put it not stress on it although they do
break<00:03:24.380> on<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.830> off<00:03:24.920> they're<00:03:25.160> on<00:03:25.310> their<00:03:25.459> own

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
break on the off they're on their own

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.060 
break on the off they're on their own
I<00:03:27.420> think<00:03:27.900> that's<00:03:28.050> what<00:03:28.230> happened<00:03:29.660> anyway<00:03:30.660> I

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
I think that's what happened anyway I

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.930 
I think that's what happened anyway I
have<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.190> live<00:03:32.370> with<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.610> for<00:03:32.790> now

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
have to live with it for now

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.240 
have to live with it for now
he<00:03:33.750> drives<00:03:34.050> it<00:03:34.230> until<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.500> break<00:03:34.770> two<00:03:34.980> or<00:03:35.100> three

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
he drives it until I break two or three

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.890 
he drives it until I break two or three
more<00:03:35.430> maybe<00:03:35.670> it's<00:03:35.820> really<00:03:36.330> loud<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.720> have

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
more maybe it's really loud and I have

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.830 
more maybe it's really loud and I have
no<00:03:37.080> choice<00:03:37.320> with<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.680> stick<00:03:38.450> that's<00:03:39.450> all<00:03:39.690> for

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
no choice with the stick that's all for

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.870 
no choice with the stick that's all for
now
