00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
copy my movements in the game it looks

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.130

type<00:01:55.380> turbine<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.250> I've<00:01:56.399> had<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.789> try<00:01:57.090> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
type turbine so I've had to try and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:32.270 
type turbine so I've had to try and
reproduce<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.289> best<00:01:58.500> at<00:01:58.680> twice<00:01:59.039> as<00:01:59.220> I<00:01:59.340> can

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.490 

Shh<00:02:32.580> I'm<00:02:33.090> hoping<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.810> arms<00:02:34.319> will<00:02:34.470> be

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
Shh I'm hoping that the arms will be

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.470 
Shh I'm hoping that the arms will be
fully<00:02:35.490> functional<00:02:36.740> as<00:02:37.740> in<00:02:38.010> one<00:02:38.550> arm<00:02:39.270> is

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
fully functional as in one arm is

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.230 
fully functional as in one arm is
holding<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.900> gun<00:02:40.080> up<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.880> will<00:02:41.880> bring<00:02:42.120> it

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
holding the gun up and will bring it

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.410 
holding the gun up and will bring it
down<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.870> other<00:02:42.920> will<00:02:43.920> come<00:02:44.190> up<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:45.180> my

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
down and the other will come up and my

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.400 
down and the other will come up and my
robotic<00:02:45.900> handle<00:02:46.260> class<00:02:46.530> that's<00:02:49.670> beyond<00:02:50.670> and

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
robotic handle class that's beyond and

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.880 
robotic handle class that's beyond and
I've<00:02:52.410> spent<00:02:52.860> in<00:02:53.190> excess<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.330> six<00:02:55.020> pounds<00:02:55.739> on<00:02:55.860> it

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
I've spent in excess of six pounds on it

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.870 
I've spent in excess of six pounds on it
so<00:02:56.190> far<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:58.080> final<00:02:58.530> push<00:02:58.680> obviously<00:02:59.280> being

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
so far the final push obviously being

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.020 
so far the final push obviously being
