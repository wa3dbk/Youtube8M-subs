 the dark portal and the fall of ben by mint guarcax corcos and humans while 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.630
 that in Jaen he prepared the horde for his invasion of Azeroth 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.910
 doctor continued to fight for his soul against assange hours 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:13.639
 the king win 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.790
 noble monarch must storm began to realize the darkness that 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.259
 It seemed to contaminate the spirit of his old friend 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.369
 he shared his concerns with we noticed the last descendant 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:26.859
 of lineage will do here 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.649
 although he had named his lieutenant in arms 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.310
 even then 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.670
 none of them could imagine that the slow descent of mehdi baala madness 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.650
 would bring the horrors that were to come 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.140
 as final incentive sarge days promised to give it great power abound if 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.070
 he agreed to take the horde to do oct 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.210
 by measures 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.550
 sargentas told the sorcerer that he could become a living god if 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.860
 I found the underwater tomb where the buin guardian had placed the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.860
 shattered body of sargé heras almost a thousand years ago 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.870
 guldan agreed and decided that once the inhabitants of azeroth were 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.890
 crushed 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.560
 he would find the legendary tomb and claim his reward 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.060
 sure that the horde would serve their purposes sarge gave them the order to 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.560
 that the invasion began 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.930
 thanks to a joint effort 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.980
 half of the sorcerers of the shadow council opened the portal dimension to 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.360
 known as the dark portal 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.930
 this portal covered the distance between steel will have in 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.990
 and it was big enough so that they could cross entire armies 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.930
 send orcs scouts through the portal to investigate the 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.230
 lands that were going to conquer 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.700
 the scouts upon returning informed the council of the shadow that the world of 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.710
 azeroth was ready for the harvest 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.110
 it lasted so long that he still thought that the corruption of gundam would destroy his 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.520
 people denounced the sorcerers once more 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.990
 the brave warrior claimed that sorcerers were destroying poverty 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.810
 of the oruco spirit and that this reckless invasion would be his downfall 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.940
 unable to risk murdering such a popular hero was forced to 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.120
 exile rioting and its clan icy logo to the far reaches of this 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.589
 the new World 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:19.579
 after the icy wolves exiled coasts in the portal 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.619
 only a few orc clans crossed it 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:27.409
 these orcs quickly raised a base of operations in the black swamp 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:31.409
 a dark and swampy area far east of the kingdom should storm 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.409
 as the orcs began to spread and explore the new lands 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.069
 they immediately entered into conflict with human defenders must 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.159
 storm 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.249
 although these skirmishes used to end quickly 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.590
 They did a lot to illustrate the weaknesses and strengths of both 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:51.439
 rival species 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:56.150
 since neither lothar were ever able to gather accurate data on the number of 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.060
 the orcs and they could only try to guess the strength they had to 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:01.499
 face 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.659
 after a few years 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.480
 most of the hanging horde had gone into steel shark decided that 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.439
 the time had come to carry out its main attack against humanity 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:16.139
 laborda was launched with full force against the unsuspecting king what should 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.589
 storm 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:21.669
 as the forces of azeroth and the horde faced each other throughout the 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:22.209
 kingdom 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.849
 internal conflicts began to take their toll on both armies 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:28.719
 the king call 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:33.430
 who thought that the bestial orcs would be unable to conquer 0 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.370
 he kept disdainfully his position in his capital should storm 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.819
 however sir lothar was convinced that the battle should be carried to 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.430
 enemy and was forced to choose between his convictions and his loyalty to 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.279
 king 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:50.519
 choosing to follow their instincts 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.139
 lothar assault on the fortress tower measuring 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:53.939
 caracas avn 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.329
 with the help of the young apprentice of the magician 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.599
 both succeeded in eliminating the possessed guardian 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.599
 who confirmed to them that it had been the source of the conflict 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:05.639
 by killing his body 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.930
 Lothar and the young apprentice sent 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.379
 without knowing the spirit of sargé you will to the abyss 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.140
 Consequently 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.430
 the pure and virtuous spirit of measuring 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.629
 could continue to exist 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:20.629
 wandering the astral plane for many years 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.720
 although he told me he had been defeated 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.270
 laborious continued to dominate the defenders must storm 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.169
 as the horde's victory was approaching 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.110
 holguin hammer damn one of the biggest orc bosses 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.009
 he began to see the depraved corruption that had spread through the clans 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.249
 since the times of transfer 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:42.819
 his old comrade 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:43.500
 it lasted so 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.840
 He returned from exile and warned him once again of the guzmán tradition 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.610
 with a quick retribution 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.090
 assassins to mock assassinated sprout and his family 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.800
 leaving only his little son alive 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.159
 damn hammer I did not know that this hard son was found by the 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:03.570
 human officer you have to see them black mud and used as a slave 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.940
 this orc child would one day become the greatest leader that his people ever 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:10.939
 I had met 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:13.520
 in cojedes ado for the death of hard so 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.129
 by grimly but to the horde of demonic corruption and finally 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:21.340
 he assumed the role of war chief of the horde of killing the corrupt puppet 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.120
 from guldan 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.370
 black dot 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.550
 under his determined leadership the restless horde finally siege the castle 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.930
 they must storm 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.420
 I had already underestimated the power of the horde and witnessing helplessly how 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.419
 his kingdom fell into the hands of the green skin invaders 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:39.180
 Finally 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.220
 ended with one of the best assassins of the shadow council of 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.610
 arona 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.430
 the middle of the arch 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.020
 lothar and his warriors 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.039
 coming home from karaz an 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.069
 They hoped to avenge the loss of lives and save what had been their glorious 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:54.029
 nation 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.930
 instead 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.460
 they returned too late and discovered that their beloved kingdom was no more than 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.279
 smoking ruins 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:05.469
 the gallows horde continued looting the fields and reclaiming the lands 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.499
 adjoining like yours 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:11.479
 forced to hide lothar and his companions made a dreary 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.739
 oath to recover your country at any price
