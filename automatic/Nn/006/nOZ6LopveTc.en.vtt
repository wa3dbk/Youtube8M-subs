00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.170
 today we have one of these cubes 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.450
 special a quite different cube and 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.349
 I'm happy, so I'm not happy 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.389
 We roll up more beta beta hub 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.850
 zone den just like the optician you remember 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.050
 of zone let's see what is this cube 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.480
 beta well we have this madness here and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.760
 this is a cube a cubic cube 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.039
 As God sends, it's okay not to call him 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.179
 cuba the pyramids I do not care everything I do 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.540
 what I want to see what happens 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.350
 out relax 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.830
 It's bucket is a golf but with stickers 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.950
 you can just see the offset 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.560
 here a small gap and I now 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.930
 I have a 3 x 3 standard of a lifetime 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.700
 vale is simply a kind of coast 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.100
 It's not a cause with stickers just 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.650
 with the cuts a little bit different and 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.340
 Now I mention it because some things 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.410
 you are observing strange things 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.690
 not worth 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.170
 the stickers because I think it's the 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.080
 strong theme here is not a very serious issue 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.900
 they are good they are quality they are very good 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.810
 because it 's a handmade juice 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.560
 if I'm not wrong, very taxes but 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.260
 you see they have certain weird shapes 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.940
 ok it's not as dramatic as here 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.680
 because now you are reflecting the 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.630
 light goes slow you notice a lot normally 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.910
 almost and you realize that they have this 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.190
 so strange pattern is not rough it's worth 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.869
 when he saw her like that, he thought that it was 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.259
 typical famous cat's tongue like ya 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.850
 you know, but no, you do not notice 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.910
 completely smooth we're going to see the 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.130
 cuts around here and here but 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.619
 clear two things with clear stickers 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.149
 in the first place this may not be 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.970
 like it is not this and then to see if you still 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.979
 ghosts you put stickers in some way 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.750
 loses the essence not because it is very much 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.520
 simpler you simply get guided by the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.220
 color code and you 're no longer the 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.960
 difficulty vanishes is practically 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.569
 true that it is nice is worth a 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.980
 good bucket but I do not know if it would be better 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.950
 that all 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.900
 the same color is a serious debate is a 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.570
 very serious debate and weighs a lot this 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.700
 cube approximately does not reach the 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.680
 standard baby's head maybe it 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.390
 is in head of newborn kitten 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.580
 and the only problem that I see this 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.290
 cube now what development tranquility is 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.480
 the price if I'm not wrong wrong I leave 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.930
 links as always but it was close to 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.550
 those of the 100 dollars or something like that 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.100
 in fact on that page also fine 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.700
 they also sell a crystal goes a 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.470
 Goes precious emerald type for 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.800
 spin is very good now I undo it but 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.740
 Of course you know that cubes sometimes 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.050
 They are a bit expensive but if you are a 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.060
 extreme collector and decadent no 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.530
 may lack in your collection interest that 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.210
 you do here that you do here and stealing 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.340
 star a fan if here right now 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.120
 out out please let us undo 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.590
 already and we shut up a little we make a 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.620
 previous lag and now we start it 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.120
 spin without problem goes well tour 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.270
 very very good 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.940
 because it has a nice easy turn 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.470
 because there are some who want so so 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.060
 also that in the end it's a problem 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.160
 because they get out of hand is not 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.930
 like that the spin goes crazy not here the turn 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.820
 you are not going to escape you have to do it 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.530
 and it stays well in your position 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.790
 there is no there is no any 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.710
 problem and I do not know if you have given 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.290
 account but we have two flat centers 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.390
 is that normally goes the does not pass this 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.460
 it's flat I put it in yellow it's 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.050
 flat then it may seem like a 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.300
 foolishness may seem to simplify 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.660
 things but maybe in the end in the 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.700
 last layer if we leave one of these 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.310
 good centers may appear some 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.970
 surprises I do not say anything even for 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.100
 inside you see that you have here by 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.740
 example has even like the textures 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.020
 of the stickers 6 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.970
 the pieces I do not know is enough 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.540
 surprising usually they tend to be 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.280
 black 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.760
 and we 're not going to see how it is 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.340
 undone here the ways to see then 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.290
 it is undone as a taste not as 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.900
 I had to be the one who made this aberration 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.960
 let's see if we are able to read 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.410
 who did this 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.990
 efe efe nguyen what is this name 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.170
 please wear a normal man 2015 

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:26.230
 Fascinating recent cube more closely 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.300
 please see they are intertwined that I 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.730
 they mean it's called it's called as 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.460
 you know the beta cube and in physics during 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.850
 the race will be by Greek letters is what 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.270
 what else do you use, not because alpha gamma beta 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:42.640
 of the plug is epsilon is everywhere 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.770
 mus news I do not know what is your lyrics 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.540
 Greek favorite to me the beta letter to me 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.160
 I like it a lot because it is very very elegant 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.720
 I really liked doing it, it's not used on 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.010
 everything for what the letter is used for 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.470
 beta for many things but for 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.330
 example for the cushioning is 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:00.990
 exponential is not elevated unless beta 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:04.139
 and I say good a nice good bucket 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.060
 of course not, that is, 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.659
 see if you like the go if you have a 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.389
 caprice yes and if not good then well 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:15.419
 what is meant is not enough 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.949
 already you know that money is gasteiz me 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:22.740
 I'm going to lay off another kilo here 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:24.840
 favor one good 1 1 2 3 4 and 5 and you're done 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.610
 good 6 because here is this united 6 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.199
 Now I'm tired of shrapnel, I hope more 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.310
 that you liked this cube so 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:34.909
 Strange as it always happens to us 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.909
 more in another video
