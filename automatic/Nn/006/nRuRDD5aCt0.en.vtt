forelock and kind of curl it around my

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.620 
forelock and kind of curl it around my
finger<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.069> her<00:02:14.220> cheek<00:02:14.489> then<00:02:14.880> I'm<00:02:15.180> fanning

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
finger and her cheek then I'm fanning

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.630 
finger and her cheek then I'm fanning
out<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.959> longer<00:02:16.319> portion<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.099> purpose<00:02:17.489> of

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
out the longer portion the purpose of

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.430 
out the longer portion the purpose of
pulling<00:02:17.819> everything<00:02:18.209> forward<00:02:18.900> was<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.290> that

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
pulling everything forward was so that

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.170 
pulling everything forward was so that
it<00:02:19.530> would<00:02:19.650> stand<00:02:19.890> up<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.430> kind<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.730> hide<00:02:20.970> all

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
it would stand up and kind of hide all

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.760 
it would stand up and kind of hide all
that<00:02:21.360> mess<00:02:21.569> we<00:02:21.750> have<00:02:21.900> going<00:02:22.170> on<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.530> back

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
that mess we have going on in the back

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.500 
that mess we have going on in the back
and<00:02:23.190> before<00:02:23.670> trying<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.030> make<00:02:24.209> everything

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
and before trying to make everything

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.089 
and before trying to make everything
look<00:02:24.840> perfect<00:02:25.050> I'm<00:02:25.380> going<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.560> go<00:02:25.709> ahead<00:02:25.830> and

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
look perfect I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.710 
look perfect I'm going to go ahead and
brush<00:02:26.250> through<00:02:26.520> smooth<00:02:26.910> out<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.420> make<00:02:27.540> sure

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
brush through smooth out and make sure

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.850 
brush through smooth out and make sure
the<00:02:27.870> tails<00:02:28.110> going<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> same<00:02:28.800> direction

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
the tails going in the same direction

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.070 
the tails going in the same direction
now<00:02:29.580> I'm<00:02:30.030> brushing<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.510> longer<00:02:30.840> portion

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
now I'm brushing the longer portion

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.690 
now I'm brushing the longer portion
straight<00:02:31.530> up<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:31.950> I'm<00:02:32.069> just<00:02:32.250> going<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.459> try<00:02:32.640> to

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
straight up and I'm just going to try to

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.520 
straight up and I'm just going to try to
adjust<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.360> make<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.750> look<00:02:33.930> normal

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
adjust it to make it look normal

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.740 
adjust it to make it look normal
and<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:35.069> do<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.250> I'm<00:02:35.670> basically<00:02:35.880> just<00:02:36.180> twisting

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
and to do so I'm basically just twisting

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.420 
and to do so I'm basically just twisting
it<00:02:36.810> around<00:02:36.900> my<00:02:37.200> fingers<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.950> pushing<00:02:38.310> and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
it around my fingers and pushing and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.770 
it around my fingers and pushing and
pulling<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:38.970> know<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.269> kind<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.569> thing

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
pulling and you know that kind of thing

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.630 
pulling and you know that kind of thing
there's<00:02:40.140> really<00:02:40.500> no<00:02:40.739> rhyme<00:02:41.010> or<00:02:41.190> reason<00:02:41.250> to

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
there's really no rhyme or reason to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.820 
there's really no rhyme or reason to
what<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:41.880> do

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.920 

but<00:02:46.830> eventually<00:02:47.430> Octavia<00:02:48.269> is<00:02:48.330> done<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:51.209> here

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
but eventually Octavia is done and here

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.830

definitely<00:03:09.720> looks<00:03:10.230> more<00:03:10.560> like<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.950> classical

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
definitely looks more like the classical

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.680 
definitely looks more like the classical
beauty<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:12.000> she's<00:03:12.209> supposed<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.690> be

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
beauty that she's supposed to be

unfortunately<00:03:15.690> she<00:03:15.930> still<00:03:16.140> looks<00:03:16.350> like<00:03:16.440> a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
unfortunately she still looks like a

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.560 
unfortunately she still looks like a
mess<00:03:16.859> in<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.130> back<00:03:17.400> because<00:03:17.730> Hasbro<00:03:18.269> put<00:03:18.480> all

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
mess in the back because Hasbro put all

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.479 
mess in the back because Hasbro put all
that<00:03:18.750> pink<00:03:19.049> in<00:03:19.200> her<00:03:19.260> hair<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.799> just<00:03:20.250> don't

that pink in her hair I just don't
understand<00:03:21.329> I'm<00:03:21.989> gonna<00:03:22.260> go<00:03:22.410> cry<00:03:22.680> now<00:03:22.890> even

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
understand I'm gonna go cry now even

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.069 
understand I'm gonna go cry now even
though<00:03:23.579> she's<00:03:23.850> still<00:03:24.060> flawed<00:03:24.390> she<00:03:24.720> looked<00:03:24.930> a

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
though she's still flawed she looked a

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.380 
though she's still flawed she looked a

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
whole lot better on display and maybe

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.090
