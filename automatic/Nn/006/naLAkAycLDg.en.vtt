okay so we just got done with the first
day<00:03:00.439> of<00:03:00.499> testing<00:03:00.920> on<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.129> 2015<00:03:01.909> yz250<00:03:02.569> yeah

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
day of testing on the 2015 yz250 yeah

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.649 
day of testing on the 2015 yz250 yeah
overall<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.790> bike<00:03:04.969> a<00:03:05.180> little<00:03:05.420> bit<00:03:05.510> more

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
overall the bike a little bit more

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.020 
overall the bike a little bit more
balanced<00:03:06.049> suspension<00:03:06.560> wise<00:03:06.849> definitely<00:03:07.849> it

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
balanced suspension wise definitely it

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.280 
balanced suspension wise definitely it
doesn't<00:03:08.359> dive<00:03:08.510> in<00:03:08.659> the<00:03:08.719> front<00:03:08.989> it<00:03:09.109> doesn't

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
doesn't dive in the front it doesn't

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.379 
doesn't dive in the front it doesn't
squat<00:03:09.799> in<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:09.950> back<00:03:10.159> it's<00:03:10.579> it's<00:03:10.969> balanced

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
squat in the back it's it's balanced

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.330 
squat in the back it's it's balanced
fairly<00:03:11.840> well<00:03:12.019> over<00:03:12.319> what<00:03:12.680> last<00:03:12.920> year's<00:03:13.159> bike

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
fairly well over what last year's bike

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.099 
fairly well over what last year's bike
was<00:03:13.609> so<00:03:14.090> this<00:03:14.299> year<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.599> seems<00:03:14.629> like<00:03:14.870> they

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
was so this year it seems like they

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.559 
was so this year it seems like they
smooth<00:03:15.680> out<00:03:15.889> the<00:03:16.040> bottom<00:03:16.189> there<00:03:16.879> isn't<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.239> big

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
smooth out the bottom there isn't a big

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.149 
smooth out the bottom there isn't a big
hit<00:03:17.780> down<00:03:17.930> low<00:03:18.230> anymore<00:03:18.590> it's<00:03:18.859> kind<00:03:19.069> of

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 
hit down low anymore it's kind of

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.979 
hit down low anymore it's kind of
smoothed<00:03:19.400> out<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:19.879> it<00:03:20.329> seems<00:03:20.719> to<00:03:20.840> have<00:03:20.930> a

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
smoothed out and it seems to have a

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.179 
smoothed out and it seems to have a
little<00:03:21.139> bit<00:03:21.349> more<00:03:21.469> power<00:03:21.680> in<00:03:21.889> the<00:03:21.980> mid-range

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
little bit more power in the mid-range

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.879 
little bit more power in the mid-range
to<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:22.669> top<00:03:22.879> in<00:03:23.090> 4/4<00:03:23.959> performance<00:03:24.499> wise<00:03:24.650> a

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
to the top in 4/4 performance wise a

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.649 
to the top in 4/4 performance wise a
couple<00:03:25.370> things<00:03:25.549> we<00:03:25.760> did<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.209> make<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.510> bike

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
couple things we did to make the bike

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.020 
couple things we did to make the bike
fit<00:03:26.989> me<00:03:27.169> a<00:03:27.200> little<00:03:27.560> bit<00:03:27.680> better<00:03:27.859> was<00:03:28.489> I<00:03:28.760> moved

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
fit me a little bit better was I moved

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.610 
fit me a little bit better was I moved
the<00:03:29.180> bar<00:03:29.419> mounts<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:30.139> the<00:03:30.260> forward<00:03:30.500> position

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
the bar mounts to the forward position

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.830 
the bar mounts to the forward position

with the with the clamps actually turned

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.170 
with the with the clamps actually turned
around<00:03:32.930> backwards<00:03:33.290> so<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.099> gives<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.609> little

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
around backwards so it gives it a little

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.449 
around backwards so it gives it a little
bit<00:03:35.269> more<00:03:35.449> space<00:03:35.689> between<00:03:36.010> myself<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.280> and
