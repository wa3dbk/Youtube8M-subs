philosophy not get like Bob down into

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.020 
philosophy not get like Bob down into
one<00:01:27.869> thing<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.799> know<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.070> we

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
one thing and think you know what we

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.999 
one thing and think you know what we
need<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.570> really<00:01:30.840> well<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.680> so

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
obviously there's a lot of expectations

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.210 
obviously there's a lot of expectations
on<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.900> gameplay<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.680> adventure<00:01:35.100> and
