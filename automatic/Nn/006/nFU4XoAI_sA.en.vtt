phase<00:00:56.760> should<00:00:57.750> I'll<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> little<00:00:58.170> bit

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
phase should I'll have a little bit

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.049 
phase should I'll have a little bit
better<00:00:58.440> odds<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.920> one<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.399> right<00:00:59.879> now

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
better odds of this one but right now

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.779 
better odds of this one but right now
they're<00:01:00.300> pretty<00:01:00.719> equal<00:01:01.309> equal<00:01:02.309> stuff<00:01:02.520> went

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
they're pretty equal equal stuff went

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.579 
they're pretty equal equal stuff went
for<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> same<00:01:03.359> items<00:01:03.840> right<00:01:04.140> off<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> get-go

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
for the same items right off the get-go

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.179 
for the same items right off the get-go
so<00:01:04.739> cause<00:01:05.189> he's<00:01:05.339> seven<00:01:06.180> full<00:01:06.450> 75<00:01:06.960> stock<00:01:07.619> would

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
so cause he's seven full 75 stock would

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.310 
so cause he's seven full 75 stock would
be<00:01:08.250> an<00:01:08.729> elixir<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.630> health<00:01:09.810> pot<00:01:10.049> coming

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.990 
which honestly I feel he may well get to
but<00:03:58.530> remember<00:03:58.590> but<00:03:58.980> these<00:03:59.190> are<00:03:59.370> ad<00:03:59.609> champions
