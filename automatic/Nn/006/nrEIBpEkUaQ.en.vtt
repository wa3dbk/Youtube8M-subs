00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.620 
pretty easy so it's family-friendly
because<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.830> game<00:03:18.040> doesn't<00:03:18.640> really<00:03:18.850> penalize

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
because the game doesn't really penalize

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.440

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
correct location sometimes you can get

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.130 
correct location sometimes you can get
lost<00:03:27.040> but<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.940> game<00:03:28.180> will<00:03:28.330> always<00:03:28.630> pretty

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140
