 hello I introduce myself I'm 123 mr brandoni this is the first video I do and I go 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.269
 to comment on the history of mario bros 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.200
 no mario has been the mascot of nintendo for a long time its first appearance 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:17.500
 it was in the first with what and how 1981 where it was called young man 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.470
 he was a carpenter 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.460
 and his mission was to rescue his girlfriend from the hands of a giant gorilla 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.339
 that launched barrels 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:29.389
 shigeru miyamoto creator of characters like donkey kong celta and be fox among 

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:33.069
 other classics in 1983 created mario bros 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.840
 mario became fitero gas and in this game his brother made his appearance 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.030
 luigi 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.970
 at that time for the programmers it was very difficult to animate a mouth and the 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.840
 hair then they made him a mustache and they put a cap 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.670
 so that it looks good on a black background they dressed him in red with white gloves 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.730
 when the nintendo entertainment system console is born, which is the month 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.380
 create a super mario bros 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.010
 a longer version and much more complex than the first game 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.630
 this fact is considered by nintendo as the official birth of mario the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.970
 September 13, 1985 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.340
 after becoming known neighborhood 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.440
 came out versions for all types of consoles that existed subsequently to 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:16.530
 mario bros 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.930
 until you get to the super pri but mario 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.920
 mario received his name from mario segale owner of the office where 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.970
 the nintendo US headquarters was operating 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.650
 he was at a company meeting demanding the payment of a 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.940
 back rent 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.780
 the antithesis character of mario is guario a combination of huawei 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.080
 Japanese word that means bad i 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.920
 likewise luigi's usual rival luigi 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.140
 mario's main enemy is bou be a giant tortoise with spikes on the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.060
 carapace me is the leader and the most powerful of your race the cumpas you are 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.920
 considers an antagonist because vou will be captured the princess pich 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.259
 countless times and has tried to conquer the mushroom / kingdom of 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.259
 the mushrooms showed in kingston since its first appearance in super mario bros 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.400
 although their plans always fail 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.939
 being a representation of brute force in general 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.639
 Mario manages to defeat him using intelligence 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.819
 taking advantage of the elements of the place where they fight 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.819
 Mario has appeared in more than 200 games and has sold approximately 193 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.180
 million units corresponding to the series of mario 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.019
 mario bros 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.019
 super mario world mario kart and so on 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.979
 I say goodbye and I hope that this information from the history of Mario 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:32.120
