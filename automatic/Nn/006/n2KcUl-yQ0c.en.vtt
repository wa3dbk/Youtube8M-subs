00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.779 
have asked for me to do more dramatic
looks<00:00:28.029> so<00:00:28.779> I<00:00:29.140> thought<00:00:29.470> I<00:00:29.679> would<00:00:29.739> start<00:00:30.460> it<00:00:30.669> off

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
looks so I thought I would start it off

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.150 
looks so I thought I would start it off
with<00:00:30.819> just<00:00:31.359> a<00:00:31.480> basic<00:00:31.749> smoky<00:00:32.470> eye<00:00:32.500> I've<00:00:32.950> only

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
with just a basic smoky eye I've only

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.190 
with just a basic smoky eye I've only
used<00:00:33.250> about<00:00:33.520> four<00:00:33.880> eyes<00:00:34.090> shadows<00:00:34.480> or<00:00:34.840> maybe

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
used about four eyes shadows or maybe

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.770 
used about four eyes shadows or maybe
five<00:00:35.470> but<00:00:36.190> because<00:00:36.520> it<00:00:36.670> is<00:00:36.730> quite<00:00:37.150> a<00:00:37.390> bold

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
five but because it is quite a bold

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.010 
five but because it is quite a bold
smoky<00:00:38.560> eye<00:00:38.590> it's<00:00:39.130> pretty<00:00:39.520> black<00:00:39.730> so<00:00:40.510> there<00:00:40.870> are

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
smoky eye it's pretty black so there are

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.350 
smoky eye it's pretty black so there are
a<00:00:41.050> lot<00:00:41.320> of<00:00:41.350> transitions<00:00:42.010> so<00:00:42.490> it<00:00:42.640> fades<00:00:43.120> out

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
a lot of transitions so it fades out

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.600 
a lot of transitions so it fades out
quite<00:00:43.720> nicely<00:00:43.960> into<00:00:44.350> your<00:00:44.650> skin<00:00:45.130> so<00:00:45.460> that's

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
quite nicely into your skin so that's

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.310 
quite nicely into your skin so that's
why<00:00:45.820> there<00:00:46.000> are<00:00:46.090> a<00:00:46.120> few<00:00:46.390> eyeshadows<00:00:46.900> to<00:00:47.110> use

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
why there are a few eyeshadows to use

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.010 
why there are a few eyeshadows to use
but<00:00:48.040> other<00:00:48.550> than<00:00:48.850> that<00:00:48.940> it's<00:00:49.270> really<00:00:49.870> simple

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
but other than that it's really simple

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.830 
but other than that it's really simple
so<00:00:50.830> if<00:00:51.100> you<00:00:51.550> would<00:00:51.700> like<00:00:51.910> to<00:00:52.150> know<00:00:52.300> how<00:00:52.540> to<00:00:52.600> get
