00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.940 
be rough yep that'll do it and getting a
little<00:03:33.269> too<00:03:33.750> feisty<00:03:33.959> there<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:34.470> think<00:03:34.769> he<00:03:34.830> would

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
little too feisty there I think he would

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.380 
little too feisty there I think he would
have<00:03:35.040> been<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.730> would<00:03:35.790> have<00:03:35.850> been<00:03:35.970> smarter<00:03:36.360> to

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
have been it would have been smarter to

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.759 
have been it would have been smarter to
opt<00:03:36.600> for<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.780> grab<00:03:37.019> but<00:03:37.260> yet<00:03:37.380> again<00:03:37.500> in<00:03:37.680> the

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
opt for the grab but yet again in the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.650 
opt for the grab but yet again in the
same<00:03:38.010> situation<00:03:38.580> that<00:03:38.610> occurred<00:03:39.000> last<00:03:39.150> time

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
same situation that occurred last time

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.020 
same situation that occurred last time
minty<00:03:39.989> didnêt<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.860> kill<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.820> can

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
minty didnêt the kill so I can

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.479 
minty didnêt the kill so I can
understand<00:03:42.600> his<00:03:43.080> /<00:03:43.560> commitment<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.220> up

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
understand his / commitment to that up

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.380 
understand his / commitment to that up
tilt<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:45.320> think<00:03:46.320> I<00:03:47.040> think<00:03:47.880> he<00:03:48.000> should<00:03:48.150> have<00:03:48.269> just

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
tilt I think I think he should have just

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.000 
tilt I think I think he should have just
chilled<00:03:48.630> because<00:03:49.019> that<00:03:49.350> kill<00:03:49.530> %<00:03:49.860> you<00:03:49.980> know

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010

that's a move you eat some serious

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.850 
that's a move you eat some serious

robotic head of his he's all up in his
circuitry<00:04:40.980> Brian<00:04:41.360> exactly<00:04:42.360> Oh<00:04:43.010> down<00:04:44.010> till<00:04:44.220> I

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
circuitry Brian exactly Oh down till I

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.910 
circuitry Brian exactly Oh down till I
like<00:04:44.730> how<00:04:44.850> it<00:04:45.000> pops<00:04:45.180> up<00:04:45.450> but<00:04:45.990> if<00:04:46.140> you<00:04:46.170> di<00:04:46.410> out<00:04:46.680> it

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
like how it pops up but if you di out it

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.170 
like how it pops up but if you di out it
seems<00:04:47.130> pretty<00:04:47.340> hard<00:04:47.580> for<00:04:47.730> diddy<00:04:47.850> kong<00:04:48.000> to

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
seems pretty hard for diddy kong to

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.180 
seems pretty hard for diddy kong to
actually<00:04:48.450> get<00:04:48.570> anything<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:49.190> that

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
actually get anything and so that

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.980 
actually get anything and so that
doesn't<00:04:51.120> come<00:04:51.210> look<00:04:51.420> into<00:04:51.690> everything

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
doesn't come look into everything

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.870 
doesn't come look into everything
guaranteed<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:53.160> was<00:04:53.310> upsetting<00:04:53.460> did

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
guaranteed and that was upsetting did

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.790 
guaranteed and that was upsetting did
you<00:04:54.030> see<00:04:54.240> that<00:04:54.420> the<00:04:54.810> banana<00:04:55.110> went<00:04:55.350> up<00:04:55.500> came

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
you see that the banana went up came

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.440 
you see that the banana went up came
back<00:04:55.980> down<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.400> J<00:04:56.580> tails<00:04:56.820> kind<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.150> pushed

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
back down and the J tails kind of pushed

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.390 
back down and the J tails kind of pushed
it<00:04:57.660> forward<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:58.110> little<00:04:58.260> bit<00:04:58.380> in<00:04:58.710> two<00:04:58.950> min<00:04:59.100> T<00:04:59.250> it

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
it forward a little bit in two min T it

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.570 
it forward a little bit in two min T it
was<00:04:59.520> very<00:04:59.940> very<00:05:00.270> tricky<00:05:00.830> yeah<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.040> body<00:05:02.280> push

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
was very very tricky yeah the body push

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.610 
was very very tricky yeah the body push
in<00:05:02.790> this<00:05:02.910> game<00:05:03.060> is<00:05:03.210> pretty<00:05:03.360> real<00:05:03.600> yes<00:05:03.990> but<00:05:04.500> hey

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
in this game is pretty real yes but hey

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.840 
in this game is pretty real yes but hey
we<00:05:04.740> can't<00:05:04.980> count<00:05:05.100> mickey<00:05:05.430> out<00:05:05.460> he's<00:05:05.670> got<00:05:05.790> a

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
we can't count mickey out he's got a
