00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.409
 the condition and reading you have already appeared before this court

 as a public interest labor censor the story 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:21.320
 I made all this little world 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.589
 it is done 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.589
 I like smes 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.750
 of course the initial goal m 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.789
 because in this case it's obviously 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.770

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.010
 versailles 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.010
 vl 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.170

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.170
 mis en cause for madame claire 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.640
 did he joke 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.640
 it was to help you I'm fine 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.160
 kolo rounded 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.770
 the circuit will be up 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.770
 the six suspended and invest themselves 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.250
 2h30 walk and complained 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.830
 so now why 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.850
 frankly offbeat 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.890
 Rates vary with the blues 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.890
 it is true that I am your luck 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.380
 You have talent 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.380
 more specifically for stadiums 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.380
 it's the first time in my life that I'm fighting for something 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.230
 I will do what you need to know 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.110
