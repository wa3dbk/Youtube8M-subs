WrestleMania moment as a fan and as a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.340 
WrestleMania moment as a fan and as a
professional<00:01:14.840> that's<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.930> pretty<00:01:16.110> tough

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
professional that's a pretty tough

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.499 
professional that's a pretty tough
question<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> professional<00:01:18.150> my<00:01:18.330> oniy

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
question as a professional my oniy

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.510 
question as a professional my oniy
appearance<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.290> last<00:01:19.530> year's<00:01:19.830> WrestleMania

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
appearance was last year's WrestleMania

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.510 
appearance was last year's WrestleMania
27<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.509> I'd<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.869> say<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.320> as<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:23.040> fan

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
27 so I'd have to say that as a fan

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.810 
27 so I'd have to say that as a fan
there's<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.570> many<00:01:24.840> moments<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
there's so many moments but I think the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.490 
there's so many moments but I think the
Undertaker<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.570> think<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:28.080> probably<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> last

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
Undertaker I think for probably the last

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.880 
Undertaker I think for probably the last
four<00:01:28.950> years<00:01:29.840> despite<00:01:30.840> his<00:01:31.110> advancing<00:01:31.710> years

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
four years despite his advancing years

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.440 
four years despite his advancing years
in<00:01:32.159> fact<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.579> he's<00:01:32.670> getting<00:01:32.820> further<00:01:33.270> and

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
in fact that he's getting further and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.630 
in fact that he's getting further and
further<00:01:33.509> into<00:01:33.750> his<00:01:34.020> career<00:01:34.350> I'm<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.189> think<00:01:35.460> he's

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
further into his career I'm I think he's

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.160 
further into his career I'm I think he's
just<00:01:35.909> got<00:01:36.060> better<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.450> better<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.960> every

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
just got better and better and every

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.920 
just got better and better and every
year<00:01:37.380> he's<00:01:37.619> impressed<00:01:38.009> me<00:01:38.189> with<00:01:38.720> having<00:01:39.720> a

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
year he's impressed me with having a

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.240 
year he's impressed me with having a
better<00:01:40.110> match<00:01:40.380> than<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.680> year<00:01:40.799> before<00:01:40.920> which

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
