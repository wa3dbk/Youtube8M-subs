00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.110
 we are ready to offer you the following 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.380
 repair and replacement of silencers 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.529
 replacement of catalysts of all European standards 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.230
 replacement of catalysts with flame arresters 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.140

 German company lifts 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.190
 manufacturer rotor lift 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.829
 replacing the top two catalysts with 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.970
 flame arresters removal of the bottom two 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.890
 catalysts and replacement of the resonator on 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.890
 cars mercedes-benz w208 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.770
 This car has four 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.750
 catalyst they will all be removed 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.580
 wishes of the owner given flange 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.340
 mount 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:25.670
 top catalysts first left 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.670
 then right 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.790
 and the left upper catalyst is removed from 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:40.080
 car then removed spent 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:49.759
 together with exhaust system and system 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:49.759
 cut out the lower catalyst then 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:02:00.200
 bumped resonator which will also 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:05.149
 replaced and so the system of the cut part 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.149
 catalysts and resonator will be replaced 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.440
 the upper right catalyst have cracks 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.730
 in the case and the preservation of geometry 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:23.760
 structures on the upper left catalyst 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:27.140
 weld the clamp then the catalyst 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.140
 cut out from the case 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:44.470
 vitalizer extracted filtering 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:45.160
 catalyst element is cracked on 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.960
 his place 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.080
 firm flame arrestor is installed 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.690
 double sprint with outer layer of 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.820
 of stainless steel 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:01.270
 instead of connecting a flame arrester with 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:07.930
 hull carefully fall through then 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:12.090
 cut off unnecessary place lock 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.090
 welding paint heat resistant paint 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.160
 similarly change the upper right 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.160
 catalyst on flame arrester 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:28.860
 flame arresters are ready to install them 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:32.910
 set on a regular place and 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.910
 fixed on the exhaust manifold 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:40.630
 install part of the exhaust system 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.890
 fix the flange connections of the upper 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.890
 right flame arrester 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.680
 for installation preparing a new resonator with 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:07.230
 it hang down the intake and exhaust 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:12.830
 nozzles new resonator set 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.830
 on a regular place and secure welding 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.970
 to connect the resonator with the exhaust 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.780
 systems made 2 repair other 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:33.990
 they are installed in the rear seats 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:37.710
 the catalysts are fixed by welding then 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.930
 the compound is boiled after 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.100
 flame arresters 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.560
 Lambda probe sensors are installed 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.520
 through mechanical catalytic 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.890
 blende and so set two 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.600
 flame arrester 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.600
 connecting pipes and a new resonator 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.150
 repair is over warranty on everything 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.980
 work performed and installed 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.980
 component year and a half
