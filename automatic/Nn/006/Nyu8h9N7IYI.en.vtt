00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
see it just to turn the sludge into a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:00.429 
see it just to turn the sludge into a
hash<00:00:58.210> now<00:00:59.210> let's<00:00:59.540> have<00:00:59.750> a<00:00:59.809> look<00:00:59.900> here<00:01:00.199> on<00:01:00.350> the

hash now let's have a look here on the
inside<00:01:00.799> of<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:00.949> valley<00:01:01.159> so<00:01:02.199> what<00:01:03.199> that<00:01:03.229> looks

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
inside of the valley so what that looks

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:10.570 
inside of the valley so what that looks
like<00:01:06.909> you<00:01:07.909> can<00:01:08.060> see<00:01:08.299> where<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:09.340> sludge<00:01:10.340> has

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
like you can see where the sludge has

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.410

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
just been turned into an ash so next

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.300
