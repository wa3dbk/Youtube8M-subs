off<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.230> street<00:00:44.470> I<00:00:44.680> think<00:00:45.010> it's<00:00:45.220> the<00:00:45.370> only<00:00:45.640> way

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
off the street I think it's the only way

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.010 
off the street I think it's the only way
out<00:00:45.880> for<00:00:45.910> some<00:00:46.180> people<00:00:46.480> because<00:00:46.540> where<00:00:46.930> we

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
out for some people because where we

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.930 
out for some people because where we
come<00:00:47.230> from<00:00:47.260> it's<00:00:47.590> very<00:00:47.620> high<00:00:48.219> place<00:00:48.610> and<00:00:48.640> I

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
come from it's very high place and I

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.060 
come from it's very high place and I
think<00:00:49.180> it<00:00:49.329> gives<00:00:49.809> them<00:00:49.960> a<00:00:50.079> drive<00:00:50.410> for<00:00:50.980> the

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
think it gives them a drive for the

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.790 
think it gives them a drive for the
future<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.840> this<00:00:52.930> particular<00:00:53.140> piece<00:00:53.590> of
