00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:54.759 
only one I can afford go take a turn to
that<00:00:50.800> it's<00:00:51.800> proportional<00:00:52.370> steering<00:00:52.760> with<00:00:53.769> way

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
that it's proportional steering with way

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.750 
that it's proportional steering with way
too<00:00:55.010> much<00:00:55.129> power<00:00:55.399> as<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:56.300> real<00:00:56.449> car<00:00:56.659> would<00:00:56.809> be
