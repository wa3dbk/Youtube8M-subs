00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
my opinion that's what the Thunder need

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.890 
my opinion that's what the Thunder need
to<00:02:16.400> do<00:02:16.550> this<00:02:16.730> year<00:02:17.030> in<00:02:17.180> order<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.540> win<00:02:17.870> a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.990 
to do this year in order to win a
championship<00:02:18.250> they're<00:02:19.250> doing<00:02:19.610> well<00:02:19.790> they're

championship they're doing well they're

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.360 
championship they're doing well they're
outperforming<00:02:20.440> what<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.470> expected<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.340> them

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
outperforming what I expected of them

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.950 
outperforming what I expected of them
honest<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:22.910> didn't<00:02:23.120> expect<00:02:23.150> them<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.630> do<00:02:23.750> very

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.720 
honest I didn't expect them to do very
well<00:02:24.020> Kendrick<00:02:24.890> Perkins<00:02:24.920> has<00:02:25.340> come<00:02:25.520> along

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
real nice but I still think Steven Adams

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.740 
real nice but I still think Steven Adams
is<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:27.890> center<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.460> future<00:02:28.820> in<00:02:29.300> Oklahoma

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
with him and everything so here's where

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.420 
with him and everything so here's where
I<00:02:35.240> switched<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:36.260> contract<00:02:36.800> up<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.070> little<00:02:37.280> bit

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
I switched the contract up a little bit

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.340 
I switched the contract up a little bit
and<00:02:37.580> now<00:02:37.820> I've<00:02:37.940> got<00:02:38.120> James<00:02:38.390> White<00:02:38.660> getting

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
and now I've got James White getting

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.199 
and now I've got James White getting
ready<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.680> sign<00:02:39.950> him<00:02:40.100> or<00:02:40.220> trying<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:40.790> anyway

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
ready to sign him or trying to anyway

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.300 
ready to sign him or trying to anyway
but<00:02:41.990> yeah<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.170> think<00:02:42.380> that<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.920> Thunder<00:02:43.280> are

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
but yeah I think that the Thunder are

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.340 
but yeah I think that the Thunder are
doing<00:02:43.760> real<00:02:44.030> real<00:02:44.300> well<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:44.720> year<00:02:44.990> but

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
doing real real well this year but

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.110 
doing real real well this year but
they've<00:02:45.770> got<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:46.070> roll<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.340> dice<00:02:46.640> if<00:02:46.820> they<00:02:46.940> want

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
they've got to roll a dice if they want

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.210 
they've got to roll a dice if they want
to<00:02:47.209> go<00:02:47.330> over<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.600> top<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.230> think<00:02:48.860> they<00:02:48.980> need<00:02:49.130> to

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
to go over the top I think they need to

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.430 
to go over the top I think they need to
make<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.430> move<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.060> this<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:50.989> kind<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.380> my

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
make a move and this is kind of my

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.240 
make a move and this is kind of my
version<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.780> what<00:02:53.780> i<00:02:53.989> would<00:02:54.440> try<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.709> do<00:02:54.980> for

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
version of what i would try to do for

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.130 
version of what i would try to do for
the<00:02:55.340> Thunder<00:02:55.760> again<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.420> am<00:02:56.810> not<00:02:56.989> necessarily

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
the Thunder again I am not necessarily

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.199 
the Thunder again I am not necessarily
the<00:02:57.650> james<00:02:57.920> white<00:02:58.190> thing<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:58.640> was<00:02:58.760> more<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.180> a

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
the james white thing that was more so a

parking<00:04:33.740> so<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:33.920> decided<00:04:34.280> you<00:04:34.580> know<00:04:35.120> the

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
parking so I decided you know the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.820 
parking so I decided you know the
Thunder<00:04:35.570> are<00:04:35.660> a<00:04:35.720> great<00:04:35.960> value<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:36.440> everything

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
Thunder are a great value and everything

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.680 
Thunder are a great value and everything
they're<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:37.400> good<00:04:37.670> winning<00:04:37.940> team<00:04:38.300> so<00:04:38.510> I'm<00:04:38.570> gonna

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
they're a good winning team so I'm gonna

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.180 
they're a good winning team so I'm gonna
jack<00:04:38.960> up<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.230> prices<00:04:39.470> a<00:04:39.650> little<00:04:39.920> bit<00:04:40.040> and<00:04:40.130> I

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
jack up the prices a little bit and I

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.220 
jack up the prices a little bit and I
think<00:04:40.430> it'll<00:04:40.550> still<00:04:40.850> sell<00:04:41.120> out<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:41.510> do<00:04:41.990> real

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
think it'll still sell out and do real

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.400 
think it'll still sell out and do real
well<00:04:42.500> so<00:04:43.100> that<00:04:43.700> was<00:04:43.850> my<00:04:43.880> thought<00:04:44.210> and<00:04:44.930> whatever

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
well so that was my thought and whatever

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.950 
well so that was my thought and whatever
when<00:04:45.950> I<00:04:45.980> go<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.220> a<00:04:46.340> game<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:47.120> team<00:04:47.390> had<00:04:47.630> seemed

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
when I go to a game the team had seemed

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.920 
when I go to a game the team had seemed
to<00:04:48.110> be<00:04:48.260> like<00:04:48.500> 20<00:04:48.890> to<00:04:49.010> 25<00:04:49.490> bucks<00:04:49.850> so<00:04:50.420> I<00:04:50.480> won't<00:04:50.720> go

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
to be like 20 to 25 bucks so I won't go

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.110 
to be like 20 to 25 bucks so I won't go
too<00:04:51.440> crazy<00:04:51.830> on<00:04:52.130> that<00:04:52.250> but<00:04:52.640> you<00:04:52.730> have<00:04:52.940> to

looking at the budget here so I can get

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.650 
looking at the budget here so I can get
really<00:05:06.320> deep<00:05:06.620> really<00:05:07.310> really<00:05:07.580> deep<00:05:07.760> into<00:05:08.570> this

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
really deep really really deep into this

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.510 
really deep really really deep into this
GM<00:05:08.990> mode<00:05:09.200> i<00:05:09.260> would<00:05:09.530> like<00:05:09.680> to<00:05:09.830> see<00:05:10.040> them<00:05:10.190> kind<00:05:10.400> of

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
GM mode i would like to see them kind of

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.460 
GM mode i would like to see them kind of
tear<00:05:10.760> it<00:05:10.880> out<00:05:11.000> and<00:05:11.330> if<00:05:11.720> you<00:05:11.840> just<00:05:12.080> wanted<00:05:12.350> to

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470

play the equivalent of association i
think<00:05:14.270> you<00:05:14.360> should<00:05:14.390> still<00:05:14.750> be<00:05:14.840> able<00:05:14.870> to<00:05:15.110> do

of this stuff and seeing how it goes

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.160 
of this stuff and seeing how it goes
again<00:05:19.040> this<00:05:19.220> won't<00:05:19.490> be<00:05:19.670> a<00:05:19.910> primary<00:05:20.330> series<00:05:20.870> on

I haven't really done a whole lot so

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.260 
I haven't really done a whole lot so
again<00:06:00.770> you<00:06:00.920> get<00:06:01.070> all<00:06:01.190> these<00:06:01.400> demands<00:06:01.910> you<00:06:02.120> get

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270
