00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 good kids jon try we are here 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.660
 in a new video of gta 5 of mods and today 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.809
 I bring you something amazing something that to me 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.910
 has really loved and is the bike 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.219
 the movie tron ​​is basically 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.379
 This cool is cool is my mother what 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.730
 host just got really is a 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.930
 paranoia now when you explain how 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.119
 you do this but it's that you're going to 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.910
 flip to see basically how you see is 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.170
 what is the motorcycle and the character as 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.869
 mounted on top of that I'm going to 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.730
 fix because it's a bit shattered 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.160
 we will help then as you can see it is that 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.020
 can see perfectly how is the uncle 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.430
 inside a mounted on your motorcycle and bone and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.649
 It's amazing when I've seen this 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.149
 drawing to put and this in gta has to 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.070
 be the milk has to be flip no and 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.050
 the truth is that it is very fun and 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.780
 well he would miss running a little bit more 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.760
 I would say but fuck is incredible that is 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.840
 thus making it easily solves 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.100
 have already put so that I have a little 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.860
 more than speed and now the truth is 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.600
 that runs pretty well is a pass or 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.460
 is that I find this here 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.680
 down the street of gta in a game 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.550
 online that you can also get in and 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.630
 would be to flip and ximo 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.480
 my mother how it jumps and everything 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.950
 do not tell me I would not give a few races 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.690
 with this to try to do it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.280
 try in some way to make a 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.560
 correct career because that is 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.420
 authentically flippant you guys 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.630
 imagine for example a tournament between 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.240
 brax ter and with this type of bikes 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.100
 It has been totally incredible and now I'm going 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.470
 to teach something that you are going to flip 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.600
 because really I 'm not the guy that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.940
 You see there is mounted but I am 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.350
 invisible tucked in to download a menu 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.500
 to be able to get invisible character 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.900
 but look if I remove it to see where it is 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.380
 this player look here is the mode 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.990
 invisible 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.579
 and I'm basically michael that comes together 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.649
 on the bike with this explain you uncle but 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.030
 clear it goes there as riding back 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.320
 a little bit ugly is not like the bike 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.179
 inside then what you do is catch 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.829
 put on the invisible character that I have 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.539
 had to download a damn mold 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.060
 to be able to put it invisible because the 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.220
 mine could not and once you put it 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.890
 invisible stays perfect or is that 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.720
 is really fantastic is amazing me 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.979
 love this mode and all the modes that 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.410
 come out lately the truth that they are 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.780
 quite cool like this as the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.340
 police car like you all the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.750
 weapons that teaches yesterday gorgeous of the 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.540
 counter and such and the truth is that 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.709
 quite surprising you liked it 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.790
 quite and to me the truth that they are 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.870
 quite liking the modes that are 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.310
 coming out lately 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.099
 let's go a little bit here with the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.440
 life today hovering invisibly the 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.170
 gun to the big rai of the call of duty 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.030
 it's pretty amazing too, that is 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.190
 I'm telling you to see if I'm going to plan 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.319
 in the first person or something fuck now the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.050
 first person but of course but not like that 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.550
 you can see the bike but it's cool too 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.450
 the truth that gives the impression of how 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.430
 who is inside the motorcycle when 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.180
 I'm really not there where the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.740
 dude, well, let's go down to 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.900
 burst it, your partner, my mother, but 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.730

 my mother I am throne the destroyer 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.739

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.220
 Come on, I'm going to destroy all the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.470
 fire truck outside mother of mine already 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.230
 really this is a pass 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.909
 that is that the mods is the best thing that 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.680
 has invented in the damn criticized uncle 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.930
 and if we run over people I will run over 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.780
 people with the bike if it's a pass and 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.569
 He is very handsome and well seen from the side to see 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.180
 young men who will step on throne 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.120

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.849
 come on let's go let my mother molaría that 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.280
 leave a trail behind as the lines 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.840
 from tron ​​uncle I think surely 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.700
 that have taken this the first what 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.200
 they will get better and they will take it out with 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.180
 leaving the line slipstream that would be 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.159
 incredible the truth would be very very 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.970
 cool we're going to step on people that I think 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:54.310
 they want a little drone bike 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.799
 this this egg that I fucking love like 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.189
 dodge one let's go let's go stomping 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.500
 stepping on fellow skulls 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.480
 all these cars annoy look at look at the 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.519
 paranoia look here the motorcycle that is in the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.530
 floor that has seen you and is blown away if you 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.350
 A little distance becomes a motorcycle 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.640
 about it becomes the motorcycle of tron ​​and 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.740
 basically because it's that motorcycle 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.230
 modified basically I have that motorcycle 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.459
 but with him with the color and that changed 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.220
 I do not know if I walk away from the table if 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.210
 will transform also I will try it 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.630
 I will move away 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.419
 look if you say transform what happened you or 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.849
 be on the hidden motorcycle you of normal the 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.530
 you see like that but people see it as a 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.930
 normal motorcycle and that when you approach 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.780
 boots on tron ​​motorbike 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.400
 mates my mother what a freakin 'you hear 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.400
 you want a little bit of these mega vouchers 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.990
 stuck people running over 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.490
 with the motorcycle because very handsome is details 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.960
 they tag close and it becomes 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.190
 flippant many kids wanted 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.930
 comment a little bit also with 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.240
 regarding the series of modes that 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.950
 like to support it and 6 more or in 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.300
 the plan of visits and that has but I 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.620
 I wish I had more light because it's 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.420
 something that I like enough work already 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.220
 how good I have to put the modes to 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.750
 I play the files that is pretty 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.030
 complex beyond what there was 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.160
 you in the video is quite difficult 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.110
 put the mods especially some by 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.970
 example this has not been very difficult but 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.530
 he also had to go find another 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.320
 mode menu to be able to make the character 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.910
 invisible and good because you think that not 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.890
 videos of this kind take their work and 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.480
 they cost more than any other kind of 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.520
 video not so I would appreciate that 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.900
 burst is the button that all of that 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.000

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.310

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.660

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.140
