thing<00:03:16.500> just<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.490> substitute<00:03:18.000> what<00:03:18.210> did<00:03:18.840> what<00:03:19.260> I

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
thing just to substitute what did what I

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.250 
thing just to substitute what did what I
was<00:03:19.470> actually<00:03:19.650> looking<00:03:19.920> for<00:03:20.310> anyway<00:03:21.270> so<00:03:22.200> okay

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
was actually looking for anyway so okay

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.400 
was actually looking for anyway so okay
now<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.830> take<00:03:23.100> one<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.490> loose<00:03:23.880> ends

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.230 

and<00:03:29.560> clip<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.490> onto<00:03:30.640> one<00:03:30.820> of<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.210> sides<00:03:33.120> at<00:03:34.120> the

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
and clip it onto one of the sides at the

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.270 
and clip it onto one of the sides at the
top<00:03:34.480> portion<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.910> copper<00:03:36.910> wire<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:39.250> a

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
top portion of the copper wire so a

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.730 
top portion of the copper wire so a
little<00:03:40.020> look<00:03:41.020> like<00:03:41.260> this

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
little look like this

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.190 
little look like this
actually<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.460> made<00:03:42.670> a<00:03:42.700> loop<00:03:43.000> there<00:03:43.300> I<00:03:43.540> just<00:03:44.020> make

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
actually I made a loop there I just make

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.790 
actually I made a loop there I just make
it<00:03:44.230> easier<00:03:44.680> just<00:03:45.070> to<00:03:45.190> chip<00:03:45.820> okay<00:03:46.720> keep<00:03:47.560> it<00:03:47.680> on

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
it easier just to chip okay keep it on

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.920 
it easier just to chip okay keep it on
keep<00:03:47.950> it<00:03:48.070> all

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:03.020 

okay<00:03:54.530> do<00:03:55.189> the<00:03:55.280> same<00:03:55.489> thing<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.939> other<00:03:55.970> side

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.250 

same<00:04:03.570> thing<00:04:03.840> clip<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.320> yeah

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:14.449 

so<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:07.920> have<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:09.120> have<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:11.659> okay<00:04:12.690> now<00:04:13.590> also

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
so you have to you have to okay now also

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.009 
so you have to you have to okay now also
you<00:04:14.700> have<00:04:14.819> to<00:04:14.909> purchase<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.299> 9-volt<00:04:15.690> battery

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
you have to purchase the 9-volt battery

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.890 
you have to purchase the 9-volt battery
it<00:04:16.169> doesn't<00:04:16.410> come<00:04:16.560> with<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.739> not<00:04:17.070> included

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
it doesn't come with it not included

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.590 
it doesn't come with it not included
that's<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.139> basically<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:19.979> need<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.430> just<00:04:21.419> take

that's so basically you need I just take

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.770 
that's so basically you need I just take
one<00:04:21.900> side<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:23.520> put<00:04:23.729> it<00:04:23.820> well<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.300> way<00:04:24.449> I<00:04:24.479> get

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
one side you put it well the way I get

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.439 
one side you put it well the way I get
it<00:04:24.870> was<00:04:24.990> I<00:04:25.110> put<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:25.440> in<00:04:25.560> one<00:04:25.889> end<00:04:26.160> of<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:27.210> tank

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
it was I put it in one end of the tank

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:28.879 
it was I put it in one end of the tank
one<00:04:27.960> op<00:04:28.139> seconds

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
one op seconds

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.650 
one op seconds
you<00:04:29.010> know<00:04:29.130> just<00:04:29.370> insert<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.240> right<00:04:30.449> in<00:04:30.570> the

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
you know just insert it right in the

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.990 
you know just insert it right in the
tank<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:31.139> then<00:04:31.740> use<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.280> other<00:04:32.460> end<00:04:32.580> and

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
tank and then use the other end and

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.030 
tank and then use the other end and
insert<00:04:33.419> it<00:04:33.570> right<00:04:33.690> in<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.500> other<00:04:34.650> side<00:04:34.860> of<00:04:34.949> the

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
insert it right in the other side of the

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.439 
insert it right in the other side of the
tank<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:35.550> don't<00:04:35.850> think<00:04:36.000> it<00:04:36.090> really<00:04:36.240> matters

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
tank I don't think it really matters

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.920 
tank I don't think it really matters
which<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:37.169> ends<00:04:37.770> or<00:04:37.889> whatever<00:04:38.220> but<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:39.150> just<00:04:39.570> did

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
it that way at one end and the other end

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.830 
it that way at one end and the other end
you<00:04:43.639> insert<00:04:44.639> those<00:04:44.820> in<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.060> tank<00:04:45.300> and<00:04:45.720> then

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
you insert those in the tank and then

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.920 
you insert those in the tank and then
you<00:04:45.960> turn<00:04:46.169> it<00:04:46.320> on<00:04:46.850> we<00:04:47.850> got<00:04:48.000> just<00:04:48.180> turn<00:04:48.690> it<00:04:48.780> on

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
automatically start hearing deemed the

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.830 
automatically start hearing deemed the
electrical<00:04:57.720> discharges<00:04:58.229> from<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:58.620> fish
