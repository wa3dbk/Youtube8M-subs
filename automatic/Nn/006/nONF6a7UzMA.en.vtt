plays that didn't go our way to go our
way<00:01:20.640> tonight<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.149> think<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.869> owe<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:22.320> whole

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
way tonight I think we owe the whole

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.620 
way tonight I think we owe the whole
team<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.250> play<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> energy

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
team is going to play with the energy

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.240 
team is going to play with the energy
that<00:01:24.659> exists<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.770> feel<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.040> right

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
that exists here you can feel it right

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.270 
that exists here you can feel it right
so<00:01:27.210> i<00:01:27.540> think<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.259> tougher<00:01:28.680> than<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.979> come<00:01:29.159> to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
so i think is tougher than to come to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.770 
so i think is tougher than to come to
