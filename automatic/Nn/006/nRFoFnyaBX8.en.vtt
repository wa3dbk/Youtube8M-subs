00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.169
 Have 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.000
 Ha 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.350
 Good morning 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.390
 I 'm a tour guide recruit 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:21.900
 This than of Armored Core Vernon di ECTS Day game tour World mode Hen Rifles 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.900
 start 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.760
 The world of Armored Coordic Day has the dominion of a huge structure called a tower 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.620
 Explore the territory 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:40.540
 Three due to a large number force war Vernon di ECTS Day University has happened 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.540
 A brief description of what kind of force of the is that First three major forces 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:48.830
 To Sirius Executive 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:51.280
 As a predecessor of the mutual aid organization formed by some representatives of the land that spared juniors 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:56.990
 Is a country 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.460
 We are achieving restoration relatively early by securing abundant supplies 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:06.940
 Convenient 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:14.940
 I would like to establish power in the form of recovery under the dictatorship leader and forced absorption of the surroundings 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:14.940
 It is a royal social system based on the class system and the most militant of the three powers 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.009
 Evergreen family 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:27.750
 Among the three largest powers, the latest one 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:34.710
 We present a three horse aspects of the other to force the second only the science and technology 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:37.920
 You participate in birdies 9 and 4 by participating as mercenaries in this third power, and the same power 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.550
 Both the area of forces hostile to the fellow 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:47.260
 Possible to fall the base will be the purpose of the World mode 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:52.850
 World mode is a battle over a certain period of time, such as a season 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:56.479
 One season ends when any one power wins 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.490
 When the season is over, all situations are reset 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:06.430
 It is also possible to change the affiliation 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:11.250
 From here actually in the place where had you know about three many force season 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.250
 We will look with the instructions to participate in the World mode 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.820
 Registration of pilot information 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.820
 Let's register your pilot information first 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.970
 Monitor 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.720
 Welcome at all 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:43.400
 Join a team or create a team 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.400
 Continue to join the team 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:52.640
 Be sure to join a team either by joining an existing team or by creating a team yourself 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.640
 Will be 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:13.320
 Let's join forces 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:19.250
 It's just a while ago that you join Birdy 9 and 4 by participating in any of the three major powers 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:27.520
 There was, but this is not possible from the start of the war , but it is also possible to join halfway 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:27.520
 However it may not always be able to complicit in force of hope necessarily taking into account the balance of matching 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:40.090
 If it breaks down to one of the powers, let's make a normal mission to play against the opposing power team 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:42.450
 The purpose of the normal species grafting it to accumulate a faith point and that cutting the endurance value of the enemy force area 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.450
 is 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:52.410
 If you win the battle, you can reduce the endurance value of the enemy power and the points of progress will be accumulated. 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.140
 With progress point 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.140
 It will be the gauge at the upper right of the sortout screen 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.220
 Next, let's set the dispatch conditions 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.760
 Opponent affiliation 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.590
 Battle area 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.590
 Faith to the priority attack target 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:20.620
 Defensive Attack Target Defense 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.620
 Participation in the Seibu table 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.800
 Participation in letter exercises with the same power team 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:34.440
 These will be set up and it will be a dispatch 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.030
 Even if the dispatch condition is a start condition and it is not always the case when matching 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.009
 There is 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:45.400
 Then you will be sent to the battle 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.400
 Fighting rules are an eradication operation to clean up the enemy 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.680
 There are two types of data recovery strategies, which recover data from data posts in a given location 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.900
 There are the following differences depending on the outcome of the match 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.760
 If you win 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:13.120
 Progress point is increased by one 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:15.550
 Themselves will reduce the endurance value of all means base case of invasion side 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.810
 If we are oa true 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.320
 The endurance value of the base recovers 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.620
 If defeated 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:29.840
 Progress points do not increase 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:32.490
 If they are invaded, the enemy base 's endurance value will be restored. 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.500
 If they are the defense side 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.910
 The durability value of the base is reduced 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:45.420
 The endurance value of each base fluctuates due to the outcome 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:47.230
 If the endurance value eventually reaches zero, the base will fall and can be resurrected 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:53.500
 not 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:58.680
 One area is made up of eight bases, and it is ultimately the most important by dropping one by one 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.680
 It will be a battle to drop the base tower 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:09.020
 I will explain the special dispatch here 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.650
 A special order is usually to select all accumulated faith points from seed grafts 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.259
 Can 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.259
 It becomes sortie of using all the points 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:24.110
 If you win this special assault, you will 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.110
 The durability of the base can be significantly reduced compared to normal launch. 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:32.940
 In the case of the defense side, the endurance value can be recovered much larger than that of the Q &amp; A governor. 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:41.230
 Also in case of special assault 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.230
 It will be a battle between the defender's team 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:50.370
 A territory is a garrison given to a team by a supporting force, and a match map at the time of a special dispatch. 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.370
 Will be 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:07:00.770
 Three and is one of the forces of the many forces survive where birdies Reserve and who has end to season 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:04.580
 It is reset and changes to the next season 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:08.700
 Because special events occur during this switching time 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:12.820
 I think you can enjoy the world mode even off the season 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:17.460
 This concludes the world mode lesson 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:20.610
 Do you know how to join World Mode ? 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:23.440
 Then with the fellows of the same power 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:27.390
 Let's fight off the addict stick 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.390
 I pray for your good luck
