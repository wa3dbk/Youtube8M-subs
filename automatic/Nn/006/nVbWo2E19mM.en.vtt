00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.109
 once again welcome you on my channel 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.180
 and today I will tell you about the Belarusian 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:06.509
 makeup cosmetics that did not cause 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.240
 to me 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.880
 positive feelings and emotions I'll start with 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.070
 hand cream here this cream sometime I 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.409
 I loved very much I do not know why something is 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.900
 I have changed but now I just donâ€™t 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:21.329
 I transfer this heavy powdery smell to me 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.399
 not going plus the effect of this cream it 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.710
 this generally no moisture is not 

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:28.470
 nutrition in two minutes this cream 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.389
 evaporates disappears from my hands 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.669
 another hand cream which too 

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:35.879
 kills me with its smell smell very 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.339
 bitter citrus saturated very 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.210
 felt on his hands and interrupts even 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:41.489
 perfume smell 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.399
 The effect of this word cream is expressed as 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.949
 as if the cream is also not finalized for the winter 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.719
 not on demi-season Cooney in the spring but do not know 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.199
 where to apply it plus an open version 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.280
 use in the form of a jar he is not very 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.140
 hygienic because microbes are here 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.659
 accumulate and product accordingly 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.370
 faster wax cream paraffin for mac you 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.859
 already seen in one of my videos i 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.600
 did a spa treatment with this 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.430
 cream I probably just do not like 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.409
 paraffin masks because it 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.200
 feeling of film on my hands me 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.939
 it annoyed me so much 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.860
 scanned my hands after this 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.810
 cream here and it says that if you 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.420
 feel like you can use peeling 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.399
 after the cream, respectively, the severity 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.290
 the effectiveness of this cream I really and not 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.549
 noticed but because it would be about mine 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.640
 hands are short-lived 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.500
 she ca n't smell anything nice 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.210
 say but the truth is probably just 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.570
 paraffin masks are not for me and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.490
 leave on the hands without scrubbing 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.500
 This cream I did not want it does not wash off 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.030
 water so after the procedure it 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.460
 use is necessary 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.310
 wet cloth or Polotenchik in 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.109
 hands well the product will not wash off with water 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.140
 and now I will show some tools for 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:51.539
 faces night with gamash scrub here gel 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.479
 base with natural almond bones 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.479
 in the form of scrubbing particles but the effect 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.509
 I would like more a lot of gel and 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.350
 very few scrubbing particles i don't 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.659
 noticed an improvement in my condition 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.629
 face relief was the same as yes and spa 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.870
 the name of this scrub so you want 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:15.629
 feasibly want to somehow harder or 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.000
 don't use middles at all i don't 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.040
 really love and another scrub which is not 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.019
 caused me no emotion this scrub 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.209
 polishing the same as applying 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.459
 ordinary cream and start this cream something 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.459
 rub on your face even on 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.480
 fingertips I did not feel at all 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.599
 no particles 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.000
 if they are they are so small that my 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.140
 they didnâ€™t take their skin at all 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.730
 noticed absolutely nothing is tonic 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.680
 which I really liked my 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.470
 moisturizing effect but not very 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.379
 liked using it was awkward 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.849
 use gel consistency 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:54.599
 which did not want to be fine from here 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.269
 emerge itself bottle solid strong 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:00.180
 plastic so push me 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.160
 so the product came out of here is difficult 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.290
 just the technical side of this 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.599
 I didn't like the bottle 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.140
 good given how many tonic trees 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.760
 washable spray with lamination effect 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.099
 This blue zhizka reminded me 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.549
 just a soap solution so his 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.799
 some kind of odor and a little bit 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.660
 hair was already described first 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.239
 well we were constantly present this 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.099
 obsessive soapy smell this no longer 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.959
 will buy this spray and and in order 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.709
 make my hair eat me i am good 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.019
 combed 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.450
 I'd rather take the same glis of chickens either with 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.609
 stroke and two more products that 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.370
 really did not like just awful 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.590
 products for my hair which 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.630
 weighed tips made the tips 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.139
 some kind of oil let alone 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.630
 the roots 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.819
 I didn't touch the roots at all because 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.769
 that I know that if I put one of these 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.569
 funds for the roots of all tomorrow I will 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.450
 wash your hair they will look terrible 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.760
 already very silicone st and u products already 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.079
 very dense but mine was the most extreme 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.599
 least did not fit 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.940
 saying about this product indelible i 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.590
 I can say that it was felt on the hair 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.450
 and if during the day I touched 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.489
 wet rock 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.500
 mika hair then this product remained 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.660
 on arms that is in fact he is not 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.629
 hair was absorbed he was on the surface 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.519
 nor did the hair resist styling 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.130

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.820
