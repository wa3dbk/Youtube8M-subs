bit<00:00:20.130> about<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.430> because<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:21.060> score<00:00:21.300> stayed

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
bit about this because the score stayed

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.090 
bit about this because the score stayed
the<00:00:21.660> same<00:00:21.689> but<00:00:22.350> some<00:00:22.619> things<00:00:22.800> are<00:00:22.920> different

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
the same but some things are different

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.160 
the same but some things are different
yeah<00:00:23.550> that's<00:00:23.820> something<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.269> probably<00:00:24.840> a

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
yeah that's something that probably a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.839 
yeah that's something that probably a
few<00:00:25.500> people<00:00:25.529> are<00:00:25.830> gonna<00:00:25.920> look<00:00:26.099> at<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.369> notice

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
few people are gonna look at that notice

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.849 
few people are gonna look at that notice
that<00:00:27.060> there<00:00:27.300> are<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> feature<00:00:28.080> discrepancy

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
that there are is a feature discrepancy

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.169 
that there are is a feature discrepancy
between<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.340> different<00:00:29.609> versions<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
between the different versions of the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.550 
between the different versions of the
game<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.599> they're<00:00:30.840> probably<00:00:30.960> wondering<00:00:31.439> why

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
game and they're probably wondering why

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.799 
game and they're probably wondering why
the<00:00:31.619> score<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.219> still<00:00:32.279> an<00:00:32.579> 8.0<00:00:33.120> across<00:00:33.450> all<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the score is still an 8.0 across all the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.630 
the score is still an 8.0 across all the
different<00:00:33.930> platforms<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:35.309> thought<00:00:35.489> we

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
different platforms so we thought we

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.069 
different platforms so we thought we
might<00:00:35.850> give<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> little<00:00:36.300> transparency

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
might give you a little transparency

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.900 
might give you a little transparency
into<00:00:37.410> our<00:00:37.500> process<00:00:37.980> here<00:00:38.250> when<00:00:38.790> you're

whereas Xbox one is 720p so you'll

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.689

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
notice certain areas where you have like

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.990 
notice certain areas where you have like
really<00:01:02.969> fine<00:01:03.750> edges<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.920> grass<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.760> or

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
really fine edges like the grass here or

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700 
really fine edges like the grass here or
maybe<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> power<00:01:06.780> lining<00:01:07.320> hanging<00:01:07.590> from

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
maybe like a power lining hanging from

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.260 
maybe like a power lining hanging from
the<00:01:07.830> sky<00:01:08.040> you're<00:01:08.580> gonna<00:01:08.700> notice<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the sky you're gonna notice it's a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.179 
the sky you're gonna notice it's a
little<00:01:09.330> more<00:01:09.659> jagged<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.500> little<00:01:10.770> more<00:01:10.860> stair

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
little more jagged a little more stair

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.200 
little more jagged a little more stair
stepping<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.790> those<00:01:12.360> edges<00:01:13.159> but<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.760> said

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
stepping in those edges but that said

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.929 
stepping in those edges but that said
other<00:01:15.659> next-gen<00:01:16.290> effects<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.890> lighting<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
other next-gen effects like lighting and

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.230 
other next-gen effects like lighting and
more<00:01:18.630> kind<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.740> pronounced<00:01:20.520> textures

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
more kind of like pronounced textures

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.020 
more kind of like pronounced textures
huh<00:01:22.040> those<00:01:23.040> are<00:01:23.400> pretty<00:01:23.700> much<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.909> same

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
huh those are pretty much the same

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.090 
huh those are pretty much the same
across<00:01:24.390> both<00:01:24.720> versions<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.350> game<00:01:25.380> they

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
across both versions of the game they

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.340 
across both versions of the game they
sound<00:01:26.340> kind<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.759> fine<00:01:27.390> differences<00:01:28.080> so

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
sound kind of like fine differences so

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.100 
sound kind of like fine differences so
you<00:01:28.619> know<00:01:28.740> if<00:01:29.159> you're<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.520> dog<00:01:29.820> cam<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:31.079> know

absolutely<00:01:43.549> but<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.820> know<00:01:45.060> at<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> end<00:01:45.390> of

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
absolutely but you know at the end of

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.660 
absolutely but you know at the end of
the<00:01:45.750> day<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.170> two<00:01:46.320> games<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.920> play<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.310> same

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the day the two games do play the same

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.069 
the day the two games do play the same
so<00:01:48.000> even<00:01:48.360> though<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.840> little<00:01:48.930> bit

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
so even though it's a little bit

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.310 
so even though it's a little bit
prettier<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.860> PlayStation<00:01:50.399> 4<00:01:50.610> version

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
prettier on the PlayStation 4 version

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.420 
prettier on the PlayStation 4 version

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
especially apparent is in lighting like

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.479 
especially apparent is in lighting like
you<00:02:28.019> look<00:02:28.260> if<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.680> was<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.950> turn<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.370> right

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
you look if I was to turn to the right

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.280 
you look if I was to turn to the right
here<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.000> kind<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.300> look<00:02:30.450> at<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.050> Rays

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
here and kind of look at the the Rays

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.589 
here and kind of look at the the Rays
coming<00:02:31.830> down<00:02:32.010> from<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.340> sky<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:33.299> would<00:02:33.390> look

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
coming down from the sky it would look

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.170 
coming down from the sky it would look
really<00:02:33.870> bright<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.799> would<00:02:35.459> be<00:02:35.640> flooding<00:02:36.090> the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
really bright and would be flooding the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.300 
really bright and would be flooding the
area<00:02:36.360> on<00:02:36.810> next-gen<00:02:37.290> whereas<00:02:37.620> I'm<00:02:37.769> current<00:02:38.099> yet

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
area on next-gen whereas I'm current yet

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.550 
area on next-gen whereas I'm current yet
those<00:02:38.910> clouds<00:02:39.239> would<00:02:39.390> be<00:02:39.510> totally<00:02:39.930> flat<00:02:40.110> so

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
those clouds would be totally flat so

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.660 
those clouds would be totally flat so
you<00:02:40.620> wouldn't<00:02:40.920> have<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:41.310> pronounced

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
you wouldn't have that pronounced
