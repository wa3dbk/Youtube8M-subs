back<00:01:10.749> to<00:01:10.929> the<00:01:11.020> granite<00:01:11.490> not<00:01:12.490> only<00:01:12.789> does<00:01:12.999> it

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
back to the granite not only does it

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.779 
back to the granite not only does it
deflect<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.749> light<00:01:13.899> and<00:01:14.109> make<00:01:14.229> it<00:01:14.409> less<00:01:15.280> shiny

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
deflect the light and make it less shiny

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.789 
deflect the light and make it less shiny
and<00:01:15.969> reflective<00:01:16.030> it<00:01:16.780> also<00:01:16.990> traps<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.499> detergent

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
and reflective it also traps a detergent

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.270 
and reflective it also traps a detergent
so<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.189> makes<00:01:18.399> it<00:01:18.579> harder<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.270> clean<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:21.159> this

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
so it makes it harder to clean so this

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.620 
so it makes it harder to clean so this
should<00:01:21.429> make<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:21.579> easier<00:01:22.030> for<00:01:22.740> people<00:01:23.740> to<00:01:24.630> want

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
should make it easier for people to want

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.599 
should make it easier for people to want
a<00:01:25.869> clean<00:01:26.409> surface<00:01:26.619> and<00:01:27.009> stay<00:01:27.189> clean<00:01:27.429> because

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
are deflecting the light

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.980 
are deflecting the light
the<00:02:12.730> difference<00:02:13.060> between<00:02:13.210> a

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
good polish and a poor polish is how

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.660 
good polish and a poor polish is how
much<00:02:17.050> light<00:02:17.290> reflects<00:02:17.800> back<00:02:18.040> up<00:02:18.280> instead<00:02:18.610> of

much light reflects back up instead of

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.700 
much light reflects back up instead of
being<00:02:18.850> deflected<00:02:19.240> away<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:20.140> now<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.350> we<00:02:20.680> have

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
being deflected away so now that we have

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.330 
being deflected away so now that we have
gotten<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.940> stone<00:02:22.690> scrub<00:02:23.080> dwell<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:24.070> just<00:02:24.250> a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
few seconds to allow it to to break up

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.560 
few seconds to allow it to to break up
the<00:02:26.620> calcium<00:02:26.910> we're<00:02:27.910> going<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.090> take<00:02:28.330> our

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
the calcium we're going to take our

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.090 
the calcium we're going to take our

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
crystal claim which is our neutral pH

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.670 
crystal claim which is our neutral pH
cleaner<00:02:30.460> and<00:02:31.360> we're<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:31.990> putting<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.440> on

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
cleaner and we're just putting this on

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.540 
cleaner and we're just putting this on
now<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:32.980> remove<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:34.390> residue<00:02:35.260> from<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:36.280> Sun

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
now to remove the residue from the Sun

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:47.220 
now to remove the residue from the Sun
scrub<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:43.620> just<00:02:44.620> by<00:02:45.030> removing<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.810> residue

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
scrub and just by removing the residue

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.020 
scrub and just by removing the residue
in<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.380> water<00:02:47.590> deposits<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.370> reflecting

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
in the water deposits and reflecting

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.880 
in the water deposits and reflecting
more<00:02:49.210> light<00:02:49.390> our<00:02:49.570> color<00:02:50.050> is<00:02:50.260> better<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.800> our

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
more light our color is better and our

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.160 
more light our color is better and our
reflectivity<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.700> better<00:02:51.910> so<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.690> next<00:02:52.900> step

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
reflectivity is better so the next step

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
reflectivity is better so the next step
then<00:02:53.440> is<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:54.030> deepen<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.180> color<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.980> add<00:02:56.980> even

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
then is to deepen the color and add even

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.560 
then is to deepen the color and add even
more<00:02:57.280> reflector<00:02:57.820> we're<00:02:57.940> going<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.120> deepen<00:02:58.450> the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
more reflector we're going to deepen the

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.510 
more reflector we're going to deepen the
color<00:02:58.810> this<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.650> granite<00:03:00.010> potato<00:03:00.370> it's<00:03:00.490> a

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
color this is a granite potato it's a

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.430 
color this is a granite potato it's a

it until it's dry we do not add any more

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.770 
it until it's dry we do not add any more
of<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.430> powder<00:03:48.640> to<00:03:48.790> it

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.560 

and<00:03:54.170> I<00:03:54.560> will<00:03:54.710> add<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:55.040> crystallizer<00:03:55.640> three<00:03:56.480> or

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
and I will add the crystallizer three or

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.510 
and I will add the crystallizer three or
four<00:03:56.720> times<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:57.080> again<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.440> can<00:03:57.590> see<00:03:57.800> it

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
four times and again you can see it

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:22.790 
four times and again you can see it
doesn't<00:03:58.820> take<00:03:59.150> a<00:03:59.180> lot<00:03:59.420> of<00:03:59.480> crystallizing

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.350 

okay<00:04:23.800> so<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:24.010> can<00:04:24.130> see<00:04:24.250> all<00:04:24.370> I've<00:04:24.490> done<00:04:24.669> is<00:04:24.940> is

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
okay so you can see all I've done is is

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.409 
okay so you can see all I've done is is
is<00:04:25.660> buff<00:04:26.290> the<00:04:26.500> crystallizer<00:04:27.100> with<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.180> still

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
is buff the crystallizer with the still

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.939 
is buff the crystallizer with the still
wall<00:04:28.600> until<00:04:28.870> it's<00:04:28.990> dry<00:04:29.199> I<00:04:29.440> don't<00:04:29.680> have<00:04:29.800> any
