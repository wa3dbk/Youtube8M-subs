than<00:04:24.280> I<00:04:24.430> was<00:04:24.580> expecting<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:25.470> usually<00:04:26.470> when<00:04:26.590> I

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
than I was expecting and usually when I

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.030 
than I was expecting and usually when I
stretch<00:04:26.919> up<00:04:27.190> like<00:04:28.030> it<00:04:28.270> takes<00:04:28.510> ages<00:04:28.750> because<00:04:29.740> I

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
stretch up like it takes ages because I

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.710 
stretch up like it takes ages because I
would<00:04:30.220> wait<00:04:30.430> at<00:04:30.610> least<00:04:30.729> four<00:04:31.030> weeks<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.660> then

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
would wait at least four weeks and then

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.719 
would wait at least four weeks and then
I<00:04:32.020> stretch<00:04:32.229> up<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:32.650> probably<00:04:33.190> my<00:04:33.400> ears<00:04:33.580> aren't

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
I stretch up and probably my ears aren't

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.570 
I stretch up and probably my ears aren't
ready<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:35.530> know<00:04:35.560> go<00:04:35.949> up<00:04:36.100> and<00:04:36.250> over<00:04:36.340> sighs

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
ready to you know go up and over sighs

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.210 
ready to you know go up and over sighs
but<00:04:36.850> I'm<00:04:36.970> impatient<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.889> hmm<00:04:38.949> and<00:04:39.960> but<00:04:41.220> I've

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
but I'm impatient and hmm and but I've

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.939 
but I'm impatient and hmm and but I've
had<00:04:42.550> a<00:04:42.790> ten<00:04:43.330> millimeter<00:04:43.540> in<00:04:43.900> my<00:04:44.020> ears<00:04:44.229> for<00:04:44.800> like

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
had a ten millimeter in my ears for like

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.800 
had a ten millimeter in my ears for like
four<00:04:45.669> months<00:04:46.060> or<00:04:46.180> something<00:04:46.389> so<00:04:46.750> that's

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
four months or something so that's

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.020 
four months or something so that's
probably<00:04:47.139> why<00:04:47.500> it's<00:04:47.830> it's<00:04:48.460> a<00:04:48.580> lot<00:04:48.729> easier<00:04:48.970> to

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
probably why it's it's a lot easier to

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.510 
probably why it's it's a lot easier to
