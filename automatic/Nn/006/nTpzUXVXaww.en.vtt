derailleur<00:00:34.270> adjustments<00:00:35.610> first<00:00:36.610> of<00:00:36.760> all

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
derailleur adjustments first of all

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.619 
derailleur adjustments first of all
we're<00:00:39.520> going<00:00:39.610> to<00:00:39.670> talk<00:00:39.790> about<00:00:39.850> limits<00:00:40.239> there's

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
we're going to talk about limits there's

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.090 
we're going to talk about limits there's
two<00:00:40.780> types<00:00:40.989> those<00:00:41.170> derailleur<00:00:41.590> adjustments

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
two types those derailleur adjustments

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.960 
two types those derailleur adjustments
the<00:00:42.610> first<00:00:42.820> place<00:00:43.000> is<00:00:43.330> the<00:00:43.690> limit<00:00:43.960> screws<00:00:44.260> and

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
the first place is the limit screws and

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.360 
the first place is the limit screws and
the<00:00:45.970> second<00:00:46.300> side<00:00:46.480> is<00:00:46.750> cable<00:00:47.620> tension<00:00:47.950> so

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
the second side is cable tension so

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.300 
the second side is cable tension so
trailer<00:00:48.970> limits<00:00:49.270> and<00:00:49.540> and<00:00:50.170> cable<00:00:50.890> tension<00:00:51.220> on

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 
trailer limits and and cable tension on

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.430 
trailer limits and and cable tension on
to<00:00:51.579> two<00:00:51.910> main<00:00:52.090> routing<00:00:52.630> elect<00:00:52.810> adjustments

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
to two main routing elect adjustments

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.670 
to two main routing elect adjustments
that<00:00:54.130> can<00:00:54.310> be<00:00:54.370> done<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:55.510> first<00:00:56.260> of<00:00:56.380> all<00:00:56.500> we<00:00:56.590> do

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
that can be done and first of all we do

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.729 
that can be done and first of all we do
is<00:00:56.770> we<00:00:56.860> take<00:00:57.010> a<00:00:57.070> look<00:00:57.280> to<00:00:57.400> limits<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.840> you'll

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
is we take a look to limits and you'll

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.760 
is we take a look to limits and you'll
notice<00:00:59.920> that<00:01:00.250> on<00:01:00.880> this<00:01:01.150> bike<00:01:01.360> right<00:01:01.570> now<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
notice that on this bike right now the

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.710 
notice that on this bike right now the
chain<00:01:03.010> is<00:01:03.160> not<00:01:03.190> dropping<00:01:03.640> down<00:01:03.910> into<00:01:04.600> the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
chain is not dropping down into the

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.230 
chain is not dropping down into the
small<00:01:05.049> cog<00:01:05.320> of<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.649> cassette<00:01:06.060> even<00:01:07.060> though

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
small cog of the cassette even though

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.630 
small cog of the cassette even though
there's<00:01:07.869> no<00:01:08.020> cable<00:01:08.350> tension<00:01:08.680> so<00:01:09.399> what<00:01:09.549> that

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
there's no cable tension so what that

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.139 
there's no cable tension so what that
means<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:10.030> that<00:01:10.170> our<00:01:11.170> high<00:01:11.470> limit<00:01:11.890> screw<00:01:12.159> is

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
means is that our high limit screw is

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.649 
means is that our high limit screw is
set<00:01:13.659> to<00:01:13.840> tight<00:01:14.110> and<00:01:15.070> if<00:01:15.909> we<00:01:16.090> look<00:01:16.270> in<00:01:16.450> very

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
set to tight and if we look in very

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.559 
set to tight and if we look in very
closely<00:01:16.960> here<00:01:17.380> at<00:01:17.679> the<00:01:17.859> rear<00:01:18.039> derailleur

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:18.569 
closely here at the rear derailleur

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.010 
closely here at the rear derailleur
you'll<00:01:19.569> notice<00:01:19.869> these<00:01:19.990> two<00:01:20.259> small<00:01:20.649> screws

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
you'll notice these two small screws

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.330 
you'll notice these two small screws
those<00:01:23.020> are<00:01:23.200> your<00:01:23.409> limit<00:01:23.649> screws<00:01:23.950> you<00:01:24.280> have

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
those are your limit screws you have

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.699 
those are your limit screws you have
your<00:01:24.670> your<00:01:25.420> high<00:01:25.630> limit<00:01:25.899> screw<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:26.469> your<00:01:26.590> low

00:01:26.699 --> 00:01:26.709 
your your high limit screw and your low

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:33.569 
your your high limit screw and your low
limit<00:01:27.009> screw<00:01:31.950> even<00:01:32.950> though<00:01:33.039> this<00:01:33.189> is<00:01:33.369> the

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
limit screw even though this is the

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.459 
limit screw even though this is the
small<00:01:33.939> cog<00:01:34.179> back<00:01:34.450> here<00:01:34.719> this<00:01:34.990> is<00:01:35.139> the<00:01:35.289> high

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
small cog back here this is the high

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.699 
small cog back here this is the high
gear<00:01:35.829> in<00:01:36.039> this<00:01:36.819> case<00:01:36.999> it's<00:01:37.179> a<00:01:37.270> 12<00:01:37.539> tooth<00:01:37.749> that's

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
gear in this case it's a 12 tooth that's

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:40.590 
gear in this case it's a 12 tooth that's
our<00:01:38.829> high<00:01:38.979> gear<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:39.609> I'm<00:01:40.090> going<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.329> take<00:01:40.450> our

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
our high gear so I'm going to take our

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.879 
our high gear so I'm going to take our
high<00:01:40.779> limit<00:01:41.170> screw<00:01:41.259> which<00:01:41.469> is<00:01:41.499> usually<00:01:41.859> the

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:41.889 
high limit screw which is usually the

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:44.940 
high limit screw which is usually the
top<00:01:42.159> screw<00:01:42.459> and<00:01:43.299> we<00:01:43.450> are<00:01:43.539> going<00:01:43.719> to<00:01:43.869> back<00:01:44.649> that

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
top screw and we are going to back that

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.279 
top screw and we are going to back that
up<00:01:45.219> which<00:01:45.670> will<00:01:45.909> allow<00:01:46.029> the<00:01:46.090> chance<00:01:46.509> to<00:01:46.779> move

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
up which will allow the chance to move

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.510 
up which will allow the chance to move
over<00:01:47.799> and<00:01:48.579> so<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:50.229> judge<00:01:50.439> how<00:01:50.649> far<00:01:50.889> back<00:01:51.100> screw

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
over and so to judge how far back screw

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.630 
over and so to judge how far back screw
up<00:01:51.670> we're<00:01:51.880> just<00:01:51.939> gonna<00:01:52.119> start<00:01:52.329> pedaling<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
up we're just gonna start pedaling and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.800 
up we're just gonna start pedaling and
you're<00:01:57.640> hearing<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:57.940> chain<00:01:58.240> now<00:01:58.480> starting<00:01:58.780> to

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
you're hearing the chain now starting to

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.210 
you're hearing the chain now starting to
click<00:01:59.050> a<00:01:59.080> little<00:01:59.260> bit<00:01:59.410> because<00:01:59.680> it's<00:01:59.890> almost

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
click a little bit because it's almost

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.730 
click a little bit because it's almost
shifting<00:02:00.640> though<00:02:01.020> there<00:02:02.020> we<00:02:02.140> go<00:02:02.260> I<00:02:02.290> backed<00:02:02.590> it

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
shifting though there we go I backed it

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.880 
shifting though there we go I backed it
off<00:02:02.860> about<00:02:03.040> half<00:02:03.910> a<00:02:03.970> turn<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:05.560> chain<00:02:05.770> is

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
off about half a turn and the chain is

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.650 
off about half a turn and the chain is
now<00:02:06.040> where<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:06.340> should<00:02:06.550> be<00:02:06.700> what<00:02:07.450> we're<00:02:07.540> going

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
now where it should be what we're going

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.500 
now where it should be what we're going
to<00:02:07.750> do<00:02:07.930> now<00:02:08.080> it's<00:02:08.229> using<00:02:08.890> cable<00:02:09.310> tension<00:02:09.640> we're

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
to do now it's using cable tension we're

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.780 
to do now it's using cable tension we're
going<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.690> see<00:02:10.810> if<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:11.110> chain<00:02:11.620> drops<00:02:12.490> down<00:02:12.730> to

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
going to see if that chain drops down to

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.000 
going to see if that chain drops down to
that<00:02:13.150> 12<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.690> about<00:02:14.080> hesitation<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.710> see<00:02:14.920> of

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
that 12 to about hesitation you see of

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.230 
that 12 to about hesitation you see of
that<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:18.310> goes<00:02:18.430> from<00:02:18.490> one<00:02:18.820> end<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
that is it goes from one end of the

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.180 
that is it goes from one end of the
cassettes<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.960> other<00:02:20.110> smoothly<00:02:20.560> without

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
cassettes the other smoothly without

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.670 
cassettes the other smoothly without
hesitation<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.970> means<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:23.020> our

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
hesitation that means that that our

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.940 
hesitation that means that that our
limit<00:02:24.190> screws<00:02:24.520> are<00:02:24.760> set<00:02:24.910> properly<00:02:25.830> next<00:02:26.830> we

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
limit screws are set properly next we

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.260 
limit screws are set properly next we
let's<00:02:27.100> take<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.250> look<00:02:27.400> at<00:02:27.490> cable<00:02:27.760> tension<00:02:28.060> so

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
let's take a look at cable tension so

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.680 
let's take a look at cable tension so
when<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.690> try<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:28.930> shift<00:02:30.300> nothing's<00:02:31.300> happening

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
when I try to shift nothing's happening

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.670 
when I try to shift nothing's happening
and<00:02:32.650> it's<00:02:33.100> like<00:02:33.280> it's<00:02:33.430> full<00:02:33.730> gear<00:02:34.240> off<00:02:34.680> what

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
and it's like it's full gear off what

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.230 
and it's like it's full gear off what
does<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:35.830> mean<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:36.190> means<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.460> cable<00:02:36.940> tension

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
does that mean it means a cable tension

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.260 
does that mean it means a cable tension
is<00:02:37.360> not<00:02:37.510> set<00:02:37.780> up<00:02:37.810> really<00:02:38.410> in<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.130> case<00:02:39.340> the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
is not set up really in this case the

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.160 
is not set up really in this case the
cable<00:02:40.780> as<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.830> shipped<00:02:42.070> from<00:02:42.630> from<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.750> high<00:02:43.900> gear

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
cable as I shipped from from a high gear

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.640 
cable as I shipped from from a high gear
up<00:02:44.710> one<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.720> chain<00:02:46.720> is<00:02:46.840> not<00:02:46.990> moving<00:02:47.320> at<00:02:47.530> all

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
up one the chain is not moving at all

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.260 
up one the chain is not moving at all
which<00:02:48.070> means<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.490> we<00:02:48.640> need<00:02:48.760> more<00:02:48.940> cable

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
which means that we need more cable

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.270 
which means that we need more cable
tension<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:50.260> for<00:02:50.440> more<00:02:50.620> cable<00:02:50.920> tension<00:02:51.220> we

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
tension so for more cable tension we

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.040 
tension so for more cable tension we
take<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.700> rear<00:02:52.060> derailleur<00:02:52.209> barrel<00:02:52.660> adjuster

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
take the rear derailleur barrel adjuster

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.660 
take the rear derailleur barrel adjuster
and<00:02:53.680> turn<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:53.980> counterclockwise<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:56.670> what

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
and turn it counterclockwise and what

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.600 
and turn it counterclockwise and what
we're<00:02:57.760> going<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:57.910> do<00:02:58.060> is<00:02:58.180> just<00:02:59.370> shift<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.489> up

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
we're going to do is just shift it up

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.520 
we're going to do is just shift it up
one<00:03:01.000> gear<00:03:01.209> on<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.420> shifter<00:03:01.750> we're<00:03:02.350> going<00:03:02.470> to

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
one gear on the shifter we're going to

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.840 
one gear on the shifter we're going to
use<00:03:02.620> our<00:03:02.709> barrel<00:03:03.010> adjuster<00:03:03.370> turn<00:03:03.760> it

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
use our barrel adjuster turn it

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.640 
use our barrel adjuster turn it
counterclockwise<00:03:04.090> until<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.900> moves<00:03:05.320> up<00:03:05.500> the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
counterclockwise until it moves up the

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.910 
counterclockwise until it moves up the
gear<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:06.280> just<00:03:06.489> did<00:03:06.640> that

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
gear you just did that

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.620 
gear you just did that
and<00:03:08.920> there<00:03:09.220> see<00:03:09.400> how<00:03:09.580> it<00:03:09.700> shifts<00:03:10.270> in<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.510> rest

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
and there see how it shifts in the rest

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.000 
and there see how it shifts in the rest
of<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.810> years<00:03:11.019> there's<00:03:11.620> still<00:03:11.650> a<00:03:11.800> bit<00:03:11.920> of

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
of the years there's still a bit of

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.710 
of the years there's still a bit of
hesitation<00:03:12.130> so<00:03:12.640> I'm<00:03:12.760> going<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.120> increase

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
hesitation so I'm going to increase

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.750 
hesitation so I'm going to increase
cable<00:03:14.080> tension<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.380> little<00:03:14.560> bit<00:03:14.830> more<00:03:17.760> and

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
cable tension a little bit more and

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.100 
cable tension a little bit more and
we're<00:03:18.880> slowly<00:03:19.150> go<00:03:19.360> through<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.630> gears<00:03:19.870> and

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
we're slowly go through the gears and

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.840 
we're slowly go through the gears and
make<00:03:20.260> sure<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:21.100> chain<00:03:21.340> goes<00:03:21.550> from<00:03:21.700> one

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
make sure that the chain goes from one

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.880 
make sure that the chain goes from one
gear<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.209> next<00:03:22.510> smoothly<00:03:23.470> without

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
gear the next smoothly without

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.600 
gear the next smoothly without
hesitation<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:26.530> seems<00:03:26.769> like<00:03:26.950> it's<00:03:27.070> hesitating

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
hesitation it seems like it's hesitating

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.699 
hesitation it seems like it's hesitating
to<00:03:27.850> give<00:03:27.970> up<00:03:28.120> well<00:03:29.080> when<00:03:29.200> you<00:03:29.290> just<00:03:29.320> turn<00:03:29.590> the

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
to give up well when you just turn the

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.979 
to give up well when you just turn the
brownest<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.250> counterclockwise<00:03:30.820> let's<00:03:31.330> have

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
a fitting to come down then you turn it

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.509 
a fitting to come down then you turn it
clockwise<00:03:34.290> right<00:03:35.290> now<00:03:35.440> this<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:35.800> chipping<00:03:36.220> per
