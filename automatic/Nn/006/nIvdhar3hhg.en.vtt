let's go ahead and upgrade burrow and

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.809 
let's go ahead and upgrade burrow and
we're<00:02:34.070> going<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.250> go<00:02:34.340> ahead<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.579> upgrade

we're going to go ahead and upgrade

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.000 
we're going to go ahead and upgrade
these<00:02:35.150> guys<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.690> what<00:02:36.140> this<00:02:36.290> one<00:02:36.620> here<00:02:36.859> does

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
these guys and what this one here does

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.190 
these guys and what this one here does
this<00:02:37.220> tunneling<00:02:37.670> Klaus<00:02:37.880> is<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.600> allows<00:02:38.900> these

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
this tunneling Klaus is it allows these

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.020 
this tunneling Klaus is it allows these
guys<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.650> move<00:02:39.799> on<00:02:40.010> their<00:02:40.160> underground<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:40.730> it

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
guys to move on their underground and it

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.210 
guys to move on their underground and it
also<00:02:41.299> increases<00:02:41.720> their<00:02:42.170> life<00:02:42.410> regeneration

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
also increases their life regeneration

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.880 
also increases their life regeneration
while<00:02:43.489> they<00:02:43.640> are<00:02:43.730> burrowed<00:02:44.319> which<00:02:45.319> allows

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
while they are burrowed which allows

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.000 
while they are burrowed which allows
some<00:02:46.310> interesting<00:02:46.970> micro<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.600> develop<00:02:48.199> let's

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
some interesting micro to develop let's

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.530 
some interesting micro to develop let's
go<00:02:49.160> ahead<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.459> do<00:02:49.699> the<00:02:49.820> same<00:02:50.030> thing<00:02:50.269> over<00:02:50.389> here

on<00:02:52.250> us<00:02:52.370> up<00:02:52.580> some<00:02:52.940> roaches<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:54.230> we'll<00:02:54.980> go<00:02:55.100> ahead

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
on us up some roaches and we'll go ahead

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.590 
on us up some roaches and we'll go ahead
and<00:02:55.340> upgrade<00:02:55.580> them<00:02:55.940> even<00:02:56.240> though<00:02:56.330> I'm<00:02:56.570> not

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
and upgrade them even though I'm not

at that I still have the majority of my
roaches<00:03:45.230> here<00:03:45.680> simply<00:03:46.459> because<00:03:46.489> all<00:03:46.909> i<00:03:46.940> did

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
roaches here simply because all i did

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.869 
roaches here simply because all i did
was<00:03:47.420> /<00:03:47.780> o<00:03:47.810> them<00:03:48.140> and<00:03:48.379> an<00:03:48.680> unburned<00:03:49.099> them<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.580> i

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
another little trick up here let's go

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.880 
another little trick up here let's go
ahead<00:03:59.750> and<00:03:59.959> spawn<00:04:00.379> in<00:04:02.290> six<00:04:03.290> stalkers<00:04:03.860> and

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
ahead and spawn in six stalkers and

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.220 
ahead and spawn in six stalkers and
let's<00:04:04.220> let's<00:04:04.819> bring<00:04:05.000> in<00:04:05.120> six<00:04:05.390> stalkers<00:04:05.840> from

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
let's let's bring in six stalkers from

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:13.300 
let's let's bring in six stalkers from
this<00:04:06.560> side<00:04:10.720> now<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:12.230> what's<00:04:12.440> key<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.860> this<00:04:13.010> is

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
this side now the what's key to this is

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.020 
this side now the what's key to this is
an<00:04:13.489> ability<00:04:13.760> called<00:04:14.140> blink<00:04:15.140> now<00:04:16.130> naturally<00:04:16.489> if

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
an ability called blink now naturally if

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.680 
an ability called blink now naturally if
we<00:04:17.329> if<00:04:17.660> we<00:04:18.049> fight<00:04:18.440> these<00:04:18.620> guys<00:04:18.889> together

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
we if we fight these guys together

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.420 
we if we fight these guys together
they're<00:04:20.690> going<00:04:20.989> to<00:04:21.109> come<00:04:21.289> out<00:04:21.320> basically<00:04:21.979> even

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
they're going to come out basically even

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.330 
they're going to come out basically even
and<00:04:22.870> there<00:04:23.870> you're<00:04:24.470> going<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.680> have<00:04:24.830> maybe<00:04:25.070> one

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
and there you're going to have maybe one

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.730 
and there you're going to have maybe one
unit<00:04:25.639> on<00:04:25.760> each<00:04:25.880> side<00:04:26.150> until<00:04:26.449> you're<00:04:27.199> probably

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
unit on each side until you're probably

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.129 
unit on each side until you're probably
be<00:04:27.949> left<00:04:28.160> with<00:04:28.310> one<00:04:28.550> unit<00:04:29.030> sometimes<00:04:29.900> two

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
be left with one unit sometimes two

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.590 
be left with one unit sometimes two
depending<00:04:30.560> on<00:04:30.650> how<00:04:30.800> it<00:04:30.979> plays<00:04:31.190> out<00:04:31.600> but

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
depending on how it plays out but

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.870 
depending on how it plays out but
generally<00:04:33.020> speaking<00:04:33.229> it<00:04:33.770> is<00:04:33.919> a<00:04:33.949> pretty<00:04:34.370> equal

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
generally speaking it is a pretty equal

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.730 
generally speaking it is a pretty equal
fight<00:04:35.090> if<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.300> just<00:04:35.539> let<00:04:35.660> them<00:04:35.750> fight<00:04:35.960> but

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
fight if you just let them fight but

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.000 
fight if you just let them fight but
however<00:04:36.949> if<00:04:37.550> you<00:04:37.820> use<00:04:38.600> proper<00:04:39.139> micro

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
however if you use proper micro

as<00:05:09.199> you<00:05:09.530> see<00:05:09.710> I<00:05:09.740> want<00:05:10.039> an<00:05:10.129> item<00:05:10.400> do<00:05:10.550> a<00:05:10.580> very<00:05:10.909> good

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
as you see I want an item do a very good

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.540 
as you see I want an item do a very good
job<00:05:11.180> of<00:05:11.780> blinking<00:05:12.590> there<00:05:12.800> but<00:05:12.949> I<00:05:13.039> still<00:05:13.340> won

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
job of blinking there but I still won

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.339 
job of blinking there but I still won
the<00:05:13.669> battle<00:05:14.060> somebody<00:05:14.689> who<00:05:14.840> is<00:05:14.960> much<00:05:15.169> more

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
the battle somebody who is much more

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:16.990 
the battle somebody who is much more
proficient<00:05:15.860> at<00:05:15.949> blinking<00:05:16.340> can<00:05:16.490> actually

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
proficient at blinking can actually

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.179 
proficient at blinking can actually
probably<00:05:17.300> save<00:05:17.689> about<00:05:17.930> four<00:05:18.289> or<00:05:18.319> five<00:05:18.409> of

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:19.189 
probably save about four or five of

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:21.700 
probably save about four or five of
those<00:05:19.550> stalkers<00:05:20.000> and<00:05:20.449> there<00:05:21.199> is<00:05:21.349> a<00:05:21.379> very<00:05:21.650> good

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
those stalkers and there is a very good

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.679 
those stalkers and there is a very good
video<00:05:22.159> I<00:05:22.219> recommend<00:05:23.030> you<00:05:23.120> watch<00:05:23.300> it<00:05:23.569> I<00:05:23.659> don't

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:23.689 
video I recommend you watch it I don't

video I recommend you watch it I don't
think<00:05:23.990> it's<00:05:24.110> on<00:05:24.229> a<00:05:24.259> replay<00:05:24.770> anymore<00:05:25.129> because

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
think it's on a replay anymore because

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.670 
think it's on a replay anymore because
it<00:05:25.430> was<00:05:25.520> in<00:05:25.639> the<00:05:25.729> theta<00:05:25.939> but<00:05:26.569> it<00:05:26.689> was<00:05:26.840> between<00:05:27.319> I

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
it was in the theta but it was between I
