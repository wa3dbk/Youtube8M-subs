 we are here with the nexus 7 the tablet from 7 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.509
 inches of google that surely 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.900
 you know and we show you today one 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.689
 small preview of what android 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.430
 4.242 was released today though 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.859
 only in the hands of the download for 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.269
 established here therefore it must be forced the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.920
 loading in the coming days 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.859
 surely google will make it available 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.360
 update on air ota and all 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.460
 owners can do to equip 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.480
 live update at the moment you can 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.219
 we did it 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.680
 it is only a matter of sending the file 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.260
 zip point downloaded to the desktop at 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.300
 device but an operation that we recommend 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.710
 to do to everyone even if you can find 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.899
 quietly the guides on the internet and 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.100
 if you follow them you should reach 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.550
 conclude the transaction with no 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.360
 problem 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.309
 what brings the 4.2 on the tablet 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.539
 vehicles we talked about android 4.0 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.460
 we once said he was a 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.199
 small update of jelly beans is 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.149
 made especially for tablets because how 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.629
 see below there is already a small one 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.790
 Announcements 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.670
 the most important news is precisely the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.630
 multiuser on the android tablet allows 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.890
 to manage two or more users on the same 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.170
 system every user will have his 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.070
 lockscreen obviously every user at 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.530
 its applications 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.939
 every user will have his part 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.259
 configured and eventually will also be 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.979
 You can protect your own 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.780
 part with its apps if its data is 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.360
 whatever else we see just that 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.750
 unlocking for example second account 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.380
 we are catapulted into this baseball 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.070
 while they call and call us back 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.600
 that of the owner we come 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.220
 catapult instead into what is the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.049
 right of the owner with the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.509
 applications that were open then a 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.240
 true multitasking in the long run must 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.119
 see if this multitasking with double 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.760
 user or even more than one more than 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.100
 prudence takes away 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.870
 autonomy to the tar we see how it is 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.240
 add additional loads, the 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.920
 settings added this this 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.600
 small tab called users where 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.100
 we can go and add we have 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.810
 reached our and the editorial staff 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.420
 adding an additional the ok not it 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:21.270
 we configure now but there is a user in 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.860
 more than appears below when 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.410
 we click on the additional user and we do 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.610
 starting swipe the automatically 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.710
 tablet allows a configuration 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.230
 device wizard by associating 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.330
 google account and then uploading 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.540
 his other personal settings 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.070
 news of android 4.2 that we remember 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.980
 always calls jelly beans 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.660
 as you can see the system has changed 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.460
 still the screen because for each user 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.320
 assigns a different background such that 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.700
 be recognizable 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.459
 who used this tablet is immediately 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.030
 the difference in exchange rate of different fund 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.620
 for the time and presence of others 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.450
 own additional screens that you don't have 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.010
 seen on nexus 4 to reach gods 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.230
 widget directly on the screen 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.520
 but there are few, but we could 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.350
 add many more for example 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.459
 we are adding a folder of the 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.550
 mail news obviously google music 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:18.209
 other news integrated into google play 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.300
 today google has opened google music yes 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.400
 can load up to 20,000 songs 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.370
 no limits on the cloud space e 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.260
 automatically if we do update 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.709
 google play music on the device will come 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.760
 downloaded these tracks from the cloud for 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.290
 upload tracks you need to download 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.720
 an application on the computer because 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.300
 we saw that if he eats it 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.860
 music loaded on the device does not come 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.360
 recognized by the scan ha function 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.470
 instead it is not made available on 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.019
 cloud so you have to go to 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.870
 recharge it manually and in case 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.000
 which is recognized will be made 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.030
 available with the scan function 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.130
 and match news today 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.900
 even here the chance to buy 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.670
 music in addition to charging it 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.320
 therefore beyond the applications books is 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.000
 just the music tab appeared there 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.820
 will allow you to download and buy 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.710
 some that will be part of ours 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:12.990
 entertainment package of the nexus 7 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.630
 other two new features of android 4.2 ipx7 in 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.680
 they saw them on one side 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.890
 pulling down 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.790
 in the center is the notification bar 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.760
 instead pulling us where the clock is 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.820
 It appears quiz pollute the bar 7 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.340
 small icons that go to manage for 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.620
 eg wireless or bluetooth la 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.290
 wife tahereh brightness and recall 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.040
 directly the settings this not 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.660
 was available on 4.1 jelly beans is 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.360
 occurring on the gelima 4.2 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.800
 last thing we do the keyboard 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.140
 see for example that it has been added 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.350
 a keyboard and swipe type we must do 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.419
 of gods we can simply drag 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:57.450
 now of course it's a bit difficult with 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:59.600
 but only the basic Roberto ideas 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.940
 drag a delta swipe your fingers over the 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.750
 on the keyboard to make google dial 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.750
 the desired word
