like the home placements so there's the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.350 
like the home placements so there's the
part<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.560> there's<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.100> comb<00:01:41.460> right<00:01:41.850> here

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360

there's<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.229> coming<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.920> which<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:45.500> understand

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
there's a coming here which I understand

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.340 
there's a coming here which I understand
why<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.520> need<00:01:47.820> combs<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.570> close<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
why you need combs that close so the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.380 
why you need combs that close so the
part<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.979> felt<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.670> should<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:51.060> lower

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
part I felt like that should be lower

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.399 
part I felt like that should be lower
down<00:01:52.369> so<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.430> secured<00:01:53.960> it<00:01:54.960> should<00:01:55.110> be<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> little

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
down so it secured it should be a little

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.730 
down so it secured it should be a little
bit<00:01:55.590> lower<00:01:56.180> but<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.240> don't<00:01:57.930> use<00:01:58.140> those<00:01:58.350> combs

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
bit lower but I don't use those combs

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.490 
bit lower but I don't use those combs
here<00:01:59.070> anyways<00:01:59.610> cuz<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.030> feel<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.409> because<00:02:01.409> I

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
here anyways cuz I feel like because I

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.499 
here anyways cuz I feel like because I
like<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.950> can<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.130> very<00:02:02.610> damaging<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.360> get

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509

starting<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.570> try<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.810> clump<00:03:14.230> together

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:43.170 

Yeah<00:03:38.940> right<00:03:39.940> there<00:03:40.750> is<00:03:40.959> no<00:03:41.489> body<00:03:42.489> there's<00:03:43.090> no

fluff there's no nothing

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.550 
fluff there's no nothing
I<00:03:45.190> mean<00:03:45.850> it<00:03:46.000> makes<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.329> look<00:03:46.450> more<00:03:46.660> natural<00:03:46.720> but

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
I mean it makes it look more natural but

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.160 
I mean it makes it look more natural but
then<00:03:47.799> you<00:03:47.890> just<00:03:47.950> have<00:03:48.690> flattened<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:49.840> year

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170
