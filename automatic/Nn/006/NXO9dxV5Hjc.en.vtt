get five sheets then we have 25 sheets
of<00:00:32.730> laser<00:00:33.030> film<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.380> up<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.980> higher

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
of laser film now this is up a higher

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.060 
of laser film now this is up a higher
quality<00:00:36.000> laser<00:00:36.360> film<00:00:36.809> that's<00:00:37.440> used<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:37.980> your

detailed design photos it's a great film

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.490 
detailed design photos it's a great film
for<00:00:41.879> your<00:00:42.059> laser<00:00:42.270> printer<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.469> a

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
for your laser printer and you get a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
for your laser printer and you get a
full<00:00:43.800> path<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.250> 25<00:00:44.850> sheets<00:00:46.129> next<00:00:47.129> we<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.370> is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
full path of 25 sheets next we have is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.729 
full path of 25 sheets next we have is
our<00:00:47.640> magic<00:00:47.850> dark<00:00:48.239> now<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.809> used<00:00:49.170> for<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
our magic dark now this is used for a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.279 
our magic dark now this is used for a
laser<00:00:50.250> printer<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:52.050> for

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
laser printer so this is going to be for

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.500 
laser printer so this is going to be for
your<00:00:52.410> UV<00:00:52.770> vellum<00:00:53.160> or<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.789> your<00:00:53.910> laser<00:00:54.149> film

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
your UV vellum or for your laser film

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.779 
your UV vellum or for your laser film
but<00:00:54.960> what<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.230> does<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.739> darkens<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.370> print

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
but what it does is it darkens the print

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.490 
but what it does is it darkens the print
so<00:00:56.969> if<00:00:57.059> your<00:00:57.180> laser<00:00:57.390> printer<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:58.050> printing

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
so if your laser printer is not printing

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.080 
so if your laser printer is not printing
dark<00:00:59.160> enough<00:00:59.399> prints<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.120> apply<00:01:00.570> this

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
dark enough prints you can apply this

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.630 
dark enough prints you can apply this
and<00:01:02.180> use<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.930> roller<00:01:03.230> and<00:01:04.070> it<00:01:04.220> will<00:01:04.339> darken

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
and use the roller and it will darken

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.910 
and use the roller and it will darken
your<00:01:04.879> toner<00:01:05.330> on<00:01:05.510> those<00:01:05.870> prints<00:01:06.290> making<00:01:06.650> it<00:01:06.740> a

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
your toner on those prints making it a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.520 
your toner on those prints making it a
usable<00:01:07.460> print

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
usable print

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.310 
usable print
next<00:01:10.220> we<00:01:10.370> have<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.700> our<00:01:10.850> wash<00:01:11.060> out<00:01:11.300> hose<00:01:11.540> and

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
next we have is our wash out hose and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.170 
next we have is our wash out hose and
this<00:01:12.470> comes<00:01:12.740> with<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:12.980> faucet<00:01:13.370> adapter<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:14.150> it

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
this comes with a faucet adapter so it

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.250 
this comes with a faucet adapter so it
fits<00:01:14.450> most<00:01:14.920> faucets<00:01:16.390> then<00:01:17.390> we<00:01:17.510> have<00:01:17.690> is<00:01:17.930> on<00:01:18.229> the

you need to but once you place your
exposed<00:01:50.360> photoresist<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.500> you<00:01:51.560> start

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
exposed photoresist and you start

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.219 
exposed photoresist and you start
washing<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:52.430> out<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:53.240> can<00:01:53.390> see<00:01:53.630> your<00:01:53.810> design

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
washing it out you can see your design

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.469 
washing it out you can see your design
develop<00:01:54.740> because<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:55.340> looks<00:01:55.550> white<00:01:55.970> because

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
develop because it looks white because
