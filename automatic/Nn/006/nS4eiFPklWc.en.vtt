however<00:00:47.070> if<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.340> really<00:00:47.700> want<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.940> focus<00:00:48.059> on

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
however if you really want to focus on

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.299 
however if you really want to focus on
conditioning<00:00:48.899> yourself<00:00:48.989> right<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.770> and

conditioning yourself right and and

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.979 
conditioning yourself right and and
having<00:00:50.640> something<00:00:51.030> that's<00:00:51.180> very<00:00:51.300> durable<00:00:51.600> and

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
having something that's very durable and

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.290 
having something that's very durable and
lifelong<00:00:52.920> then<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.670> would<00:00:53.789> definitely<00:00:54.120> choose

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
lifelong then I would definitely choose

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.660 
lifelong then I would definitely choose
something<00:00:54.539> that's<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.780> little<00:00:54.840> more<00:00:54.989> high-end

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
something that's a little more high-end

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.639 
something that's a little more high-end
so<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.329> made<00:00:57.480> out<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.899> aircraft

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
so this is made out of the aircraft

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.279 
so this is made out of the aircraft
aluminum<00:00:59.309> construction<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:00.270> think<00:01:01.170> at<00:01:01.260> one

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
aluminum construction I think at one

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.779 
aluminum construction I think at one
time<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.590> was<00:01:01.710> sponsored<00:01:01.890> by<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> Olympic<00:01:02.609> so

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
time I was sponsored by the Olympic so

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.780 
time I was sponsored by the Olympic so
it<00:01:02.910> has<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> logo<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:04.220> this<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> foam

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
it has a logo on here this is a foam

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.460 
it has a logo on here this is a foam
grip<00:01:06.290> it's<00:01:07.290> hollow<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.920> inside<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:09.659> there

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
grip it's hollow on the inside and there

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.080 
grip it's hollow on the inside and there
needs<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.860> ball<00:01:11.040> bearing<00:01:11.430> control<00:01:11.820> so

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
needs the ball bearing control so

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.640 
needs the ball bearing control so
therefore<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.840> rope<00:01:13.290> doesn't<00:01:13.500> get

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
therefore that the rope doesn't get

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.070 
therefore that the rope doesn't get
tangled<00:01:14.040> if<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.090> look<00:01:15.270> closely<00:01:15.479> right<00:01:15.810> here

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
tangled if you look closely right here

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.600 
tangled if you look closely right here
you<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.380> see<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.890> clear<00:01:17.159> nylon

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
you can see that it's a clear nylon

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.539 
you can see that it's a clear nylon
tubing<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.780> jump<00:01:19.229> ropes<00:01:19.439> comb<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.250> certain

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
length of course I had a trim mine down

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.090 
length of course I had a trim mine down
inside<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.390> right<00:01:24.750> here<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.259> screwed

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
inside of this right here is a screwed

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.819 
inside of this right here is a screwed
thread<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.479> hollow<00:01:27.689> tubing<00:01:28.110> then<00:01:28.350> threads

light<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.630> would<00:01:36.780> probably<00:01:36.810> more

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
light so this would probably more

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.530 
light so this would probably more
consider<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.860> speed<00:01:38.130> rope<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:39.509> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
consider of a speed rope so you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.850 
consider of a speed rope so you
definitely<00:01:39.750> get<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.200> whole<00:01:40.380> lot<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.680> momentum

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
definitely get a whole lot of momentum

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.100 
definitely get a whole lot of momentum
to<00:01:41.130> keep<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.400> going<00:01:41.700> there's<00:01:42.540> other<00:01:42.750> kinds<00:01:43.079> of

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
to keep it going there's other kinds of

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.630 
to keep it going there's other kinds of
rope<00:01:43.229> there<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> market<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.549> have

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
rope there on the market one to have

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.350 
rope there on the market one to have
nylon<00:01:44.790> beads<00:01:45.290> some<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.790> like

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
nylon beads some have just just the like

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.990 
nylon beads some have just just the like
a<00:01:48.390> cotton<00:01:48.810> material<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.560> then<00:01:50.310> some<00:01:50.850> are

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
a cotton material and then some are

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.370 
a cotton material and then some are
actually<00:01:51.329> weighted<00:01:51.689> like<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> handles<00:01:52.259> are

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
actually weighted like the handles are

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.240 
actually weighted like the handles are
weighted<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.680> everything<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.100> just

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
weighted and everything like that just

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.469 
weighted and everything like that just
kind<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.700> depends<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.060> what<00:01:54.240> kind<00:01:54.390> of

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
kind of depends on what kind of

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.359 
kind of depends on what kind of
conditioning<00:01:55.290> exercises<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.950> want<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.219> do

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
conditioning exercises you want to do

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.670 
conditioning exercises you want to do
okay<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.540> next<00:01:57.960> what<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.200> want<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> talk<00:01:58.560> about

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
okay so next what I want to talk about

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.590 
okay so next what I want to talk about
is<00:01:59.009> once<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.430> get<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.579> rope<00:01:59.850> how<00:02:00.119> do<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.299> adjust

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
is once you get a rope how do I adjust

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.990 
is once you get a rope how do I adjust
the<00:02:00.960> length<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.710> matches<00:02:01.829> me<00:02:02.219> so

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the length so that it matches me so

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.700 
the length so that it matches me so
everybody<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.509> different<00:02:03.840> height<00:02:03.990> bear

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
everybody is a different height bear

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.170 
everybody is a different height bear
with<00:02:04.860> me<00:02:05.009> because<00:02:05.100> I'm<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.399> one-man<00:02:05.579> show<00:02:06.000> right

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
with me because I'm a one-man show right

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.930 
with me because I'm a one-man show right
here<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.750> I'm<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.409> do<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.710> drop<00:02:08.039> drop<00:02:08.759> on

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
here so I'm going to do is drop drop on

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.770 
here so I'm going to do is drop drop on
the<00:02:09.030> rope<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.420> give<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.629> an<00:02:09.720> idea<00:02:10.129> and<00:02:11.780> what

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
the rope to give you an idea and what

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.850 
the rope to give you an idea and what
you<00:02:12.900> want<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.080> do<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.440> want<00:02:13.590> to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860

you want to do is you want to
and<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.070> center<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.700> rope<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:16.130> then<00:02:17.130> put

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and the center of the rope and then put

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.060 
and the center of the rope and then put
your<00:02:17.760> one<00:02:18.090> foot<00:02:18.330> or<00:02:18.570> two<00:02:18.750> feet<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.380> okay<00:02:19.830> in

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
your one foot or two feet on it okay in

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.830 
your one foot or two feet on it okay in
this<00:02:20.670> case<00:02:20.850> I'm<00:02:21.030> going<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.210> find<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.570> center

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
this case I'm going to find the center

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.290 
this case I'm going to find the center
which<00:02:21.990> is<00:02:22.110> about<00:02:22.230> right<00:02:22.440> here

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
which is about right here

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.720 
which is about right here
now<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.360> Rope<00:02:24.870> should<00:02:25.650> only<00:02:25.920> come<00:02:26.160> down<00:02:26.400> to

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
now the Rope should only come down to

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.700 
now the Rope should only come down to
armpit<00:02:26.970> level<00:02:27.320> somewhere<00:02:28.320> around<00:02:28.410> there

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
armpit level somewhere around there

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.260 
armpit level somewhere around there
that's<00:02:29.220> when<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.520> know<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.940> Rope<00:02:30.090> is

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
that's when you know that the Rope is

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.050 
that's when you know that the Rope is
correct<00:02:30.660> now<00:02:31.590> if<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.040> cut<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.310> or<00:02:32.580> if<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.000> just

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
correct now if you cut it or if you just

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.090 
correct now if you cut it or if you just
have<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.510> where<00:02:33.660> it's<00:02:33.780> just<00:02:33.960> too<00:02:34.170> long<00:02:34.380> like

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
have it where it's just too long like

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.670 
have it where it's just too long like
this<00:02:35.370> or<00:02:36.030> where<00:02:36.270> it's<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.480> too<00:02:36.600> short<00:02:37.140> you're

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
this or where it's just too short you're

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.230 
this or where it's just too short you're
going<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.920> struggle<00:02:38.160> on<00:02:38.400> jumping<00:02:38.790> rope<00:02:38.940> you're

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
going to struggle on jumping rope you're

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.640 
going to struggle on jumping rope you're
going<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.450> find<00:02:39.660> yourself<00:02:40.050> either<00:02:40.200> tripping

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
going to find yourself either tripping

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.690 
over the rope or you're going to have to
whip<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.690> sucker<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.350> lot<00:02:44.220> because<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.580> so

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
whip that sucker a lot because it's so

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.150 
whip that sucker a lot because it's so
loose<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:46.500> you're<00:02:46.830> going<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.040> get
