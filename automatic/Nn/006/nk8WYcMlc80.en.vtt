00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.599
 I'm paulo fonteles 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:20.460
 deputy 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.460
 the state legislature the candidate for federal 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.330

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:29.329
 policies 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.890
 but the hit hard state does not 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.600
 Socrates' torture 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.400
 kicks all over the body 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.710
 the macaw 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.040
 the instrument of the middle age breaking the will of gangster 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.720
 you gave yourself paulo 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.750
 my generation 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.830
 the generation of 68 did not surrender 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.750
 those who survived 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.070
 left the prisons of the dictatorship 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.010
 to resume the struggle for political freedoms and independence 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.300
 national level 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.790
 you changed the comfort of the big city for a militant work in the south of the 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.500
 for 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 how to lawyer bracelets 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.270
 did you know what you were doing then or was it all a huge illusion? 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Of course I knew what I was doing. 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.470
 son of Bethlehem 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.050
 took notice 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.750
 hence abnormal 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.240
 atrocities that they practiced 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.740
 tell the porters from the south of Para 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.700
 and it was a conscious decision 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.740
 in 1988 wide belem and to the south of the faepa conception cross and 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.500
 guaratinga marabá she defends the idea of ​​finishing the work was being the 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.800
 marked by saneago here today you still challenge the great lords of 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.680
 Earth 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.680
 facing only with his words the fire of carbines 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.160
 you do not fear reprisals you and your family and friends are safe 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.100
 Paulo 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.890
 most importantly has said so many times 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.110
 but important that my life 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.820
 It is the life of our 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.530
 she personally dedicated my life to the struggle for the liberation of our people 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.450
 I would not know how to live differently. 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.739
 if not striving for redemption this Brazilian people and this past 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.739
 before being a deputy you and the priest 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:17.259
 were indicted in court for their own washed lavadores 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.169
 what civilians and their friends 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:20.739
 who was in the inter 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.209
 in fact this fact happened in 1989 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.779
 when federal police arrested and tortured three rural workers 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:31.239
 there in the south of par 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.289
 the one who deals with the cattle is better to pay this debacle 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.319
 and we have sent ruth justice 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.479
 and eight months ago I died in that area in lot 8 of itaipava gt evidently 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:44.940
 with little time 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.740
 being balela was entirely different per week the farmers invade the leg 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.559
 left 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:53.239
 It's evident 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.290
 who has even on the way to land occupation 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.640
 it's the need 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.539
 and millions of Brazilians that 10 to 12 million landless workers have 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:03.940
 today in the south of Para 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.920
 There are farms with 200 300 400 thousand hectares. 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.230
 population there more than 100 thousand workers have a floor span 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.510
 to work and this need to do this 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.859
 to occupy the unproductive lands 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.069
 and the profile of rural workers 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.650
 unproductive lands 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.359
 Do you dare to name the oxen? 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.729
 It's evident 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:26.889
 next to 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.870
 in this country to the municipality of santana do araguaia 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.740
 we found there that funds like the one of the farm given the supergasbrás of the volks and 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.909
 will double risk is fashionable malena of trail gomes 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:43.609
 and to arrive the first settlement is in depression we saw hostage 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.600
 80 kilometers by car to close the first settlement on one side and another 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.360
 are just big farms meanwhile about a month ago 49'- farmers 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.850
 for a pleasure because they wanted only twenty acres of land to work 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.049
 pluto violence in the countryside 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.289
 unwarranted prisons and injustices 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:04.919
 all this has not yet ended life 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.319
 it is evident that 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.959
 Brazil has only the monopoly of land, the land is concentrated in the hand of a 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.439
 minority of farmers and large farmers 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:19.769
 347 farm together take the size of france and this farmer who 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.100
 they the landlords 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.270
 do not allow workers to have a floor span 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.409
 to be able to 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.979
 under the headline their own survival for our time 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.069
 unfortunately it comes to an end 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.650
 in a next opportunity you will be once again in the studios of the tv 

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:35.659
 pay 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.659
 again under closed fire 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.199
 You have another 10 seconds to say goodbye. 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.080
 during 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.490
 this campaign 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.550
 we intend 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.789
 is to demonstrate 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.749
 that only the struggle of the people to unite the entire Brazilian people is to achieve them 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.050
 release in this situation of our country 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.010
 we came here on other occasions to present our stones in the 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:01.379
 high heel
