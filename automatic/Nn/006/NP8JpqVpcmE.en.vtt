00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.740 
taillights I change the tail light to
this<00:00:58.469> mostly<00:00:58.859> because<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.190> legal<00:00:59.609> but<00:00:59.750> also

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
this mostly because it's legal but also

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.640 
this mostly because it's legal but also
because<00:01:01.520> looks<00:01:02.520> better<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.290> see<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.470> got<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
light it up really nice at night makes a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.460 
light it up really nice at night makes a
little<00:01:17.250> more<00:01:17.430> visible<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.900> lower<00:01:19.110> bars

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
little more visible the lower bars

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.440 
little more visible the lower bars
they're<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:19.950> upside<00:01:20.280> down<00:01:20.549> dirtbike<00:01:21.180> bars

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
they're just upside down dirtbike bars

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.179 
they're just upside down dirtbike bars
so<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.780> want<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> build<00:01:22.200> some<00:01:22.470> Z<00:01:22.680> bars<00:01:22.920> that

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
so I want to build some Z bars that

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.480 
so I want to build some Z bars that
follow<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.670> same<00:01:24.259> of<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> same<00:01:25.590> contours<00:01:26.130> but

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
follow the same of the same contours but

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.630 
follow the same of the same contours but
are<00:01:26.630> where<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.900> guess<00:01:28.650> suits<00:01:29.100> look<00:01:29.310> at<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> bike

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
are where I guess suits look at the bike

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.679 
are where I guess suits look at the bike
a<00:01:29.670> little<00:01:29.790> more<00:01:32.869> acid<00:01:33.869> that's<00:01:34.200> how<00:01:34.350> she<00:01:34.409> looks

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
a little more acid that's how she looks

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.130 
a little more acid that's how she looks
also<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:37.640> got<00:01:38.640> around<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.360> finally<00:01:39.840> after

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
also I got around to finally after

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.980 
also I got around to finally after
soaking<00:01:40.560> back<00:01:41.220> end<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.640> bike<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.119> engine

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
soaking back end of this bike in engine

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.740 
soaking back end of this bike in engine
oil<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.700> couple<00:01:44.700> dozen<00:01:44.820> times<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.509> getting

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750

sick<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.320> got<00:01:46.979> around<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.490> making<00:01:47.520> a

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
sick of it I got around to making a

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.350 
sick of it I got around to making a
catch<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.579> which<00:01:50.579> I'm<00:01:50.729> pretty<00:01:50.880> happy<00:01:51.119> with

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
catch can which I'm pretty happy with

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.280 
catch can which I'm pretty happy with
its<00:01:51.630> snugs<00:01:52.409> right<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.829> there<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.930> you<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.049> see

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
its snugs right in there and you can see

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.230 
its snugs right in there and you can see
line<00:01:56.250> runs<00:01:57.229> down<00:01:58.229> into<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:59.240> transmission

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
line runs down into the transmission

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.590 
line runs down into the transmission
there<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:01.710> yeah<00:02:02.490> I'm<00:02:02.729> pretty<00:02:02.969> happy<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.360> that

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
there so yeah I'm pretty happy with that

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.780 
there so yeah I'm pretty happy with that
should<00:02:04.409> keep<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.829> back<00:02:05.040> end<00:02:05.310> ever<00:02:05.490> clean

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
should keep the back end ever clean

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.520 
should keep the back end ever clean
because<00:02:06.000> anytime<00:02:06.329> i<00:02:06.509> fight<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.899> headwind<00:02:07.290> it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
because anytime i fight a headwind it

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.589 
because anytime i fight a headwind it
ends<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:07.920> soaking<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> whole<00:02:09.090> bike<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.450> oil
