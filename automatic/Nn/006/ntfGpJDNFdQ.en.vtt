like this it's very clean simple and the
back<00:00:43.350> design<00:00:43.700> which<00:00:44.700> i<00:00:44.850> believe<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.270> metallic

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
back design which i believe is metallic

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.090 
back design which i believe is metallic
red<00:00:46.140> ink<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.620> can't<00:00:47.070> really<00:00:47.219> tell<00:00:48.829> but<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.890> think

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
red ink I can't really tell but I think

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.160 
red ink I can't really tell but I think
it's<00:00:50.190> metallic<00:00:50.510> I'm<00:00:51.510> not<00:00:51.690> entirely<00:00:51.930> sure

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
it's metallic I'm not entirely sure

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.889 
it's metallic I'm not entirely sure
though<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.850> whole<00:00:54.030> deck<00:00:54.270> features<00:00:54.660> custom

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
though the whole deck features custom

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.220 
though the whole deck features custom
faces<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.430> spot<00:00:56.670> cards<00:00:57.120> are<00:00:57.239> custom<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
faces so the spot cards are custom the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.430 
faces so the spot cards are custom the
number<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.770> corner<00:00:59.340> then<00:00:59.520> Dicey's<00:01:00.000> at<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440
