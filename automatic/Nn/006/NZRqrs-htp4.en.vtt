00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.260
 the production of nutritious food is an increasing concern in the 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.619
 Brazil and the world 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.519
 to meet this challenge a series of processes that ensure the security 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:24.000
 have been adopted among them are the best practices 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.240
 agricultural 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.240
 hazard analysis and critical control points 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.909
 and integrated production 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:35.159
 implementation of good agricultural practices takes into 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:37.810
 hygiene in the production environment 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.480
 the quality of water and adults the appropriate use of agrochemicals health and 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.560
 hygiene of workers appropriate sanitary facilities in addition to 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.820
 transport handling among other factors 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.799
 good agricultural practices 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:59.069
 are prerequisites for the hazard analysis and critical points system 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:00.740
 of control 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.030
 in this process 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.619
 serve to identify hazards 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.119
 and estimate the risks that can make a new food your health 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.640
 after agricultural exchanges 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.430
 which are the basis of the pyramid that led to the loss of food 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.900
 are processes 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.720
 produce producers 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.300
 excellent quality insurance 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.210
 within this process an important tool 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.750
 quality management 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.500
 is the analysis of hazards and critical control points 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.500
 that emerged around the 60's 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.200
 american space program 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.730
 the most incredible of the constant with prouni 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.810
 sheyla a ppc 7 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.439
 is used mainly in the post-harvest stages 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.450
 all other vegetables 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.020
 and ensured the safety and food safety 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.730
 good agricultural practice and a system for the analysis of hazards and 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.579
 control critics 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.839
 integrated parts of integrated production 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.180
 in all these methodologies, traceability is part of a 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.190
 dispensable for obtaining of greenery and safe and a requirement of the 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.879
 International 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:18.059
 traceability is an identification system which allows 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:23.309
 origin and history of each agricultural product from production to consumption 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:28.399
 currently the bar code reading system is the most used 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:34.819
 embrapa hortaliças works on the development of traceability through 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.999
 radio frequency for some productive chains of vegetables 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.209
 in this technology 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.749
 the barcode 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:48.149
 is replaced by labels which can be read by an antenna system in 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.299
 portal format 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.730
 so you can get information about the same products 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.679
 that they are not visible 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.509
 she said that if it happened for oscar begins today the phase like accused hacker 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.509
 may Brazil cooperate 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:10.969
 however it has some advantages as long as the bar code is to be 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:15.149
 reading should be done by scanning product by 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:19.529
 The product identification system of the frequency cases can be done by a 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:25.189
 with a truck no danger at the same time and this 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:30.859
 process speed and even the bar code trading system have a 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.159
 limited amount of information 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.329
 in 4º with the radio frequency identification system has a number 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.039
 in christmas the pain 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.039
 traceability 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.379
 from the field to the consumer desk 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.530
 this set of information 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.740
 can be used to evaluate the possible contamination of products derived from 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.919
 tomato by mycotoxins 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.319
 porcine friend is a crowd made by fungi 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:05.559
 it is found in products such as coffee peanuts and Brazil nuts. 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:08.019
 may be carcinogenic 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.499
 Polish troops is also very concerned about the possibility of 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:14.649
 occurrence of mika by finasa in products derived from tomato 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.849
 the tomato industry is high, the most cultivated in a low way and for this 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:32.889
 reason to have 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.310
 of the state of goiás a program called integrated 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.259
 tomato 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.830
 for processing 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.750
 and that actions are planned as the study gave rise to these monkeys by 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.160
 cent
