00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.559
 of three running with dotcom today we're going 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.619
 to analyze a shirt the shirt is 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.570
 the app of the range is the atlas exo vale 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.490
 a t-shirt designed for the days of 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.699
 competition for the days those that 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.949
 we want to give everything goes then what is 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.720
 the ex or the ex west this is seen here 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.380
 before it is as if it were a mesh of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.230
 bee this Solomon says that what he does 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.340
 It is to encourage a bit and compression 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.110
 especially that is not noticed in the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.720
 tired muscles notice that they are in 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.070
 the areas where it is usually worth 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.290
 example the area of ​​the pectorals that do not 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.030
 to bounce this is what 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.810
 does it take us as if it were 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.060
 a bra but without being so it is worth 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.890
 will avoid this because many of us are the 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.200
 that we suffer and we put on sometimes 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.720
 Vaseline on the breasts because they are going away 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.150
 rubbing with more more more shirts 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.620
 relieved this to be a thing that we 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.480
 it is very close to the body and especially 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.750
 with the former west will prevent us from 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.040
 we have to put this, it's worth more here 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.420
 in the shoulder area of ​​another area that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.070
 he also usually suffers and especially if 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.900
 we carry backpacks we also carry here 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.830
 all the rest of the ex or the zone 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.120
 the area of ​​the biceps according 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.970
 and here on the back to another I teach 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.500
 fastened the area of ​​the shoulder blades 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.900
 which is an area when we are running 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.400
 ok we're exercising all the time 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.080
 it's fine we have it reinforced with this 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.210
 calm nexus also took advantage of a dream 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.610
 here behind we also have the logo of 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.460
 Solomon that is reflective just like 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.180
 of course here is worth all this is 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.490
 reflective and the slap range is worth this 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.350
 to be clear that it is almost certain 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.869
 for days of competition is some are 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.450
 some shirts that are expensive, it's worth 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.640
 that are designed to not absorb anything 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.930
 of sweat I will show how it looks but 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.310
 it is a fabric is very breathable and 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.040
 especially that will not absorb that 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.320
 sweat is a shirt that will spend hours 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.760
 running with it we will sweat and it will not be 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.830
 a heavy shirt will not be of those 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.450
 that we notice that we are left 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.550
 attached to the body that gives us cold if it does 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.200
 wind or things from these tsunamis eta that 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.789
 evaporates very well that we can use it 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.709
 as much as first layer carry a 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.440
 jacket over like the sun or with it 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.930
 We also have just zip it 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.340
 a little is a little inclined favors 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.170
 being able to go down helps us 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.660
 perspiration these are moments of 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.640
 noon that is that the heat tightens 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.730
 we can open and have that feeling more 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.250
 of perspiration 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.540
 and then another area that also 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.970
 favors perspiration in this area 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.110
 from here the armpit fix is ​​a tissue 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.110
 of different vale 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.629
 to favor is in all that 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.200
 sweat shirt as you see 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:49.150
 adjusted ok we can not spend anything 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.340
 with the weight we will see everything is worth 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.239
 there is an area that did not see very reinforced 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.640
 what is this here that is where 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.379
 They usually put deposits because the area 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.220
 the deposits lack reinforce it if we 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.500
 We spent a little worth and good one 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.140
 excellent shirt to go to the days of 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.640
 competition to have our 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.650
 feeling that we will not fail 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.840
 that we are going to enjoy and that we are not going 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.760
 to go wet there was not the feeling of going 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.709
 wet this this shirt the feeling 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.260
 is that shortly after I run a little 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.030
 air we go dry according and up to here 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.310
 so one more analysis brings the running 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.579
 puntocom review we are in 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.579
 following 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.730
