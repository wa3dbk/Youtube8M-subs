 and said that you people figure 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:13.589
 really very beautiful this scenario 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.419
 We will not tire of saying what we do not 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.750
 we are transmitting in the best 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:20.550
 sports scene of the country lack of 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.580
 fight free throw that favors the team 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.859
 of coatepeque and the ball says fredy 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.800
 thompson asking for the ball there 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.260
 bernard the game by channel 3 urge the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.570
 match of your team 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.850
 ay mazatenango until scarce people who 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.000
 comes the guard of this one to divert the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.150
 units against the ball the ball went 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.030
 deviated dramatically to the bottom of the 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.830
 stadium the 'creams' were saved 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.600
 change of game is left again to 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.600
 conscience stops the game 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.700
 the problem and with the banking of 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.700
 communications 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.700
 If the referee has to stop the game 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.750
 central aldana washout because 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.730
 good banking team 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.840
 communications moves there to 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.330
 can begin to make a 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.330
 heating directly in the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.980
 banking of the set of communications and 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.460
 more than amateur student that is there the 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.440
 start was cut as he launched a package of 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.330
 we capture the rockets here 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.430
 and as we know that this one is 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.590
 forbidden is because of what you take 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.660
 the average and you must have a moment of 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.880
 game so that the organizers of the 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.320
 event they move and can after 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.450
 stop this situation and have the 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.670
 situation of finally as you wish 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.780
 for the security that you have now for 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.550
 what is the final phase of this tournament 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.380
 that comes in terms of the matches that 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.930
 are going to develop in our country 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.580
 this year Jairo supported in the middle to 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.310
 appearance appeared to talk that the 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.050
 bar waiting for the long hardware 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.050
 perfect for our figueroa 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.890
 with the perfect for each area 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.460
 lifts the texcoco center 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.460
 I 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.110
 Goal scored communications but 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.980
 they are also the height league 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.930
 and one game 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.840
 the heat communications fire 40 and already 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.290
 that come unarmed the touches to a 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.719
 archer how it moves perfectly 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.180
 he wins the position absolutely a 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:47.470
 predictor although you do not even know where you 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.010
 appeared number 40 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.960
 and I face are meters back between 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.840
 make a nod 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.060
 I would never have it because it appears very 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.590
 well the number four leaves it to the bran 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.920
 and let's not say the archer 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.930
 because he bathed it absolutely teacher 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.330
 who plays it well towards the front rolls 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.330
 he could not hold it fell 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.730
 You'll see what color cards 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.730
 none says the light 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.140
 so it seems like a real move 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.200
 controversy will have to see the repetition 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.660
 think of the arms in front says that 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.760
 Best is completed the first time 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.560
 Slipped lalin and gives the impression that 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.570
 from the ground when it is stolen and 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.480
 ball has no other to knock down the 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.940
 rival are now going to gallant as pushes 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.740
 a man of security that these of 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.870
 security at the end what most arrive is 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.390
 to cause to take care of the referees 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.910
 ends with controversy the first time 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.540
 of the party of anais the law slips 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.230
 it is necessary to find that if this takes 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.820
 lateral no longer sees to see no longer 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.340
 the ball arrives although they have been 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.000
 always where it has practically located the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.780
 trip to the number 24 was a lack 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.920
 dangerous and often keep it 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.750
 everyone is there in the discussion a 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.820
 figuration has been in israel neighborhoods 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.819
 a greeting for the moment is dark 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.910
 they located it 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.100
 perfectly with there raised they are very 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.150
 well because they passed him north he is the 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.520
 owner and with justice and without further reason 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.190
 is named after that medium that he 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.349
 he built he was doing the design what 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.759
 he loses doing it fantastic so very 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.349
 good mate 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.650
 it's worth not knowing a lot 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:41.110
 people in the country also by channel 13 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:44.620
 all of you see where it is to continue 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.530
 return match of this key the p4 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.320
 it was communications close was to 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.310
 wilbert of the non-player pie 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.470
 important and that you can give it the 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.720
 ownership and in addition to good walls 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.170
 the ball is diverted the products 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.930
 are and opened the left seemed change 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:08.470
 the play on the bridge is arriola the 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.350
 head butt the ball crashed on the 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.540
 crossbar almost feet to the entire area it 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.960
 more for libya of photo here we see it in 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.000
 the play the ball that comes to look 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.249
 the hand although it is separated from the body 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.119
 by simply moral 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:28.800
 image and l once felt how it's going to 

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:31.530
 try 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.870
 if it was not going to cover and the other is 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.909
 the interpretation of that in your arm 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.970
 right detached from the body which of 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:42.060
 coatepeque goes goes to the front has it 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.250
 you look at him to fight the ball after 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.310
 again the day of the arch that defends 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.490
 walls to try to climb comes already 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.930
 coasts wants with the value with the wall 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.289
 the auction 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.419
 the ball went astray they claimed 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:01.479
 cut the knob on the first play 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.550
 done by the team's cadre 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.669
 coatepeque the ball the hit the shot of 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.669
 corner
