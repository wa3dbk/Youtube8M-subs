take<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.849> rocket<00:00:27.029> scientist<00:00:27.840> fill<00:00:28.289> out<00:00:28.410> a

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
take a rocket scientist fill out a

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.609 
take a rocket scientist fill out a
multiple<00:00:28.920> multiple<00:00:29.580> choice<00:00:29.939> form<00:00:30.380> or<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
multiple multiple choice form or do a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.430 
multiple multiple choice form or do a
survey<00:00:32.070> online<00:00:32.250> based<00:00:32.669> on<00:00:32.850> my<00:00:32.940> opinions<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:34.050> I

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
opinion on the fact is I don't really

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.420 
opinion on the fact is I don't really
know<00:00:45.360> why<00:00:45.570> people<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.379> because<00:00:46.530> I'll

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
need to be a rocket scientist to know

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.609 
need to be a rocket scientist to know
that<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.470> math<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:30.229> doesn't<00:01:31.229> really<00:01:31.350> add<00:01:31.590> up

that that math is doesn't really add up

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.880 
that that math is doesn't really add up
to<00:01:32.070> time<00:01:32.400> efficiency<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.570> opinion<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.140> works

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
to time efficiency in my opinion I works

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.100 
to time efficiency in my opinion I works
out<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.220> about<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:36.060> two<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.990> half

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110

three dollars an hour be my guest but

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.999 
three dollars an hour be my guest but
with<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.509> amount<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.960> traffic<00:01:49.290> that's<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
with the amount of traffic that's on the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.109 
with the amount of traffic that's on the
internet<00:01:50.520> at<00:01:50.820> any<00:01:51.000> given<00:01:51.329> moment<00:01:53.119> it'sit's

internet at any given moment it'sit's
there's<00:01:54.390> much<00:01:54.659> better<00:01:54.869> ways<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.850> I'm

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
there's much better ways to do it so I'm

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.840

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
making money online because I know that

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
there's actually about two billion

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.710 
there's actually about two billion
people<00:02:51.630> online<00:02:52.260> at<00:02:53.010> any<00:02:53.310> given<00:02:53.640> moment<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:54.180> if

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
people online at any given moment and if

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.320 
people online at any given moment and if
you<00:02:54.810> can<00:02:54.959> get<00:02:55.110> your<00:02:55.230> exposure<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.739> them<00:02:56.610> then
