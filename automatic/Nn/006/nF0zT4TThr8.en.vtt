okay<00:00:00.960> we're<00:00:01.199> testing<00:00:01.709> this<00:00:01.860> injector<00:00:02.280> now

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
okay we're testing this injector now

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.200 
okay we're testing this injector now
it's<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:04.279> suspected<00:00:05.279> failed<00:00:05.549> injector<00:00:08.210> an

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
it's a suspected failed injector an

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.669 
it's a suspected failed injector an
engine<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.719> constantly<00:00:10.530> blowing<00:00:11.450> major<00:00:12.679> smoke

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
engine is constantly blowing major smoke

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.480 
engine is constantly blowing major smoke
raw<00:00:14.580> fuel<00:00:15.830> smoke<00:00:18.320> with<00:00:19.320> an<00:00:19.470> engine<00:00:19.800> knock<00:00:20.070> a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
raw fuel smoke with an engine knock a

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.230 
raw fuel smoke with an engine knock a
fuel<00:00:21.390> knocks<00:00:21.660> away

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
fuel knocks away

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.419 
fuel knocks away
fuel<00:00:24.240> possibly<00:00:24.810> dumps<00:00:25.199> into<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> cylinder

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.020 

and<00:00:29.429> cut<00:00:29.699> out<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.000> objectors<00:00:31.759> this<00:00:32.759> one

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
and cut out the objectors this one

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.209 
and cut out the objectors this one
number<00:00:33.329> four<00:00:33.660> making<00:00:33.960> no<00:00:34.410> difference

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
number four making no difference

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:47.540 
number four making no difference
just<00:00:40.309> check<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:44.579> same<00:00:44.850> rpm<00:00:46.309> we're<00:00:47.309> looking

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
just check the same rpm we're looking

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.389 
just check the same rpm we're looking
for<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> drop<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.710> RPMs<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:50.010> would<00:00:50.190> make<00:00:50.370> no

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
for a drop in RPMs this would make no

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.950 
for a drop in RPMs this would make no
difference<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.760> here<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.120> three<00:00:54.539> o-rings

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
difference so here we have three o-rings

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.790 
difference so here we have three o-rings
two<00:00:55.890> sections<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.579> bottom<00:00:57.230> portion<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.440> your

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
two sections the bottom portion is your

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.090 
two sections the bottom portion is your
fuel<00:00:59.219> galley

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
fuel galley

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.259 
fuel galley
it<00:01:01.220> is<00:01:01.370> constantly<00:01:02.060> supplying<00:01:03.550> 50<00:01:04.550> to<00:01:04.610> 60<00:01:05.059> psi

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
it is constantly supplying 50 to 60 psi

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.630 
it is constantly supplying 50 to 60 psi
a<00:01:05.570> fuel<00:01:06.080> pressure<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:09.340> there<00:01:10.340> should<00:01:10.520> be<00:01:10.550> no

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
a fuel pressure and there should be no

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.450 
a fuel pressure and there should be no
fuel<00:01:12.010> injected<00:01:13.010> until<00:01:13.690> we<00:01:14.690> get<00:01:14.869> our

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
fuel injected until we get our

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.520 
fuel injected until we get our
pulse-width<00:01:16.460> signal<00:01:17.050> and<00:01:19.600> it'll<00:01:20.600> fire<00:01:20.900> off

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
pulse-width signal and it'll fire off

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.310 
pulse-width signal and it'll fire off
okay<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.670> stuck<00:01:23.000> injector<00:01:23.540> will<00:01:24.110> just

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
okay the stuck injector will just

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.109 
okay the stuck injector will just
constantly<00:01:24.920> dump<00:01:25.220> dump<00:01:25.520> fuel<00:01:25.759> into<00:01:26.030> the

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
constantly dump dump fuel into the

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.859 
constantly dump dump fuel into the
cylinder<00:01:26.479> causing<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.110> mean<00:01:27.860> you're<00:01:28.070> smoking

engine doctor so we have an apparatus
here<00:01:34.450> which<00:01:35.450> I<00:01:35.830> turned<00:01:37.090> on<00:01:38.090> my<00:01:38.149> lathe<00:01:38.660> just

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
here which I turned on my lathe just

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.580 
here which I turned on my lathe just
it's<00:01:40.009> just<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.399> three-step<00:01:41.170> piece<00:01:42.170> of<00:01:42.350> pipe

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
it's just a three-step piece of pipe

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
it's just a three-step piece of pipe
with<00:01:45.250> able<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.460> steal<00:01:47.420> all<00:01:47.630> your<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:48.500> know<00:01:48.610> fit

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.480 
your o-ring seal all your o-rings and I
got<00:01:52.460> I<00:01:53.470> got<00:01:54.520> taps<00:01:55.520> two<00:01:56.060> taps<00:01:56.560> one<00:01:57.560> for<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.860> ICP

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
got I got taps two taps one for the ICP

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.090 
got I got taps two taps one for the ICP
which<00:01:58.820> we<00:01:58.940> won't<00:01:59.030> be<00:01:59.210> dealing<00:01:59.450> with<00:01:59.600> today<00:02:00.100> the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
which we won't be dealing with today the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.120 
which we won't be dealing with today the
lower<00:02:01.399> one<00:02:01.759> is<00:02:02.200> what<00:02:03.200> we're<00:02:03.350> dealing<00:02:03.500> with<00:02:03.710> now

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
lower one is what we're dealing with now

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.370 
lower one is what we're dealing with now
was<00:02:04.490> what<00:02:04.759> our<00:02:04.789> concern<00:02:05.330> is<00:02:06.189> so<00:02:08.290> we're<00:02:09.290> going

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
was what our concern is so we're going

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.289 
was what our concern is so we're going
to<00:02:09.440> be<00:02:09.530> supplying<00:02:10.540> 50<00:02:11.540> 60<00:02:11.870> psi<00:02:12.260> regulated<00:02:12.830> here

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
to be supplying 50 60 psi regulated here

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.560 
to be supplying 50 60 psi regulated here
to<00:02:14.299> the<00:02:14.420> lower<00:02:14.660> port<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.880> it's<00:02:16.880> pretty<00:02:17.329> simple

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
to the lower port and it's pretty simple

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.980 
to the lower port and it's pretty simple
you<00:02:17.810> just

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
you just

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.880 
you just
slip<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:20.150> there's<00:02:21.150> bolts<00:02:21.720> here<00:02:22.260> for

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
slip it on there's bolts here for

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.070 
slip it on there's bolts here for
checking<00:02:23.850> ICT<00:02:24.710> that's<00:02:25.710> like<00:02:26.000> 3000<00:02:27.000> plus<00:02:27.360> psi

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
checking ICT that's like 3000 plus psi

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.160 
checking ICT that's like 3000 plus psi
so<00:02:28.320> we're<00:02:28.410> not<00:02:28.530> we<00:02:29.280> don't<00:02:29.370> have<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.640> bolt<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.170> 60

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
so we're not we don't have to bolt it 60

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:39.630 
so we're not we don't have to bolt it 60
