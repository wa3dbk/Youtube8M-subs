00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.480
 the poison epidermal level that has the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.300
 lionfish that as soon as we cook it 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.710
 amino acid becomes and denatures is 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.720
 say the poison that has a kind of 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.250
 protein that when the fish enters 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.129
 contact with the heat when the meat already 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.830
 it becomes denatural then we can eat 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.440
 the lion quietly his flesh is very 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.940
 rich has a very delicate flavor I would say 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.269
 I resemble a bit like the one in 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.269
 bass 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.309
 you 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.120
 we essentially make the steaks and 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.070
 apart we make a few sheets of eggplant 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.809
 we take the sheets to wrap the 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.720
 fillets after we brown them again 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.909
 we made a reduction with coconut milk 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.909
 and lemon area a little cumin salt 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.020
 we made a croquette against it 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.030
 wheat that we use to make a kit of 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.250
 then the flavored with all the 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:34.510
 chopped vegetables with coriander 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:36.670
 cumin cumin salt with paprika what 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.040
 we love we remove the skin and apart 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.830
 We sauté the spinach with a little 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.800
 white wine cream cheese 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.920
 Parmesan salt with that pasta that we 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.380
 We filled in the fillings 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.380
 peppers and there was the plate mounted 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.790
 I believe that the costeños and in our 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.710
 beaches long ago sometimes we do not consume 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.350
 not even fresh fish many 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.540
 fish that I know enough places the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.700
 they carry distributors and they are fish 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.260
 frozen some depending also 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.970
 the season of the year that there is fishing 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.710
 then I lived with the people who use it 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.340
 it's a fish we can get fresh 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.680
 it is an exquisite meat is very tender and 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.750
 as I say and we break the myths the fish does not 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.420
 is the shark of horror movies 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.830
 that comes to attack us the fish does not have 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.230
 ability of evil he has basically 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.400
 a structure and a way in which 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.230
 who also use it like many others 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.390
 animals to defend against attacks 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.570
 of the other animals we consummate it with 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.670
 with pleasure and enjoy a good one 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.670
 good a good piece of meat and 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.610
 do not 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.280
 no no
