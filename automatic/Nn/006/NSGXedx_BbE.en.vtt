00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.340
 products and raw materials and food 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.770
 the country of origin of which is

 state decided to introduce

 Russian legal and 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.049
 or individuals or affiliated 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.580
 to such a decision listing with the products 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.080
 food already prepared 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.390
 the government besides the president 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.880
 asked the cabinet to take action 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.409
 to balance 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.330
 commodity markets and non-admission 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.640
 accelerated food price increases 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.380
 another assignment for the cabinet to develop and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.759
 implement measures aimed at 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.250
 increase the supply of domestic 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.840
 goods in Russia powerful agrarian 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.130
 complex to feed 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.689
 country as experts say 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.790
 domestic manufacturers 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.009
 now be able to finally break through 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.860
 large retail chains where they have not 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.909
 allowed the company engaged in import 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.860
 It is obvious that the increase in the share 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.350
 Domestic products will lead to 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.020
 creating new jobs besides 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.060
 product quality will rise as it is known 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.250
 Russian standards are higher than in many 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.290
 other countries in imported products 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.170
 many artificial additives including 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.850
 antibiotics decree uniquely signed 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.700
 plus for both consumers and 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.250
 agricultural producers winter products 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.520
 from many countries she did not fit 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.410
 quality level even our inner 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.540
 products 1 b our agricultural producer 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.580
 commodity producer had practically no 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.700
 let's be frank access to the market with 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.160
 their products due to the fact that the products 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.900
 May delivery from EU countries for example 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.989
 sex on which to add sanctions 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.239
 against us they had more preferences 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.090
 If you quickly replace the imported goods are not 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.950
 succeed analogue can be easily found in 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.760
 countries that did not impose sanctions 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.370
 against Russia will take meat and and and forget 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.720
 from nintendo can get there very 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.110
 developed fruit production you can 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.790
 acquire and connects there 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.590
 overproduction and sometimes don't know where 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.790
 stumbled on putting on these products 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.519
 fruits also we can all sorts 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.920
 exotic southeastern acquire 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.110
 Asia, the decree is one year old but he 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.720
 may change the day before in Voronezh 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.790
 Vladimir Putin warned about a neat 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.590
 response to western political sanctions 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.560
 instruments 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:14.250
 pressure on the economy they are not acceptable 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.630
 they contradict everyone in this regard 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.940
 Russian government has already offered this 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.500
 response to the so-called sanctions 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:29.480
 on the part of some countries I think that all 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.590
 time conditions secure interests 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.630
 domestic producers we 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.459
 might well think about it but 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.650
 Needless to say this should be extremely 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.500
 neatly in order to produce 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.510
 adriatic support but consumers 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.099
 do no harm and so they 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.810
 agricultural products food can 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.150
 be stopped or restricted and 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.459
 united states america canada countries 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.560
 EU Japan other countries 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.959
 declared sanctions against Russia for 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.030
 events in Ukraine last week they 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.859
 imposed restrictions not only for 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.720
 individual citizens or companies 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.790
 but also for the whole Russian industry 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.010
 in Finance Economics Defense 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.769
 high tech industry but how 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.629
 known sanction is a double-edged weapon 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.090
 especially sensitive Russian response 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.519
 will be for European countries in many of 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.260
 them the agricultural sector and so subsidized 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.329
 now for him may be lost 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.419
 huge market in the Ministry of Economic Development 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.700
 Russia has already declared a legal purity 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.500
 restrictions on the importation of agricultural products in 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.110
 response to sanctions according to the deputy 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.330
 Minister Aleksei Likhachev actions 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.219
 Russia matched and will 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.469
 meet basic requirements 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:38.000
