00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.800
 jayo legario hello all how about almost 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.420
 like every Tuesday today I bring you a video 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.970
 of if in race away since it is a game 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.980
 that on Tuesdays allows you to try one of 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.410
 those cars for free and in addition 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.720
 they give you a 50% discount on the 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.180
 price of it to have it so 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.130
 permanent and good first of all in 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.410
 this video I will give two rounds to 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.990
 silverstone circuit with the mclaren 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.160
 mp4 26 which is the car that allow 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.660
 try for free today and good 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.030
 how is the first video commented that 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.729
 I make this game I would like to make a 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.739
 brief analysis of himself first 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:47.110
 graphic as you can see is not what 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.269
 more advanced that we can find for 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.890
 it 's a free to play game 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.900
 true that they are quite well and in addition 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.880
 I was in beta 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.610
 It's a game where you only pay for 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.070
 the cars the circuits and the game in 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.240
 General is free and also that the 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.659
 download it come three cars 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.899
 Free form included in the game 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.469
 and then as for the cars we have 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:17.490
 a fairly wide variety and also 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:19.469
 in terms of prices since this mp4 26 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.390
 for example, it's worth 20 dollars later 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.670
 we also have another formula1 like the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.700
 mclaren mp4 4 which is the most expensive of the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.380
 game that is worth $ 38 or a bugatti 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.030
 veyron that is worth 24 dollars 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.070
 and on the other hand we can also 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.780
 find interesting cars 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.659
 for a very economical price as you can 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.399
 be the ariel atom 500 v8 of which he made a 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.670
 video recently and that is only worth one dollar 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.740
 with 60 or a woody that they have taken to 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.740
 game last week that's worth 18 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.000
 cents or a lancer evolution 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.880
 that is worth 23 cents and the truth that they are 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.950
 pretty cheap prices and that for 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.560
 little money you can buy enough 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.179
 cars and as for the physics that is the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.310
 most important aspect to which you are 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.020
 supposes a simulator the truth that in 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.259
 this game are pretty good I've 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.910
 tried six or seven cars and it has 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.880
 liked quite 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.360
 has a good touch of force feedback and 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:22.640
 the car feels good on the asphalt 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.480
 and well it does not reach the level of and racing 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.379
 m is touching but 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.319
 I liked it and in principle this 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:35.530
 game is the competition of going racing and 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.709
 right now in terms of graphics or in 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.860
 how much of the simulation is at your level 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.720
 but it's on a good path and it's also 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.610
 an optional to consider in this 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.730
 look as racing has prices 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.680
 high and this game at first because 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.480
 it has to be your competence here a 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.819
 time when you are in a more version 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.379
 developed and present a better 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.459
 quality in all its circuits without 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:03.549
 cars and good circuits that have 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.680
 currently the game because they are this 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.470
 silvio this we can find others like 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.049
 the one from sonoma the one from gÃ¶ttingen the one from brno 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.470
 the one of chambord and then there is a series of 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:18.579
 circuits invented but those that are 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.650
 Really, all of them are not going to 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.959
 be scanned by laser like this one 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.060
 here of silvestreone from the one that underlies 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.819
 a comparative and the truth that what 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.810
 nail and in that aspect on the circuits 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.930
 what is going to have 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.500
 is one of its strengths to download 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.540
 because they are free and they were also going to be 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.050
 scanned we can find ourselves before 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.390
 circuits that are faithfully the 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.370
 reflection of reality and that they deserve the 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.390
 sorry so nothing that ends the video 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.390
 Greetings and see you next time 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.950
 or else
