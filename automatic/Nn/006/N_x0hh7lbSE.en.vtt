 there are many forms of violence not 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.370
 only hitting our mates 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.049
 but also carving for example I 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.939
 I'm talking and the partner tells me 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.270
 shut up this is also a way of 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.859
 violence a verbal violence or in 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.510
 all cases also at the time of 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.510
 start a backpack or a pen 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.510
 materials 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.630
 city 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.700
 called 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.930
 Y 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.300
 his service was very bad they said what 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.870
 surprises were the days that was my life 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.660
 no additional but one day in which 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:44.030
 one of her classmates pushed her 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.030
 strongly talking about braids 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.789
 or 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.580
 sad 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:26.739
 but no 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:52.629
 of better quality to the boys who have 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:55.470
 their parents have to be more and they have to 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.470
 his teachers 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.430
 no no no 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.430
 the jurist bayern 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.220
 Oriental 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.490
 today's day has seemed very 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.940
 satisfactory for both me and 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.230
 for all the brigadistas together 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.620
 because because we have transmitted what 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.760
 we really wanted that was to avoid or 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.710
 talking is about what was the 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.780
 bullying is so we do not 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.630
 we only inform the community and 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.800
 we say what is bullying the causes and 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.170
 the consequences but that we 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.020
 we come here as you can see 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.160
 schools do fieldwork 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.140
 but we only analyze the 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.690
 problematic but we act cake 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.430
 excellent I found the support very good 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.500
 disinterested that you all have 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.330
 towards young people the students of the 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.910
 educational institution and I think it's 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.770
 as it is said no brigade of psychologists in 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.420
 action that is lending support to 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.460
 people who need us 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.020
 we invited and we were surprised by the 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.870
 number of specialists who have come 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.310
 today more than 15 specialists and 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.680
 that somehow fills us with a lot 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.090
 joy because there are people who 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.100
 they want the education that they want 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.860
 children and therefore give their effort give their 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.390
 time for this to improve more many 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.639
 Thank you to each of you many 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.699
 thanks to you director thank you very much 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.569
 good this day is very enriching 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.770
 since in our educational institution 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.719
 we have never had the opportunity to 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.439
 this kind of support of this magnitude 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:45.659
 I'm not really happy about the 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:47.189
 students that we handle which 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.770
 they need the support of professionals 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:51.990
 that today have been present 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.729
 in our institution for the good of the 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.610
 students I think there's going to be a good 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.439
 future of this institution really with 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.789
 the director have been surprised 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:05.909
 the level of professionalism that manages 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.620
 the intention of wanting this to support and 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.849
 we are really very grateful 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.849
 for the presence of you 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:18.010
 especially in changing the way 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.010
 of which we are part
