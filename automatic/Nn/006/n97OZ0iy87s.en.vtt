00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Scalesia affinis is an endemic plant that is distributed over the different islands. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Nevertheless, the Scalesia affinis is an endangered species here in Santa Cruz. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Of course, a word that is endangered is threatened, but this is really an alarming problem. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 The last remaining 70 copies are in Santa Cruz and they are 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 limited to the area of ​​El Mirador. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Today we are going to sow an endemic plant from Santa Cruz. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 An endangered species, Scalesia affinis, also known as Lechoso. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 To protect this Scalesia was a few years ago, with the help of 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 the Charles Darwin foundation and the Galapagos national park, 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 the construction of this fence began to the remaining endemic plant population 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 to protect on this island. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 In this way, with the help of Waterboxx technology, we want to 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 improve the restoration of this symbolic species on Santa Cruz 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 and for that we want the plant that we are going to sow within this 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 protected area in the city of Puerto Ayora the symbol of ours 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Waterboxx ecological restoration project. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 I am going to explain to you how sowing with the Waterboxx works. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 First we look for land that is free, without large plants on it. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 When we find the right country, we dig a small hole. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 We try to obstruct capillary action as much as possible so that there is no competition 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 with the roots for water and place the box from the north to the south so that in the heat of the day 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 the sun does not hit the plant. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 The box has been specially designed for this purpose and then we will continue planting. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Everything is covered and perfectly sealed so that no moisture is lost 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 and then the required amount of water is added to retain the moisture. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 The wick delivers the required amount of water to the plant daily. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 This can then be supplemented by placing rocks on the outside. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 After that it is important to clear the area from 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 roots and nearby plants so that they do not compete for humidity. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 The Waterboxx technology is very interesting and not difficult to understand. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 This means that anyone with some training can follow the necessary steps and procedures 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 to sow the plant perfectly. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Anyone can use it, it can be used extensively, it is not complicated 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 and it is not difficult to use in dry areas such as this. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 The Waterboxx project in the Galapagos Islands is a very important challenge. Why? 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Because we want to save water in the Galapagos. 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 The Waterboxx can also be used to restore natural environments. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 One of the plants that is also included in the Waterboxx project 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.600
 is logically the Scalesia Affinis with which we are currently testing in Santa Cruz.
