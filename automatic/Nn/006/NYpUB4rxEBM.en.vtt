00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
really hard to watch in some places just

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.000

due<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.420> nature<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.930> how<00:03:52.230> incredibly

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
due to the nature of how incredibly

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.890
