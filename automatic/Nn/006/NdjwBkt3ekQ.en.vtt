00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:12.080
 good afternoon today we are preparing home 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:16.290
 shortcake cake 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:20.520
 a pack of softened margarine we 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:24.329
 added half a glass of sugar and now 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.390
 margarine mix thoroughly with 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.390
 sugar 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.669
 after margarine carefully 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.690
 mixed with sugar we added two 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:44.550
 eggs and now carefully again this 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:47.929
 we stir now our task to add 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.350
 soda soda quench with vinegar 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:56.820
 about a teaspoon of soda can even 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:03.829
 slightly less and add a little vinegar 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.829
 so that we have all the court on gloss 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:23.260
 and add to the total weight 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:27.600
 we mix everything thoroughly 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:31.270
 tablespoon of salt and also carefully 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.790
 we mix everything now we add 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.440
 gradually 2 cups flour 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:47.470
 pour out 1 cup 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:50.350
 mix everything thoroughly after the first 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.509
 glass with us and that's what happened it 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.220
 Of course the dough is watery it should 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:02:02.009
 nozzle so add 2 stacks 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:04.600
 gradually mix well 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:09.660
 add flour to such an extent that 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.660
 dough still thought enough 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.450
 capable of rolling out we added already with 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.350
 half a cup of flour 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.010
 but apparently the dough is still enough 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.459
 thin this dough will not roll 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.709
 therefore we add hands more than 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:33.239
 planned by prescription before education 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:37.420
 thicker mass 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:40.840
 we added another glass and carefully 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.760
 mixed dough it turned out 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.549
 you have enough empty 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:51.329
 it can be rolled out in a thin layer and 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:55.750
 bake at 200 degrees 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:03:00.280
 200 230 degrees for 5 minutes in 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:05.019
 preheated oven shortcakes further cashier 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.350
 we will lubricate sour cream connected 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.350
 milk 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.610
 roll out cakes about 2 millimeters 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.319
 thick 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.480
 first we have a little better 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:25.670
 then it is more convenient to sprinkle flour 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:28.370
 roll out forms and cut a circle or 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.240
 square at your discretion to make the cake 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.360
 got the right shape 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:38.660
 cream is prepared which one you like in 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.760
 principle but since i am for natural 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.540
 I decided to use sour cream and 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.600
 decided to use 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.680
 boiled condensed milk all this carefully 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:56.660

 That's the way I got 4 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:10.570
 large korzhe in order to how 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.280
 better soaked we pierce 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.530
 toothpick 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:20.000
 each layer of cake after we 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:23.450
 smeared it with cream left me 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.720
 a small piece of dough that is no longer 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:31.850
 would be enough for his skin anyway decided 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.930
 bake and spread her hands up to such 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.710
 about degree 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:41.390
 and now here I will cover this mug 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:44.320
 top of our cake and now we will admire 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.580

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:57.820
 remind you that the products are gone 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.820

 I added a little more boiled condensed milk 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.460
