00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.809
 and then the crowd pachuca videos on video 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.430
 I'm going to bring some tips today. 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.650
 for you are buying your way 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.630
 It's only for fishing. 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.430
 so today I brought two models there in the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.790
 if the model on the top of the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.860
 video is a path that is a single part 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.140
 do not dismount that is more appropriate 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.529
 for you are fishing in rivers lakes or 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.810
 dams okay and with artificial bait 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.790
 already in the lower reed a path that already 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.620
 divided into two parts would be greater than 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.420
 approximately three meters 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.949
 it is more appropriate that you are 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.690
 needing to dial in 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.859
 longer pitches with 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.840
 bottom 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:47.879
 the character in this fund whatever 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.519
 bigger but I want you for yourself 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.140
 flashing then ticks in today's video 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.320
 Here I'll be bringing you a vote. 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.960
 pointing out the aspects of each of the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.449
 two reeds for you at the time of purchase 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.449
 know right, ok let's get started 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.010
 Good guys here we are with the reed that 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.650
 is in a single match a small model 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.800
 appropriate for you are fishing with 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.670
 artificial bait like milk a 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.800
 bottom line fish in the pond a river ta 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.540
 you're buying meat juice but it does not fall 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.790
 this little because I want to return to the scene 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.090
 artificial politics always try 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.220
 to look for it in the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.440
 case of computers is thus here 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.210
 The more passersby I do not say many 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.090
 hunters plus a legal average of 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.760
 hunter always good to be providing 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.880
 A better shot is if you 're a 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.310
 protagonist of this small model he 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.310
 you have only 34 pins is not very 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.420
 appropriate you will not get a pitch 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.980
 I can really say a very good pitch. 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.210
 very lucrative you will have a 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.970
 I'm starting the worst zin, so this first one 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.720
 It's also a tip when you go shopping. 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.920
 your small start car is in your case 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.110
 staff with artificial bait that 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.440
 model is always showing 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.020
 look look at the tip of his rod and 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.040
 resistance is the house that has a 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.549
 good resistance 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.829
 There you will be able to fish the bigger fish. 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.209
 has a good resistance you can be 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.819
 going to buy a car in this model and 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.549
 take a small car that with the tip 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:35.049
 well molly wei may be at risk of breaking 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:37.359
 as the size of the fish is right and 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:44.819
 It is always good to look for the fiber 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:50.739
 reed argument it is said here if O 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:58.180
 and it says here and there design bragin do 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:03:01.389
 Reed there is 17 pounds 7.5 pounds more 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.870
 or less take it but just to think 7,5 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:07.919
 pounds a fish fighting in the water 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.919
 it's too much, right? 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:16.000
 so here is a small model will then 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.629
 taking a break here showing reed 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.280
 appropriate for beach fishing is 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.229
 so here guys with the other model 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.870
 meat to be divided into two parts 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:28.359
 and this carrion model is longer appropriate 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.120
 said only fishing with a reel 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.760
 or windlass on a bottom line. 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.019
 staying at sea 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.659
 they are the shipping of the longest as 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.250
 it is bigger and it is not appropriate you are 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.069
 thinking with scales artificial baits 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.810
 Okay, you're not going to perform well. 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.120
 With him it's going to be difficult. 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.379
 It is not cool is practicing 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.560
 very long affection 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.199
 then this hebe cancer has 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.010
 approximately three meters already 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:58.750
 provides better fishing at sea 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.949
 There is not much to indicate you are 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.879
 fishing in the river 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:06.909
 So how much was in the store and if it is to 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:10.629
 stay at sea so I recommend staying in this 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:13.180
 Here is a larger model that you are 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:18.009
 doing the beach fishing at the time of 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:20.919
 approximately 36 360 cup will already 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:23.770
 give a good time you're praying for 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.880
 Are you doing good pitches at 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:30.960
 beach is fine if you want to stay at more in 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.960
 river on goal company 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.099
 having as the one who had shown 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.069
 there provides pitch shorter but 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:44.319
 with more excitement in the reed is 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:45.159
 stay no more left over reed 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:48.219
 the river is not 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:50.580
 if you can understand then 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:55.110
 to stay at it you can see that 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:59.139
 and has less hunter than the reed 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.089
 It's artificial how to train both I 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.319
 not assembled whole is unable to get 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:04.900
 in bed but it is divided into two 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:17.860
 only then you can see that it has a 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:23.520
 123456 and the distance from the 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:26.289
 dowels most right because that 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.339
 relatively larger is the same thing 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.520
 When you go, you will not get into it. 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:32.710
 always seeks to know if the cold tip 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.860
 is carbon fiber cable that is 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.899
 It is always important to know that it is not 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.319
 problem has good resistance and 

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:44.949
 a good price to buy a carbon disc 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:47.409
 it is providing a resistance 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.800
 bigger hit 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:53.589
 so I guess I had to talk 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.349
 This is always important, you are. 

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:58.029
 knowing then this is it guys until 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.999
 next video if they can sign up for 

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:03.399
 our channel I liked in the video if 

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:05.289
 liked and this may be the favorite 

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:08.370
 It's helping a lot, that 's right. 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.370
 so until the next
