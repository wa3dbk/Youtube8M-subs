you<00:04:56.020> really<00:04:56.319> can't<00:04:56.560> fail<00:04:56.830> on<00:04:57.039> this<00:04:57.189> stuff<00:04:57.719> if

you really can't fail on this stuff if
you<00:04:58.779> notice<00:04:59.110> here<00:04:59.289> the<00:04:59.319> fish's<00:04:59.710> mouth

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
you notice here the fish's mouth

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.619 
you notice here the fish's mouth
they're<00:05:00.610> quite<00:05:00.849> unique<00:05:01.210> they've<00:05:01.419> got<00:05:01.539> these

real big four protruding lips and I

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.950 
real big four protruding lips and I
think<00:05:03.639> they've<00:05:03.759> evolved<00:05:04.270> like<00:05:04.419> this<00:05:04.599> over<00:05:04.870> the

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
think they've evolved like this over the

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.689 
think they've evolved like this over the
sort<00:05:05.139> of<00:05:05.199> 10<00:05:05.409> 15<00:05:05.620> 20<00:05:06.099> years<00:05:06.279> they've<00:05:06.460> been<00:05:06.580> in
