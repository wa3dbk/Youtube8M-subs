00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
and dirt off of the brake pads okay now

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.380 
and dirt off of the brake pads okay now
for<00:01:33.009> a<00:01:33.160> quick<00:01:33.310> test<00:01:33.460> ride<00:01:33.729> we<00:01:33.910> test<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.300> brakes

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
for a quick test ride we test the brakes

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.980 
for a quick test ride we test the brakes
and<00:01:34.690> see<00:01:34.810> if<00:01:34.990> we<00:01:35.080> fix<00:01:35.289> a<00:01:35.350> problem<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:39.990> know

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
and see if we fix a problem and know

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.460 
and see if we fix a problem and know
they're<00:01:41.289> still<00:01:41.530> squealing<00:01:41.830> on<00:01:42.160> the<00:01:42.430> next<00:01:42.670> step

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
they're still squealing on the next step

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.050 
they're still squealing on the next step
with<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.619> wheel<00:01:44.770> removed<00:01:45.220> I<00:01:45.550> have<00:01:45.759> some

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
with the wheel removed I have some

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.389 
with the wheel removed I have some
pretty<00:01:46.509> rough<00:01:46.720> sandpaper<00:01:47.050> here<00:01:47.560> I<00:01:47.590> think<00:01:47.860> 660

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
pretty rough sandpaper here I think 660

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.210 
pretty rough sandpaper here I think 660
grit<00:01:48.610> I'm<00:01:49.179> gonna<00:01:49.300> go<00:01:49.420> ahead<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.840> just<00:01:50.590> rough

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
grit I'm gonna go ahead and just rough

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.990 
grit I'm gonna go ahead and just rough
up<00:01:51.539> the<00:01:52.539> surface<00:01:52.570> of<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.350> brake<00:01:53.530> pads<00:01:54.000> where

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
up the surface of the brake pads where

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.650 
up the surface of the brake pads where
they<00:01:55.179> contact<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.710> rim<00:01:57.300> because<00:01:58.300> sometimes

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
they contact the rim because sometimes

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.449 
they contact the rim because sometimes
they'll<00:01:58.840> get<00:01:58.959> like<00:01:59.259> glazed<00:01:59.709> on<00:02:00.039> they're<00:02:00.280> just

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
they'll get like glazed on they're just

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.490 
they'll get like glazed on they're just
too<00:02:00.640> smooth<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:01.929> we<00:02:02.020> want<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.259> make<00:02:02.410> them

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
too smooth and so we want to make them

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.889 
too smooth and so we want to make them
rough<00:02:02.740> again<00:02:03.039> so<00:02:03.789> we<00:02:03.910> go<00:02:04.030> ahead<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.300> rough<00:02:04.750> up

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
rough again so we go ahead and rough up

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.550 
rough again so we go ahead and rough up
the<00:02:05.020> entire<00:02:05.289> surface<00:02:05.649> of<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:05.979> brake<00:02:06.220> pad

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the entire surface of the brake pad

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.440 
the entire surface of the brake pad
there<00:02:08.560> shouldn't<00:02:08.800> be<00:02:08.860> any<00:02:09.009> shiny<00:02:09.849> parts<00:02:10.179> left

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
there shouldn't be any shiny parts left

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.570 
there shouldn't be any shiny parts left
on<00:02:10.660> there

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.500 

okay<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.819> then<00:02:19.209> we'll<00:02:19.360> try<00:02:19.629> it<00:02:19.660> again

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
okay and then we'll try it again

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.110 
okay and then we'll try it again
okay<00:02:22.319> another<00:02:22.709> test<00:02:23.069> ride<00:02:23.280> will<00:02:23.610> test<00:02:23.909> break

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
okay another test ride will test break

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.740 
okay another test ride will test break
see<00:02:24.330> how<00:02:24.420> they<00:02:24.540> work<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:29.599> still<00:02:30.599> no

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
see how they work and still no

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.309 
see how they work and still no
improvement<00:02:30.870> on<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.980> next<00:02:32.310> step<00:02:33.170> okay<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
improvement on the next step okay the

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.710 
improvement on the next step okay the
next<00:02:34.530> step<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.190> adjust<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.610> brake<00:02:35.819> pads<00:02:36.150> so

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
next step is to adjust the brake pads so

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.770 
next step is to adjust the brake pads so
there's<00:02:36.989> slightly<00:02:37.319> toe<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.180> front

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
there's slightly toe in so the front

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.869 
there's slightly toe in so the front
this<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.620> front<00:02:40.709> towards<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.640> front<00:02:41.819> of

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
this is the front towards the front of

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.809 
this is the front towards the front of
the<00:02:41.940> bike<00:02:42.090> here<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:44.069> wheel<00:02:44.220> turns<00:02:44.549> this

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
the bike here the the wheel turns this

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.360 
the bike here the the wheel turns this
way<00:02:45.410> what<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:46.500> want<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.709> do<00:02:46.799> is<00:02:46.950> we<00:02:47.099> want<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.280> go

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
way what we want to do is we want to go

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.430 
way what we want to do is we want to go
ahead<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.549> adjust<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:48.629> brake<00:02:48.840> pads<00:02:49.110> at<00:02:49.349> the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
ahead and adjust the brake pads at the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.220 
ahead and adjust the brake pads at the
front<00:02:49.709> edge<00:02:49.980> is<00:02:50.690> slightly<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.870> what<00:02:52.140> we're

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
front edge is slightly in what we're

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.949 
front edge is slightly in what we're
going<00:02:52.349> to<00:02:52.379> do<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:52.590> we're<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.799> take<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.010> penny<00:02:53.370> and

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
going to do is we're to take a penny and

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.030 
going to do is we're to take a penny and
we're<00:02:54.959> going<00:02:55.079> to<00:02:55.140> stick<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.440> between<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
we're going to stick it between the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.900 
we're going to stick it between the
brake<00:02:56.250> pad<00:02:56.579> and<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:58.170> rim<00:02:58.890> on<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.370> backside

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
brake pad and the rim on the backside

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.390 
brake pad and the rim on the backside
here<00:03:00.470> we're<00:03:01.470> going<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.650> go<00:03:01.739> ahead<00:03:01.829> and<00:03:02.160> loosen

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
here we're going to go ahead and loosen

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:11.619 
here we're going to go ahead and loosen
the<00:03:02.670> brake<00:03:03.410> pad<00:03:06.950> just<00:03:07.950> loosen<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.370> little<00:03:08.400> bit
