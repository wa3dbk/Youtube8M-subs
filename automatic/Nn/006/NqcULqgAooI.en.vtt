00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 You said you want more decoration 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.599
 Now you get more decoration 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.490
 caught up with the last interior design 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.790
 decorations hall cupcake wonderland 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.170
 I earn you a video here again 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.330
 did you say oh yes we would like to 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.980
 more of such decorations videos and 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.760
 then I have it right on the occasion 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.900
 taken around you my new decoration 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.580
 or storage of mine 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.730
 to present brand paints me has 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.730
 very disturbed in this regal because of this 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.300
 shelf full time but i want to 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.270
 now the new and what else where 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.260
 maybe not so much dusty 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.270
 and that's why I thought about it 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.920
 is my new nail polish storage 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.239
 Conti people think like it 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.680
 works but still does it 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.770
 again with the mouse like 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.280
 namely we do not have all the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.469
 nail polish or at least heartwarming 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.690
 krams that makes us happy and the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.100
 actually just lying around or in 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.080
 dusty on any corners 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.470
 but it can still be packed nicely 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.030
 look more beautiful in our apartment 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.189
 I have my nail polish in the new 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.770
 I decorate for that 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.030
 first of all a nail polish on the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.950
 board spread 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.040
 look for an area where you can do a lot 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.040
 space to move and sort 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.150
 then I started the first 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.030
 to sort out unloved nail polish and 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:36.930
 then to sort by colors yellow pink 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.930
 purple green blue and glitter nail polishes 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.800
 when you have finished sorting , snap 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.300
 yourselves a container 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.580
 I chose a transparent one 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.460
 candy jar with lid decided 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.470
 You can also take jars or 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.150
 But a beautiful base never does 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.140
 It was important to have discovered it 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.240
 it is not a jam 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.210
 then I started mine 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.009
 nail polishes in misfortune to sort that 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.830
 means I have all pink 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.440
 nail polishes snapped the pink peek and 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.380
 have the next situation with pink 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.959
 lay long designed and then again 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.120
 to put color nail polish on top and so on 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.459
 a nice effect I clear to them 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.840
 that looks good, too 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:26.280
 So then the lid on it and ebola 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.840
 finished is your nail polish storage 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.150
 This is also very much 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.860
 decorative in the apartment and you can 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.260
 of course the color scheme in the 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.120
 glass individually according to yours 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.120
 arrange as desired 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.710
 The main thing is that you the sight 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.110

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.550

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.320
