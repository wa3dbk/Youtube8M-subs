Ohio town businesses it's the most
simple<00:02:21.610> thing<00:02:21.849> for<00:02:22.239> me<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.650> can<00:02:23.829> keep<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.549> in

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
simple thing for me and I can keep it in

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.930 
simple thing for me and I can keep it in
for<00:02:24.849> a<00:02:24.880> long<00:02:25.060> time<00:02:25.440> like<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.470> can<00:02:26.799> go<00:02:27.130> about<00:02:27.640> two

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
for a long time like I can go about two

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.059 
for a long time like I can go about two
months<00:02:28.299> with<00:02:28.750> twist<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.410> because<00:02:29.829> I<00:02:29.890> just

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
months with twist and because I just

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.860 
months with twist and because I just
wash<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.670> know<00:02:30.790> as<00:02:30.910> as<00:02:31.180> needed<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.690> so

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
wash it you know as as needed and so

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.680 
wash it you know as as needed and so
yeah<00:02:35.079> I<00:02:35.109> think<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.650> think<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:36.040> did<00:02:36.250> okay<00:02:36.540> for<00:02:37.540> my

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
yeah I think I think I did okay for my

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.559 
yeah I think I think I did okay for my
first<00:02:38.019> time<00:02:38.459> it's<00:02:39.459> kind<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.329> know<00:02:40.390> it's

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
first time it's kind of you know it's

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.390 
first time it's kind of you know it's
only<00:02:40.690> been<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:40.930> for<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.200> few<00:02:41.319> weeks<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:42.160> it's

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
only been in for a few weeks and it's

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.789 
only been in for a few weeks and it's
kind<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.819> messy<00:02:43.390> at<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.630> top<00:02:43.900> because<00:02:44.380> when<00:02:44.859> I

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
kind of messy at the top because when I

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.150 
kind of messy at the top because when I
did<00:02:47.799> my<00:02:48.280> twist<00:02:48.639> I<00:02:49.000> had<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.930> lot<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.440> new<00:02:50.950> growth

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
did my twist I had a lot of new growth

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.009 
did my twist I had a lot of new growth
already<00:02:51.730> on<00:02:51.940> my<00:02:52.060> locs<00:02:52.299> and<00:02:52.569> I<00:02:52.780> didn't

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
already on my locs and I didn't

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.509 
already on my locs and I didn't
interlock<00:02:53.380> before<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:53.769> did<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.130> because<00:02:54.310> I

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
interlock before I did this because I

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.830 
interlock before I did this because I
knew<00:02:54.639> it's<00:02:54.790> gonna<00:02:54.910> be<00:02:55.090> pulling<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.600> little<00:02:55.720> bit

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
knew it's gonna be pulling a little bit

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.620 
knew it's gonna be pulling a little bit
and<00:02:56.049> I<00:02:56.109> didn't<00:02:56.290> want<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.560> do<00:02:57.280> too<00:02:57.310> much<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:58.600> I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
and I didn't want to do too much so I

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.759 
and I didn't want to do too much so I
just<00:02:58.870> left<00:02:59.049> my<00:02:59.139> new<00:02:59.319> growth<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.650> that's

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
just left my new growth and that's

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.849 
just left my new growth and that's
actually<00:02:59.950> what<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.220> want<00:03:00.459> wanted<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.239> was<00:03:01.420> to

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
won't be too tight at the root because I

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.230
