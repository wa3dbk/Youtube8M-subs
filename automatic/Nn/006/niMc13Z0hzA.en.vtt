you're going to try to get one of the
care<00:00:20.100> packages<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.550> bounce<00:00:20.850> off<00:00:21.029> something

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
care packages to bounce off something

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.689 
care packages to bounce off something
and<00:00:21.689> land<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.260> now<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.130> kind<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.460> hard

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
and land on you now this is kind of hard

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.279 
and land on you now this is kind of hard
and<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.119> will<00:00:24.240> take<00:00:24.420> quite<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.779> while<00:00:24.840> yet

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
and it will take quite a while yet

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.320 
and it will take quite a while yet
because<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.310> most<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.820> time<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.150> care

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
because it most of the time the care

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.910 
because it most of the time the care
packages<00:00:27.720> will<00:00:27.930> kill<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.349> if<00:00:28.410> they<00:00:28.470> line<00:00:28.740> on

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
packages will kill you if they line on

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.320 
packages will kill you if they line on
you<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.699> have<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> make<00:00:30.000> sure<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.300> it

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
you so you have to make sure that it

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.179 
you so you have to make sure that it
bounces<00:00:30.570> off<00:00:30.990> something<00:00:31.019> off<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.710> ground<00:00:31.949> or

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
bounces off something off the ground or

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.459 
bounces off something off the ground or
something<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:33.780> gets<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.110> stuck

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
something like that and gets you stuck

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.620 
something like that and gets you stuck
inside<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.130> care<00:00:35.340> package<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.149> will<00:00:36.360> breach
