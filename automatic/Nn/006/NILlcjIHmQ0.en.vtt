cheaper than as an Chi from what I can

cheaper than as an Chi from what I can
tell<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.969> differences<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.719> pieces<00:00:58.050> are

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
tell the differences in the pieces are

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.869 
tell the differences in the pieces are
really<00:00:58.440> really<00:00:58.620> minor<00:00:58.920> one<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> only

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
really really minor one of the only

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.819 
really really minor one of the only
things<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> could<00:01:00.660> really<00:01:00.960> clearly<00:01:01.500> see

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
things that I could really clearly see

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.049 
things that I could really clearly see
that<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:02.070> different<00:01:02.250> was<00:01:02.399> actually<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> size

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
that was different was actually the size

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.060 
that was different was actually the size
of<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.239> torpedoes<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.260> pink<00:01:04.470> one<00:01:04.619> seems<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
of the torpedoes the pink one seems to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.190 
of the torpedoes the pink one seems to
have<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.489> longer<00:01:05.760> thinner<00:01:06.090> anchor<00:01:06.600> whereas<00:01:06.930> an

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
have a longer thinner anchor whereas an

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.170 
have a longer thinner anchor whereas an
she<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> little<00:01:07.890> bit<00:01:08.040> shorter<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.640> little<00:01:08.880> bit

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
she is a little bit shorter a little bit

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.390 
she is a little bit shorter a little bit
fatter<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.110> other<00:01:10.229> pieces<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.830> noticed

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
fatter on the other pieces I noticed

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.570 
fatter on the other pieces I noticed
some<00:01:11.790> flash<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.479> think<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.799> think<00:01:14.400> on

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
some flash on the think on I think on

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.219 
some flash on the think on I think on
the<00:01:14.640> zhanchi<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> same<00:01:15.840> place<00:01:16.110> but

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the zhanchi it's in the same place but

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.560 
the zhanchi it's in the same place but
it's<00:01:16.650> not<00:01:16.799> as<00:01:16.920> pronounced<00:01:17.430> either<00:01:18.090> way<00:01:18.390> though

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
it's not as pronounced either way though

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.390 
it's not as pronounced either way though
the<00:01:18.689> flash<00:01:18.900> does<00:01:19.229> not<00:01:19.560> make<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> difference<00:01:19.920> in

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the flash does not make a difference in

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.620 
the flash does not make a difference in
the<00:01:20.490> performance<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> cube<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:21.570> you

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the performance of the cube and when you

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.929 
the performance of the cube and when you
turn<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.020> cannot<00:01:22.439> feel<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.280> flash<00:01:23.549> being

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
turn it you cannot feel the flash being

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.350 
turn it you cannot feel the flash being
there<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.509> bank<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.229> had<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.950> couple<00:01:26.340> flaws<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
there the bank on had a couple flaws the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
there the bank on had a couple flaws the
first<00:01:27.600> one<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.810> pretty<00:01:28.020> minor<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.159> center

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
first one is pretty minor on the center

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.760 
first one is pretty minor on the center
caps<00:01:29.549> do<00:01:29.820> fall<00:01:30.119> off<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.600> my<00:01:31.079> experience<00:01:31.320> they

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
caps do fall off in my experience they

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.469 
caps do fall off in my experience they
only<00:01:31.950> fell<00:01:32.189> off<00:01:32.340> during<00:01:32.369> an<00:01:32.759> extreme<00:01:33.180> corner

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
only fell off during an extreme corner

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.080 
only fell off during an extreme corner
cut<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:34.290> didn't<00:01:34.680> actually<00:01:34.890> fall<00:01:35.369> off<00:01:35.579> during<00:01:35.820> a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
cut it didn't actually fall off during a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.990 
cut it didn't actually fall off during a

regular solve the main problem with the

regular solve the main problem with the
fame<00:01:39.150> come<00:01:39.360> out<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> box<00:01:39.869> was<00:01:40.049> actually

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
fame come out of the box was actually

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.649 
fame come out of the box was actually
the<00:01:40.590> hardware<00:01:41.009> namely<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> springs<00:01:42.030> they

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the hardware namely the springs they

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.020 
the hardware namely the springs they
were<00:01:42.720> really<00:01:43.049> really<00:01:43.320> stiff<00:01:43.770> at<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.729> time<00:01:44.909> of

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
were really really stiff at the time of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.060 
were really really stiff at the time of
this<00:01:45.149> review<00:01:45.360> i<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.960> put<00:01:46.170> them<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.860> goo

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
this review i have put them in a goo

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.219 
this review i have put them in a goo
hyung<00:01:47.280> version<00:01:47.670> 2<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.090> actually<00:01:48.750> works<00:01:48.869> quite

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
hyung version 2 and actually works quite

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.679 
hyung version 2 and actually works quite
well<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.759> fan<00:01:50.970> con<00:01:51.210> they<00:01:51.360> were<00:01:51.450> just

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
well but in the fan con they were just

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.260 
well but in the fan con they were just
too<00:01:51.810> stiff<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.320> i<00:01:52.829> basically<00:01:53.250> ran<00:01:53.700> into<00:01:54.060> two

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
too stiff and i basically ran into two

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.170 
too stiff and i basically ran into two
problems<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.560> first<00:01:55.829> was<00:01:56.100> loose<00:01:56.520> tensions<00:01:57.030> if

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
problems the first was loose tensions if

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.209 
problems the first was loose tensions if
I<00:01:57.810> loosen<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.259> tensions<00:01:58.619> which<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
I loosen the tensions which is what the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.219 
I loosen the tensions which is what the
keep<00:01:59.399> came<00:01:59.670> with<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.630> cube<00:02:00.840> actually<00:02:01.079> turned

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
keep came with the cube actually turned

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.840 
keep came with the cube actually turned
pretty<00:02:01.380> well<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.070> movement<00:02:02.490> was<00:02:02.549> pretty

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
pretty well the movement was pretty

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.969 
pretty well the movement was pretty
fluid<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.360> what<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.540> experienced<00:02:04.259> was<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.799> it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
fluid but what I experienced was that it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.069 
fluid but what I experienced was that it
couldn't<00:02:05.219> really<00:02:05.399> corner<00:02:05.700> cut<00:02:05.909> too<00:02:06.420> well<00:02:06.659> just

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
couldn't really corner cut too well just

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.350 
couldn't really corner cut too well just
because<00:02:07.200> they<00:02:07.500> caught<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.910> caching<00:02:09.239> issue

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
because they caught the caching issue

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.880 
because they caught the caching issue
made<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.750> kind<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.110> annoying<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:10.860> I

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
made it kind of annoying and so I

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.140 
made it kind of annoying and so I
decided<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.489> actually

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
decided to actually

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.210 
decided to actually
the<00:02:12.269> cute<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:13.170> problem<00:02:13.560> with<00:02:13.680> tightening<00:02:14.099> the

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
the cute the problem with tightening the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.890 
the cute the problem with tightening the
cube<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.579> although<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.939> get<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.360> 45<00:02:15.780> degree

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
cube is although you get the 45 degree

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.009 
cube is although you get the 45 degree
corner<00:02:16.290> cut<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:18.000> takes<00:02:18.299> a<00:02:18.390> lot<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.540> effort<00:02:18.870> just

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
corner cut it takes a lot of effort just

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.479 
corner cut it takes a lot of effort just
because<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.379> springs<00:02:19.620> are<00:02:19.739> too<00:02:19.890> stiff<00:02:20.159> so

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
because the springs are too stiff so

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.179 
because the springs are too stiff so
there<00:02:21.000> wasn't<00:02:21.180> really<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.629> happy<00:02:22.079> medium<00:02:22.260> for

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
there wasn't really a happy medium for

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.069 
there wasn't really a happy medium for
tensioning<00:02:23.519> this<00:02:23.730> queue<00:02:23.939> and<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.689> kind<00:02:24.959> of

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
tensioning this queue and that kind of

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.050 
tensioning this queue and that kind of
made<00:02:25.290> me<00:02:25.439> upset<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.459> what<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.640> ended<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:27.000> doing

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
made me upset so what I ended up doing

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.000 
made me upset so what I ended up doing
was<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.689> actually<00:02:27.780> replace<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.500> hardware<00:02:28.829> with

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
was I actually replace the hardware with

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.949 
was I actually replace the hardware with
Diane<00:02:29.430> hardware<00:02:29.849> which<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.599> little<00:02:30.840> bit

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
Diane hardware which is a little bit

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.500 
Diane hardware which is a little bit
insulting<00:02:31.379> to<00:02:31.500> Diane<00:02:31.859> but<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.819> wanted<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.299> see

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
insulting to Diane but I wanted to see

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.449 
insulting to Diane but I wanted to see
how<00:02:33.540> good<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.930> cute<00:02:34.140> could<00:02:34.319> be<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.709> I'm

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
how good the cute could be and I'm

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.220 
how good the cute could be and I'm
really<00:02:35.609> happy<00:02:35.909> I<00:02:36.299> actually<00:02:36.480> made<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.930> swamp

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
really happy I actually made the swamp

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.319 
really happy I actually made the swamp
so<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.920> actually<00:02:38.129> swapped<00:02:38.489> out<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.909> core

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
so I actually swapped out the core

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.890 
so I actually swapped out the core
springs<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.170> screws<00:02:41.129> and<00:02:41.459> remove<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.629> cube

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
springs and screws and remove the cube

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.899 
springs and screws and remove the cube
and<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.739> have<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.040> say<00:02:44.069> that<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.459> thing<00:02:44.639> done

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
and I have to say that the thing done

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.970 
and I have to say that the thing done
with<00:02:45.239> this<00:02:45.659> set<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.139> hardware<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.680> actually

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
with this set of hardware is actually

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.069 
with this set of hardware is actually
better<00:02:47.159> than<00:02:47.280> is<00:02:47.639> Angie<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.209> course<00:02:48.690> if<00:02:48.870> you

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
better than is Angie of course if you

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.720 
better than is Angie of course if you
buy<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.409> Diane<00:02:49.829> hardware<00:02:50.220> along<00:02:50.519> with<00:02:50.549> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
buy the Diane hardware along with the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.089 
buy the Diane hardware along with the
think<00:02:50.909> on<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.120> kind<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.569> voids<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.799> whole

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
think on that kind of voids the whole

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.369 
think on that kind of voids the whole
perk<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.609> being<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.849> cheaper<00:02:54.150> cube<00:02:54.420> but<00:02:54.930> some

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
perk of it being a cheaper cube but some

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.660 
perk of it being a cheaper cube but some
of<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.560> probably<00:02:55.709> have<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.069> Diane<00:02:56.370> cube<00:02:56.549> that

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
of you probably have a Diane cube that

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.000 
of you probably have a Diane cube that
you<00:02:56.790> don't<00:02:57.000> use<00:02:57.299> because<00:02:57.870> it's<00:02:58.349> worn<00:02:58.650> out<00:02:58.799> or

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
you don't use because it's worn out or

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.649 
you don't use because it's worn out or
maybe<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.370> just<00:02:59.430> don't<00:02:59.639> like<00:02:59.760> it<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.540> can

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
maybe you just don't like it you can

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.750 
maybe you just don't like it you can
harvest<00:03:00.900> those<00:03:01.230> parts<00:03:01.620> put<00:03:02.159> it<00:03:02.250> into<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.489> Fink

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
harvest those parts put it into the Fink

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.929 
harvest those parts put it into the Fink
on<00:03:02.939> and<00:03:03.269> you'll<00:03:03.930> get<00:03:04.139> a<00:03:04.349> pretty<00:03:04.889> amazing<00:03:05.280> q<00:03:05.700> as

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
on and you'll get a pretty amazing q as

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.759 
on and you'll get a pretty amazing q as
far<00:03:06.540> as<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:06.720> turning<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.079> this<00:03:07.230> cube<00:03:07.470> goes

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
far as the turning of this cube goes

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.270 
far as the turning of this cube goes
with<00:03:08.700> be<00:03:09.000> swapped<00:03:09.299> hardware<00:03:09.780> it's<00:03:10.079> a<00:03:10.799> little

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
with be swapped hardware it's a little

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.550 
with be swapped hardware it's a little
bit<00:03:11.400> slower<00:03:11.700> than<00:03:11.879> as<00:03:12.030> an<00:03:12.150> cheat<00:03:12.420> not<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.319> lot

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
bit slower than as an cheat not a lot

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.170 
bit slower than as an cheat not a lot
slower<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.189> when<00:03:14.579> you<00:03:14.700> actually<00:03:14.909> use

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
slower and when you actually use

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.689 
slower and when you actually use
algorithms<00:03:15.420> or<00:03:15.889> actually<00:03:16.889> do<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.040> salt<00:03:17.400> it's

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:17.699 
algorithms or actually do a salt it's

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.479 
algorithms or actually do a salt it's
not<00:03:18.030> noticeably<00:03:18.540> slower<00:03:18.870> what<00:03:19.799> is<00:03:19.980> different

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
not noticeably slower what is different

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.699 
not noticeably slower what is different
is<00:03:20.669> Miss<00:03:21.299> cute<00:03:21.569> is<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.750> lot<00:03:22.019> smoother<00:03:22.530> and

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
is Miss cute is a lot smoother and

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.949 
is Miss cute is a lot smoother and
actually<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.489> little<00:03:23.669> bit<00:03:23.879> quieter<00:03:24.329> than<00:03:24.629> as<00:03:24.780> an

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
actually a little bit quieter than as an

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.319 
actually a little bit quieter than as an
cheese<00:03:25.169> so<00:03:25.379> I<00:03:25.620> actually<00:03:25.709> like<00:03:26.340> that<00:03:26.370> aspect<00:03:26.790> of

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
cheese so I actually like that aspect of

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.300 
cheese so I actually like that aspect of
the<00:03:27.480> Q<00:03:27.659> a<00:03:27.690> lot<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.230> it's<00:03:28.949> one<00:03:29.069> of<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.190> reasons

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
the Q a lot and it's one of the reasons

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.129 
the Q a lot and it's one of the reasons
why<00:03:29.609> I<00:03:29.639> like<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.299> thing<00:03:30.480> could<00:03:30.659> more<00:03:30.840> than<00:03:30.870> is

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
why I like the thing could more than is

I<00:03:48.150> was<00:03:48.329> talking<00:03:48.449> about<00:03:48.659> before<00:03:48.989> as<00:03:49.470> far<00:03:49.799> as

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
I was talking about before as far as

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.409 
I was talking about before as far as
popping<00:03:50.220> goes<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.549> cube<00:03:50.760> does<00:03:50.909> not<00:03:51.120> pop

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
popping goes this cube does not pop

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.409 
popping goes this cube does not pop
mostly<00:03:52.379> because<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:52.739> tighten<00:03:53.220> my<00:03:53.340> cubes<00:03:53.639> pretty

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
mostly because I tighten my cubes pretty

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.300 
mostly because I tighten my cubes pretty
much<00:03:54.540> all<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.870> way<00:03:55.019> so<00:03:55.590> there's<00:03:55.859> not<00:03:56.010> really<00:03:56.220> a

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
much all the way so there's not really a

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.580 
much all the way so there's not really a
way<00:03:56.519> for<00:03:56.729> the<00:03:56.790> pieces<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.269> fall<00:03:57.449> out<00:03:57.479> but<00:03:58.440> if

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
way for the pieces to fall out but if

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.289 
way for the pieces to fall out but if
you<00:03:58.680> do<00:03:58.799> like<00:03:59.010> Loser<00:03:59.220> tensions<00:03:59.459> then<00:03:59.849> you

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
you do like Loser tensions then you

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.939 
you do like Loser tensions then you
should<00:04:00.449> expect<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.840> same<00:04:00.989> popping<00:04:01.409> as<00:04:01.560> Ana's

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
should expect the same popping as Ana's

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.920 
should expect the same popping as Ana's
Angie<00:04:02.310> recommending<00:04:03.090> this<00:04:03.209> cube<00:04:03.479> is<00:04:03.569> a<00:04:03.599> little

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
Angie recommending this cube is a little

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.229 
Angie recommending this cube is a little
difficult<00:04:04.169> just<00:04:04.799> because<00:04:04.889> of<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.519> aspect<00:04:06.150> of

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
difficult just because of the aspect of

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.360 
difficult just because of the aspect of
it<00:04:06.329> being<00:04:06.479> a<00:04:06.569> knockoff<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.530> I'll<00:04:07.799> sort<00:04:08.129> of<00:04:08.250> walk

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
it being a knockoff so I'll sort of walk

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.189 
it being a knockoff so I'll sort of walk
you<00:04:08.519> through<00:04:08.729> it<00:04:08.760> if<00:04:09.060> you're<00:04:09.449> someone<00:04:09.720> who<00:04:09.930> is

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
you through it if you're someone who is

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.719 
you through it if you're someone who is
completely<00:04:10.829> against<00:04:11.190> in<00:04:11.250> all<00:04:11.340> costs<00:04:11.549> and<00:04:11.609> you

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:11.729 
completely against in all costs and you

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.490 
completely against in all costs and you
want<00:04:11.879> nothing<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.239> do<00:04:12.389> with<00:04:12.540> them<00:04:12.690> then<00:04:12.989> you

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
want nothing to do with them then you

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.659 
want nothing to do with them then you
shouldn't<00:04:13.739> need<00:04:13.919> my<00:04:14.069> opinion<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.639> should

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
shouldn't need my opinion you should

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:15.860 
shouldn't need my opinion you should
already<00:04:14.970> know<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.329> you're<00:04:15.479> not<00:04:15.629> going<00:04:15.780> to

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
already know that you're not going to

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.479 
already know that you're not going to
get<00:04:15.989> one<00:04:16.169> just<00:04:16.199> because<00:04:16.530> that's<00:04:17.130> what<00:04:17.310> this<00:04:17.430> is

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
get one just because that's what this is

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.819 
get one just because that's what this is
so<00:04:18.269> if<00:04:18.389> you're<00:04:18.510> one<00:04:18.659> of<00:04:18.750> those<00:04:18.840> people<00:04:19.260> do<00:04:19.590> not

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
so if you're one of those people do not

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.409 
so if you're one of those people do not
buy<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.070> think<00:04:20.340> I'm<00:04:20.549> there's<00:04:20.789> no<00:04:20.940> real<00:04:21.180> way<00:04:21.209> I

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
buy the think I'm there's no real way I

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.810 
buy the think I'm there's no real way I
can<00:04:21.659> convince<00:04:21.779> you<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.289> buy<00:04:22.500> one<00:04:22.740> but<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.610> lot<00:04:23.789> of

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
can convince you to buy one but a lot of

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.490 
can convince you to buy one but a lot of
you<00:04:23.969> are<00:04:24.029> playing<00:04:24.240> like<00:04:24.479> me<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.200> you

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
you are playing like me and you

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.950 
you are playing like me and you
just<00:04:25.770> want<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:26.220> best<00:04:26.460> cube<00:04:26.760> for<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.630> lowest

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
just want the best cube for the lowest

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.590 
just want the best cube for the lowest
price<00:04:28.260> if<00:04:28.650> that's<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.610> case<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.300> really

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
price if that's the case and you really

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.540 
price if that's the case and you really
don't<00:04:31.110> care<00:04:31.440> too<00:04:31.650> much<00:04:31.680> if<00:04:32.040> it's<00:04:32.220> a<00:04:32.280> knockoff

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
don't care too much if it's a knockoff

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.730 
don't care too much if it's a knockoff
or<00:04:32.760> not<00:04:32.910> then<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.780> think<00:04:33.990> on<00:04:34.170> in<00:04:34.350> my<00:04:34.470> opinion

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
or not then the think on in my opinion

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.590 
or not then the think on in my opinion
is<00:04:34.980> better<00:04:35.160> than<00:04:35.310> as<00:04:35.460> an<00:04:35.640> cheat<00:04:35.850> finally<00:04:36.450> if

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
is better than as an cheat finally if

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.920 
is better than as an cheat finally if
you're<00:04:36.810> someone<00:04:37.290> who<00:04:37.620> actually<00:04:38.750> doesn't<00:04:39.750> want

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
you're someone who actually doesn't want

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.320 
you're someone who actually doesn't want
to<00:04:40.020> buy<00:04:40.110> knockoffs<00:04:40.560> but<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:41.700> want<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.180> best

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
to buy knockoffs but you want the best

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.240 
to buy knockoffs but you want the best
cube<00:04:42.690> anyway<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.350> so<00:04:43.740> you're<00:04:43.920> kind<00:04:44.160> of

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
cube anyway and so you're kind of

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.040 
cube anyway and so you're kind of
fighting<00:04:44.430> yourself<00:04:44.660> whether<00:04:45.660> or<00:04:45.840> not<00:04:45.930> you

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
fighting yourself whether or not you

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.080 
fighting yourself whether or not you
should<00:04:46.080> buy<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.410> cube<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.980> would<00:04:47.790> say<00:04:48.030> to

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
should buy the cube I would say to

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.920 
should buy the cube I would say to
actually<00:04:48.570> let<00:04:48.990> this<00:04:49.110> one<00:04:49.260> go<00:04:49.830> because<00:04:50.930> it's

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
actually let this one go because it's

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.670 
actually let this one go because it's
not<00:04:52.080> miles<00:04:52.650> better<00:04:52.980> than<00:04:53.070> as<00:04:53.340> anchi<00:04:53.670> if<00:04:53.910> at<00:04:54.210> all

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
not miles better than as anchi if at all

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.720 
not miles better than as anchi if at all
personally<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.710> just<00:04:56.040> like<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.280> feel<00:04:56.490> of<00:04:56.520> the

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
personally I just like the feel of the

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.460 
personally I just like the feel of the
thing<00:04:56.760> come<00:04:57.060> more<00:04:57.210> than<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.450> zhanchi<00:04:57.660> but

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
thing come more than the zhanchi but

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.720 
thing come more than the zhanchi but
performance<00:04:58.980> wise<00:04:59.130> they're<00:04:59.400> pretty<00:04:59.610> much

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
performance wise they're pretty much

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.000 
performance wise they're pretty much
identical<00:04:59.880> so<00:05:00.840> if<00:05:01.350> you<00:05:01.530> don't<00:05:01.710> want<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:01.919> break

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
identical so if you don't want to break

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.070 
identical so if you don't want to break
your<00:05:02.160> own<00:05:02.280> values<00:05:02.669> then<00:05:03.180> do<00:05:03.419> not<00:05:03.630> buy<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:03.870> fan

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
your own values then do not buy the fan

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.870 
your own values then do not buy the fan
con<00:05:04.290> if<00:05:04.470> you<00:05:04.560> do<00:05:04.740> get<00:05:04.919> the<00:05:05.040> think<00:05:05.250> on<00:05:05.460> I<00:05:05.610> would

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
con if you do get the think on I would

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.340 
con if you do get the think on I would
recommend<00:05:06.150> getting<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:06.570> diam<00:05:06.750> hardware<00:05:07.140> with

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
recommend getting the diam hardware with

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.110 
recommend getting the diam hardware with
it<00:05:07.530> if<00:05:07.680> you<00:05:07.800> don't<00:05:07.980> already<00:05:08.250> have<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.550> spare<00:05:08.880> set

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
it if you don't already have a spare set

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.350 
it if you don't already have a spare set
but<00:05:09.990> of<00:05:10.080> course<00:05:10.380> that<00:05:10.620> only<00:05:11.100> applies<00:05:11.970> if<00:05:12.270> you

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
but of course that only applies if you

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.970 
but of course that only applies if you
have<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:12.690> money<00:05:12.720> because<00:05:13.260> I'm<00:05:13.410> assuming<00:05:13.919> a

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
have the money because I'm assuming a

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.110 
have the money because I'm assuming a
lot<00:05:14.070> of<00:05:14.190> you<00:05:14.280> actually<00:05:14.550> want<00:05:14.700> the<00:05:14.820> thing<00:05:14.970> come

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
lot of you actually want the thing come

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.630 
lot of you actually want the thing come
because<00:05:15.390> it<00:05:15.540> is<00:05:15.660> cheaper<00:05:16.110> if<00:05:16.740> you<00:05:16.800> are<00:05:17.310> on<00:05:17.580> a

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
because it is cheaper if you are on a

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.520 
because it is cheaper if you are on a
tight<00:05:18.060> budget<00:05:18.090> that<00:05:18.630> think<00:05:18.810> on<00:05:18.990> is<00:05:19.230> pretty

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
tight budget that think on is pretty

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.040 
tight budget that think on is pretty
good<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:20.100> cube<00:05:20.400> with<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.300> factory<00:05:21.540> lubricant

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
good the cube with the factory lubricant

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.840 
good the cube with the factory lubricant
and<00:05:22.200> the<00:05:22.470> springs<00:05:22.680> actually<00:05:22.980> feels<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.490> lot

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
and the springs actually feels a lot

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.400 
and the springs actually feels a lot
like<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.150> lubick<00:05:24.419> sanchi<00:05:24.900> which<00:05:25.080> is<00:05:25.200> a<00:05:25.230> great

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
like the lubick sanchi which is a great

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.530 
like the lubick sanchi which is a great
q<00:05:25.710> so<00:05:26.250> it's<00:05:26.580> more<00:05:26.760> than<00:05:26.910> usable<00:05:27.240> out<00:05:27.360> of<00:05:27.480> the

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
q so it's more than usable out of the

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.900 
q so it's more than usable out of the
box<00:05:27.750> but<00:05:28.169> if<00:05:28.410> you<00:05:28.890> are<00:05:29.130> able<00:05:29.400> to<00:05:29.669> I<00:05:29.700> would

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
box but if you are able to I would

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.670 
box but if you are able to I would
actually<00:05:30.180> buy<00:05:30.540> the<00:05:30.600> Diane<00:05:31.020> hardware<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.560> go

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
actually buy the Diane hardware to go

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.800 
actually buy the Diane hardware to go
with<00:05:31.890> it<00:05:32.040> I'm<00:05:32.880> going<00:05:33.180> to<00:05:33.240> give<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.450> Fink<00:05:33.660> on

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
with it I'm going to give the Fink on

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.540 
with it I'm going to give the Fink on
two<00:05:34.050> grades<00:05:34.380> one<00:05:34.740> with<00:05:34.890> the<00:05:35.010> stock<00:05:35.190> hardware

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
two grades one with the stock hardware

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.270 
two grades one with the stock hardware
and<00:05:35.760> one<00:05:35.970> with<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.600> swapped<00:05:37.050> hardware<00:05:37.590> with

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
and one with the swapped hardware with

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.469 
and one with the swapped hardware with
the<00:05:38.400> stock<00:05:38.580> hardware<00:05:38.970> I'm<00:05:39.090> going<00:05:39.210> to<00:05:39.270> give<00:05:39.360> the

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
the stock hardware I'm going to give the

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.050 
the stock hardware I'm going to give the
cuba<00:05:39.690> v+<00:05:40.140> and<00:05:40.410> that<00:05:41.310> would<00:05:41.430> be<00:05:41.460> a<00:05:41.550> little<00:05:41.880> bit

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
cuba v+ and that would be a little bit

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.940 
cuba v+ and that would be a little bit
lower<00:05:42.240> than<00:05:42.810> as<00:05:42.990> angie<00:05:43.350> which<00:05:43.590> would<00:05:43.800> be

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
lower than as angie which would be

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.590 
lower than as angie which would be
something<00:05:44.280> like<00:05:44.400> a<00:05:44.520> b-plus<00:05:44.729> to<00:05:45.030> an<00:05:45.150> a-minus

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
something like a b-plus to an a-minus

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.690 
something like a b-plus to an a-minus
and<00:05:46.470> of<00:05:46.590> course<00:05:46.620> this<00:05:46.950> is<00:05:47.040> all<00:05:47.070> benchmark

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
and of course this is all benchmark

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.430 
and of course this is all benchmark
relative<00:05:48.210> to<00:05:48.419> a<00:05:48.450> google<00:05:48.810> hong<00:05:48.960> version<00:05:49.290> 1

relative to a google hong version 1

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.980 
relative to a google hong version 1
which<00:05:49.890> is<00:05:49.919> that<00:05:50.160> a<00:05:50.190> be<00:05:50.570> so<00:05:51.570> with<00:05:51.720> the<00:05:51.810> stock

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
which is that a be so with the stock

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.110 
which is that a be so with the stock
hardware<00:05:52.380> like<00:05:52.710> I<00:05:52.800> said<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:53.190> cube<00:05:53.400> is<00:05:53.580> good<00:05:53.910> I

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
hardware like I said the cube is good I

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.060 
hardware like I said the cube is good I
think<00:05:54.570> this<00:05:54.660> brings<00:05:54.900> are<00:05:55.110> a<00:05:55.140> bit<00:05:55.410> stiff<00:05:55.800> but

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
think this brings are a bit stiff but

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.490 
think this brings are a bit stiff but
the<00:05:56.640> cube<00:05:56.850> is<00:05:57.060> very<00:05:57.300> usable<00:05:57.780> and<00:05:57.960> I<00:05:58.050> get<00:05:58.290> pretty

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
the cube is very usable and I get pretty

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.710 
the cube is very usable and I get pretty
good<00:05:58.710> times<00:05:58.919> with<00:05:59.100> it<00:05:59.130> the<00:05:59.970> factory<00:06:00.300> lubricant

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
good times with it the factory lubricant

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.010 
good times with it the factory lubricant
is<00:06:00.840> amazing<00:06:01.290> it's<00:06:02.150> fantastic<00:06:03.150> I<00:06:03.390> guess<00:06:03.810> which

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
is amazing it's fantastic I guess which

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.740 
is amazing it's fantastic I guess which
is<00:06:04.050> a<00:06:04.169> bad<00:06:04.530> pun<00:06:04.800> but<00:06:05.760> the<00:06:05.910> cube<00:06:06.120> is<00:06:06.240> pretty<00:06:06.600> good

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
is a bad pun but the cube is pretty good

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.930 
is a bad pun but the cube is pretty good
with<00:06:06.990> the<00:06:07.530> stock<00:06:07.740> hardware<00:06:08.190> now<00:06:08.669> if<00:06:08.850> you

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
with the stock hardware now if you

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.540 
with the stock hardware now if you
choose<00:06:09.210> to<00:06:09.390> swap<00:06:09.720> the<00:06:09.930> hardware<00:06:10.350> with<00:06:11.250> the

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
choose to swap the hardware with the

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.880 
choose to swap the hardware with the
Diane<00:06:11.970> springs<00:06:12.390> then<00:06:13.020> this<00:06:13.260> cube<00:06:13.530> easily

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
Diane springs then this cube easily

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.380 
Diane springs then this cube easily
becomes<00:06:14.160> an<00:06:14.250> a-minus<00:06:14.760> and<00:06:14.940> it's<00:06:15.090> getting

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
becomes an a-minus and it's getting

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.659 
becomes an a-minus and it's getting
close<00:06:15.570> to<00:06:15.600> that<00:06:15.750> a<00:06:16.050> mark<00:06:16.350> the<00:06:16.890> only<00:06:17.130> real<00:06:17.310> flaw

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
close to that a mark the only real flaw

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.100 
close to that a mark the only real flaw
with<00:06:18.330> both<00:06:19.140> q's<00:06:19.470> is<00:06:20.030> the<00:06:21.030> center<00:06:21.270> caps<00:06:21.510> they<00:06:22.050> do

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
with both q's is the center caps they do

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.170 
with both q's is the center caps they do
fall<00:06:22.440> off<00:06:22.620> if<00:06:22.890> you<00:06:23.160> corner<00:06:23.460> cut<00:06:23.700> a<00:06:23.729> lot<00:06:23.970> so<00:06:24.120> if

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
fall off if you corner cut a lot so if

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.400 
fall off if you corner cut a lot so if
you're<00:06:24.300> rough<00:06:24.450> cuber<00:06:24.810> you<00:06:24.960> might<00:06:25.140> find<00:06:25.290> that

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
you're rough cuber you might find that

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.350 
you're rough cuber you might find that
annoying<00:06:25.710> for<00:06:26.220> me<00:06:26.250> I<00:06:26.490> haven't<00:06:26.820> had<00:06:27.090> it<00:06:27.210> fall

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
annoying for me I haven't had it fall

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.270 
annoying for me I haven't had it fall
off<00:06:27.390> a<00:06:27.540> single<00:06:27.870> time<00:06:28.200> during<00:06:28.560> a<00:06:28.680> regular<00:06:28.800> salt

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
off a single time during a regular salt

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.390 
off a single time during a regular salt
and<00:06:29.490> I've<00:06:29.580> done<00:06:29.790> plus500<00:06:30.750> salts<00:06:31.260> on<00:06:31.380> it<00:06:31.530> so

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
and I've done plus500 salts on it so

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.070 
and I've done plus500 salts on it so
center<00:06:32.880> caps<00:06:33.090> aren't<00:06:33.300> really<00:06:33.780> a<00:06:33.810> problem

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
center caps aren't really a problem

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.380 
center caps aren't really a problem
unless<00:06:34.440> you're<00:06:34.830> a<00:06:34.860> rough<00:06:35.070> cuber<00:06:35.460> the<00:06:35.940> fame<00:06:36.180> gun

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
unless you're a rough cuber the fame gun

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.719 
unless you're a rough cuber the fame gun
is<00:06:36.599> a<00:06:36.630> pretty<00:06:37.169> amazing<00:06:37.530> cube

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
is a pretty amazing cube

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:40.010 
is a pretty amazing cube
I<00:06:38.759> would<00:06:38.849> say<00:06:38.969> it's<00:06:39.029> a<00:06:39.089> bargain<00:06:39.300> cube<00:06:39.689> and<00:06:39.900> it

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
I would say it's a bargain cube and it

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.779 
I would say it's a bargain cube and it
can<00:06:40.139> easily<00:06:40.439> become<00:06:40.559> a<00:06:40.710> main<00:06:41.009> so<00:06:41.550> if<00:06:41.669> you're

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:41.789 
can easily become a main so if you're

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:43.399 
can easily become a main so if you're
looking<00:06:41.969> for<00:06:42.180> a<00:06:42.360> new<00:06:42.539> speed<00:06:42.809> cube<00:06:43.110> and<00:06:43.319> you

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:43.409 
looking for a new speed cube and you

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:44.749 
looking for a new speed cube and you
don't<00:06:43.589> like<00:06:43.680> the<00:06:43.830> one<00:06:43.949> you<00:06:44.039> currently<00:06:44.309> have<00:06:44.580> i

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 
don't like the one you currently have i

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:46.969 
don't like the one you currently have i
would<00:06:45.029> say<00:06:45.210> consider<00:06:46.169> getting<00:06:46.469> the<00:06:46.650> Fink<00:06:46.830> on

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
would say consider getting the Fink on

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:49.760 
would say consider getting the Fink on
it's<00:06:47.309> a<00:06:47.520> very<00:06:47.819> good<00:06:47.879> q<00:06:48.270> so<00:06:48.930> thank<00:06:49.319> you<00:06:49.439> cameron
