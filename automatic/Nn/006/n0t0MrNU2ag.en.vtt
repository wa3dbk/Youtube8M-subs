the easter egg now I'm not really sure

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.139 
the easter egg now I'm not really sure
what<00:00:58.079> his<00:00:58.620> function<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.280> besides<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> easter

what his function is besides the easter

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.420 
what his function is besides the easter
egg<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.780> think<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.620> know<00:01:01.739> Trey

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.310 
egg but I think that if you know Trey
you<00:01:02.730> know<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.850> did<00:01:03.149> not<00:01:03.180> want<00:01:03.270> him<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.080> know<00:01:04.140> or
