00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.779

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.290
 everyone knows what other case 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.840
 I hope you are well and I will 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.060
 very very good because we end up 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.950
 for a video that will talk about 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.950
 different budgets of fashion clubs 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.059
 fifa career 16 friends so there are 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.480
 had some screens that were 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.220
 scattered by here and there is so 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.640
 vain to decide to make a small 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.830
 video 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.080
 so that's potential because 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.760
 friends it can very well change 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:55.070
 draw at the beginning of the game so I want to 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.040
 so you tell yourself that if the price there if 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.230
 this budget there will not be the same 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.480
 of gold-fifa 16 it's perfectly normal 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.970
 it's a potential so it can be very 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.990
 change well from here transfers and where 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.080
 so by the end of the game 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.170
 so now I leave you with all 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.000
 the potentials so budget this mode 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.880

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.530

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.600
