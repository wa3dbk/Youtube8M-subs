illustrate<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> point<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.880> how<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.119> can

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
illustrate a point and so how I can

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.810 
illustrate a point and so how I can
learn<00:01:24.509> both<00:01:24.750> good<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.259> bad<00:01:25.320> things<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.490> did

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
learn both good and bad things and I did

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.260 
learn both good and bad things and I did
from<00:01:27.420> some<00:01:27.689> some<00:01:27.990> really<00:01:28.229> wonderful<00:01:28.320> books

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
from some some really wonderful books

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.969 
from some some really wonderful books
now<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.720> each<00:01:31.110> other<00:01:31.350> several<00:01:31.619> different

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
now in this each other several different

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.319 
now in this each other several different
storylines<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.610> think<00:01:32.790> he's<00:01:32.880> got<00:01:33.030> it's

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
storylines and I think he's got it's

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.370 
storylines and I think he's got it's
been<00:01:33.479> several<00:01:33.689> years<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.020> i<00:01:34.110> think<00:01:34.229> there's

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
been several years but i think there's

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.010 
been several years but i think there's
four<00:01:34.650> different<00:01:35.360> groups<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.630> are<00:01:36.720> pinned

scene with that person is so powerfully

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.540 
scene with that person is so powerfully
conveyed<00:03:44.630> that<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.770> know<00:03:45.920> exactly<00:03:46.040> who<00:03:46.460> they

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550
