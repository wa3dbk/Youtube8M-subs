I'm pretty good at the multiplayer but
for<00:00:21.660> my<00:00:21.750> first<00:00:21.990> video<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.410> decided<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.980> do<00:00:23.189> a

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
for my first video I decided to do a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.710 
for my first video I decided to do a
how-to<00:00:24.900> guide<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:26.010> how<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.279> do<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> rape<00:00:27.480> train

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
how-to guide on how to do a rape train

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.800 
how-to guide on how to do a rape train
on<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.439> map<00:00:28.619> town<00:00:29.039> now<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:29.880> really<00:00:30.269> easy<00:00:30.539> to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
on the map town now it's really easy to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.139 
on the map town now it's really easy to
do<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.679> let's<00:00:31.920> get<00:00:32.009> right<00:00:32.130> into<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.940> there

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
do so let's get right into it so there

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.020 
do so let's get right into it so there
are<00:00:33.239> two<00:00:33.510> main<00:00:33.809> buildings<00:00:34.320> one<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.309> them<00:00:35.460> well

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
are two main buildings one of them well

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.650 
are two main buildings one of them well
both<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.420> them<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.809> fact<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.879> perks<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.570> of

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
both of them in fact have perks one of

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.630 
both of them in fact have perks one of
them<00:00:39.870> which<00:00:40.110> I'm<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.469> at<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> moment<00:00:40.770> has<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
them which I'm in at the moment has the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.490 
them which I'm in at the moment has the
quick<00:00:41.910> revive<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.870> other<00:00:43.050> one<00:00:43.170> has<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
quick revive and the other one has the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.529 
quick revive and the other one has the
trigonal<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.760> what<00:00:44.969> you're<00:00:45.059> going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> do<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
trigonal so what you're going to do is

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.990 
trigonal so what you're going to do is
because<00:00:46.410> both<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.710> these<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.190> missing<00:00:47.640> walls

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
because both of these are missing walls

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.479 
because both of these are missing walls
and<00:00:48.809> you'll<00:00:48.960> be<00:00:49.110> able<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.320> jump<00:00:49.739> down<00:00:49.890> onto<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and you'll be able to jump down onto the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.549 
and you'll be able to jump down onto the
street<00:00:50.850> you're<00:00:51.449> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.719> want<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.960> stand<00:00:52.440> as

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
street you're going to want to stand as

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.260 
street you're going to want to stand as
far<00:00:52.770> back<00:00:52.980> as<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:54.949> so<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.149> won't<00:00:57.149> get

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
far back as you can so you won't get

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.650 
far back as you can so you won't get
stuck<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.809> pinned<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> wall<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.680> dye<00:00:58.920> and

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
stuck and pinned to the wall and dye and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.139 
stuck and pinned to the wall and dye and
so<00:01:00.660> once<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.379> start<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.739> hit<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.370> bite

jump<00:01:04.710> down<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.070> street<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.400> run<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
jump down to the street and run to the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.480 
jump down to the street and run to the
next<00:01:06.210> building<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.659> I'm<00:01:07.229> doing<00:01:07.380> right<00:01:07.619> now<00:01:07.680> so

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
next building as I'm doing right now so

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.240 
next building as I'm doing right now so
what<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:10.080> hold<00:01:10.350> zombies<00:01:10.920> off<00:01:11.070> as

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
what you do is you hold zombies off as

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.670 
what you do is you hold zombies off as
long<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.180> before<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.409> jump<00:01:13.650> down

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
long as you can before you jump down

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.530 
long as you can before you jump down
like<00:01:14.040> you'll<00:01:14.220> see<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.369> come<00:01:14.700> down<00:01:14.909> now<00:01:15.150> because

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
like you'll see I come down now because

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.719 
like you'll see I come down now because
it's<00:01:15.689> always<00:01:15.900> start<00:01:16.140> hitting<00:01:16.470> me<00:01:16.500> own<00:01:17.280> yet<00:01:17.549> I

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
it's always start hitting me own yet I

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.039 
it's always start hitting me own yet I
would<00:01:17.880> definitely<00:01:18.240> recommend<00:01:18.630> having

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
would definitely recommend having

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.350 
would definitely recommend having
juggernaut<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.740> speed<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.820> speed<00:01:20.970> back

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
juggernaut and speed the speed back

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.950 
juggernaut and speed the speed back
mainly<00:01:22.229> because<00:01:22.259> you're<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.310> more<00:01:23.750> able<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
mainly because you're just more able to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.550 
mainly because you're just more able to
run<00:01:25.140> away<00:01:25.290> from<00:01:25.350> zombies<00:01:25.860> faster<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:27.560> would

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
run away from zombies faster I would

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.200 
run away from zombies faster I would
also<00:01:28.710> recommend<00:01:28.890> having<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.640> least<00:01:29.729> one<00:01:29.880> pack

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
also recommend having at least one pack

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.140 
also recommend having at least one pack
a<00:01:30.240> punched<00:01:30.570> weapon<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.170> being<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.590> lmg<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.369> have

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
a punched weapon that being a lmg I have

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.149 
a punched weapon that being a lmg I have
the<00:01:33.360> hammer<00:01:33.810> at<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> moment<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.770> think<00:01:34.829> it's

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the hammer at the moment I think it's

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.490 
the hammer at the moment I think it's
called<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:36.540> only<00:01:36.720> bad<00:01:36.900> thing<00:01:36.930> about<00:01:37.140> doing

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
called the only bad thing about doing

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.440 
called the only bad thing about doing
these<00:01:37.680> rate<00:01:37.920> range<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.729> run<00:01:38.850> out<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.030> ammo

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
these rate range is you run out of ammo

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.600 
these rate range is you run out of ammo
very<00:01:39.869> fast<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.829> you're<00:01:40.979> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.490> to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
very fast so you're going to have to
