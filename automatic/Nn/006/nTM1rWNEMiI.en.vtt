how to design character poses by Shari
in<00:00:10.300> this<00:00:10.480> lesson<00:00:10.690> I'll<00:00:11.080> be<00:00:11.380> explaining<00:00:11.710> how<00:00:11.889> to

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
in this lesson I'll be explaining how to

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.549 
in this lesson I'll be explaining how to
design<00:00:12.460> character<00:00:12.940> poses<00:00:13.330> there<00:00:14.170> are<00:00:14.320> two

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
design character poses there are two

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.370 
design character poses there are two
points<00:00:15.010> that<00:00:15.070> are<00:00:15.309> important<00:00:15.700> to<00:00:15.730> remember

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:16.380 
points that are important to remember

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.109 
points that are important to remember
first<00:00:17.380> off<00:00:17.650> let<00:00:18.220> me<00:00:18.369> introduce<00:00:18.580> the<00:00:18.910> term

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
first off let me introduce the term

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.350 
first off let me introduce the term
contrapposto<00:00:20.490> contrapposto<00:00:21.490> is<00:00:22.060> when<00:00:22.240> the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
contrapposto contrapposto is when the

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.850 
contrapposto contrapposto is when the
character's<00:00:22.780> weight<00:00:22.990> has<00:00:23.230> shifted<00:00:23.470> so<00:00:23.830> that

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
character's weight has shifted so that

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.070 
character's weight has shifted so that
the<00:00:24.279> shoulders<00:00:24.730> and<00:00:24.880> arms<00:00:25.180> sit<00:00:25.420> at<00:00:25.539> a<00:00:25.570> slanted

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
the shoulders and arms sit at a slanted

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.170 
the shoulders and arms sit at a slanted
angle<00:00:26.230> to<00:00:26.590> the<00:00:26.680> hips<00:00:26.890> and<00:00:27.070> legs<00:00:27.250> this<00:00:27.970> will

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
angle to the hips and legs this will

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.880 
angle to the hips and legs this will
portray<00:00:28.449> our<00:00:28.630> sense<00:00:28.810> of<00:00:28.900> movement<00:00:29.230> in<00:00:29.680> your

for a figure that looks somewhat like
it's<00:00:42.910> in<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.090> process<00:00:43.450> of<00:00:43.750> moving<00:00:45.630> the<00:00:46.630> next

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.160 

current<00:01:00.640> lines<00:01:00.879> will<00:01:01.179> add<00:01:01.329> a<00:01:01.359> sense<00:01:01.719> of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
current lines will add a sense of

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.979 
current lines will add a sense of
softness<00:01:02.589> and<00:01:03.070> turn<00:01:03.280> domestic<00:01:03.730> economy<00:01:04.239> while

softness and turn domestic economy while
straight<00:01:05.320> lines<00:01:05.530> get<00:01:05.830> a<00:01:05.860> sense<00:01:06.130> of

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
straight lines get a sense of

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.520 
straight lines get a sense of
sustainability<00:01:07.060> when<00:01:08.049> you<00:01:08.200> draw<00:01:08.380> your

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
sustainability when you draw your

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.020 
sustainability when you draw your
character<00:01:08.979> is<00:01:09.070> standing<00:01:09.369> straight<00:01:09.610> up

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
character is standing straight up

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.969 
character is standing straight up
you'll<00:01:10.540> probably<00:01:10.720> be<00:01:11.049> drawing<00:01:11.439> in<00:01:11.619> a<00:01:11.740> lot<00:01:11.950> of

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
you'll probably be drawing in a lot of

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.170 
you'll probably be drawing in a lot of
straight<00:01:12.310> lines<00:01:13.680> however<00:01:14.680> adding<00:01:15.610> in<00:01:15.759> lots<00:01:16.000> of

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
straight lines however adding in lots of

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.240 
straight lines however adding in lots of
curved<00:01:16.450> s-shaped<00:01:17.049> lines<00:01:17.289> is<00:01:17.560> a<00:01:17.590> surprisingly

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
curved s-shaped lines is a surprisingly

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.889 
curved s-shaped lines is a surprisingly
handy<00:01:18.549> trick<00:01:18.909> when<00:01:19.210> sketching<00:01:19.509> in<00:01:19.780> the

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
handy trick when sketching in the

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.109 
handy trick when sketching in the
general<00:01:20.289> outline<00:01:20.729> because<00:01:21.729> you<00:01:21.820> can<00:01:22.000> add

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
general outline because you can add

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.910 
general outline because you can add
balance<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.720> your<00:01:22.750> character<00:01:23.200> by<00:01:23.470> mixing<00:01:23.680> up

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
balance to your character by mixing up

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.029 
balance to your character by mixing up
the<00:01:24.070> tempo<00:01:24.460> of<00:01:24.580> your<00:01:24.610> sketch<00:01:25.000> lines<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.860> also

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
the tempo of your sketch lines it's also

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.219 
the tempo of your sketch lines it's also
a<00:01:27.189> good<00:01:27.430> idea<00:01:27.549> to<00:01:27.850> take<00:01:28.180> note<00:01:28.509> of<00:01:28.539> differences

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
a good idea to take note of differences

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.289 
a good idea to take note of differences
in<00:01:29.259> specific<00:01:29.950> parts<00:01:30.310> of<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.580> body<00:01:30.789> that<00:01:31.149> look

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
in specific parts of the body that look

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.969 
in specific parts of the body that look
good<00:01:31.509> with<00:01:31.720> straight<00:01:31.990> lines<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.560> those<00:01:32.740> that

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
good with straight lines and those that

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.609 
good with straight lines and those that
look<00:01:33.130> good<00:01:33.340> with<00:01:33.550> curved<00:01:33.819> lines<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:35.470> this

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
look good with curved lines in this

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.950 
look good with curved lines in this
regard<00:01:36.069> anything<00:01:36.970> you<00:01:37.090> might<00:01:37.270> know<00:01:37.509> from<00:01:37.539> our

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.370 

let's<00:01:43.090> review<00:01:43.479> step<00:01:43.840> 1

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
let's review step 1

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.499 
let's review step 1
I'll<00:01:45.009> go<00:01:45.220> through<00:01:45.429> the<00:01:45.490> whole<00:01:45.759> process<00:01:46.030> from

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
I'll go through the whole process from

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.570 
I'll go through the whole process from
constructing<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.470> guidelines<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:48.220> building

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
constructing the guidelines to building

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.389 
constructing the guidelines to building
up<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.850> rough<00:01:49.060> sketch<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.740> first<00:01:50.979> thing<00:01:51.220> we

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
up the rough sketch the first thing we

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.430 
up the rough sketch the first thing we
learned<00:01:51.670> in<00:01:51.819> step<00:01:52.030> 1<00:01:52.270> is<00:01:52.600> a<00:01:52.630> concept<00:01:53.229> of

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
learned in step 1 is a concept of

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.490 
learned in step 1 is a concept of
contrapposto<00:01:54.690> style<00:01:55.690> that<00:01:55.869> emphasizes

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
contrapposto style that emphasizes

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.800 
contrapposto style that emphasizes
assets<00:01:56.830> played<00:01:57.130> centre<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.640> gravity<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
assets played centre of gravity the

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.749 
assets played centre of gravity the
simplest<00:01:59.200> way<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.500> recreate<00:02:00.039> this<00:02:00.310> is<00:02:00.520> by

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
simplest way to recreate this is by

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.880 
simplest way to recreate this is by
drawing<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.299> shoulders<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:01.899> hips<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.649> the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
drawing the shoulders and hips and the

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.429 
drawing the shoulders and hips and the

easier<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.799> see<00:02:06.130> how<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:06.520> works<00:02:06.789> by<00:02:07.119> actually

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
easier to see how this works by actually

let's<00:02:23.620> review<00:02:23.980> step<00:02:24.310> two<00:02:24.550> when<00:02:25.270> drying<00:02:25.540> keep

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
let's review step two when drying keep

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.080 
let's review step two when drying keep

or<00:02:28.240> character<00:02:28.600> took<00:02:28.780> shape<00:02:29.610> it's<00:02:30.610> pretty<00:02:30.940> hard

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
or character took shape it's pretty hard

to<00:02:31.330> develop<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:31.780> sense<00:02:32.020> for<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.350> initially

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
to develop a sense for this initially

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.890 
to develop a sense for this initially
but<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.310> think<00:02:33.610> you'll<00:02:33.730> be<00:02:33.790> able<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.330> grasp<00:02:34.540> and

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
but I think you'll be able to grasp and

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.510 
but I think you'll be able to grasp and
the<00:02:34.960> two<00:02:35.290> good<00:02:35.560> sense<00:02:35.860> of<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.370> as<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:36.730> go<00:02:36.880> along

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
the two good sense of it as you go along

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.400
