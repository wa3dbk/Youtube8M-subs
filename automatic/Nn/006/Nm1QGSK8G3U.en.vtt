ultimately<00:02:01.180> what<00:02:01.690> I'm<00:02:01.840> preparing<00:02:02.350> him<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.680> do

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
ultimately what I'm preparing him to do

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.540 
ultimately what I'm preparing him to do
is<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.340> have<00:02:03.490> me<00:02:03.730> actually<00:02:04.060> ride<00:02:04.600> in

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
is to have me actually ride in

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.240 
is to have me actually ride in
straddling<00:02:06.550> his<00:02:06.760> back<00:02:07.050> but<00:02:08.050> if<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.800> just<00:02:08.979> get

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
straddling his back but if you just get

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.320 
straddling his back but if you just get
on<00:02:09.280> from<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.790> mounting<00:02:10.240> block<00:02:12.120> your<00:02:13.120> horse

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
on from the mounting block your horse

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.080 
on from the mounting block your horse
isn't<00:02:13.540> really<00:02:14.020> prepared<00:02:14.530> for<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.760> way<00:02:15.880> that

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
isn't really prepared for the way that

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.500 
isn't really prepared for the way that
you're<00:02:16.210> gonna<00:02:16.300> wiggle<00:02:16.720> around<00:02:16.870> up<00:02:17.290> there<00:02:17.320> and

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
you're gonna wiggle around up there and

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.880 
you're gonna wiggle around up there and
jumping<00:02:19.510> next<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.050> side<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.530> actually

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
jumping next to the side and actually

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.590 
jumping next to the side and actually
leaping<00:02:21.340> onto<00:02:21.550> their<00:02:21.820> back<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.300> pretty

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
leaping onto their back is a pretty

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.510 
leaping onto their back is a pretty
exaggerated<00:02:23.410> movement<00:02:23.830> so<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.340> really

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
exaggerated movement so it really

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.060 
exaggerated movement so it really
desensitize<00:02:25.270> is<00:02:25.480> fun<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:26.200> prepared

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
desensitize is fun and prepared

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.750 
desensitize is fun and prepared
sometimes<00:02:27.580> be<00:02:27.730> ridden<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:29.610> what<00:02:30.610> I'm<00:02:30.730> doing

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
sometimes be ridden so what I'm doing

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.000 
sometimes be ridden so what I'm doing
there<00:02:31.000> Green<00:02:31.540> did<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.780> particularly<00:02:32.380> nice<00:02:32.680> job

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
there Green did a particularly nice job

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.490 
there Green did a particularly nice job
that<00:02:33.250> time<00:02:33.460> so<00:02:33.820> I<00:02:33.850> fed<00:02:34.210> him<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.420> treat<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.320> I

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
that time so I fed him a treat and I

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.650 
that time so I fed him a treat and I
gave<00:02:35.680> him<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:36.130> really<00:02:36.670> good<00:02:36.850> rub<00:02:37.270> on<00:02:37.480> his

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
gave him a really good rub on his

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.830 
gave him a really good rub on his
forehead<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:39.160> we<00:02:39.880> can<00:02:40.000> see<00:02:40.210> him<00:02:40.300> looking<00:02:40.450> and

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
forehead and we can see him looking and

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.570 
forehead and we can see him looking and
chewing<00:02:41.170> seeing<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.740> message<00:02:42.100> got

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
chewing seeing that the message got

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.690 
chewing seeing that the message got
across<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:43.800> every<00:02:44.800> time<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.130> jump<00:02:45.340> like<00:02:45.430> one

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
across so every time I jump like one

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.670 
across so every time I jump like one
it's<00:02:45.880> back<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.450> want<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.110> walk<00:02:47.260> them<00:02:47.500> out

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
it's back I want to walk them out

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.400 
it's back I want to walk them out
because<00:02:48.270> every<00:02:49.270> time<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.630> walk<00:02:49.870> him<00:02:50.050> out<00:02:50.230> and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
because every time I walk him out and

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.699 
because every time I walk him out and
then<00:02:50.680> reposition<00:02:51.489> them<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:52.380> gives<00:02:53.380> them<00:02:53.620> a

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
then reposition them it gives them a

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.130 
then reposition them it gives them a
chance<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.160> say<00:02:54.520> yes<00:02:55.239> I'm<00:02:55.480> ready<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.840> have<00:02:55.989> you

to get to in seven minutes I would have
well<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.990> would<00:03:31.170> have<00:03:31.260> stopped<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.800> but<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.400> don't

well I would have stopped it but I don't

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.580 
well I would have stopped it but I don't
know<00:03:32.910> arrangement<00:03:33.480> very<00:03:33.870> well<00:03:34.080> at<00:03:34.260> this<00:03:34.440> point

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
know arrangement very well at this point

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.270 
know arrangement very well at this point
and<00:03:35.900> him<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.230> just<00:03:37.560> trying<00:03:37.740> to<00:03:37.830> figure<00:03:38.070> him

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
and him and just trying to figure him

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.340 
and him and just trying to figure him
out<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.640> figure<00:03:38.940> out<00:03:39.000> what<00:03:39.810> he<00:03:39.900> actually

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
out and figure out what he actually

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.460 
out and figure out what he actually
needs<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.950> what<00:03:41.580> his<00:03:41.880> personal<00:03:42.600> sense<00:03:43.200> of

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
needs and what his personal sense of

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.320 
needs and what his personal sense of
relaxation<00:03:43.740> are<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.700> how<00:03:44.850> much<00:03:45.000> he<00:03:45.210> can

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
relaxation are and how much he can

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.930 
relaxation are and how much he can
actually<00:03:45.810> relax<00:03:46.500> because<00:03:47.040> at<00:03:47.340> this<00:03:47.490> point<00:03:47.730> it

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
actually relax because at this point it

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.750 
actually relax because at this point it
seems<00:03:47.970> like<00:03:48.450> reading

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
seems like reading

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.640 
seems like reading
he's<00:03:50.760> always<00:03:51.060> got<00:03:51.510> kind<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:52.020> high<00:03:52.230> level<00:03:52.260> of

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
he's always got kind of a high level of

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.740 
he's always got kind of a high level of
energy<00:03:52.770> and<00:03:53.160> doesn't<00:03:53.730> really<00:03:53.880> have<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.150> neutral

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
energy and doesn't really have a neutral

energy and doesn't really have a neutral
and<00:03:55.430> standing<00:03:56.430> there<00:03:56.550> in<00:03:56.700> front<00:03:56.730> of<00:03:57.030> him<00:03:57.180> and

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
and standing there in front of him and

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.590 
and standing there in front of him and
stroking<00:03:57.930> his<00:03:58.080> forehead<00:03:58.590> really<00:03:59.600> reinforces

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
stroking his forehead really reinforces

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.740 
stroking his forehead really reinforces
that<00:04:00.930> um<00:04:01.430> that<00:04:02.430> calming<00:04:02.970> down<00:04:03.150> because<00:04:03.600> I

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
that um that calming down because I

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.420 
that um that calming down because I
wanted<00:04:04.020> to<00:04:04.080> lower<00:04:04.380> his<00:04:04.620> head<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.130> looking

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
wanted to lower his head and looking

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.850 
wanted to lower his head and looking
shoe<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:05.940> think<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:07.260> there<00:04:07.470> I'm<00:04:07.620> just

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
shoe and think and there I'm just

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.640 
shoe and think and there I'm just
wiggling<00:04:08.460> my<00:04:08.610> finger<00:04:09.000> on<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.390> saying<00:04:09.650> come

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
wiggling my finger on and saying come

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.580 
wiggling my finger on and saying come
this<00:04:10.890> way<00:04:11.100> weed<00:04:11.960> and<00:04:12.960> what<00:04:13.110> I'm<00:04:13.200> willing<00:04:13.500> to

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
this way weed and what I'm willing to

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.289 
this way weed and what I'm willing to
get<00:04:13.800> from<00:04:14.070> him<00:04:14.250> is<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.450> he's<00:04:16.730> he<00:04:17.730> enjoys<00:04:18.060> the

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.630 
get from him is that he's he enjoys the
game<00:04:18.480> so<00:04:18.810> much<00:04:19.049> that<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.709> don't<00:04:19.980> even<00:04:20.190> have<00:04:20.489> to

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
game so much that I don't even have to

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.790 
game so much that I don't even have to
pull<00:04:20.850> on<00:04:21.030> him<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.570> get<00:04:21.720> him<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:21.989> come<00:04:22.290> over<00:04:22.350> to

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
pull on him to get him to come over to

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.220 
pull on him to get him to come over to
me<00:04:22.860> now<00:04:23.070> -<00:04:23.130> he<00:04:23.490> just<00:04:23.760> wants<00:04:24.480> to<00:04:24.540> do<00:04:24.780> it<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:25.080> earn

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
me now - he just wants to do it to earn

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.110 
me now - he just wants to do it to earn
the<00:04:25.440> treat<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:25.950> he's<00:04:26.400> not<00:04:26.610> really<00:04:26.790> there<00:04:27.090> yet

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
the treat and he's not really there yet

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.270 
the treat and he's not really there yet
but<00:04:27.540> we<00:04:27.660> do<00:04:27.870> keep<00:04:28.080> working<00:04:28.530> on<00:04:28.710> it<00:04:28.740> you'll<00:04:29.040> see

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
but we do keep working on it you'll see

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.940 
but we do keep working on it you'll see
me<00:04:29.430> pull<00:04:29.640> on<00:04:29.760> him<00:04:29.940> less<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.180> less<00:04:30.620> so<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.650> think

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
me pull on him less and less so I think

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.290 
me pull on him less and less so I think
we're<00:04:32.250> up<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.610> about<00:04:34.070> seven<00:04:35.070> strokes<00:04:35.550> maybe<00:04:35.940> on

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
we're up to about seven strokes maybe on

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
we're up to about seven strokes maybe on
this<00:04:36.720> side<00:04:36.960> there<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:37.770> I<00:04:38.550> noticed<00:04:39.480> that<00:04:39.720> at<00:04:39.870> 7

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
this side there and I noticed that at 7

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.140 
this side there and I noticed that at 7
strokes<00:04:40.590> that<00:04:40.860> took<00:04:41.040> him<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.310> lot<00:04:41.520> longer<00:04:41.730> -

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
strokes that took him a lot longer -

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.140 
strokes that took him a lot longer -
Lawrence<00:04:42.600> had<00:04:42.870> it<00:04:43.050> off<00:04:43.200> and<00:04:43.950> right<00:04:44.850> there<00:04:45.030> I'm

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
Lawrence had it off and right there I'm

Lawrence had it off and right there I'm
just<00:04:45.360> waiting<00:04:45.780> for<00:04:45.810> him<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.169> Bob<00:04:47.040> his<00:04:47.340> head

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
down a tiny bit like he's not prepared

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.340 
down a tiny bit like he's not prepared
to<00:04:49.950> a<00:04:49.980> full-on<00:04:50.310> lick<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.150> chew<00:04:51.210> and<00:04:51.840> blow<00:04:52.020> out

to a full-on lick and chew and blow out

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.340 
to a full-on lick and chew and blow out
and<00:04:52.680> really<00:04:53.010> relax<00:04:53.280> Oh<00:04:53.850> a<00:04:53.880> foot<00:04:54.330> like<00:04:54.630> at

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
this stage it surprises that he

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.040 
this stage it surprises that he
Laura's<00:04:59.919> had<00:05:00.250> at<00:05:00.400> all<00:05:00.520> but<00:05:01.240> ultimately

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
Laura's had at all but ultimately

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.050 
Laura's had at all but ultimately
ultimately<00:05:02.560> I'm<00:05:03.159> really<00:05:03.460> looking<00:05:03.819> for

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
ultimately I'm really looking for

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.490 
ultimately I'm really looking for
smaller<00:05:04.330> relaxation<00:05:04.900> which<00:05:05.259> we<00:05:05.379> don't

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
smaller relaxation which we don't

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.309 
smaller relaxation which we don't
achieve<00:05:05.710> this<00:05:06.069> day<00:05:06.370> and<00:05:06.960> I've<00:05:07.960> been<00:05:08.139> working

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:08.319 
achieve this day and I've been working

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.249 
achieve this day and I've been working
with<00:05:08.500> ringing<00:05:09.009> about<00:05:09.879> a<00:05:10.060> month<00:05:10.360> since<00:05:10.720> this

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
with ringing about a month since this

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.070 
with ringing about a month since this
and<00:05:11.740> he<00:05:12.460> still<00:05:12.729> has<00:05:12.909> trouble<00:05:13.120> relaxing<00:05:13.479> all

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
and he still has trouble relaxing all

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.540 
and he still has trouble relaxing all
the<00:05:14.259> way<00:05:14.379> he<00:05:14.560> keeps<00:05:14.740> a<00:05:14.889> lot<00:05:15.039> of<00:05:15.190> tension

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
the way he keeps a lot of tension

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.240 
the way he keeps a lot of tension
particularly<00:05:16.210> in<00:05:16.509> this<00:05:16.690> time<00:05:16.750> in<00:05:17.970> so<00:05:20.250> rands

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
particularly in this time in so rands

attention<00:05:21.729> span<00:05:21.970> is<00:05:22.000> starting<00:05:22.569> to<00:05:22.690> wane<00:05:22.900> it's

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
attention span is starting to wane it's

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.619 
attention span is starting to wane it's
been<00:05:23.409> five<00:05:23.710> in<00:05:23.919> five<00:05:24.430> minutes<00:05:24.819> and<00:05:25.060> that's

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:25.629 
been five in five minutes and that's

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:28.680 
been five in five minutes and that's
pretty<00:05:26.020> common<00:05:26.470> with<00:05:26.650> green<00:05:27.099> horses<00:05:27.610> but<00:05:28.300> he's

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
pretty common with green horses but he's

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.420 
pretty common with green horses but he's
starting<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:29.050> week<00:05:29.259> and<00:05:29.500> shoot<00:05:29.710> so<00:05:30.039> that's

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
starting the week and shoot so that's

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.439 
starting the week and shoot so that's
good<00:05:31.319> basically<00:05:32.319> what<00:05:32.560> happen<00:05:32.919> is<00:05:33.240> when<00:05:34.240> he

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
good basically what happen is when he

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.689 
good basically what happen is when he
started<00:05:34.840> to<00:05:35.050> calm<00:05:35.650> down<00:05:35.740> he<00:05:36.159> didn't<00:05:36.340> have<00:05:36.520> the

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
started to calm down he didn't have the

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.909 
started to calm down he didn't have the
adrenalin<00:05:37.300> keeping<00:05:37.690> him<00:05:37.930> so<00:05:38.199> focused<00:05:38.680> and<00:05:38.830> so

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
adrenalin keeping him so focused and so

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.010 
adrenalin keeping him so focused and so
now<00:05:39.870> he<00:05:40.870> needs<00:05:41.080> a<00:05:41.199> little<00:05:41.440> more<00:05:41.770> motivation

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
now he needs a little more motivation

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.740 
now he needs a little more motivation
and<00:05:44.639> let's<00:05:45.639> see<00:05:45.759> him<00:05:45.909> up<00:05:46.030> on<00:05:46.210> this<00:05:46.330> back<00:05:46.539> I

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
and let's see him up on this back I

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.200 
and let's see him up on this back I
think<00:05:46.990> that<00:05:47.169> was<00:05:47.490> it<00:05:48.490> should<00:05:48.669> have<00:05:48.759> counted<00:05:48.940> it

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
think that was it should have counted it

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.689 
think that was it should have counted it
was<00:05:49.330> about<00:05:49.509> eight<00:05:49.780> strokes<00:05:50.169> and<00:05:50.560> that<00:05:51.550> was<00:05:51.669> a

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
was about eight strokes and that was a

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:53.850 
was about eight strokes and that was a
much<00:05:52.030> better<00:05:52.360> head<00:05:52.659> low<00:05:52.900> at<00:05:53.139> that<00:05:53.169> time<00:05:53.530> so

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
much better head low at that time so

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.089 
much better head low at that time so
he's<00:05:54.190> starting<00:05:54.580> to<00:05:54.639> come<00:05:54.819> around<00:05:54.969> but<00:05:56.099> pretty

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
he's starting to come around but pretty

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:58.210 
he's starting to come around but pretty
soon<00:05:57.219> what<00:05:57.699> I<00:05:57.729> wanted

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
soon what I wanted

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.950 
soon what I wanted
this<00:05:58.700> is<00:05:58.970> is<00:05:59.660> more<00:06:00.530> relaxation
