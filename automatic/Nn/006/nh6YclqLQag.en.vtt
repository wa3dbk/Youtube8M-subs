is<00:04:08.769> an<00:04:09.299> awesome<00:04:10.299> smart<00:04:10.810> walk<00:04:11.019> actually<00:04:11.620> it's

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
is an awesome smart walk actually it's

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.220 
is an awesome smart walk actually it's
an<00:04:11.799> awesome<00:04:11.980> watch<00:04:12.670> I<00:04:13.060> think<00:04:13.750> that<00:04:13.900> approach

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
an awesome watch I think that approach

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.110 
an awesome watch I think that approach
that<00:04:14.470> Motorola<00:04:14.950> decided<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.400> take<00:04:15.579> by<00:04:15.819> making

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
that Motorola decided to take by making

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.569 
that Motorola decided to take by making
it<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.299> watch<00:04:16.539> first<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.260> then<00:04:18.010> moving<00:04:18.310> into

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
it a watch first and then moving into

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.000 
it a watch first and then moving into
the<00:04:18.849> smart<00:04:19.150> capability<00:04:19.660> one<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.229> I<00:04:20.260> like<00:04:20.560> now

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
the smart capability one that I like now

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.700 
the smart capability one that I like now
I<00:04:21.039> know<00:04:21.160> Sam<00:04:21.700> doesn't<00:04:21.729> like<00:04:22.720> that<00:04:23.050> is<00:04:23.289> more<00:04:23.560> of

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
I know Sam doesn't like that is more of

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.129 
I know Sam doesn't like that is more of
a<00:04:23.800> wristband<00:04:24.250> person<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:25.090> in<00:04:25.630> two<00:04:25.810> more<00:04:25.840> the

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
a wristband person and in two more the

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.080 
a wristband person and in two more the
biometric<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:26.950> I<00:04:27.250> like<00:04:27.490> that<00:04:27.700> I<00:04:27.760> like<00:04:27.880> that

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
biometric and I like that I like that

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.150 
biometric and I like that I like that
that's<00:04:28.570> still<00:04:28.840> incorporated<00:04:29.560> here<00:04:29.830> with<00:04:30.070> the

age 24
and<00:05:14.020> i<00:05:14.139> have<00:05:14.439> tested<00:05:14.710> it<00:05:14.979> it<00:05:15.189> has<00:05:15.310> been<00:05:15.550> solid

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
and i have tested it it has been solid

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.360 
and i have tested it it has been solid
battery<00:05:16.210> life<00:05:16.389> now<00:05:16.960> if<00:05:17.080> you<00:05:17.169> put<00:05:17.379> the<00:05:17.530> screen

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
battery life now if you put the screen

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.879 
battery life now if you put the screen
always<00:05:18.669> on<00:05:19.000> it<00:05:19.389> will<00:05:19.569> drain<00:05:19.900> much<00:05:20.199> faster<00:05:20.740> and

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
always on it will drain much faster and

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.950 
always on it will drain much faster and
you<00:05:20.979> get<00:05:21.250> no<00:05:21.550> amounts<00:05:21.969> of<00:05:22.060> battery<00:05:22.300> life<00:05:22.449> about

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
you get no amounts of battery life about

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.339 
you get no amounts of battery life about
12<00:05:23.319> to<00:05:23.560> about<00:05:23.800> 14<00:05:24.729> hours<00:05:24.879> which<00:05:25.810> was<00:05:26.110> some

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
12 to about 14 hours which was some

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.409 
12 to about 14 hours which was some
sites<00:05:26.680> are<00:05:26.830> recorded<00:05:27.340> but<00:05:27.580> you<00:05:28.060> really<00:05:28.270> don't

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
sites are recorded but you really don't

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.899 
sites are recorded but you really don't
need<00:05:28.659> to<00:05:28.719> school<00:05:29.110> on<00:05:29.259> that<00:05:30.129> offer<00:05:30.310> whenever

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909 
need to school on that offer whenever

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.119 
need to school on that offer whenever
notifications<00:05:31.509> come<00:05:31.719> on<00:05:31.930> yes<00:05:32.500> it<00:05:32.650> vibrates

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
notifications come on yes it vibrates

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:35.309 
notifications come on yes it vibrates
then<00:05:33.520> you<00:05:33.639> see<00:05:33.849> the<00:05:34.479> screen<00:05:34.719> comma<00:05:34.900> and<00:05:35.139> things

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
then you see the screen comma and things

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.619 
then you see the screen comma and things
like<00:05:35.409> that<00:05:35.500> so<00:05:35.770> I<00:05:35.800> think<00:05:35.979> on<00:05:36.639> that<00:05:36.699> aspect<00:05:37.270> of

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629 
like that so I think on that aspect of

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.749 
like that so I think on that aspect of
you<00:05:38.560> know<00:05:38.590> I<00:05:38.830> would<00:05:39.009> love<00:05:39.129> to<00:05:39.189> see<00:05:39.460> some<00:05:39.639> more

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
you know I would love to see some more

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:40.980 
you know I would love to see some more
improvements<00:05:40.419> with<00:05:40.599> that<00:05:40.780> especially

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
improvements with that especially

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.709 
improvements with that especially
Android<00:05:41.710> wear<00:05:41.979> and<00:05:42.129> some<00:05:42.280> of<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:42.490> app<00:05:42.729> for

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:43.719 
Android wear and some of the app for

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:45.510 
Android wear and some of the app for
lessons<00:05:44.080> and<00:05:44.289> ideas<00:05:44.680> that<00:05:44.860> we<00:05:44.979> deal<00:05:45.190> with<00:05:45.340> now

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
lessons and ideas that we deal with now

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.830 
lessons and ideas that we deal with now
you<00:05:46.090> could<00:05:46.240> have<00:05:46.330> gone<00:05:46.449> with<00:05:46.509> a<00:05:46.659> bigger

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
you could have gone with a bigger
