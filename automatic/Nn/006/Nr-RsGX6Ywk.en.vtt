potentially dead hard drive in this case

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.379 
potentially dead hard drive in this case
this<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> little<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.340> drive<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.000> came<00:00:12.210> from

a 21 inch

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.010 
a 21 inch
I<00:00:13.740> think<00:00:14.460> it's<00:00:14.549> 21<00:00:14.910> inch<00:00:15.059> maybe<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.389> 24<00:00:15.870> inch

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020

Samsung<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:33.000> all<00:00:33.090> depends<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.480> what<00:00:33.570> was<00:00:33.690> cheap

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
Samsung it all depends on what was cheap

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.799 
Samsung it all depends on what was cheap
at<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.140> time<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.040> being<00:00:35.370> said<00:00:35.430> any<00:00:36.059> kind

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
at the time but that being said any kind

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.420 
at the time but that being said any kind
of<00:00:36.930> brand<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.469> hard<00:00:37.620> drive<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.950> fail<00:00:38.160> and

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
of brand of a hard drive can fail and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.250 
of brand of a hard drive can fail and
any<00:00:38.579> computer<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.570> hard<00:00:39.750> drive<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.960> in

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
any computer that the hard drive is in

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.170 
any computer that the hard drive is in
can<00:00:40.620> fail<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.399> don't<00:00:41.700> think<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:41.969> there's

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
can fail so don't think that there's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.400 
can fail so don't think that there's
anything<00:00:42.390> specific<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.290> that

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
anything specific to this one that

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.619 
anything specific to this one that
causes<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.980> what<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:45.059> done<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.510> I've

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
causes this what I have done is I've

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.900 
causes this what I have done is I've
attached<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> hard<00:00:46.710> drive<00:00:46.950> reader<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
attached it to hard drive reader it's a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.490 
attached it to hard drive reader it's a
little<00:00:48.120> bit<00:00:48.210> easier<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> go<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.989> route<00:00:49.200> than

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
little bit easier to go this route than

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.560 
little bit easier to go this route than
it<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.890> go<00:00:50.039> directly<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.760> plug<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.329> into<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
it is to go directly and plug it into a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.299 
it is to go directly and plug it into a
computer<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.469> easier<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:52.980> plug<00:00:53.219> it

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
computer it's easier to just plug it

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.279 
computer it's easier to just plug it
into<00:00:53.430> one<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.699> these<00:00:53.789> readers<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.420> simulate

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
into one of these readers and simulate

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.380 
into one of these readers and simulate
it<00:00:55.410> being<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.010> computer<00:00:56.460> than<00:00:56.940> actually

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
it being in a computer than actually

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.880 
it being in a computer than actually
going<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.809> plugging<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.410> there<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.649> find

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
going and plugging it in there to find

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.130 
going and plugging it in there to find
them<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.399> fact<00:00:59.550> defective<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.899> over

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
them it is in fact defective so over

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.660 
them it is in fact defective so over
here<00:01:01.379> I've<00:01:01.559> got<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.920> little<00:01:02.039> power<00:01:02.250> switch<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
here I've got a little power switch and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.939 
here I've got a little power switch and
I'm<00:01:02.789> going<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.000> go<00:01:03.059> ahead<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.359> turn<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.080> I

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
I'm going to go ahead and turn on and I

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.140 
I'm going to go ahead and turn on and I
want<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.580> if<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.939> hear<00:01:06.330> this

that as the drive is actually spending
here<00:01:37.900> because<00:01:38.050> it<00:01:38.140> is<00:01:38.260> spinning<00:01:38.620> there's<00:01:39.610> a

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
here because it is spinning there's a

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.340 
here because it is spinning there's a
head<00:01:40.000> there's<00:01:40.360> a<00:01:40.480> piece<00:01:40.690> that<00:01:40.720> comes<00:01:41.020> out<00:01:41.170> from

about<00:01:41.560> here<00:01:41.950> actually<00:01:42.550> it<00:01:42.760> maybe<00:01:42.880> over<00:01:43.120> here

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
about here actually it maybe over here

about here actually it maybe over here
the<00:01:43.450> piece<00:01:43.600> that<00:01:43.750> comes<00:01:43.900> from<00:01:44.050> here<00:01:44.350> that

the piece that comes from here that

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.190 
the piece that comes from here that
actually<00:01:45.280> goes<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:45.880> reads<00:01:46.120> the<00:01:46.780> hard<00:01:46.990> drive

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
actually goes and reads the hard drive

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.540 
actually goes and reads the hard drive
and<00:01:47.380> it<00:01:47.440> moves<00:01:47.650> kind<00:01:47.950> of<00:01:48.040> like<00:01:48.130> my<00:01:48.250> fingers

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
and it moves kind of like my fingers

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.950 
and it moves kind of like my fingers
moving<00:01:48.850> where<00:01:49.000> it<00:01:49.090> will<00:01:49.180> go<00:01:49.270> back<00:01:49.510> and<00:01:49.540> forth

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
moving where it will go back and forth

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.410 
moving where it will go back and forth
across<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.500> drive<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:51.100> find<00:01:51.340> where<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:51.970> starts

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.770 
restart the motor over and over and over

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
to try and find that one part but if it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
can't find it it just sits there and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.610 
can't find it it just sits there and
then<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.540> eventually<00:02:13.690> shuts<00:02:14.230> itself<00:02:14.500> down

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
then it eventually shuts itself down

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.650 
then it eventually shuts itself down
saying<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.370> don't<00:02:15.459> know<00:02:15.670> what's<00:02:15.850> going<00:02:16.060> on<00:02:16.180> but

I can't operate like this so I'm going

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.670 
I can't operate like this so I'm going
to<00:02:18.640> turn<00:02:18.790> myself<00:02:18.970> off<00:02:19.350> I'm<00:02:20.350> going<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.560> go<00:02:20.620> ahead

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
to turn myself off I'm going to go ahead

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.199 
to turn myself off I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:20.830> turn<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.070> off<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.550> I'm<00:02:21.820> going<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:21.970> turn<00:02:22.090> it

and turn it off and I'm going to turn it

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.240 
and turn it off and I'm going to turn it
back<00:02:22.239> on<00:02:22.540> again<00:02:22.570> so<00:02:22.959> we<00:02:23.050> can<00:02:23.080> hear<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.470> so<00:02:23.650> here

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
back on again so we can hear it so here

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:38.640 
is turned off and here we are turned on
you<00:02:29.800> should<00:02:29.830> hear<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.130> spin<00:02:30.400> back<00:02:30.580> up<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.680> then

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.259 

it's<00:02:43.860> almost<00:02:44.069> perfectly<00:02:44.549> rhythmic<00:02:45.030> if<00:02:45.150> you've

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
it's almost perfectly rhythmic if you've

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.929 
it's almost perfectly rhythmic if you've
got<00:02:45.480> any<00:02:45.750> kind<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.439> musical<00:02:46.799> tempo<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.730> know

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
got any kind of musical tempo you know

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.910 
got any kind of musical tempo you know
it<00:02:48.180> rhythmic<00:02:48.659> perfect<00:02:49.079> tempo<00:02:49.379> sounds<00:02:49.769> like

it rhythmic perfect tempo sounds like

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.250 
it rhythmic perfect tempo sounds like
and<00:02:50.129> that<00:02:50.280> was<00:02:50.459> absolutely<00:02:50.700> perfect<00:02:51.260> that's

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
and that was absolutely perfect that's

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.420 
and that was absolutely perfect that's
just<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.560> way<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.799> these<00:02:52.950> work<00:02:53.189> when

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
just the way that these work when

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.679 
just the way that these work when
they're<00:02:53.549> spending<00:02:53.819> up<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.150> speed<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.599> it

won't read it we're kind of dead there's

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.580 
won't read it we're kind of dead there's
some<00:02:57.540> things<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.810> can<00:02:57.959> do<00:02:58.049> with<00:02:58.170> these<00:02:58.260> drives

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
when the parts cool they fit a little

bit differently together if the drive is

bit differently together if the drive is
warm<00:03:16.739> though<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.459> put<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.790> in<00:03:17.940> the

warm though and you put it in the
freezer<00:03:18.269> or<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.989> goes<00:03:19.200> into<00:03:19.409> an<00:03:19.560> environment

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
warm or somewhat cold there's a chance

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.869 
warm or somewhat cold there's a chance
of<00:03:25.019> getting<00:03:25.109> condensation<00:03:26.010> inside<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.639> drive

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
of getting condensation inside the drive

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.780 
of getting condensation inside the drive
and<00:03:27.150> that's<00:03:27.269> very<00:03:27.750> very<00:03:28.170> bad<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:28.859> if<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.609> want

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
and that's very very bad so if you want

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.949 
and that's very very bad so if you want
to<00:03:29.849> do<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.090> make<00:03:30.359> sure<00:03:30.389> that<00:03:30.540> that's<00:03:30.780> the

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
to do that make sure that that's the

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.149 
to do that make sure that that's the
last<00:03:31.170> thing<00:03:31.319> that<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.560> do<00:03:31.680> with<00:03:31.769> this<00:03:31.950> drive

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
last thing that you do with this drive

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.319 
last thing that you do with this drive
because<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.519> may<00:03:32.670> not<00:03:32.849> get<00:03:32.940> anything<00:03:33.120> else

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
because you may not get anything else

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.539 
because you may not get anything else
out<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.750> but<00:03:34.409> in<00:03:34.530> our<00:03:34.650> case<00:03:34.829> I've<00:03:35.190> tried<00:03:35.430> all

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
out of it but in our case I've tried all

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.039 
out of it but in our case I've tried all
the<00:03:35.670> orientations<00:03:36.269> I've<00:03:36.510> tried<00:03:36.750> turning<00:03:36.870> it

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
the orientations I've tried turning it

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.030 
the orientations I've tried turning it
off<00:03:37.139> throwing<00:03:37.319> it<00:03:37.440> on<00:03:37.560> I've<00:03:37.739> tried<00:03:37.920> different

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
off throwing it on I've tried different

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.770 
off throwing it on I've tried different
cables<00:03:38.519> just<00:03:38.609> to<00:03:38.760> make<00:03:38.909> sure<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.150> this<00:03:39.599> guy

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
cables just to make sure and this guy

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.300 
cables just to make sure and this guy
failed<00:03:40.109> when<00:03:40.349> he<00:03:40.470> was<00:03:40.590> inside<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:40.980> Mack

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
failed when he was inside the Mack

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.220 
failed when he was inside the Mack
definitely<00:03:41.879> so<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.480> had<00:03:42.629> to<00:03:42.720> replace<00:03:42.959> him<00:03:43.170> with

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
definitely so I had to replace him with

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.220 
definitely so I had to replace him with
a<00:03:43.290> similar<00:03:43.709> drive<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.280> now<00:03:44.489> he's<00:03:44.700> good<00:03:44.879> to<00:03:44.970> go

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
a similar drive and now he's good to go

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.360 
a similar drive and now he's good to go
but<00:03:46.230> if<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.500> happens<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.099> and<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:47.310> don't

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
but if this happens to you and you don't

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.250 
but if this happens to you and you don't
have<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.549> backup<00:03:47.730> you're<00:03:48.359> pretty<00:03:48.810> much<00:03:48.930> stuck

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
have a backup you're pretty much stuck

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.869 
have a backup you're pretty much stuck
you<00:03:49.530> can<00:03:49.650> send<00:03:49.859> these<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.099> a<00:03:50.129> facility<00:03:50.669> where

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
you can send these to a facility where

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.580 
you can send these to a facility where
they'll<00:03:51.060> go<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.449> actually<00:03:51.569> take<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.379> whole

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
they'll go and actually take this whole

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.199 
they'll go and actually take this whole
cover<00:03:52.829> off<00:03:53.040> take<00:03:53.310> out<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.609> screws<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.150> are

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
cover off take out the screws that are

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.119 
cover off take out the screws that are
in<00:03:54.299> here<00:03:54.599> all<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.870> way<00:03:55.049> around<00:03:55.199> where<00:03:56.010> these

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
in here all the way around where these

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.650 
in here all the way around where these
little<00:03:56.280> black<00:03:56.519> things<00:03:56.760> are<00:03:56.970> they<00:03:57.269> can<00:03:57.419> remove

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
little black things are they can remove

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.900 
little black things are they can remove
the<00:03:57.840> screws<00:03:58.109> and<00:03:58.769> get<00:03:58.980> into<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.310> drive<00:03:59.519> itself

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
the screws and get into the drive itself

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.000 
the screws and get into the drive itself
and<00:04:00.209> hopefully<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.440> do<00:04:01.500> mean<00:04:01.739> hopefully

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
and hopefully and I do mean hopefully

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.189 
and hopefully and I do mean hopefully
get<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.699> data<00:04:02.879> off<00:04:03.090> here<00:04:03.419> it's<00:04:03.930> very

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
get the data off here it's very

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.050 
get the data off here it's very
expensive<00:04:04.530> very<00:04:05.129> time-consuming<00:04:05.459> and

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
expensive very time-consuming and

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.270 
expensive very time-consuming and
usually<00:04:06.959> doesn't<00:04:07.139> work<00:04:07.260> unless<00:04:07.859> you<00:04:08.010> take<00:04:08.160> it

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
usually doesn't work unless you take it

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.039 
usually doesn't work unless you take it
to<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.400> very<00:04:08.669> good<00:04:08.849> facility<00:04:09.359> and<00:04:09.569> even<00:04:09.870> then

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
to a very good facility and even then

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.900 
to a very good facility and even then
you're<00:04:10.410> going<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.560> pay<00:04:10.739> upwards<00:04:10.949> of<00:04:11.340> usually<00:04:11.879> a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
you're going to pay upwards of usually a

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.520 
you're going to pay upwards of usually a
thousand<00:04:12.389> to<00:04:12.449> five<00:04:12.599> thousand<00:04:13.079> dollars<00:04:13.109> to<00:04:13.440> get

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
thousand to five thousand dollars to get

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.890 
thousand to five thousand dollars to get
them<00:04:13.650> data<00:04:13.799> off<00:04:14.030> so<00:04:15.030> make<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.209> backup<00:04:15.449> it's

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
them data off so make a backup it's

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.199 
them data off so make a backup it's
easier<00:04:16.139> that<00:04:16.199> way<00:04:16.500> hope<00:04:17.130> this<00:04:17.280> helps<00:04:17.639> a<00:04:18.090> little

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
easier that way hope this helps a little

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.569 
easier that way hope this helps a little
