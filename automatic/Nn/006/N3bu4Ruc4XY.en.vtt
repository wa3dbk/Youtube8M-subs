she's having a hard time doing is
curling<00:00:45.399> it<00:00:45.489> so<00:00:45.699> we<00:00:45.879> just<00:00:46.090> did<00:00:46.210> a<00:00:46.239> something

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
curling it so we just did a something

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.630 
curling it so we just did a something
that<00:00:46.629> we<00:00:46.840> call<00:00:46.989> a<00:00:47.050> flash<00:00:47.379> wave<00:00:47.680> so<00:00:48.250> I<00:00:48.280> just

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
that we call a flash wave so I just

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.130 
that we call a flash wave so I just
rolled<00:00:48.850> it<00:00:49.000> like<00:00:49.149> a<00:00:49.180> normal<00:00:49.390> perm<00:00:49.780> that<00:00:50.020> we

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
rolled it like a normal perm that we

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.279 
rolled it like a normal perm that we
normally<00:00:50.260> do<00:00:50.649> except<00:00:51.309> um<00:00:51.550> I<00:00:51.910> just<00:00:52.090> dot<00:00:52.719> the

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
normally do except um I just dot the

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:54.990 
normally do except um I just dot the
perm<00:00:53.530> solution<00:00:53.649> on<00:00:54.039> there<00:00:54.250> to<00:00:54.430> retexture<00:00:54.879> eyes

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
perm solution on there to retexture eyes

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.490 
perm solution on there to retexture eyes
it<00:00:55.149> so<00:00:55.300> it's<00:00:55.420> just<00:00:55.539> creating<00:00:56.019> more<00:00:56.050> of<00:00:56.289> a

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
it so it's just creating more of a

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.290 
it so it's just creating more of a
relaxed<00:00:56.920> wave<00:00:57.309> throughout<00:00:57.730> her<00:00:57.820> hair<00:00:58.000> so<00:00:58.210> that

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
relaxed wave throughout her hair so that

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.020 
relaxed wave throughout her hair so that
she'll<00:00:58.539> be<00:00:58.629> able<00:00:58.750> to<00:00:58.989> now<00:00:59.590> she<00:01:00.250> wants<00:01:00.399> to<00:01:00.489> curl

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
she'll be able to now she wants to curl

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.069 
she'll be able to now she wants to curl
oh<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.239> curling<00:01:01.539> iron<00:01:01.600> she's<00:01:01.780> gonna<00:01:01.899> get<00:01:02.019> a
