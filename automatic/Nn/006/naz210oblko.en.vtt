00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
all right so the first thing that we're

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.970 
all right so the first thing that we're
gonna<00:01:00.080> be<00:01:00.200> talking<00:01:00.380> about<00:01:00.410> today<00:01:00.680> is<00:01:00.860> these

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
gonna be talking about today is these

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.160 
gonna be talking about today is these
stats<00:01:01.220> with<00:01:01.430> both<00:01:01.580> the<00:01:01.730> FAA<00:01:02.150> and<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.660> ak-47

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
stats with both the FAA and the ak-47

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.560 
stats with both the FAA and the ak-47
you<00:01:03.590> know<00:01:03.680> I<00:01:03.920> think<00:01:04.220> both<00:01:04.640> weapons<00:01:05.000> are<00:01:05.299> pretty

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
you know I think both weapons are pretty

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.120 
you know I think both weapons are pretty
much<00:01:05.810> kind<00:01:06.049> of<00:01:06.110> fairly<00:01:06.290> matched<00:01:06.590> up<00:01:06.860> they<00:01:07.009> both

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
much kind of fairly matched up they both

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.819 
much kind of fairly matched up they both
have<00:01:07.310> their<00:01:07.460> pros<00:01:07.579> and<00:01:07.939> cons<00:01:08.390> but<00:01:08.689> the<00:01:09.350> ak-47

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829 
have their pros and cons but the ak-47

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:11.230 
have their pros and cons but the ak-47
is<00:01:10.159> definitely<00:01:10.579> known<00:01:10.729> to<00:01:10.850> have<00:01:10.970> its<00:01:11.119> high

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240

be<00:01:29.600> about<00:01:29.780> 3<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.110> 4<00:01:30.290> shots<00:01:30.320> from<00:01:30.680> close<00:01:30.740> range

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
be about 3 to 4 shots from close range

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.850 
be about 3 to 4 shots from close range
and<00:01:31.340> 5<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:32.030> 6<00:01:32.270> from<00:01:32.420> long<00:01:32.630> range<00:01:32.860> unfortunately

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
and 5 to 6 from long range unfortunately

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.920 
and 5 to 6 from long range unfortunately
it<00:01:33.979> has<00:01:34.100> a<00:01:34.130> huge<00:01:34.580> damage<00:01:35.060> drop<00:01:35.330> as<00:01:35.570> you<00:01:35.690> can<00:01:35.780> see

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
it has a huge damage drop as you can see

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.990 
it has a huge damage drop as you can see
but<00:01:36.140> it's<00:01:36.320> not<00:01:36.470> as<00:01:36.620> big<00:01:36.860> as<00:01:37.100> of<00:01:37.490> a<00:01:37.610> difference

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
but it's not as big as of a difference

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.690 
but it's not as big as of a difference
as<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.750> 18:47<00:01:39.590> now<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.040> magazine<00:01:40.400> size<00:01:40.549> on

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
as the 18:47 now the magazine size on

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.450 
as the 18:47 now the magazine size on
the<00:01:40.760> F<00:01:40.880> 80<00:01:41.060> is<00:01:41.330> 40<00:01:41.690> round<00:01:41.900> while<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.170> ak-47<00:01:42.710> has

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
the F 80 is 40 round while the ak-47 has

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.219 
the F 80 is 40 round while the ak-47 has
a<00:01:43.490> magazine<00:01:43.820> size<00:01:44.150> of<00:01:44.360> 30<00:01:44.630> rounds<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.140> it's

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
a magazine size of 30 rounds and it's

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.289 
a magazine size of 30 rounds and it's
kind<00:01:45.409> of<00:01:45.440> odd<00:01:45.680> to<00:01:45.950> see<00:01:46.130> an<00:01:46.549> assault<00:01:46.909> rifle<00:01:46.970> have

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
kind of odd to see an assault rifle have

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.210 
kind of odd to see an assault rifle have
a<00:01:47.330> 40<00:01:47.720> round<00:01:47.900> magazine<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.770> definitely

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
a 40 round magazine so I definitely

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.380 
a 40 round magazine so I definitely
thought<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:49.520> was<00:01:49.700> kind<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:49.880> interesting<00:01:50.299> to

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
thought that was kind of interesting to

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.510 
thought that was kind of interesting to
point<00:01:50.540> out<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.409> may<00:01:51.740> not<00:01:51.920> need<00:01:52.190> you<00:01:52.250> know

point out and you may not need you know

about some of the recoil differences and
you're<00:02:56.030> gonna<00:02:56.180> see<00:02:56.480> where<00:02:57.380> this<00:02:57.530> kind<00:02:57.709> of

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
you're gonna see where this kind of

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.890 
you're gonna see where this kind of
takes<00:02:58.010> place<00:02:58.270> also<00:02:59.270> a<00:02:59.300> quick<00:02:59.630> little<00:02:59.870> thing

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
takes place also a quick little thing

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.000 
takes place also a quick little thing
that<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:00.140> wanted<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.410> fill<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.590> guys<00:03:00.650> in<00:03:00.740> about

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
that I wanted to fill you guys in about

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.350 
that I wanted to fill you guys in about
where<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.280> headshot<00:03:01.640> multipliers<00:03:02.090> with<00:03:02.209> both

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
where the headshot multipliers with both

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.880 
where the headshot multipliers with both
the<00:03:02.480> FAA<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:02.959> ak-47

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
the FAA and the ak-47

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.160 
the FAA and the ak-47
now<00:03:04.190> since<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:04.610> F<00:03:04.790> ad<00:03:05.120> actually<00:03:05.300> lacks<00:03:05.900> a

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
now since the F ad actually lacks a

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.260 
now since the F ad actually lacks a
little<00:03:06.410> bit<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.590> damage<00:03:06.820> what<00:03:07.820> they<00:03:07.940> did<00:03:08.120> was

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
little bit of damage what they did was

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.370 
little bit of damage what they did was
actually<00:03:08.420> increase<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.080> headshot

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
actually increase the headshot

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.410 
actually increase the headshot
multiplier<00:03:09.470> on<00:03:09.890> this<00:03:10.040> weapon<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.430> 1.7<00:03:11.060> times

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
multiplier on this weapon to 1.7 times

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.990 
multiplier on this weapon to 1.7 times
up<00:03:11.690> from<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.260> average<00:03:12.410> 1.4<00:03:13.160> times<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:13.880> the

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
up from the average 1.4 times that the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.699 
up from the average 1.4 times that the
ak-47<00:03:14.420> has<00:03:14.840> so<00:03:15.020> I<00:03:15.050> mean<00:03:15.290> if<00:03:15.410> you're<00:03:15.500> shooting

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
ak-47 has so I mean if you're shooting

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.230 
ak-47 has so I mean if you're shooting
for<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.890> head<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.040> lot<00:03:16.190> guys<00:03:16.400> this<00:03:16.880> may<00:03:17.030> be<00:03:17.209> a

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
for the head a lot guys this may be a

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.300 
for the head a lot guys this may be a
really<00:03:17.510> great<00:03:17.690> benefit<00:03:18.050> all<00:03:18.650> right<00:03:19.070> so<00:03:19.160> next

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
really great benefit all right so next

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.040 
really great benefit all right so next
up<00:03:19.490> we<00:03:19.610> have<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.880> accuracy<00:03:20.300> slash<00:03:20.660> bullet

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
up we have the accuracy slash bullet

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.960 
up we have the accuracy slash bullet
spread<00:03:21.200> test<00:03:21.500> with<00:03:21.650> both<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:21.920> FE<00:03:22.280> D<00:03:22.490> and<00:03:22.700> the

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
spread test with both the FE D and the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.390 
spread test with both the FE D and the
ak-47<00:03:23.570> now<00:03:24.290> as<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:24.470> do<00:03:24.620> note<00:03:24.800> with<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.010> FA<00:03:25.250> D

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
ak-47 now as you do note with the FA D

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.220 
ak-47 now as you do note with the FA D
it<00:03:25.670> does<00:03:25.880> have<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.150> very<00:03:26.420> high<00:03:26.660> rate<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:26.870> fire<00:03:27.050> at

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
it does have a very high rate of fire at

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.199 
it does have a very high rate of fire at
1,000<00:03:27.860> rounds<00:03:27.980> per<00:03:28.220> minute<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:28.580> unfortunately

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
1,000 rounds per minute so unfortunately

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.820 
1,000 rounds per minute so unfortunately
that's<00:03:29.630> gonna<00:03:29.870> increase<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.470> bullet<00:03:30.709> spread

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
that's gonna increase the bullet spread

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.770 
that's gonna increase the bullet spread
but<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:31.160> definitely<00:03:31.670> don't<00:03:31.790> want<00:03:32.060> guys<00:03:32.269> you

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
but you definitely don't want guys you

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.060 
but you definitely don't want guys you
want<00:03:32.959> all<00:03:33.080> of<00:03:33.110> your<00:03:33.260> bullets<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.590> be<00:03:33.680> in<00:03:33.800> one

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
want all of your bullets to be in one

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.699 
want all of your bullets to be in one
compact<00:03:34.550> area<00:03:34.940> just<00:03:35.150> like<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:35.390> ak-47<00:03:36.290> as<00:03:36.440> you

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
compact area just like the ak-47 as you

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.500 
compact area just like the ak-47 as you
can<00:03:36.830> see<00:03:36.950> here<00:03:37.190> so<00:03:37.400> with<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:37.880> comparison<00:03:38.330> on<00:03:38.450> the

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
can see here so with a comparison on the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.090 
can see here so with a comparison on the
left<00:03:38.720> hand<00:03:38.870> side<00:03:39.019> in<00:03:39.200> red<00:03:39.380> we<00:03:39.530> have<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.709> F<00:03:39.860> ad

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
left hand side in red we have the F ad

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.460 
left hand side in red we have the F ad
and<00:03:40.430> in<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.850> right<00:03:41.030> hand<00:03:41.269> side<00:03:41.480> in<00:03:41.720> blue<00:03:41.989> we

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
and in the right hand side in blue we

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.800 
and in the right hand side in blue we
have<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.680> ak-47<00:03:43.280> now<00:03:43.700> with<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:43.970> ak-47<00:03:44.330> it

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
have the ak-47 now with the ak-47 it

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.540 
have the ak-47 now with the ak-47 it
actually<00:03:45.530> has<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.709> very<00:03:46.040> high<00:03:46.250> amount<00:03:46.400> of

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
actually has a very high amount of

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.060 
actually has a very high amount of
recoil<00:03:46.910> so<00:03:47.120> that's<00:03:47.300> why<00:03:47.420> I<00:03:47.480> would<00:03:47.660> recommend

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
recoil so that's why I would recommend

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.710 
recoil so that's why I would recommend
kick-butt<00:03:49.130> entail<00:03:49.550> it<00:03:49.820> does<00:03:50.120> have<00:03:50.330> a<00:03:50.360> kind<00:03:50.630> of

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
kick-butt entail it does have a kind of

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.970 
kick-butt entail it does have a kind of
a<00:03:50.840> smaller<00:03:51.140> bullet<00:03:51.440> spread<00:03:51.590> just<00:03:51.799> due<00:03:51.890> the

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
a smaller bullet spread just due the

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.410 
a smaller bullet spread just due the
fact<00:03:52.100> that<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.430> rate<00:03:52.580> of<00:03:52.610> fires<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:53.000> little

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
fact that the rate of fires a little

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.270 
fact that the rate of fires a little
smaller<00:03:53.690> so<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.530> guns<00:03:54.799> gonna<00:03:54.920> actually<00:03:55.070> gonna

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
smaller so the guns gonna actually gonna

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.280 
smaller so the guns gonna actually gonna
have<00:03:55.430> time<00:03:55.640> to<00:03:55.820> recover<00:03:56.180> in<00:03:56.420> between<00:03:56.750> shots<00:03:57.049> so

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
have time to recover in between shots so

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.530 
have time to recover in between shots so
the<00:03:57.980> ak-47<00:03:58.400> swings<00:03:58.850> so<00:03:59.000> far<00:03:59.180> in<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.330> accuracy

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
the ak-47 swings so far in the accuracy

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.240 
the ak-47 swings so far in the accuracy
category<00:04:00.140> let's<00:04:00.410> get<00:04:00.590> into<00:04:00.860> our<00:04:01.010> next

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
both the ak-47 and the F ad because I do

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.160 
both the ak-47 and the F ad because I do
know<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.090> main<00:04:08.269> benefits<00:04:08.750> of<00:04:08.810> having<00:04:08.959> a

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
and you know at times you can kind of

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.540 
and you know at times you can kind of
throw<00:04:47.630> off<00:04:47.900> your<00:04:47.930> sight<00:04:48.440> so<00:04:48.710> I'll<00:04:49.130> definitely

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
or a holographic with this weapon and

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.970 
or a holographic with this weapon and
that<00:04:53.840> is<00:04:54.020> pretty<00:04:54.230> much<00:04:54.380> a<00:04:54.410> wrap<00:04:54.620> up<00:04:54.770> for<00:04:54.860> the

video guys so I hope you enjoyed it now
my<00:04:57.139> personal<00:04:57.530> opinion<00:04:57.830> on<00:04:57.980> what<00:04:58.160> I<00:04:58.190> think<00:04:58.280> is

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
my personal opinion on what I think is

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.570 
my personal opinion on what I think is
better<00:04:58.610> either<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.180> FAA<00:04:59.540> or<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.110> ak-47<00:05:00.620> so<00:05:01.400> if

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
better either the FAA or the ak-47 so if

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.159 
better either the FAA or the ak-47 so if
I<00:05:01.790> had<00:05:02.000> to<00:05:02.060> choose<00:05:02.210> one<00:05:02.270> I<00:05:02.570> would<00:05:02.720> probably<00:05:02.930> go

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
I had to choose one I would probably go

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.500 
I had to choose one I would probably go
with<00:05:03.200> the<00:05:03.410> ak-47<00:05:03.980> just<00:05:04.790> to<00:05:04.880> the<00:05:04.970> fact<00:05:05.210> that<00:05:05.300> you

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
with the ak-47 just to the fact that you

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.580 
with the ak-47 just to the fact that you
know<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.720> bullet<00:05:05.960> spread<00:05:06.110> is<00:05:06.260> much<00:05:06.380> better

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
know the bullet spread is much better

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.620 
know the bullet spread is much better
and<00:05:06.800> it<00:05:06.919> also<00:05:07.040> has<00:05:07.310> a<00:05:07.340> great<00:05:07.610> damage<00:05:07.850> so<00:05:08.180> with

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
and it also has a great damage so with

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.030 
and it also has a great damage so with
the<00:05:08.720> bullet<00:05:08.990> spread<00:05:09.139> as<00:05:09.380> you<00:05:09.560> do<00:05:09.710> know<00:05:09.860> from

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
the bullet spread as you do know from

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.950 
the bullet spread as you do know from
medium<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.610> long<00:05:10.820> range<00:05:11.000> encounters<00:05:11.360> you're

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
medium and long range encounters you're

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.020 
medium and long range encounters you're
gonna<00:05:12.050> do<00:05:12.229> much<00:05:12.500> better<00:05:12.770> with<00:05:12.950> the<00:05:13.070> ak-47<00:05:13.550> but

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
gonna do much better with the ak-47 but

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.280 
gonna do much better with the ak-47 but
from<00:05:14.180> close<00:05:14.360> range<00:05:14.600> you<00:05:14.720> know<00:05:14.930> but<00:05:15.169> you're

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
from close range you know but you're

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.870 
from close range you know but you're
gonna<00:05:15.440> be<00:05:15.590> pretty<00:05:15.620> up<00:05:15.889> and<00:05:16.010> up<00:05:16.100> with<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.370> FE<00:05:16.700> D

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
gonna be pretty up and up with the FE D

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.490 
gonna be pretty up and up with the FE D
and<00:05:17.120> I<00:05:17.570> don't<00:05:17.630> actually<00:05:17.870> like<00:05:18.080> to<00:05:18.169> know<00:05:18.260> your
