I have seen that I saw a good review in

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.560 
I have seen that I saw a good review in
Walmart<00:05:26.050> but<00:05:26.620> trust<00:05:27.010> me<00:05:27.160> I<00:05:27.460> can't<00:05:28.210> tolerate

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
Walmart but trust me I can't tolerate

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.200 
Walmart but trust me I can't tolerate
the<00:05:28.930> smell<00:05:29.080> but<00:05:29.740> in<00:05:29.919> on<00:05:30.130> the<00:05:30.370> second<00:05:30.850> day<00:05:31.030> I

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
the smell but in on the second day I

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.080 
the smell but in on the second day I
felt<00:05:31.870> like<00:05:32.140> the<00:05:32.410> smell<00:05:32.800> became<00:05:33.490> a<00:05:33.669> little<00:05:33.970> bit

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
felt like the smell became a little bit

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.740 
felt like the smell became a little bit
of<00:05:34.240> light<00:05:34.600> so<00:05:35.560> I<00:05:35.919> think<00:05:36.370> the<00:05:36.550> day<00:05:36.700> by<00:05:36.880> day<00:05:36.940> the

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
of light so I think the day by day the

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.110 
of light so I think the day by day the
smell<00:05:38.020> becomes<00:05:38.410> a<00:05:38.620> little<00:05:38.860> bit<00:05:38.979> of<00:05:39.130> lighter<00:05:39.400> so

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
smell becomes a little bit of lighter so

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.380 
smell becomes a little bit of lighter so
that's<00:05:40.419> a<00:05:40.539> good<00:05:40.660> part<00:05:40.960> for<00:05:41.050> me<00:05:41.410> so<00:05:42.190> now<00:05:42.490> I<00:05:43.240> think

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
that's a good part for me so now I think

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.600 
that's a good part for me so now I think
it's<00:05:43.930> fine

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
it's fine

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.580

beside that and don't spread too much if
you<00:05:47.620> spread<00:05:47.979> too<00:05:48.130> much<00:05:48.280> that<00:05:48.729> will<00:05:48.940> be<00:05:48.970> bad

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240
