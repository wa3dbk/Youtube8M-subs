00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
formation now why is it forming a sport

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.869 
formation now why is it forming a sport
by<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.530> milligram<00:00:44.219> answer<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
by the milligram answer for the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.940 
by the milligram answer for the
microscope<00:00:45.570> that's<00:00:45.989> because<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.620> male

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
microscope that's because the male

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.130 
microscope that's because the male
gametes<00:00:47.550> are<00:00:47.730> smaller<00:00:48.270> than<00:00:48.510> science<00:00:48.960> when

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
gametes are smaller than science when

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.229 
gametes are smaller than science when
compared<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.770> female<00:00:50.160> gamete<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.120> are

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
compared to the female gamete so we are

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.700 
compared to the female gamete so we are
forming<00:00:51.629> my<00:00:51.780> clothes<00:00:52.079> force<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
forming my clothes force and the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.560 
forming my clothes force and the
previous<00:00:53.190> parts<00:00:53.579> are<00:00:53.760> called<00:00:54.030> America's

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
previous parts are called America's

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.090 
previous parts are called America's
potion<00:00:56.180> now<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.660> exactly<00:00:57.899> happens<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.920> this

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
potion now what exactly happens in this

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
potion now what exactly happens in this
process<00:00:59.719> we<00:01:00.719> will<00:01:00.870> differentiate<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:02.039> form

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
process we will differentiate to form

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.020 
process we will differentiate to form
one<00:01:03.120> bigger<00:01:03.719> spoon<00:01:04.049> mother<00:01:04.439> cells<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:05.850> also

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
one bigger spoon mother cells here also

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.780 
one bigger spoon mother cells here also
we<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.930> bigger<00:01:07.530> school<00:01:08.070> mothers<00:01:08.549> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
we have a bigger school mothers and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.640 
we have a bigger school mothers and
mothers<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.299> means<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.840> end<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.500> to

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
mothers a means this end is going to

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.100 
mothers a means this end is going to
produce<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.220> make<00:01:11.520> us<00:01:11.700> force<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> volume

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
produce the make us force so the volume

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.140 
produce the make us force so the volume
which<00:01:13.260> will<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.770> differentiate

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
which will just differentiate

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.390 
which will just differentiate
there<00:01:15.689> will<00:01:15.869> be<00:01:15.900> no<00:01:16.200> cell<00:01:16.409> division<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.130> just

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
there will be no cell division to just

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.490 
there will be no cell division to just
differentiate<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.540> form<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.990> cursed<00:01:19.229> with

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
differentiate to form a cursed with

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.899 
differentiate to form a cursed with
mother<00:01:19.680> self<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.560> here<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.280> look<00:01:23.460> at<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
mother self so here you can look at the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.090 
mother self so here you can look at the
structure<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.869> where<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> biggest<00:01:25.860> form

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
structure so where is the biggest form

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.749 
structure so where is the biggest form
of<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.400> cells<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:29.250> vapors

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
of the cells here you have the vapors

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.319 
of the cells here you have the vapors
for<00:01:30.210> mother<00:01:30.960> strength<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.650> these<00:01:32.640> cells<00:01:33.030> are

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
for mother strength and these cells are

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.460 
for mother strength and these cells are
the<00:01:33.689> new<00:01:33.869> centers<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.420> an<00:01:37.049> even

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
the new centers so this is like an even

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.429 
the new centers so this is like an even
more<00:01:37.650> magnified<00:01:38.369> diagram<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.689> new<00:01:39.869> is

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
more magnified diagram so the new is

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.710 
more magnified diagram so the new is
also<00:01:41.100> bounded<00:01:41.610> by<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.850> useless<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.570> this

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
also bounded by the useless and this

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.749 
also bounded by the useless and this
portion<00:01:43.049> inside<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.890> Umbra<00:01:44.250> either<00:01:44.399> side

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
portion inside is the Umbra either side

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.910 
portion inside is the Umbra either side
right<00:01:46.399> so<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.630> Magus<00:01:48.899> for<00:01:49.380> mother

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
right so this is the Magus for mother

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.160 
right so this is the Magus for mother
center<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.640> Vegas<00:01:51.090> pool<00:01:51.299> minus<00:01:51.689> L<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.020> going

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
center this Vegas pool minus L is going

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.980 
center this Vegas pool minus L is going
to<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.409> deployed<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.909> what<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.299> will<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:54.720> it

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
to be deployed so what we will do it

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.830 
to be deployed so what we will do it
will<00:01:55.200> undergo<00:01:55.649> meiosis<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.210> deployed

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
will undergo meiosis so this is deployed

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.530 
will undergo meiosis so this is deployed
but<00:01:58.409> what<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:58.950> want<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.670> want<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.060> female

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
but what we want we want the female

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.450 
but what we want we want the female
gametes<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> Cabot's<00:02:01.740> are<00:02:01.890> always<00:02:02.250> have

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
gametes and the Cabot's are always have

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.260 
gametes and the Cabot's are always have
thought<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.180> deploy<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.840> have

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
thought so deploy to have

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.510 
thought so deploy to have
reduction<00:02:05.170> division<00:02:05.409> so<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:05.890> will<00:02:06.070> undergo

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
reduction division so it will undergo

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.380 
reduction division so it will undergo
meiosis<00:02:08.039> what<00:02:09.039> will<00:02:09.250> happen<00:02:09.640> that<00:02:09.819> design

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
meiosis what will happen that design

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.770 
meiosis what will happen that design
will<00:02:10.720> be<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.170> four<00:02:11.860> haploid<00:02:12.480> niggas<00:02:13.480> posted

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
will be that four haploid niggas posted

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.170 
will be that four haploid niggas posted
informed<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.370> called<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.730> universal

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
informed so this is called a universal

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.750 
informed so this is called a universal
pick<00:02:16.810> track<00:02:17.080> very<00:02:17.560> similar<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.250> how<00:02:18.489> my

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
pick track very similar to how my

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.460 
pick track very similar to how my
clothes<00:02:19.090> for<00:02:19.330> which<00:02:19.480> an<00:02:19.660> assistant<00:02:20.230> is

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
clothes for which an assistant is

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.100 
clothes for which an assistant is
something<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.730> sort<00:02:21.940> so<00:02:22.269> if<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.540> see<00:02:22.780> here

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
something of the sort so if you see here

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.220 
something of the sort so if you see here
these<00:02:23.739> are<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.130> makers<00:02:24.910> for<00:02:25.239> Diane<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:26.050> this

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
these are the makers for Diane so this

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.040 
these are the makers for Diane so this
was<00:02:26.410> just<00:02:26.709> one<00:02:27.010> set<00:02:27.370> below<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.510> minus<00:02:28.900> s

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
was just one set below that is minus s

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.930 
was just one set below that is minus s
that<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.230> make<00:02:29.500> us<00:02:29.680> poor<00:02:29.890> mother's<00:02:30.250> dead<00:02:30.519> now

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
that is make us poor mother's dead now

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.600 
that is make us poor mother's dead now
I'm<00:02:31.180> using<00:02:31.420> two<00:02:31.870> cells<00:02:32.170> have<00:02:32.500> been<00:02:32.739> formed<00:02:33.190> so

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
I'm using two cells have been formed so

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.160 
I'm using two cells have been formed so
this<00:02:33.819> is<00:02:34.060> known<00:02:34.390> as<00:02:34.709> Vegas<00:02:35.709> for<00:02:36.630> kayak<00:02:37.630> and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
this is known as Vegas for kayak and

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.740 
this is known as Vegas for kayak and
it's<00:02:38.560> diagnosed<00:02:39.160> tombs<00:02:39.489> since<00:02:40.180> make<00:02:40.330> us<00:02:40.540> poor

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
it's diagnosed tombs since make us poor

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.500 
it's diagnosed tombs since make us poor
diet<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.350> gradually<00:02:42.340> gain<00:02:42.610> on<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:42.940> next<00:02:43.269> step

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
diet and gradually gain on the next step

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.390 
diet and gradually gain on the next step
that<00:02:43.690> will<00:02:44.019> be<00:02:44.140> four<00:02:44.470> cells<00:02:44.799> which<00:02:45.040> will<00:02:45.220> be

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
that will be four cells which will be

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.430 
that will be four cells which will be
four<00:02:45.640> one<00:02:46.060> two<00:02:46.989> three<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:48.220> four<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.450> these

four one two three and four and these

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.740 
four one two three and four and these
are<00:02:50.680> called<00:02:51.160> Vegas<00:02:52.120> for<00:02:52.680> entrant<00:02:54.150> okay<00:02:55.150> so

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
are called Vegas for entrant okay so

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.680 
are called Vegas for entrant okay so
here<00:02:55.989> also<00:02:56.340> single<00:02:57.340> meiosis<00:02:57.910> has<00:02:57.940> taken<00:02:58.569> place

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
here also single meiosis has taken place

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.610 
here also single meiosis has taken place
Vegas<00:02:59.560> for<00:02:59.799> mother<00:03:00.069> cell<00:03:00.430> which<00:03:00.730> was<00:03:01.620> delight

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
Vegas for mother cell which was delight

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.080 
Vegas for mother cell which was delight
it<00:03:03.040> underwent

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
it underwent

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.910 
it underwent
meiosis<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:05.940> then<00:03:06.940> for<00:03:07.750> applying<00:03:08.470> cells

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
meiosis and then for applying cells

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.580 
meiosis and then for applying cells
important<00:03:09.730> peaceful<00:03:10.390> blood<00:03:10.840> cells<00:03:11.290> later

important peaceful blood cells later
form<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.700> bigger<00:03:13.150> school<00:03:13.450> take<00:03:13.690> back<00:03:13.930> how

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
form the bigger school take back how

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.590 
form the bigger school take back how
does<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.980> niggas<00:03:15.310> for<00:03:15.519> mother<00:03:15.760> cell<00:03:16.090> want<00:03:16.420> it

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
does the niggas for mother cell want it

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.310 
does the niggas for mother cell want it
was<00:03:16.810> formed<00:03:17.260> from<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.560> view<00:03:18.190> so<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:18.760> will<00:03:19.090> be

was formed from the view so that will be

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.509 
was formed from the view so that will be
differentiated<00:03:20.320> so<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.709> old<00:03:20.920> rule<00:03:21.070> is<00:03:21.310> also

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
what happens to these four niggas push

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.610 
what happens to these four niggas push
which<00:03:29.859> are<00:03:30.040> form<00:03:30.340> Wow<00:03:31.269> these<00:03:31.750> niggas<00:03:32.260> curves

develops<00:03:33.160> into<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.760> female<00:03:34.269> gametophyte

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
develops into the female gametophyte

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.949 
develops into the female gametophyte
should<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.769> see<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.519> will<00:03:36.640> swap<00:03:37.000> all<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.720> sets

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
should you see it will swap all the sets

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.470 
should you see it will swap all the sets
who<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.440> are<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:39.069> form<00:03:39.430> something<00:03:39.790> we<00:03:40.180> gang

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
who you are and form something we gang

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.620 
who you are and form something we gang
what<00:03:40.959> all<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.260> them<00:03:41.590> just<00:03:42.340> try<00:03:42.549> then<00:03:43.359> what

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
what all of them just try then what

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.630 
what all of them just try then what
happens<00:03:44.079> to<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.350> best<00:03:44.560> unit<00:03:44.920> in<00:03:44.950> suppose<00:03:45.370> this

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
happens to the best unit in suppose this

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.030 
happens to the best unit in suppose this
forms<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.120> female<00:03:46.630> gang<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.410> what<00:03:47.590> is<00:03:47.769> going

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
forms the female gang so what is going

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.740 
forms the female gang so what is going
to<00:03:48.069> happen<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.609> the<00:03:48.700> other<00:03:48.880> team<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.450> other

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
to happen to the other team the other

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.039 
to happen to the other team the other
three<00:03:50.470> degenerate<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.730> is<00:03:51.910> they<00:03:52.299> just<00:03:52.569> go

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
three degenerate that is they just go

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.160 
three degenerate that is they just go
off<00:03:53.079> after<00:03:53.410> some<00:03:54.160> time<00:03:54.370> now<00:03:54.819> how<00:03:55.030> that

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
off after some time now how that

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.629 
off after some time now how that
transformation<00:03:56.170> happens<00:03:56.889> will<00:03:57.100> you<00:03:57.130> see<00:03:57.430> that

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
transformation happens will you see that

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.729 
transformation happens will you see that
so<00:03:58.090> they<00:03:58.269> even<00:03:58.420> say<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.079> one<00:03:59.260> of<00:03:59.470> things

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
so they even say the one of things

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:06.319 
so they even say the one of things
develops<00:04:00.340> into<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:00.910> feeling<00:04:01.720> that<00:04:04.829> so<00:04:05.829> let<00:04:06.040> us

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
develops into the feeling that so let us

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.530 
develops into the feeling that so let us
look<00:04:07.329> at<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:08.230> array<00:04:08.739> of<00:04:08.769> sac<00:04:09.280> formation<00:04:10.269> so

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
look at the array of sac formation so

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.509 
look at the array of sac formation so
just<00:04:10.720> now<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:10.900> was<00:04:11.230> talking<00:04:11.410> about<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:12.040> fleeing

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
just now I was talking about the fleeing

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.409 
just now I was talking about the fleeing
gametophyte

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
gametophyte

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:17.280 
gametophyte
so<00:04:14.639> female<00:04:15.639> gametophyte<00:04:16.090> is<00:04:16.479> what<00:04:16.750> you

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
so female gametophyte is what you

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.580 
so female gametophyte is what you
five<00:04:17.830> is<00:04:17.980> the<00:04:18.130> embryo<00:04:18.580> sac<00:04:19.300> so<00:04:19.930> how<00:04:20.170> the<00:04:20.230> embryo

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
five is the embryo sac so how the embryo

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.580 
five is the embryo sac so how the embryo
sac<00:04:21.310> will<00:04:21.700> be<00:04:21.850> one<00:04:22.120> that<00:04:22.420> is<00:04:22.630> what<00:04:22.840> we<00:04:23.080> see<00:04:23.440> now

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
sac will be one that is what we see now

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.820 
sac will be one that is what we see now
in<00:04:24.340> this<00:04:24.520> formation<00:04:25.030> of<00:04:25.330> NIU<00:04:25.780> sac<00:04:26.200> from<00:04:26.710> a

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
in this formation of NIU sac from a

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.820 
in this formation of NIU sac from a
single<00:04:27.490> angles<00:04:27.940> for<00:04:28.210> this<00:04:28.480> room<00:04:28.840> as<00:04:29.020> gurus<00:04:29.560> for

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
single angles for this room as gurus for

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.770 
single angles for this room as gurus for
development<00:04:30.640> so<00:04:31.120> if<00:04:31.180> you<00:04:31.330> look<00:04:31.510> at<00:04:31.660> the

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
development so if you look at the

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.080 
development so if you look at the
previous<00:04:32.020> life<00:04:32.440> surrounded<00:04:33.130> by<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.760> new

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
previous life surrounded by the new

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.720 
previous life surrounded by the new
solar<00:04:34.390> cells<00:04:34.840> there<00:04:35.380> was<00:04:35.560> just<00:04:35.800> one<00:04:36.010> megaspore

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
solar cells there was just one megaspore

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.420 
solar cells there was just one megaspore
that<00:04:37.150> one<00:04:37.390> Vegas<00:04:37.810> for<00:04:38.080> gradually<00:04:38.950> on<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:39.340> the

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
that one Vegas for gradually on to the

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.030 
that one Vegas for gradually on to the
maker<00:04:39.640> school<00:04:40.030> dyad<00:04:40.390> Vegas<00:04:41.080> poor<00:04:41.290> diet<00:04:41.620> formed

the<00:04:42.190> mega<00:04:42.400> sport<00:04:42.790> aircraft

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
the mega sport aircraft

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.190 
the mega sport aircraft
now<00:04:43.720> out<00:04:44.140> of<00:04:44.200> those<00:04:44.920> four<00:04:45.310> vegas<00:04:45.790> force<00:04:46.200> only

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
now out of those four vegas force only

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.350 
now out of those four vegas force only
one<00:04:47.470> will<00:04:48.040> form<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.520> female<00:04:48.910> gametophyte

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
one will form the female gametophyte

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.050 
one will form the female gametophyte
that<00:04:49.750> means<00:04:49.930> that<00:04:50.170> one<00:04:50.440> megaspore<00:04:51.220> will<00:04:51.700> form

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
that means that one megaspore will form

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.660 
that means that one megaspore will form
the<00:04:52.270> embryo<00:04:52.480> sac<00:04:53.110> embryo<00:04:53.650> sac<00:04:53.980> is<00:04:54.190> the<00:04:54.340> female

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
the embryo sac embryo sac is the female

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.820 
the embryo sac embryo sac is the female
gametophyte<00:04:55.120> right<00:04:55.570> so<00:04:56.170> now<00:04:56.290> how<00:04:56.500> this

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
gametophyte right so now how this

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.740 
gametophyte right so now how this
coevolution<00:04:57.100> will<00:04:57.670> take<00:04:57.880> this<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.240> this

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
coevolution will take this and this

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.410 
coevolution will take this and this

develop will go 2-1 score levels to the
Vegas<00:05:08.020> pool<00:05:08.290> so<00:05:08.770> developing<00:05:09.640> from<00:05:09.970> one<00:05:10.480> mega

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
Vegas pool so developing from one mega

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:17.190 
Vegas pool so developing from one mega
store<00:05:11.380> is<00:05:11.560> 400<00:05:12.130> story<00:05:12.610> development<00:05:16.110> so<00:05:17.110> now

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
store is 400 story development so now

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.280 
store is 400 story development so now
that<00:05:17.260> is<00:05:17.620> how<00:05:17.980> exactly<00:05:18.610> this<00:05:18.880> hats<00:05:19.180> so<00:05:20.110> let<00:05:20.260> us

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
that is how exactly this hats so let us

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.440 
that is how exactly this hats so let us
see<00:05:20.590> how<00:05:20.770> exactly<00:05:20.800> this<00:05:21.640> more<00:05:21.910> useful<00:05:22.300> in

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
see how exactly this more useful in

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.960 
see how exactly this more useful in
development<00:05:23.110> takes<00:05:23.410> place<00:05:23.530> now<00:05:24.340> what<00:05:24.550> happens

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
development takes place now what happens

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.000 
development takes place now what happens
is<00:05:25.120> that<00:05:25.300> there<00:05:25.870> were<00:05:26.050> four<00:05:26.380> makers<00:05:26.770> for

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
is that there were four makers for

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.640 
is that there were four makers for
speech<00:05:27.310> waveform<00:05:27.580> right<00:05:28.390> the<00:05:28.870> out<00:05:29.080> of<00:05:29.350> those

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
speech waveform right the out of those

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.370 
speech waveform right the out of those
four<00:05:30.040> only<00:05:30.550> one<00:05:30.760> is<00:05:31.120> going<00:05:31.390> to<00:05:31.480> be<00:05:31.660> functional

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
four only one is going to be functional

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.230 
four only one is going to be functional
so<00:05:32.530> what<00:05:32.680> will<00:05:32.890> happen<00:05:32.920> to<00:05:33.310> the<00:05:33.400> others<00:05:33.760> they

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
so what will happen to the others they

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.570 
so what will happen to the others they
are<00:05:34.390> going<00:05:34.660> to<00:05:34.750> regenerate<00:05:35.500> so<00:05:36.100> the<00:05:36.220> upper

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
are going to regenerate so the upper

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.080 
are going to regenerate so the upper
makers<00:05:36.970> force<00:05:37.270> D<00:05:37.540> generate<00:05:38.340> by<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.400> base<00:05:39.820> and

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
makers force D generate by the base and

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.390 
makers force D generate by the base and
vehicles<00:05:40.510> food<00:05:40.810> is<00:05:41.050> functional<00:05:41.710> and<00:05:41.830> this

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
vehicles food is functional and this

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.910 
vehicles food is functional and this
base<00:05:42.700> base<00:05:43.000> will<00:05:43.240> take<00:05:43.420> us<00:05:43.630> poor<00:05:44.020> develops

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
base base will take us poor develops

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.230 
base base will take us poor develops
into<00:05:45.280> the<00:05:45.670> embryo<00:05:46.450> sac<00:05:47.550> so<00:05:48.550> if<00:05:48.640> you<00:05:48.790> see<00:05:49.030> here

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
into the embryo sac so if you see here

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.840 
into the embryo sac so if you see here
DS<00:05:49.510> where<00:05:49.810> the<00:05:50.020> food<00:05:50.320> which<00:05:50.590> web<00:05:50.830> form<00:05:51.490> for

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
DS where the food which web form for

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.750 
DS where the food which web form for
megaspores<00:05:52.600> so<00:05:52.990> the<00:05:53.170> upper<00:05:53.590> tree<00:05:53.920> clear<00:05:54.520> we're

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
megaspores so the upper tree clear we're

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.980 
megaspores so the upper tree clear we're
all<00:05:56.010> degenerate<00:05:57.010> and<00:05:57.370> the<00:05:58.030> lower<00:05:58.300> one<00:05:58.480> that<00:05:58.840> is

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
all degenerate and the lower one that is

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.310 
all degenerate and the lower one that is
the<00:05:59.140> base<00:05:59.320> and<00:05:59.590> make<00:05:59.770> us<00:05:59.980> pool<00:06:00.280> with<00:06:00.490> them<00:06:00.670> in

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
the base and make us pool with them in

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.990 
the base and make us pool with them in
this<00:06:02.320> space<00:06:02.590> will<00:06:02.830> make<00:06:02.860> us<00:06:03.220> poor<00:06:03.520> with<00:06:03.820> they

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
this space will make us poor with they

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
this space will make us poor with they
can<00:06:04.240> develop<00:06:04.480> into<00:06:04.990> that<00:06:05.350> Empire<00:06:06.100> slack<00:06:07.020> okay

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
can develop into that Empire slack okay

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.590 
can develop into that Empire slack okay
just<00:06:08.830> say<00:06:09.160> it<00:06:09.190> in<00:06:09.940> this<00:06:10.300> case<00:06:10.570> where<00:06:11.350> is<00:06:11.590> your

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
just say it in this case where is your

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.510 
just say it in this case where is your
tip<00:06:13.600> which<00:06:14.080> is<00:06:14.110> the<00:06:14.380> tip<00:06:14.680> and<00:06:14.920> mentions<00:06:15.370> the

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
tip which is the tip and mentions the

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.060 
tip which is the tip and mentions the
base<00:06:15.730> you<00:06:16.300> remember<00:06:16.720> I<00:06:16.750> told<00:06:17.080> you<00:06:17.260> this<00:06:17.590> is<00:06:17.830> how

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
base you remember I told you this is how

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.510 
base you remember I told you this is how
the<00:06:18.130> movie<00:06:19.030> looks<00:06:19.960> like<00:06:20.110> so<00:06:20.620> this<00:06:20.770> is<00:06:21.010> the<00:06:21.280> base

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
the movie looks like so this is the base

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.730 
the movie looks like so this is the base
and<00:06:21.910> this<00:06:21.970> is<00:06:22.450> the<00:06:22.630> tip<00:06:23.350> so<00:06:23.650> in<00:06:23.770> this<00:06:24.040> case

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
and this is the tip so in this case

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.530 
and this is the tip so in this case
this<00:06:24.920> side<00:06:25.190> is<00:06:25.520> your<00:06:25.550> business<00:06:26.180> better<00:06:26.390> than

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
this side is your business better than

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.010 
this side is your business better than
China's<00:06:27.110> all<00:06:27.350> in<00:06:27.530> and<00:06:27.920> the<00:06:28.520> side<00:06:28.790> is<00:06:29.060> the<00:06:29.420> micro

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
China's all in and the side is the micro

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.920 
China's all in and the side is the micro
and<00:06:30.590> so<00:06:31.280> when<00:06:31.430> I<00:06:31.550> say<00:06:31.850> that<00:06:32.090> the<00:06:32.270> bristle<00:06:32.690> maker

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930 
and so when I say that the bristle maker

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.710 
and so when I say that the bristle maker
scores<00:06:33.380> functional<00:06:34.070> that<00:06:34.250> means<00:06:34.490> this<00:06:35.150> niggas

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
scores functional that means this niggas

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.920 
scores functional that means this niggas
food<00:06:36.020> is<00:06:36.200> going<00:06:36.470> to<00:06:36.620> be<00:06:37.000> functional<00:06:38.000> when<00:06:38.840> I

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
food is going to be functional when I

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.050 
food is going to be functional when I
say<00:06:39.110> the<00:06:39.230> upper<00:06:39.470> biggest<00:06:40.160> force<00:06:40.430> degenerate

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
say the upper biggest force degenerate

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.000 
say the upper biggest force degenerate
that<00:06:41.420> means<00:06:41.630> the<00:06:41.810> biggest<00:06:42.200> force<00:06:42.560> which<00:06:42.800> are

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
that means the biggest force which are

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.160 
that means the biggest force which are
towards<00:06:43.550> the<00:06:43.640> tip<00:06:44.060> that<00:06:44.660> is<00:06:44.840> which<00:06:44.990> are

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.170 
towards the tip that is which are

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.560 
towards the tip that is which are
towards<00:06:45.620> the<00:06:45.680> microfiber<00:06:46.430> a<00:06:46.730> so<00:06:47.300> they<00:06:47.450> are

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570 
towards the microfiber a so they are

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.840 
towards the microfiber a so they are
going<00:06:47.780> to<00:06:47.930> be<00:06:48.110> an<00:06:48.350> array<00:06:48.470> and<00:06:48.800> this<00:06:49.310> particular

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:49.850 
going to be an array and this particular

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.020 
going to be an array and this particular
megaspore<00:06:50.630> will<00:06:51.080> form<00:06:51.410> the<00:06:51.620> embryo<00:06:51.890> sac<00:06:52.670> and

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
megaspore will form the embryo sac and

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.450 
megaspore will form the embryo sac and
you<00:06:53.120> already<00:06:53.390> saw<00:06:53.780> what<00:06:53.990> is<00:06:54.140> embryo<00:06:54.500> sac<00:06:54.800> it<00:06:55.220> is

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
you already saw what is embryo sac it is

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.090 
you already saw what is embryo sac it is
like<00:06:55.670> a<00:06:55.940> big<00:06:56.420> sack<00:06:56.840> like<00:06:57.230> structure<00:06:57.740> which<00:06:57.770> is

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
like a big sack like structure which is

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.810 
like a big sack like structure which is
formed

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:58.820
