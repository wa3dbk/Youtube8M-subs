00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
marks on the wing and that's where my cg

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.630 
marks on the wing and that's where my cg
is<00:00:27.020> just<00:00:28.020> in<00:00:28.110> front<00:00:28.259> of<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.380> line<00:00:29.329> yeah<00:00:30.329> so

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
is just in front of the line yeah so

it's nice heavy Aziz so let's maybe that

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:36.920 
it's nice heavy Aziz so let's maybe that
might<00:00:35.820> help<00:00:36.030> eliminate<00:00:36.239> some<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.690> pitch

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
might help eliminate some of the pitch
