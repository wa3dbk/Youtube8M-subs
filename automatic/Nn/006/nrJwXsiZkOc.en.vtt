00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
you know when it pertains to the the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.220 
you know when it pertains to the the
health<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> game<00:00:44.700> as<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> whole<00:00:45.149> but<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
health of the game as a whole but the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.560 
health of the game as a whole but the
Bears<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.620> question<00:00:47.070> should<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.910> Spurs<00:00:48.329> be

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
Bears the question should the Spurs be

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.049 
Bears the question should the Spurs be
allowing<00:00:48.989> Roy<00:00:49.170> Hibbert<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:50.520> work<00:00:50.670> out<00:00:50.910> with

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
allowing Roy Hibbert to work out with

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.880 
allowing Roy Hibbert to work out with
Tim<00:00:51.329> Duncan<00:00:51.780> should<00:00:52.020> they<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:52.199> allowing<00:00:52.739> that

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
Tim Duncan should they be allowing that

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
Tim Duncan should they be allowing that
I<00:00:53.070> mean<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.399> could<00:00:53.610> potentially<00:00:54.059> be<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> team

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
I mean this could potentially be a team

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.689 
I mean this could potentially be a team
that<00:00:55.289> pulls<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.680> together<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.340> see<00:00:56.550> them

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
that pulls it together and you see them

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.310 
that pulls it together and you see them
in<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.879> finals<00:00:57.300> one<00:00:57.480> year<00:00:57.719> or<00:00:57.840> something<00:00:58.020> like

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
in the finals one year or something like

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.599 
in the finals one year or something like
that<00:00:58.379> um<00:00:59.010> are<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.300> Spurs<00:01:00.660> may<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.649> looking<00:01:02.309> at

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
that um are the Spurs may be looking at

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.860 
that um are the Spurs may be looking at
right<00:01:02.789> Hibbert<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> guy<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.600> might<00:01:03.780> want

but I think oh no I think it's good for
Roy<00:01:11.760> Hibbert<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.270> think<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.780> very<00:01:12.840> kind<00:01:13.260> of

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
Roy Hibbert I think it's very kind of

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
Roy Hibbert I think it's very kind of
Tim<00:01:13.740> Duncan's<00:01:14.159> do<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:16.280> you<00:01:17.280> know<00:01:17.400> we'll

he's<00:01:44.610> working<00:01:44.939> out<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.149> them<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.390> don't<00:01:45.540> think

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
he's working out of them I don't think

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.609 
he's working out of them I don't think
we're<00:01:45.810> going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.229> much<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
we're going to see that much of a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.289 
we're going to see that much of a
difference<00:01:46.649> from<00:01:47.220> more<00:01:47.430> ever<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.030> honest

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
difference from more ever to be honest

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.289 
difference from more ever to be honest
with<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.479> because<00:01:49.159> he<00:01:50.159> tends<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> go

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
with you because he tends to like to go

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.039 
with you because he tends to like to go
into<00:01:51.479> his<00:01:51.689> bad<00:01:51.899> habits<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:54.210> seems<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.840> but

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
into his bad habits a it seems like but

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.950 
into his bad habits a it seems like but
uh<00:01:55.110> no<00:01:55.710> maybe<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.219> think<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:57.060> think<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.810> lot

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
uh no maybe I think I think it's a lot

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.539 
uh no maybe I think I think it's a lot
better<00:01:58.140> for<00:01:58.530> him<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.799> working<00:01:59.100> out<00:01:59.159> Duncan

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
better for him to be working out Duncan

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.450 
better for him to be working out Duncan
and<00:02:00.240> his<00:02:00.479> uh<00:02:00.829> for<00:02:01.829> him<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.009> be<00:02:02.070> working<00:02:02.340> out

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
and his uh for him to be working out

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.340 
and his uh for him to be working out
with<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.640> guy<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.939> team<00:02:03.270> because<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:04.229> know

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
with a guy like a team because you know

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.749 
with a guy like a team because you know
it<00:02:04.469> seems<00:02:04.590> like<00:02:04.740> everybody's<00:02:05.250> been<00:02:05.399> going<00:02:05.670> to

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
it seems like everybody's been going to

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.630 
it seems like everybody's been going to
hit<00:02:05.909> came<00:02:06.119> because<00:02:07.110> uh<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.489> think

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
hit came because uh I just I think

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.029 
hit came because uh I just I think
that's<00:02:08.970> bad<00:02:09.500> especially<00:02:10.500> for<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> guy

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
that's bad especially for like a guy

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.440 
that's bad especially for like a guy
like<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.370> white<00:02:11.550> when<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.910> want<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.180> work<00:02:12.300> out

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
like the white when you want to work out

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
like the white when you want to work out
with<00:02:12.510> them<00:02:12.750> because

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
with them because

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.350 
with them because
team<00:02:13.680> was<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.280> know<00:02:14.370> he<00:02:14.550> was<00:02:14.640> you're<00:02:15.120> so

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
team was you know he was you're so

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.770 
team was you know he was you're so
unique<00:02:15.780> being<00:02:16.530> 6<00:02:16.890> 10<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.160> his<00:02:18.000> skill<00:02:18.360> set<00:02:18.390> you

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
unique being 6 10 and his skill set you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.560 
unique being 6 10 and his skill set you
know<00:02:18.900> he<00:02:19.020> can<00:02:19.410> move<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.830> guard<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.570> that's

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
know he can move like a guard and that's

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.910 
know he can move like a guard and that's
not<00:02:21.720> going<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.990> work<00:02:22.020> for<00:02:22.140> everybody<00:02:22.530> so

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
not going to work for everybody so

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.530 
not going to work for everybody so
especially<00:02:23.160> now<00:02:23.520> forgot<00:02:23.850> like<00:02:24.000> Roy<00:02:24.150> Hibbert

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
especially now forgot like Roy Hibbert

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.240 
especially now forgot like Roy Hibbert
so<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.780> think<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.140> makes<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.470> lot<00:02:25.590> more<00:02:25.650> sense<00:02:26.100> for

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
so I think it makes a lot more sense for

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.790 
so I think it makes a lot more sense for
him<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.490> be<00:02:26.610> working<00:02:26.910> on<00:02:27.000> with<00:02:27.120> Tim<00:02:27.300> Duncan

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
him to be working on with Tim Duncan

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.140 
him to be working on with Tim Duncan
obviously<00:02:28.800> Tim<00:02:29.040> Duncan<00:02:29.430> being<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.760> big<00:02:29.910> fun

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
obviously Tim Duncan being the big fun

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.480 
obviously Tim Duncan being the big fun
two<00:02:30.330> fundamental<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.680> know<00:02:31.770> he<00:02:32.190> could<00:02:32.370> teach

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
two fundamental you know he could teach

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.000 
two fundamental you know he could teach
him<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.760> lot<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.750> don't<00:02:34.410> really<00:02:34.530> know<00:02:34.770> why

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
him a lot so I I don't really know why

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.700 
him a lot so I I don't really know why
Tim<00:02:35.400> Duncan<00:02:35.880> wants<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.750> help<00:02:36.930> out<00:02:37.110> Roy<00:02:37.290> Hibbert

out of his mind I me so I mean Tim
Duncan<00:03:27.750> can<00:03:27.900> only<00:03:28.080> help<00:03:28.350> him<00:03:28.530> out<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:29.160> try<00:03:29.519> to

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
Duncan can only help him out and try to

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.030 
Duncan can only help him out and try to
teach<00:03:29.910> him<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.150> intricacies<00:03:31.019> of<00:03:31.050> how<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.500> work

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
teach him the intricacies of how to work

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.380 
teach him the intricacies of how to work
in<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.370> post<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.820> how<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.000> be<00:03:33.330> the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
in the post and how to be the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.110 
in the post and how to be the
double-team<00:03:34.140> properly<00:03:34.769> because<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.580> think<00:03:35.760> the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
double-team properly because I think the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.940 
double-team properly because I think the
guy<00:03:36.269> needs<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.660> lot<00:03:36.870> of<00:03:36.900> work<00:03:37.200> as<00:03:37.470> far<00:03:37.709> as<00:03:37.830> the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
guy needs a lot of work as far as the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.160 
guy needs a lot of work as far as the
postgame<00:03:38.459> those<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.090> how<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.570> not<00:03:39.810> be<00:03:39.989> so

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
postgame those and how to not be so

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.710 
postgame those and how to not be so
afraid<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.709> think<00:03:40.800> Tim<00:03:41.160> Duncan<00:03:41.670> could<00:03:42.570> also

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
afraid so I think Tim Duncan could also

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.380 
afraid so I think Tim Duncan could also
help<00:03:43.410> him<00:03:43.590> out<00:03:43.709> in<00:03:43.950> those<00:03:44.100> ways<00:03:44.370> as<00:03:44.670> well<00:03:44.700> other

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
help him out in those ways as well other

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.090 
help him out in those ways as well other
than<00:03:45.720> this<00:03:45.870> teaching<00:03:46.380> him<00:03:46.500> how<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.650> play<00:03:46.950> the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
than this teaching him how to play the

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.550 
than this teaching him how to play the
game<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.030> mean<00:03:48.450> instead<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.900> running<00:03:49.320> for

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
game so I mean instead of running for

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.710 
game so I mean instead of running for
running<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.519> king<00:03:50.820> which<00:03:51.060> became<00:03:51.480> too

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
running to the king which became too

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.289 
running to the king which became too
much<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:52.140> fad<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:52.650> mean<00:03:53.220> Tim<00:03:53.459> Duncan's<00:03:53.940> also<00:03:54.269> a

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
much of a fad I mean Tim Duncan's also a

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.289 
much of a fad I mean Tim Duncan's also a
great<00:03:54.660> guy<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.320> learn<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.160> stuff<00:03:56.400> room<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:56.970> I

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
great guy to learn the stuff room and I

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.090 
great guy to learn the stuff room and I
think<00:03:57.510> he'll<00:03:57.690> be<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.900> lot<00:03:58.260> it'll<00:03:58.769> be<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.890> lot

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
think he'll be a lot it'll be a lot

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.190 
think he'll be a lot it'll be a lot
easier<00:03:59.370> for<00:03:59.880> players<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.330> follow<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.930> Tim

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
easier for players to follow a Tim

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.650 
easier for players to follow a Tim
Duncan<00:04:01.709> because<00:04:02.549> players<00:04:02.850> don't<00:04:03.209> seem<00:04:03.450> to

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
Duncan because players don't seem to

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.420 
Duncan because players don't seem to
follow<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.140> Kings<00:04:04.410> teachings<00:04:05.010> for<00:04:05.190> some

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
follow the Kings teachings for some

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.420 
follow the Kings teachings for some
reason<00:04:05.880> for<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.959> most<00:04:07.170> part<00:04:07.380> there<00:04:08.100> you<00:04:08.280> don't

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
reason for the most part there you don't

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.340 
reason for the most part there you don't
see<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.850> translate<00:04:09.420> into<00:04:09.570> their<00:04:09.840> game<00:04:10.080> and

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
see it to translate into their game and

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.810 
see it to translate into their game and
following<00:04:10.470> season<00:04:11.130> as<00:04:11.220> much<00:04:11.400> as<00:04:11.519> you<00:04:11.640> would

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
following season as much as you would

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.289 
following season as much as you would
like<00:04:11.959> but<00:04:12.959> I<00:04:12.989> think<00:04:13.640> you<00:04:14.640> guys<00:04:14.790> hit<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.150> nail

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
like but I think you guys hit the nail

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.550 
like but I think you guys hit the nail
on<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.480> head<00:04:15.570> with<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.959> double<00:04:16.320> teams

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
on the head with the double teams

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.550 
on the head with the double teams
because<00:04:17.549> we<00:04:17.700> saw<00:04:18.000> so<00:04:18.299> many<00:04:18.419> times<00:04:18.780> where<00:04:19.169> Roy

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
because we saw so many times where Roy

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.020 
because we saw so many times where Roy
Hibbert<00:04:19.919> gets<00:04:20.010> double-teamed<00:04:20.489> he<00:04:20.850> gets

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
Hibbert gets double-teamed he gets

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.400 
Hibbert gets double-teamed he gets
flustered<00:04:21.330> he<00:04:21.690> ends<00:04:21.900> up<00:04:21.959> turning<00:04:22.169> the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
flustered he ends up turning the

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.920 
flustered he ends up turning the
basketball<00:04:22.620> over<00:04:22.979> or<00:04:23.760> he<00:04:24.330> just<00:04:24.510> kicks<00:04:24.780> the

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
basketball over or he just kicks the

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.360 
basketball over or he just kicks the
basketball<00:04:25.410> out<00:04:25.620> i<00:04:25.650> think<00:04:25.860> that's<00:04:26.190> right

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
basketball out i think that's right

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.260 
basketball out i think that's right
Hibbert's<00:04:26.700> biggest<00:04:27.060> we

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
Hibbert's biggest we

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.689 
Hibbert's biggest we
this<00:04:27.449> as<00:04:27.629> a<00:04:27.660> score<00:04:28.110> is<00:04:28.919> when<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.250> double-team

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
this as a score is when the double-team

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.909 
this as a score is when the double-team
crashes<00:04:30.180> down<00:04:30.360> on<00:04:30.569> him<00:04:30.720> he's<00:04:30.870> not<00:04:31.050> able<00:04:31.620> to

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
crashes down on him he's not able to

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.170 
crashes down on him he's not able to
immediately<00:04:32.099> turn<00:04:32.669> away<00:04:32.819> from<00:04:32.910> the

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
to get flustered by double team so maybe

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:38.839 
to get flustered by double team so maybe
that's<00:04:37.590> one<00:04:37.830> thing<00:04:38.039> we<00:04:38.159> should<00:04:38.250> look<00:04:38.430> for<00:04:38.669> the
