00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
generators and and gainfully a lot of

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.920 
generators and and gainfully a lot of
batteries<00:01:08.640> Winery<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.299> lot<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.600> batteries

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
batteries Winery a lot of batteries

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.060 
batteries Winery a lot of batteries
lying<00:01:10.140> around<00:01:10.380> they<00:01:10.470> didn't<00:01:10.650> knock<00:01:10.770> out<00:01:10.920> all

the generators so clearly we have enough

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.890 
the generators so clearly we have enough
energy<00:01:13.680> left<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:14.700> keep<00:01:14.939> ourselves<00:01:15.210> occupied

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
energy left to keep ourselves occupied

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.480 
energy left to keep ourselves occupied

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
love the realistic explosions in this

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.170 
love the realistic explosions in this
game<00:03:26.989> yeah<00:03:27.290> it's<00:03:28.129> good<00:03:28.370> normally<00:03:28.790> we<00:03:29.030> don't

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
game yeah it's good normally we don't

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.759 
game yeah it's good normally we don't
let<00:03:29.419> what<00:03:29.750> really<00:03:30.019> would<00:03:30.290> happen<00:03:30.650> they

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
let what really would happen they

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.470 
let what really would happen they
wouldn't<00:03:30.949> fall<00:03:31.250> down<00:03:31.280> into<00:03:31.879> the<00:03:32.090> snow<00:03:32.150> they

wouldn't fall down into the snow they

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.759 
wouldn't fall down into the snow they
would<00:03:32.599> just<00:03:32.750> evaporate<00:03:32.989> into<00:03:33.379> thin<00:03:33.439> air

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
would just evaporate into thin air

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:34.959 
would just evaporate into thin air
normally<00:03:34.250> we<00:03:34.340> don't<00:03:34.430> like<00:03:34.609> it<00:03:34.760> when<00:03:34.849> things

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:34.969 
normally we don't like it when things

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:36.490 
normally we don't like it when things
blinking<00:03:35.419> go<00:03:35.569> away<00:03:35.719> but<00:03:35.900> in<00:03:35.959> this<00:03:36.049> game<00:03:36.260> it

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
blinking go away but in this game it

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.379 
blinking go away but in this game it
kind<00:03:36.829> of<00:03:36.859> works<00:03:37.040> for<00:03:37.159> it<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.819> explosions<00:03:38.299> are

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
kind of works for it the explosions are

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:39.490 
kind of works for it the explosions are
grating<00:03:38.719> a<00:03:38.780> faint<00:03:39.019> signal

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
grating a faint signal

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.780 
grating a faint signal
cuz<00:03:39.980> there's<00:03:40.159> kind<00:03:40.310> of<00:03:40.370> like<00:03:40.459> these<00:03:40.579> two

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
cuz there's kind of like these two

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.699 
cuz there's kind of like these two
blocks<00:03:41.120> for<00:03:41.449> the<00:03:41.540> explosion<00:03:41.989> is<00:03:42.139> flash<00:03:42.409> back

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
blocks for the explosion is flash back

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.229 
blocks for the explosion is flash back
and<00:03:42.859> forth<00:03:43.099> to<00:03:43.250> make<00:03:43.370> it<00:03:43.489> look<00:03:43.639> like<00:03:43.760> it's<00:03:44.000> fire
