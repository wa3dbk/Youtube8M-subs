00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:16.130
 my name is johannes b am 36 years 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:18.029
 old and profession controller yes something 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.520
 I have not been for seven years 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.500
 flown and recent experiences 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.020
 Always shake and shake all this 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.520
 he has wobbling and so on 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.680
 not so much a clue about the technology and 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.300
 and that's what it's like 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.160
 inexplicable reasons somehow scared 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.900
 I'm done then I have it 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.269
 was really avoided for seven years 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.870
 I'm camping and everything I'm not 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.989
 more flown 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.809
 I'm just down to earth and if 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.070
 I am up there or I was then 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.960
 told me you actually actually have 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.640
 not so that's natural that 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.690
 that does not really fit and that has 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.360
 I was just scared 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.660
 that's the reason it comes clear I have 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.399
 already determines six flights behind me 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.200
 even to thailand and so on 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.300
 I'm really flown it is 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.300
 then came I can not assign it 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.110
 understanding for me above all 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.569
 in terms of technology so I had 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.190
 he had the expectation that more so 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:17.560
 these these 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.780
 techniques how to calm down and such 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.940
 that help me and and 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.400
 Astonishingly, it was not like that 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.740
 but then more with the pilot 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.350
 to speak because to ask all questions 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.080
 and he really convinced me so 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.610
 That was where I did not expect that 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.530
 So it was finally one 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.470
 Certainly, of course, something 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.290
 tackled did at that time where you did 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.550
 maybe in other situations 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.030
 set back and I think my god 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:52.200
 Boy that means well done and so 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.200
 that in any case with 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.860
 I am also with the expectation 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.960
 that's really cut 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.070
 does and I'm not scared it is 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.390
 do not think so but as a realist you know 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.190
 then it's just a piece 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.429
 work is and you are fine 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.869
 equipped and I would prefer 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.959
 now flown around really 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.440
 try to continue to try and 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.750
 of which he is not totally euphoric though 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.000
 in the end, really with a good one 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.500
 feeling and with the courage of the again 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.500
 tackle as soon as possible
