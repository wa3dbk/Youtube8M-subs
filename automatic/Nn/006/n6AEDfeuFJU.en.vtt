00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:19.640
 whether orroid or apple 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.130

 these birthday and gender can 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.130
 be that this optional does not matter much 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.700
 Since they installed it, they will ask 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.500
 a code and for that they are going to enter the 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.580

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:13.530

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.530
 the gift of my part is worth 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.130
 and once having that 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.570
