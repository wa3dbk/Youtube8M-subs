00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.500
 hallÃ¶chen and servus love all fans 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.630
 Welcome back to the 15th 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.139
 must be imaginings yes today 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.190
 again a jollen and indeed in t 84 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.300
 20 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.340
 yes the original s15 part was here 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.439
 I would like to completely reworked 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.180
 not complete but at least the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.880
 Tires will be improved in any case 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.449
 also be ever the same very 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.030
 make a great impression 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.320
 look at the job 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.690
 there the picture is not perfect 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.300
 free but it looks good 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.670
 located, great for just under 290,000 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.079
 we get 420 ps that's relative 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.649
 cheap 350 euro entertainment costs lock 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.219
 free is the part probably i am 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.449
 I'm not sure how to buy that 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.100
 part then it would probably now 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.390
 turn up in the lok what it does not do 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.439
 so it's flawless of it I go 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.229
 otherwise textures are natural 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.170
 Good, very good the stickers help 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.070
 Machine ring are there every abc seems 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.580
 to be from the same month as the gc 675 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.549
 he makes me very happy 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.860
 that makes me really happy and also these logos 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.240
 are very very high resolution we have 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.159
 unfortunately not a few functions here 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.140
 from the outside the blue is darker 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.020
 could be summarize blue power model 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.280
 I do not think it's blue personally 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.509
 sometimes ugly, I think maybe 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.560
 a tick too gaudy otherwise everything 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.790
 top we have with the button 707 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.009
 we were met the one was and 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.479
 we can now hide nine 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.930
 Fender prefer to show and hide 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.659
 can 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.210
 that looks pretty good too and 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.100
 enter unfortunately we have no ec 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.150
 disturbance that means actually only became 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.670
 the optics changed 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.290
 Added this time feature and one 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.510
 bad function and should you 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:09.890
 steers because of the g8 really strong me 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:13.220
 would like to say that that is relative 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.410
 Fiercely was so distracting would not have 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.240
 otherwise very bad 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.620
 satisfactory the part the only one 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.390
 I feel all is still 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.850
 just that it looks so weird 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.790
 the front axle is so far forward it is 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.590
 just a funny we took here 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.870
 I'm broadening myself right now 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.370
 we thought we already have the axes 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.650
 certainly still a bit further are the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.720
 front because that's what's so funny 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.390
 Looks the tires are too far away 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:43.250
 but if you get in now and the 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.320
 fender fades in it again 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.670
 order 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.900
 I think that makes the fenders 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.250
 when the aerobatics change is that 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.480
 the tire is still a bit further away 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.730
 and that just looks really funny 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.040
 I make the tires out of him because he is 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.780
 also in such a slim is the g8 and 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.550
 that looks real would have to be funny 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.930
 otherwise there is nothing to 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.370
 complain we did not quite have the 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.130
 standard functions again that is allowed 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.519
 Do not forget but everything is flashing and there 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.260
 everything lights up there that's it 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.630
 actually, then again , everyone can 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.110
 case the mod recommend for your fans 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.459
 also for all other 420 ps one should 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.730
 think about it, if you do not like that 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.769
 but in the big yard it grows 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.400
 follow says i would like one 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.900
 make less tick blue or tick 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.000
 same direction blue power who still 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.590
 a lot darker or just normal 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.480
 otherwise leave the version completely 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:42.590
 horny 50 km top speed me 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:46.280
 do not even think 60 or 50 50 said 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.190
 couple of stickers to have horny friends 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.080
 pr mark what unfortunately not for 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.450
 Passau is but somewhere 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.549
 Lower Saxony is a pity I should have 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.090
 thought it would not be papenburg 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.980
 maybe that's it with the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.610
 speculation I'm out for today 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.610
 makes it good
