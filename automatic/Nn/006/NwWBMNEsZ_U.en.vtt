Nightwing in this matchup is the fact

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.460 
Nightwing in this matchup is the fact
that<00:01:32.909> flash<00:01:33.210> rushes<00:01:33.630> down<00:01:33.659> really<00:01:33.960> hard<00:01:34.049> which

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that flash rushes down really hard which

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.810 
that flash rushes down really hard which
is<00:01:34.590> hard<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:34.920> Nightwing<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.280> deal<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
is hard for Nightwing to deal with and

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.539 
is hard for Nightwing to deal with and
he's<00:01:36.479> also<00:01:36.750> very<00:01:36.960> good<00:01:37.829> at<00:01:37.890> beating<00:01:38.340> you

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
he's also very good at beating you

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.330 
he's also very good at beating you
air-to-air<00:01:39.079> like<00:01:40.079> Nightwing's<00:01:40.920> best<00:01:41.159> an

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
air-to-air like Nightwing's best an

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.039 
air-to-air like Nightwing's best an
tires<00:01:41.549> actually<00:01:42.150> did<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.329> jump<00:01:42.570> heavy<00:01:42.810> but

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
tires actually did you jump heavy but

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.420 
tires actually did you jump heavy but
you<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:43.259> those<00:01:43.409> little<00:01:43.500> double<00:01:43.890> kicks<00:01:44.070> that

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
you see those little double kicks that

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.690 
you see those little double kicks that
flash<00:01:44.729> does<00:01:45.000> those<00:01:45.810> are<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.189> worst

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
flash does those are like the worst

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.160 
flash does those are like the worst
thing<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.360> could<00:01:48.479> happen<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.079> as

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
thing that could happen to you as

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.859 
thing that could happen to you as
Nightwing<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.770> they're<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.310> hard<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.149> anti

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
Nightwing like they're so hard to anti

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.859 
Nightwing like they're so hard to anti
air<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:53.100> no<00:01:53.280> chance<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.750> see

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
air that is like no chance and you see

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:55.999 
air that is like no chance and you see
this<00:01:54.990> pressure<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.409> very<00:01:55.590> hard<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.799> deal<00:01:55.979> with

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
this pressure is very hard to deal with

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.649 
this pressure is very hard to deal with
that<00:01:56.250> back<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.880> overhead<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> just

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
that back to that overhead that I just

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.260 
that back to that overhead that I just
did<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.990> actually<00:01:58.710> really<00:01:59.009> good<00:01:59.189> but<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.119> keep

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
did is actually really good but I keep

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.730 
did is actually really good but I keep
dropping<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> combo<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.409> set<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
dropping the combo in this set like I

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.990 
dropping the combo in this set like I
don't<00:02:01.799> even<00:02:01.950> hit<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.250> once<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.610> don't<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.820> what

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
don't even hit it once I don't know what

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.060 
don't even hit it once I don't know what
it<00:02:03.090> was<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:04.140> couldn't<00:02:04.320> do<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.500> safe<00:02:04.799> string

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
it was I just couldn't do it safe string

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.410 
it was I just couldn't do it safe string
into<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> low<00:02:05.490> right<00:02:05.729> there<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.180> went<00:02:06.329> for

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
into a low right there and I went for

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.609 
into a low right there and I went for
the<00:02:06.479> overhead<00:02:06.810> but<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.960> got<00:02:07.079> bought<00:02:07.290> by<00:02:07.320> that

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
the overhead but I got bought by that

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.949 
the overhead but I got bought by that
like<00:02:07.829> upwards<00:02:08.550> kick<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.000> don't<00:02:09.149> even<00:02:09.209> know<00:02:09.390> what

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
like upwards kick I don't even know what

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.130 
like upwards kick I don't even know what

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.940 
torpedo move a lot and I actually know
how<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.870> stop<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.140> right<00:02:22.290> here<00:02:22.439> you<00:02:22.500> do<00:02:22.620> kunai

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
how to stop it right here you do kunai

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.039 
how to stop it right here you do kunai
like<00:02:23.189> that<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.610> also<00:02:24.239> if<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.540> block<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.810> you

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
like that and also if you block it you

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.420 
like that and also if you block it you
can<00:02:25.170> do<00:02:25.260> back<00:02:25.409> to<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.709> punish<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.099> like<00:02:26.280> right

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
can do back to to punish it like right

can do back to to punish it like right
there<00:02:26.780> but<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.989> dropped<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.349> confirm<00:02:28.739> again

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
there but I dropped the confirm again

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.289 
there but I dropped the confirm again
like<00:02:29.370> I'm<00:02:29.489> really<00:02:29.610> sad<00:02:29.849> about<00:02:29.879> that<00:02:30.090> he's

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
like I'm really sad about that he's

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.059 
like I'm really sad about that he's
gonna<00:02:30.390> go<00:02:30.540> for<00:02:30.659> another<00:02:30.750> torpedo<00:02:31.049> and<00:02:31.739> I'm

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
gonna go for another torpedo and I'm

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.339 
gonna go for another torpedo and I'm
gonna<00:02:32.159> hit<00:02:32.280> him<00:02:32.370> with<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.760> air<00:02:33.230> shuriken<00:02:34.230> I

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
gonna hit him with the air shuriken I

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.229 
gonna hit him with the air shuriken I
guess<00:02:34.500> it's<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.709> shuriken<00:02:35.069> batarangs<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:36.030> call

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
guess it's a shuriken batarangs on call

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.720 
guess it's a shuriken batarangs on call
batarangs<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.409> yeah<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.159> mean<00:02:38.189> in<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.519> matchup

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
batarangs so yeah I mean in this matchup

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.280 
batarangs so yeah I mean in this matchup
a<00:02:38.939> lot<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.299> is<00:02:39.480> preventing<00:02:39.959> flash<00:02:40.170> from

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
a lot of it is preventing flash from

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.479 
a lot of it is preventing flash from
getting<00:02:40.530> in<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.829> putting<00:02:40.980> him<00:02:41.069> on<00:02:41.189> his<00:02:41.340> back

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
getting in and putting him on his back

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.009 
getting in and putting him on his back
because<00:02:41.760> flash<00:02:41.970> actually<00:02:42.390> doesn't<00:02:42.689> have<00:02:42.840> any

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
because flash actually doesn't have any

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.229 
because flash actually doesn't have any
safe<00:02:43.349> ways<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.890> get<00:02:44.010> out<00:02:44.129> of<00:02:44.159> pressure<00:02:44.430> he<00:02:45.120> has

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
safe ways to get out of pressure he has

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.430 
safe ways to get out of pressure he has
like<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.480> upward<00:02:45.840> move<00:02:46.049> that<00:02:46.230> he<00:02:46.290> can<00:02:46.409> use

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
like this upward move that he can use

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.770 
like this upward move that he can use
but<00:02:46.859> it's<00:02:47.040> not<00:02:47.190> very<00:02:47.340> good<00:02:47.609> this<00:02:48.239> wager<00:02:48.510> right

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
but it's not very good this wager right

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.720 
but it's not very good this wager right
here<00:02:48.989> was<00:02:49.109> a<00:02:49.139> little<00:02:49.409> early<00:02:49.739> i<00:02:49.769> think<00:02:50.129> but<00:02:50.430> not

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
here was a little early i think but not

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.190 
here was a little early i think but not
a<00:02:50.760> bad<00:02:51.000> idea<00:02:51.030> since<00:02:51.420> he<00:02:51.569> had<00:02:51.659> a<00:02:51.690> lot<00:02:51.870> more<00:02:51.989> meter

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
a bad idea since he had a lot more meter

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.170 
a bad idea since he had a lot more meter
than<00:02:52.409> me<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:53.400> wasn't<00:02:53.700> really<00:02:53.879> that<00:02:54.000> bad

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
than me it wasn't really that bad

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.670 
than me it wasn't really that bad
because<00:02:54.480> i<00:02:54.510> didn't<00:02:54.959> have<00:02:55.079> shit<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:55.349> meet<00:02:55.590> her

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
because i didn't have shit for meet her

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.199 
because i didn't have shit for meet her
and<00:02:55.829> I<00:02:55.920> actually<00:02:56.040> spent<00:02:56.459> some<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:56.849> that<00:02:57.030> it

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
and I actually spent some so that it

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.599 
and I actually spent some so that it
wouldn't<00:02:57.359> be<00:02:57.480> too<00:02:57.659> bad<00:02:57.690> but<00:02:58.430> that's<00:02:59.430> actually

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
wouldn't be too bad but that's actually

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.069 
wouldn't be too bad but that's actually
really<00:02:59.939> good<00:03:00.090> for<00:03:00.299> him<00:03:00.420> because<00:03:00.599> now<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.900> have

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
really good for him because now I have

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.750 
really good for him because now I have
no<00:03:01.319> meter<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.829> I<00:03:01.859> don't<00:03:02.220> really<00:03:02.310> have<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.519> good

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
no meter and I don't really have a good

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.220 
no meter and I don't really have a good
way<00:03:02.879> to<00:03:02.939> get<00:03:03.120> him<00:03:03.180> off<00:03:03.359> me<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:03.750> he's<00:03:03.930> getting

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
way to get him off me so he's getting

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.319 
way to get him off me so he's getting
like<00:03:04.859> free<00:03:05.069> pressure<00:03:05.340> right<00:03:05.549> here<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:05.939> my<00:03:06.030> I'm

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
like free pressure right here and my I'm

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.020

getting<00:03:06.569> fucking<00:03:07.260> destroyed<00:03:07.889> but<00:03:08.670> luckily

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
getting fucking destroyed but luckily

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.379 
getting fucking destroyed but luckily
for<00:03:09.299> me<00:03:09.450> he<00:03:09.480> can't<00:03:09.780> really<00:03:10.019> use<00:03:10.200> any

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
for me he can't really use any

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.490 
for me he can't really use any
interactable<00:03:12.389> offensively<00:03:13.049> which<00:03:13.290> means

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
interactable offensively which means

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.750 
interactable offensively which means
