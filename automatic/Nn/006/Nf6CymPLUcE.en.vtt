00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.830
 heating around the Aussenalster 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.480
 inside alster rattle all bridges and 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.480
 of course you're off 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.660
 Here you can easily forget about fishing 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.220
 if here the mesa zander can know 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.630

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.630

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.450

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.230
 powerfully for a shareholder 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:36.790
 just in the conversation but too shallow 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.790

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.270

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.270

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:12.210

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:12.210
 Lombards bridge cooler 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.380
 unsightly fish 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.380
 clean so it can go back 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.780

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.459

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.440
 canoe basin for this core driver was 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.390

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.400

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.310

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.630
 frosta another ball into the cover 'm 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:55.019
 curious if that works and film the 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.019
 whole history of my skin my back 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.790
 we the people here briefly show what 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.379
 and as is parked in hamburg 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.140
 Here are always quite funny to see 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.140
 because that is really funny 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.380
 1 from better you can not park next 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.380
 it's 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.510
 so people we are here now in such a 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.400
 small spot where you directly the master 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.530
 The lamp can be put on like in the 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.939
 immediately thrown a beautiful was strong 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.569
 After the goods come back again 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.569
 clean 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.690
 he has to beluga 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.439
 so people first day in hamburg for me 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.719
 fished here 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:14.810
 and that was cool on the one hand because 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:18.289
 we really cool little fish nice bar 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.609
 no harm was still good bite 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.660
 a bit puny could have been better 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.250
 but we are still one 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.419
 second terrier or in the second part ever 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.900
 so how come or why 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.270
 is cut by me and I think 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.979
 hopefully something will go there 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.360
 otherwise conclusion relatively cool you have to 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.680
 Stop running a lot 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.410
 made because we have no spots in 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.669
 well known and are now pretty 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.830
 that means it's off now 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.729

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.729
