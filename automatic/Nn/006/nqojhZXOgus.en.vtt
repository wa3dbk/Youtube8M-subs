where to buy ram and what kind of RAM we

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.900 
where to buy ram and what kind of RAM we
can<00:00:09.960> use<00:00:10.139> in<00:00:10.260> our<00:00:10.349> computer<00:00:10.650> now<00:00:10.920> in<00:00:11.130> this<00:00:11.639> step

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
can use in our computer now in this step

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.430 
can use in our computer now in this step
I'll<00:00:12.090> show<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.269> how<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.450> physically<00:00:12.780> install

I'll show you how to physically install

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.410 
I'll show you how to physically install
that<00:00:13.590> ram<00:00:13.799> into<00:00:14.309> our<00:00:14.429> computer<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.089> let's

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
that ram into our computer so let's

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.050 
that ram into our computer so let's
check<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.750> out<00:00:15.839> now<00:00:16.460> you<00:00:17.460> have<00:00:17.609> your<00:00:17.640> stick<00:00:17.940> of

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
check it out now you have your stick of

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.140 
check it out now you have your stick of
ram<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.529> maybe<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.650> have<00:00:19.830> let's<00:00:20.340> say<00:00:20.520> old<00:00:20.850> ram

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
ram and maybe you have let's say old ram

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.670 
ram and maybe you have let's say old ram
you<00:00:21.300> want<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.510> remove<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.050> let's<00:00:22.380> say<00:00:22.500> for

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
a ram you want to make sure you grab it

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.280 
a ram you want to make sure you grab it
from<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> outside<00:00:41.340> edges<00:00:41.780> just<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.110> so

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
from the outside edges just like that so

your<00:00:46.800> ram<00:00:47.809> now<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.559> installation<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.219> ram<00:00:50.399> is

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
your ram now the installation of ram is

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.910 
your ram now the installation of ram is
just<00:00:50.969> as<00:00:51.090> simple<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.530> want<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.770> make<00:00:52.800> sure

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
you get it in the slot here on one side

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.130 
you get it in the slot here on one side
then<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> slot<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> other<00:00:57.420> side<00:00:57.629> so

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
then in the slot on the other side so

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.529 
then in the slot on the other side so
now<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.680> seated<00:00:59.010> we'll<00:00:59.760> push<00:00:59.969> down<00:01:00.210> on

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
one side push down the other side say

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.109 
one side push down the other side say
hear<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.199> click<00:01:04.439> those<00:01:05.159> two<00:01:05.400> arms<00:01:05.760> will<00:01:05.909> go<00:01:06.000> up

hear it click those two arms will go up
and<00:01:06.270> snap<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.290> ram<00:01:07.470> into<00:01:07.680> place<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:09.350> when

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and snap that ram into place and when

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.410 
and snap that ram into place and when
installing<00:01:10.680> ram<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.130> want<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.369> go<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:12.060> rule

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
installing ram you want to go the rule

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.580 
installing ram you want to go the rule
of<00:01:12.450> thumb<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:13.110> you're<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.560> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
of thumb is if you're going to do a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.260 
of thumb is if you're going to do a
single<00:01:13.890> stick<00:01:14.250> which<00:01:14.490> more<00:01:14.729> date<00:01:14.880> more<00:01:15.090> times

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
single stick which more date more times

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.359 
single stick which more date more times
than<00:01:15.420> not<00:01:15.479> you'll<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:15.810> dual<00:01:16.049> sticks<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:17.250> if

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
than not you'll do dual sticks but if

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.590 
than not you'll do dual sticks but if
you're<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.670> install<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.970> single<00:01:18.360> stick

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you're going to install a single stick

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.469 
you're going to install a single stick
you<00:01:18.750> want<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> go<00:01:19.340> closest<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.729> processor

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
you want to go closest to the processor

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.539 
you want to go closest to the processor
for<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.200> first<00:01:22.470> spot<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.860> put<00:01:23.040> your<00:01:23.159> ramen

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
and one other thing guys the reason i

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.670 
and one other thing guys the reason i
have<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.790> wacky<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.420> wristband<00:01:27.930> thing<00:01:28.460> is

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
have is wacky you wristband thing is

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.950 
have is wacky you wristband thing is
because<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.479> electrostatic<00:01:33.479> discharge

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
because it's a electrostatic discharge

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.380 
because it's a electrostatic discharge
wristband<00:01:34.500> because<00:01:35.130> i'm<00:01:35.280> grounded<00:01:35.579> via<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
wristband because i'm grounded via the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.080 
wristband because i'm grounded via the
wristband<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.229> my<00:01:37.350> ESD<00:01:37.740> matt<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> ground<00:01:38.700> so

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
wristband to my ESD matt to a ground so

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.910 
wristband to my ESD matt to a ground so
the<00:01:39.869> reason<00:01:39.990> i<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.560> don't<00:01:40.590> shock

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the reason i have it so you don't shock

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.139 
the reason i have it so you don't shock
your<00:01:41.070> ram<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.460> kill<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.820> or<00:01:41.970> fri<00:01:42.810> your<00:01:42.990> ram<00:01:43.200> so

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
your ram and kill it or fri your ram so
