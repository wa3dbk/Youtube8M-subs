don't know what happened
how<00:02:52.299> long<00:02:52.510> has<00:02:52.659> it<00:02:52.689> been<00:02:52.810> since<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.290> sniffed

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
how long has it been since you sniffed

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.390 
how long has it been since you sniffed
an<00:02:53.739> ass<00:02:55.530> yeah<00:02:56.530> then<00:02:56.890> we're<00:02:57.040> right<00:02:57.159> back<00:02:57.219> where

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
an ass yeah then we're right back where

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.619 
an ass yeah then we're right back where
we<00:02:57.579> started

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
we started

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.470 
we started
so<00:02:59.319> I<00:02:59.590> know<00:03:00.189> if<00:03:00.370> dogs<00:03:00.640> get<00:03:00.819> depressed<00:03:01.180> or<00:03:01.329> not

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
so I know if dogs get depressed or not

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.330 
so I know if dogs get depressed or not
but<00:03:01.750> when<00:03:02.049> you<00:03:02.109> think<00:03:02.349> about<00:03:02.409> it<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.829> proof<00:03:03.129> if

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
but when you think about it the proof if

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.649 
but when you think about it the proof if
you<00:03:03.519> need<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.700> prove<00:03:03.909> that<00:03:04.030> they<00:03:04.180> didn't<00:03:04.540> it

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
you need to prove that they didn't it

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.059 
you need to prove that they didn't it
