00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.549 
what you need video to alter cards I
know<00:00:11.940> there's<00:00:12.120> plenty<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.420> these<00:00:12.570> on<00:00:12.840> youtube

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559

but I've looked at a lot of them and I

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.779 
but I've looked at a lot of them and I
realized<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.890> they're<00:00:17.100> missing<00:00:17.430> like<00:00:17.609> one

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
realized that they're missing like one

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.000 
realized that they're missing like one
crucial<00:00:18.090> point<00:00:18.590> I'll<00:00:19.590> go<00:00:19.740> into<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:19.920> later

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010

the same the way I did that I'll tell
you<00:00:40.350> later<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:40.710> I've<00:00:41.250> did<00:00:41.610> all<00:00:41.730> these<00:00:42.320> um<00:00:43.579> this

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
you later but I've did all these um this

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.459 
you later but I've did all these um this
Neos<00:00:44.960> this<00:00:45.960> hope<00:00:47.570> this<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.989> these<00:00:49.079> two<00:00:49.260> I

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
Neos this hope this one of these two I

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.799 
Neos this hope this one of these two I
did<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.579> thick<00:00:50.879> these<00:00:51.539> kind<00:00:51.780> of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
did with the thick these kind of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.950 
did with the thick these kind of
sharpies<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.059> greater

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
sharpies so it's just for like greater

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.380 
sharpies so it's just for like greater
detail<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> best<00:00:56.430> time<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.910> use<00:00:57.059> them<00:00:57.239> is

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
detail but the best time to use them is

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.520 
detail but the best time to use them is
one<00:00:57.539> like<00:00:58.140> brand<00:00:58.559> new

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.680 

okay<00:01:04.100> see<00:01:04.699> how<00:01:04.760> that<00:01:04.909> point<00:01:05.150> is<00:01:05.210> kind<00:01:05.390> of<00:01:05.540> dull

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
okay see how that point is kind of dull

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.560 
okay see how that point is kind of dull
it's<00:01:06.470> not<00:01:06.619> good<00:01:06.770> to<00:01:06.799> use<00:01:07.070> but<00:01:07.369> if<00:01:07.610> I<00:01:08.330> really

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
it's not good to use but if I really

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.440 
it's not good to use but if I really
sharp<00:01:08.810> which<00:01:08.990> our<00:01:09.140> motions<00:01:09.590> are<00:01:10.119> like<00:01:11.119> those

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
sharp which our motions are like those

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.109 
sharp which our motions are like those
are<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.690> best<00:01:11.840> ones<00:01:11.960> to<00:01:12.170> use<00:01:12.320> now<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:13.850> then

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
are the best ones to use now and then

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.050 
are the best ones to use now and then
for<00:01:14.150> like<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.630> finer<00:01:14.840> detail<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:15.590> just<00:01:16.009> as<00:01:16.190> a

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
for like the finer detail and just as a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.359 
for like the finer detail and just as a
general<00:01:17.270> rule<00:01:17.540> on<00:01:18.080> these<00:01:18.409> hollow<00:01:18.619> cards<00:01:19.159> like

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
general rule on these hollow cards like

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.719 
general rule on these hollow cards like
the<00:01:19.670> plaza<00:01:19.940> fighters<00:01:20.390> use<00:01:21.140> these<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:22.399> ultra

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
the plaza fighters use these the ultra

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.719 
the plaza fighters use these the ultra
fine<00:01:22.909> points<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:25.070> ones<00:01:25.250> that<00:01:25.340> are<00:01:25.490> just<00:01:25.640> like

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
fine points the ones that are just like

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.420 
fine points the ones that are just like
a<00:01:25.759> little<00:01:25.850> stick<00:01:26.149> at<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.360> end<00:01:27.130> that's<00:01:28.130> hard<00:01:28.369> to

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
a little stick at the end that's hard to

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.990 
a little stick at the end that's hard to
do<00:01:28.520> with<00:01:28.640> one<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:29.350> see<00:01:30.350> like<00:01:30.920> that<00:01:30.979> those<00:01:31.880> are

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
do with one and see like that those are

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.840 
do with one and see like that those are
the<00:01:32.030> best<00:01:32.149> kind<00:01:32.390> of<00:01:32.479> use<00:01:32.630> for<00:01:33.290> detail<00:01:33.850> that's

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
the best kind of use for detail that's

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.279 
the best kind of use for detail that's
what<00:01:34.970> I<00:01:35.000> did<00:01:35.180> for<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.390> same<00:01:35.539> time<00:01:35.690> for<00:01:35.990> Goku

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
what I did for the same time for Goku

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.430 
what I did for the same time for Goku
and<00:01:36.679> these<00:01:37.340> hydro<00:01:37.640> get<00:01:37.820> ons<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.390> then<00:01:39.259> this

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
and these hydro get ons and then this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.380 
and these hydro get ons and then this
one<00:01:39.500> was<00:01:40.340> used<00:01:40.550> with<00:01:40.700> one<00:01:40.850> of<00:01:40.970> my<00:01:41.060> favorite

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
one was used with one of my favorite

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.560 
one was used with one of my favorite
star<00:01:41.659> pieces<00:01:42.050> this<00:01:42.440> is<00:01:42.590> like<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.740> paint<00:01:43.100> sharpie
