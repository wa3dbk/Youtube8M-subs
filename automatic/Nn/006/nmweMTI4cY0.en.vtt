all<00:00:02.129> right<00:00:02.280> now<00:00:02.460> that<00:00:02.700> we<00:00:02.820> have<00:00:03.350> measured<00:00:04.350> all

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
all right now that we have measured all

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.680 
all right now that we have measured all
our<00:00:04.830> components<00:00:05.279> for<00:00:05.430> our<00:00:05.460> skimmer<00:00:05.790> it's<00:00:06.509> time

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
our components for our skimmer it's time

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.589 
our components for our skimmer it's time
to<00:00:06.810> cut<00:00:06.960> them<00:00:07.080> out<00:00:07.970> we're<00:00:08.970> going<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.120> start<00:00:09.389> by

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
to cut them out we're going to start by

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.520 
to cut them out we're going to start by
cutting<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.429> lines<00:00:11.429> separating<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.150> body

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
cutting the lines separating the body

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.189 
cutting the lines separating the body
from<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.679> fins<00:00:14.660> very<00:00:15.660> important<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.080> know

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
from the fins very important to know

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.609 
from the fins very important to know
where<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.590> body<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:16.949> fins<00:00:17.160> end<00:00:17.449> and<00:00:18.449> meet<00:00:19.939> the

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
where the body and fins end and meet the

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.349 
where the body and fins end and meet the
baseline<00:00:22.619> was<00:00:22.949> here<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.430> measured<00:00:24.029> up<00:00:24.150> four

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
baseline was here I measured up four

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.950 
baseline was here I measured up four
inches<00:00:24.720> created<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> upper<00:00:25.800> edge<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
inches created the upper edge of the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.290 
inches created the upper edge of the
body<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.550> line<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.970> separates

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
body and that is the line that separates

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.479 
body and that is the line that separates
the<00:00:30.480> body<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.869> fins<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:31.920> had<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.099> cut<00:00:32.279> all

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
the body and fins so we had to cut all

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.310 
the body and fins so we had to cut all
that<00:00:32.700> long<00:00:32.940> line<00:00:33.390> right<00:00:33.750> now<00:00:34.880> Strait<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.030> good

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
that long line right now Strait is good

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.270 
that long line right now Strait is good
Strait<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.410> great<00:00:37.700> so<00:00:38.700> straighter<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.210> better

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
Strait is great so straighter the better

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.520 
Strait is great so straighter the better
double<00:00:41.280> check<00:00:41.340> you're<00:00:41.610> doing<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.850> right<00:00:41.969> line

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
double check you're doing the right line

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.200 
double check you're doing the right line
so<00:00:43.530> once<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.920> cut<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.340> can't<00:00:44.550> uncut<00:00:45.090> it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
so once you cut it you can't uncut it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.959 
so once you cut it you can't uncut it
there's<00:00:45.690> no<00:00:45.840> such<00:00:46.050> thing<00:00:46.320> as<00:00:46.350> pod<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.800> cutting

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:01:00.040 

everything<00:00:50.969> else<00:00:53.000> just

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.210 

pache<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:04.170> substitute<00:01:04.800> you're<00:01:04.949> doing<00:01:05.129> it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
pache you substitute you're doing it

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.740 
pache you substitute you're doing it
right<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> first<00:01:05.670> time

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.260 

there's<00:01:09.750> our<00:01:09.900> fins<00:01:10.610> set<00:01:11.610> those<00:01:11.790> aside<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
there's our fins set those aside for the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.300 
there's our fins set those aside for the
moment<00:01:13.640> there's<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.729> skimmer<00:01:14.970> body<00:01:16.100> I'll<00:01:17.100> do

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
moment there's a skimmer body I'll do

00:01:17.310 --> 00:02:00.010 
moment there's a skimmer body I'll do
baseline<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.400> ends

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.359 

there's<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.140> skimmer<00:02:01.409> body<00:02:03.649> all<00:02:04.649> more<00:02:04.920> cut<00:02:05.189> to

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
there's a skimmer body all more cut to

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.490 
there's a skimmer body all more cut to
make<00:02:05.549> now<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.329> have<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.570> do<00:02:06.689> some<00:02:06.960> spory<00:02:08.030> cut

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
make now we have to do some spory cut

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.150 
make now we have to do some spory cut
pair<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:11.420> slits<00:02:12.420> at<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.080> back<00:02:13.290> end<00:02:13.590> which<00:02:14.040> will

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
pair of slits at the back end which will

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:23.350 
pair of slits at the back end which will
make<00:02:14.340> our<00:02:14.370> rear<00:02:14.700> scoot

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.820 

and<00:02:24.360> she<00:02:24.570> stopped<00:02:24.930> when<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.260> get<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.650> the

and she stopped when you get to the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.350 
and she stopped when you get to the
three<00:02:26.460> inch<00:02:26.610> mark<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.920> fold<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:32.360> same

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
three inch mark the fold is the same

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:42.650 
three inch mark the fold is the same
thing<00:02:33.600> I'm<00:02:33.720> gonna<00:02:33.840> slit

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.340 

now<00:02:43.660> we're<00:02:43.810> going<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.020> score<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:45.580> paper

now we're going to score the paper
scoring<00:02:47.350> means<00:02:47.560> making<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:48.010> light<00:02:48.220> cut<00:02:48.520> to<00:02:48.790> open

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
scoring means making a light cut to open

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:57.380 
scoring means making a light cut to open
the<00:02:49.270> scissors<00:02:51.900> I'm<00:02:52.900> gonna<00:02:53.170> light<00:02:53.350> scratch

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.020 

I<00:02:57.830> say<00:02:58.830> light<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.250> do<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.550> put<00:02:59.700> some<00:02:59.820> pressure

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
I say light you do to put some pressure

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.190 
I say light you do to put some pressure
down<00:03:02.120> that<00:03:03.120> will<00:03:03.380> allow<00:03:04.380> us<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.860> fold<00:03:06.200> very

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
down that will allow us to fold very

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:15.500 
down that will allow us to fold very
easily<00:03:09.410> at<00:03:10.410> corner<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:14.010> same<00:03:14.400> thing<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:15.300> only

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
easily at corner the same thing we only

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.720 
easily at corner the same thing we only
two<00:03:15.690> slits<00:03:16.050> not<00:03:16.770> slits<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.250> little<00:03:17.430> too<00:03:17.520> full

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
two slits not slits a little too full

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:25.619 
two slits not slits a little too full
month

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629

slide the triangle up to the scissors
and<00:03:43.700> then<00:03:43.790> check<00:03:44.060> both<00:03:44.299> ends<00:03:44.660> because

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
and then check both ends because

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.259 
and then check both ends because
remember<00:03:45.200> again<00:03:45.620> once<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.190> cut<00:03:46.370> it<00:03:46.400> you<00:03:47.030> can't

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
remember again once you cut it you can't

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.880 
remember again once you cut it you can't
uncut<00:03:47.810> it

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.080 

so<00:03:51.890> check<00:03:52.190> double<00:03:52.909> check<00:03:53.530> triple<00:03:54.530> check

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
so check double check triple check

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.390 
so check double check triple check
quadruple<00:03:56.090> check<00:03:56.709> have<00:03:57.709> your<00:03:57.890> neighbor<00:03:58.069> check

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
quadruple check have your neighbor check

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.449 
quadruple check have your neighbor check
it<00:03:58.580> never<00:03:59.150> you<00:03:59.209> need<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.420> do<00:03:59.599> you<00:04:00.319> only<00:04:00.530> get<00:04:00.739> one

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
it never you need to do you only get one

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:09.369 
it never you need to do you only get one
chance<00:04:01.720> do<00:04:02.720> it<00:04:02.840> right<00:04:07.720> now<00:04:08.720> we<00:04:08.780> have<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.019> skimmer

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379
