some team Grylls Cascade designs where I

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.200 
some team Grylls Cascade designs where I
show<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.590> little<00:00:37.590> bit<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:38.070> flex<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.550> I'm

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
show you a little bit of flex I I'm

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.940 
show you a little bit of flex I I'm
still<00:00:39.570> breaking<00:00:39.780> everything<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
still breaking everything in so it's a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:54.390 
still breaking everything in so it's a
little<00:00:41.100> scary<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:41.579> me

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:17.490 

which<00:00:55.400> is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:42.660 

I<00:01:38.250> speechless<00:01:39.250> I<00:01:39.550> mean<00:01:40.240> that<00:01:40.650> that's<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:41.920> amps

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
I speechless I mean that that's a amps

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.270 
I speechless I mean that that's a amps
at<00:01:42.820> point<00:01:42.850> seven<00:01:43.390> ohms<00:01:43.750> each<00:01:47.010> not<00:01:48.010> even

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
at point seven ohms each not even

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.249 
at point seven ohms each not even
strapped<00:01:48.700> either<00:01:49.150> that's<00:01:49.420> just<00:01:49.720> dialed<00:01:50.110> in

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
strapped either that's just dialed in

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.920 
strapped either that's just dialed in
with<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.530> DMM<00:01:51.009> for<00:01:51.250> both<00:01:51.479> exactly<00:01:52.479> they<00:01:52.630> like

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
with the DMM for both exactly they like

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.469 
with the DMM for both exactly they like
and<00:01:53.850> that's<00:01:54.850> about<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:57.030> between<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.149> quarter

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
and that's about just between a quarter

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.389 
and that's about just between a quarter
and<00:01:58.600> a<00:01:58.750> half<00:01:58.780> gain<00:01:59.290> on<00:01:59.560> the<00:02:00.720> on<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.960> amps

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
and a half gain on the on the amps

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.850 
and a half gain on the on the amps
wasn't<00:02:03.399> sure<00:02:03.640> exactly<00:02:04.020> how<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.080> voltage<00:02:05.649> was

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
wasn't sure exactly how the voltage was

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.250 
wasn't sure exactly how the voltage was
going<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.130> be<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:10.000> does<00:02:10.420> real<00:02:10.750> well<00:02:10.780> just

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
going to be but it does real well just

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.240 
going to be but it does real well just
three<00:02:11.470> of<00:02:11.560> these<00:02:11.650> battery<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.130> one

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
three of these battery and one

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.100 
three of these battery and one
alternator<00:02:12.610> these<00:02:12.790> answer<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.810> damn

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
alternator these answer so damn

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.280 
alternator these answer so damn
efficiently<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:14.980> funny<00:02:15.220> but<00:02:15.340> it's<00:02:16.330> getting

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
efficiently and funny but it's getting

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.990 
efficiently and funny but it's getting
really<00:02:17.440> good<00:02:17.709> flex<00:02:18.010> as<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.310> can<00:02:18.459> see<00:02:18.640> from<00:02:18.820> the

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
really good flex as you can see from the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.690 
really good flex as you can see from the
door<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.630> mean<00:02:20.290> I'm<00:02:20.830> getting<00:02:21.100> light<00:02:21.400> through

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
door I mean I'm getting light through

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.490 
door I mean I'm getting light through
all<00:02:21.850> these<00:02:22.060> doors<00:02:22.360> when<00:02:22.660> it<00:02:22.810> flexes<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.350> mean

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
all these doors when it flexes I mean

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.710 
all these doors when it flexes I mean
it's<00:02:23.670> I've<00:02:24.670> even<00:02:24.940> looked<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.299> haven't<00:02:25.630> been

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720

it's I've even looked I haven't been
outside<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.200> truck<00:02:26.410> yet<00:02:26.680> simple<00:02:27.190> fact<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:27.670> I

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
outside the truck yet simple fact that I

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.820 
outside the truck yet simple fact that I
got<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.970> keep<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.360> RPMs<00:02:29.350> up<00:02:29.560> for<00:02:29.739> the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
got to keep the RPMs up for the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.220 
got to keep the RPMs up for the
alternator<00:02:30.160> but<00:02:30.549> I<00:02:30.820> mean<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.450> only<00:02:31.480> got<00:02:31.840> my<00:02:31.989> box

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
alternator but I mean I only got my box

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.289 
alternator but I mean I only got my box
bolted<00:02:32.769> on<00:02:32.950> yet<00:02:33.220> I'm<00:02:33.400> seeing<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.060> box

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
bolted on yet I'm seeing that the box

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.890 
bolted on yet I'm seeing that the box
the<00:02:34.570> bottom<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.260> port<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.799> getting<00:02:36.280> a

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the bottom and the port is getting a

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.539 
the bottom and the port is getting a
decent<00:02:37.900> amount<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.530> flex<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.160> I'm<00:02:39.280> going<00:02:39.459> to

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
decent amount of flex so I'm going to

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.100 
decent amount of flex so I'm going to
have<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:41.760> fasten<00:02:42.760> down<00:02:43.120> which<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.570> have<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:44.080> I

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
once we get it all in there be able to

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.620 
once we get it all in there be able to
put<00:02:49.600> these<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:50.410> second<00:02:50.890> alternator<00:02:51.280> be<00:02:52.269> able<00:02:52.480> to

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
put these a second alternator be able to

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:59.030 
put these a second alternator be able to
put<00:02:53.019> this<00:02:53.140> shit<00:02:53.410> up<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:56.340> about<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.579> edge<00:02:57.670> up<00:02:58.390> to

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
put this shit up to about the edge up to

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.759 
put this shit up to about the edge up to
the<00:03:00.329> fifteen<00:03:01.329> point<00:03:01.630> three<00:03:01.720> volts<00:03:04.769> team

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
the fifteen point three volts team

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
to be some serious serious problems as

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.860 
to be some serious serious problems as
far<00:03:16.220> as<00:03:16.400> this<00:03:16.610> truck<00:03:16.880> not<00:03:17.090> wanting<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.450> fuck<00:03:17.660> up

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
far as this truck not wanting to fuck up

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.270 
far as this truck not wanting to fuck up
and<00:03:18.860> fall<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.190> fuck<00:03:19.340> apart

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
and fall the fuck apart

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:30.490 
and fall the fuck apart
I'm<00:03:22.280> more<00:03:23.240> more<00:03:24.020> than<00:03:24.290> happy<00:03:25.070> I<00:03:27.670> would<00:03:28.670> I'm<00:03:29.500> I'm
