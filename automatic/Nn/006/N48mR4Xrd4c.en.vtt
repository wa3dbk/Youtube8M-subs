e3 so far people seem to be embracing it

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.240 
e3 so far people seem to be embracing it
so<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.240> is<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.750> first<00:03:03.960> day<00:03:04.170> obviously<00:03:04.380> I've

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
so this is the first day obviously I've

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.090 
so this is the first day obviously I've
done<00:03:05.670> every<00:03:06.210> three<00:03:06.630> since<00:03:06.900> favor<00:03:07.170> one<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.740> I

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
done every three since favor one and I

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.280 
done every three since favor one and I
think<00:03:08.180> because<00:03:09.180> it's<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.540> third<00:03:09.750> one<00:03:09.990> in<00:03:10.110> the
