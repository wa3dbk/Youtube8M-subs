00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
comic every week and this is the first

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.550

ever Dalek Emperor never was introduced
in<00:05:56.680> the<00:05:56.740> comics<00:05:57.130> because<00:05:57.820> he<00:05:58.210> was<00:05:58.360> the<00:05:58.480> first

Dalek

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
Dalek

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.280 
Dalek
I<00:05:59.820> think<00:06:00.820> he<00:06:01.030> was<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:01.300> first<00:06:01.510> art<00:06:01.780> to<00:06:01.990> be<00:06:02.080> made

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
I think he was the first art to be made

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.420 
I think he was the first art to be made
so<00:06:03.070> he's<00:06:03.460> not<00:06:03.640> special<00:06:04.270> casing<00:06:04.840> this<00:06:05.830> method

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
so he's not special casing this method

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:12.620 
so he's not special casing this method
had<00:06:06.840> some<00:06:07.840> reason<00:06:08.340> and<00:06:10.020> yeah<00:06:11.310> yeah<00:06:12.310> these

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
had some reason and yeah yeah these

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.580 
had some reason and yeah yeah these
seven<00:06:13.630> white<00:06:15.150> yammer<00:06:16.150> I<00:06:16.330> have<00:06:16.810> to<00:06:17.080> count<00:06:17.350> them

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
seven white yammer I have to count them
