00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.550
 ae 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.789
 I ask the Brazilians abroad they will be there 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.769
 and I've prepared a super special program for you from accounts already 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.029
 already 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.080
 I'll talk about this country. 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.330
 that as well as Brazil is also wonderful and I chose to live 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.390
 australia has the majority of the planet in the sixth country in 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.550
 territorial extension losing to russia canada 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.550
 china united states one brazil 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.260
 the mainland is bathed by the Indian Ocean in the new people for the healing of coral 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.730
 its on the Pacific Tasmanian Pill and just as we Brazilians 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.690
 Australians are also passionate about the beach and most of them live nearby. 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.600
 from the sea 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.130
 in today's show I'll show you 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.230
 How are the beaches to redeem with me? 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.730
 one of the best forms of transportation to get at me for those who leave the cet 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.460
 is catching encompasses what we call would do here 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.990
 the ferry that leaves the circulates by ip costs 6 dollars and 50 to go and the same for 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.430
 back and what is worth more is the privileged view said ideli and the 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.590
 your sights during 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.950
 all the way 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.009
 a week and a half ago 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.270
 and you are faced with a large shopping center this is one of the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.270
 facilities you find here 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.480
 beach organization 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.000
 Let's be before beautiful people from all over the world are by these and others 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.520
 reasons 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.520
 that many Brazilians chose me to live 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.939
 here in beautiful mount the cast wants another for that right 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.310
 you find it bigger because they look like ISI 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.770
 besides showing 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.300
 the solubilization and what finds here as parks bathrooms area for 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.519
 kick school and where it starts 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.790
 and most importantly you find out that you can what you can not 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.290
 do here 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.400
 with for example 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.860
 it is forbidden to drink smoking and walk with dogs and a curiosity the famous 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.629
 show custody in brazil 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.799
 It's totally forbidden here. 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.999
 and what also makes the difference in the beaches 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:37.769
 this right 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.230
 to find the famous Australian grills 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.230
 and natural pools like this 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:53.649
 considered one of the main postcards of sidnei dou of the e-bit 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:56.489
 is the most popular beach in the region 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.410
 and certainly one of the favorites 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.719
 of the tourists who come here 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:07.969
 It's about a mile of golden sand. 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:08.590
 side 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.519
 it's party 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.069
 the whole year 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.859
 just like Mary who lives in Bombay does not have to leave the neighborhood to 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.359
 enjoy mind not 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.459
 here you live on the beach 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.579
 with easy access to transport with a fantastic trading structure and 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.889
 Close to everything 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.109
 attracted by all the hype and the beach climate 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.919
 many Brazilians live in kindness 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.819
 ae 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.029

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.190
 April 25 is a holiday 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.510
 national public of australia for a very special reason because here deic 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.490
 which represents an important historical moment in the year 1915 when during 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.409
 the first world war 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.279
 joint forces of Great Britain and the 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:05.329

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:06.589
 Turkey 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:10.929
 to face a bloody battle the majority of votes given to the other 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:13.689

 until now remembered with stops 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.000
 throughout the country and in new zealand despite the negative balance 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.940
 historic passage of pride because for the first time Australians and 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.180
 New Zealanders share the feeling of patriotism 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:37.479
