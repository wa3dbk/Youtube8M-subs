00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:37.670 
double-sided rich reading to me doesn't
really<00:02:16.750> matter<00:02:16.960> either<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:20.880> 12<00:02:27.000> 24<00:02:28.000> 36<00:02:33.630> I

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.180 

just<00:02:38.680> get<00:02:38.800> evidence<00:02:39.250> race<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:40.390> then<00:02:41.200> that's<00:02:41.440> 2

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
just get evidence race and then that's 2

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.730 
just get evidence race and then that's 2
inches<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.450> 38<00:02:44.050> inches<00:02:45.450> with<00:02:46.450> my<00:02:46.959> British

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
inches so 38 inches with my British

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:59.940 
inches so 38 inches with my British
people<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:49.330> is<00:02:50.520> 9<00:02:56.190> 1995<00:02:57.540> centimeters<00:02:58.950> so

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
people that is 9 1995 centimeters so

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.160 
people that is 9 1995 centimeters so
first<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.400> all<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:01.660> put<00:03:01.900> your<00:03:02.380> fabric<00:03:02.980> in

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
first of all you put your fabric in

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.140 
first of all you put your fabric in
through<00:03:05.170> here<00:03:05.490> don't<00:03:06.490> worry<00:03:06.700> about<00:03:06.790> mapping

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
through here don't worry about mapping

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.590 
through here don't worry about mapping
you<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.480> see<00:03:07.660> it<00:03:07.780> here<00:03:09.090> let<00:03:10.090> me<00:03:10.120> get<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.450> the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
you to see it here let me get it the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.660 
you to see it here let me get it the
right<00:03:10.630> way

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
right way

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.960 
right way
excuse<00:03:12.670> me<00:03:13.800> now<00:03:14.800> you're<00:03:15.489> going<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.760> start

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
excuse me now you're going to start

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.759 
excuse me now you're going to start
threading<00:03:16.540> I'm<00:03:16.930> going<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.170> turn<00:03:17.320> it<00:03:17.500> here<00:03:17.620> so

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
threading I'm going to turn it here so

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.259 
threading I'm going to turn it here so
you<00:03:17.830> can<00:03:17.950> see<00:03:18.130> it<00:03:18.220> start<00:03:18.910> threading<00:03:19.060> it

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
you can see it start threading it

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.870 
you can see it start threading it
through<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.570> middle<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:22.680> pretty<00:03:23.850> quite<00:03:24.850> a

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
through the middle so pretty quite a

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.180 
through the middle so pretty quite a
tight<00:03:25.209> loop<00:03:25.920> here<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.510> my<00:03:28.510> loops<00:03:28.950> let<00:03:29.950> me<00:03:30.010> just

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
tight loop here so my loops let me just

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.220 
tight loop here so my loops let me just
get<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.430> through<00:03:30.640> and<00:03:30.820> I'll<00:03:30.880> show<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:31.230> I'm

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
get it through and I'll show you I'm

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.229 
get it through and I'll show you I'm
thinking<00:03:32.680> I<00:03:32.800> do<00:03:33.130> about<00:03:33.280> this<00:03:33.550> size<00:03:33.820> for<00:03:34.180> a

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
thinking I do about this size for a

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.699 
thinking I do about this size for a
little<00:03:34.450> girl<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.720> think<00:03:34.989> that's<00:03:35.110> about<00:03:35.230> size<00:03:35.500> if

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
little girl I think that's about size if

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.530 
little girl I think that's about size if
you're<00:03:35.830> doing<00:03:35.920> it<00:03:36.070> for<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.640> then<00:03:37.000> go<00:03:37.450> ahead

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
you're doing it for you then go ahead

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.650 
you're doing it for you then go ahead
and<00:03:37.660> make<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.989> little<00:03:38.140> bigger<00:03:39.660> then<00:03:42.660> again

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
and make it a little bigger then again

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.940 
and make it a little bigger then again
just<00:03:44.280> go<00:03:45.280> back<00:03:45.489> and<00:03:45.700> forth<00:03:45.940> sort<00:03:46.630> of<00:03:46.840> let<00:03:47.830> me

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
just go back and forth sort of let me

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.590 
just go back and forth sort of let me
show<00:03:47.980> you<00:03:48.190> from<00:03:48.370> above<00:03:48.670> sorry<00:03:49.150> what<00:03:49.450> you're

show you from above sorry what you're

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.759 
show you from above sorry what you're
going<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.230> start<00:03:50.500> looping<00:03:50.739> over<00:03:52.470> or<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:53.590> just

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
going to start looping over or you just

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.840 
going to start looping over or you just
find<00:03:54.550> easier<00:03:54.880> just<00:03:55.030> to<00:03:55.180> keep<00:03:55.510> twisting<00:03:56.850> the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
find easier just to keep twisting the

and<00:04:00.030> just<00:04:00.240> try<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.510> keep<00:04:00.780> not<00:04:01.020> to<00:04:01.200> pull<00:04:02.030> so

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
and just try and keep not to pull so

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.880 
and just try and keep not to pull so
much<00:04:03.210> we<00:04:03.390> need<00:04:03.540> go<00:04:03.630> through<00:04:03.930> because<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.650> the

much we need go through because of the

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.320 
much we need go through because of the
lies<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.750> your<00:04:06.750> loops<00:04:07.020> will<00:04:07.230> suffer<00:04:07.560> braces

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
lies and your loops will suffer braces

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.780 
lies and your loops will suffer braces
they<00:04:09.330> will<00:04:09.540> start<00:04:09.990> to<00:04:10.130> get<00:04:11.130> inconsistent

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
they will start to get inconsistent

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.660 
they will start to get inconsistent
sighs<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.270> then<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:15.049> push<00:04:16.049> down<00:04:16.430> when<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.549> get

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
sighs and then you push down when it get

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.180 
sighs and then you push down when it get
starts<00:04:18.000> get<00:04:18.150> too<00:04:18.330> high<00:04:21.049> for<00:04:22.049> people<00:04:22.080> and<00:04:22.920> you

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
starts get too high for people and you

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.580 
starts get too high for people and you
elect<00:04:23.910> if<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:24.690> want<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.080> pad<00:04:25.200> ever<00:04:25.380> I'm<00:04:25.560> not

thing now when you're finished see I

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.810 
thing now when you're finished see I
have<00:04:39.660> three<00:04:39.900> loops<00:04:40.050> here<00:04:40.460> you<00:04:41.460> pull<00:04:42.320> this

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
have three loops here you pull this

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.380 
have three loops here you pull this
string<00:04:44.820> over<00:04:45.920> while<00:04:46.920> kind<00:04:47.460> of<00:04:47.580> lifting<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.330> up

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
string over while kind of lifting it up

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.850 
string over while kind of lifting it up
at<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.570> same<00:04:48.750> time<00:04:48.900> it's<00:04:49.320> kind<00:04:49.530> of<00:04:49.560> hard<00:04:49.740> to

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
at the same time it's kind of hard to

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.750 
at the same time it's kind of hard to
explain<00:04:49.920> but<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:51.390> want<00:04:51.600> to<00:04:51.750> pull<00:04:52.560> up<00:04:52.590> hold<00:04:53.310> the

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
explain but you want to pull up hold the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.540 
explain but you want to pull up hold the
loop<00:04:54.620> and<00:04:55.620> see<00:04:56.010> how<00:04:56.250> you're<00:04:56.460> getting<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:59.280> sort

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
loop and see how you're getting the sort

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.930 
loop and see how you're getting the sort
of<00:05:00.470> CIA<00:05:01.470> in<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.860> bow<00:05:02.130> shape<00:05:04.070> fall<00:05:05.070> over<00:05:05.700> and

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
of CIA in the bow shape fall over and

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.250 
of CIA in the bow shape fall over and
over<00:05:06.480> keep<00:05:06.720> looping<00:05:06.990> I<00:05:07.470> leave<00:05:08.250> about<00:05:08.520> twice<00:05:08.820> I

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
over keep looping I leave about twice I

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
over keep looping I leave about twice I
play<00:05:10.260> with<00:05:10.380> my<00:05:10.440> bows<00:05:10.800> my<00:05:11.760> long<00:05:11.910> loops<00:05:13.010> so<00:05:14.010> I<00:05:14.040> can

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
play with my bows my long loops so I can

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:22.920 
play with my bows my long loops so I can
get<00:05:14.430> a<00:05:14.460> good<00:05:15.230> estimate

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.980 

okay<00:05:23.949> so<00:05:24.949> here<00:05:25.330> I'm<00:05:26.330> just<00:05:26.389> gonna<00:05:26.600> make<00:05:26.810> a

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
okay so here I'm just gonna make a

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.670
