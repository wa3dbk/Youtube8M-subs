way to get to where it is that wherever

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.810 
way to get to where it is that wherever
you<00:02:36.830> need<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:36.950> go<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.160> just<00:02:37.310> have<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.610> kind<00:02:37.790> of

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
you need to go you just have to kind of

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.509 
you need to go you just have to kind of
go<00:02:38.060> for<00:02:38.270> it<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.420> see<00:02:38.540> what<00:02:38.660> happens<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:40.340> you

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
go for it and see what happens and you

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.770 
go for it and see what happens and you
were<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.700> only<00:02:40.850> one<00:02:41.060> up<00:02:41.209> there<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:41.420> was

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
were the only one up there that was

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.120 
were the only one up there that was
technically<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.410> they<00:02:42.620> technically

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
technically that they technically

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.530 
technically that they technically
trained<00:02:43.489> answer<00:02:43.880> a<00:02:43.910> lot<00:02:44.090> of<00:02:44.150> people<00:02:44.330> didn't

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
trained answer a lot of people didn't

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.870 
trained answer a lot of people didn't
know<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:45.459> think<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.489> lot<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.700> people

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
know that I think a lot of people

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.000 
know that I think a lot of people
wouldn't<00:02:47.000> really<00:02:47.630> talk<00:02:47.810> about<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:48.170> because

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
wouldn't really talk about it because

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.199 
wouldn't really talk about it because
it's<00:02:49.130> kind<00:02:49.190> of<00:02:49.310> weird<00:02:49.519> that<00:02:49.730> like<00:02:49.880> I<00:02:50.000> used<00:02:50.150> to

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
it's kind of weird that like I used to

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.199 
it's kind of weird that like I used to
wear<00:02:50.390> tights<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:54.550> you<00:02:55.550> wouldn't<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:56.000> want<00:02:56.150> to

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209
