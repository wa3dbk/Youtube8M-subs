00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
master the Enoch altarpiece which was

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.430 
master the Enoch altarpiece which was
one<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.740> major<00:00:17.099> pieces<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:18.210> he<00:00:18.390> did<00:00:18.690> at

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
one of the major pieces that he did at

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.920 
one of the major pieces that he did at
which<00:00:19.680> by<00:00:19.860> the<00:00:19.920> way<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.190> historically<00:00:21.119> pretty

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
which by the way is historically pretty

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.830 
which by the way is historically pretty
accurate<00:00:22.440> we<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.800> several<00:00:23.220> artists<00:00:23.940> that<00:00:24.060> we

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
accurate we have several artists that we

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.990 
accurate we have several artists that we
don't<00:00:25.020> know<00:00:25.110> their<00:00:25.289> names<00:00:25.619> but<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:26.490> can<00:00:26.699> see

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
don't know their names but we can see

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.950 
don't know their names but we can see
their<00:00:27.900> styles<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.800> they<00:00:29.010> connect<00:00:29.400> together

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
their styles that they connect together

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.349 
their styles that they connect together
and<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.439> pick<00:00:31.680> a<00:00:31.710> piece<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.340> give<00:00:33.120> them

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:33.359 
and so we pick a piece and give them

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.549 
and so we pick a piece and give them
that<00:00:33.539> name<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.229> my<00:00:34.499> character<00:00:35.069> is<00:00:36.019> the<00:00:37.019> master

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
that name so my character is the master

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.590 
that name so my character is the master
of<00:00:37.589> the<00:00:37.769> Enoch<00:00:38.190> altarpiece<00:00:38.819> and<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.269> Enoch

destroyed at the flood of Noah and so he

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.130
