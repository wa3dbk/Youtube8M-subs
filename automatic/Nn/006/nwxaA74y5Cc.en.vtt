fast cars and this is probably the most

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.160 
fast cars and this is probably the most
well<00:02:17.430> balanced<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.209> driver-oriented

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170

there's<00:02:21.540> probably<00:02:22.160> many<00:02:23.160> more<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:24.030> are<00:02:24.060> much

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
there's probably many more that are much

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.479 
there's probably many more that are much
better<00:02:25.200> but<00:02:25.739> they're<00:02:25.890> probably<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.250> lot<00:02:26.459> more

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
better but they're probably a lot more

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.830 
better but they're probably a lot more
