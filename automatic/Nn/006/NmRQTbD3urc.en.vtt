the type of cam gear on the intake side

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.729 
the type of cam gear on the intake side
and<00:03:02.180> then<00:03:02.300> it's<00:03:02.420> got<00:03:02.630> a<00:03:03.880> RS<00:03:04.880> X<00:03:05.090> Type<00:03:05.270> S<00:03:05.480> oil<00:03:05.959> pump

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
and then it's got a RS X Type S oil pump

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:07.660 
and then it's got a RS X Type S oil pump
so<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:06.980> can<00:03:07.070> read<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.220> little<00:03:07.340> bit<00:03:07.489> higher

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
so it can read a little bit higher

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.640 
so it can read a little bit higher
safely

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
as you can see also it's got the RBC

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
money to e85 it's tuned on Cape fro and

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.820 
money to e85 it's tuned on Cape fro and
currently<00:03:44.850> it's<00:03:45.090> making<00:03:45.570> about<00:03:45.780> 230<00:03:46.590> wheel

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
currently it's making about 230 wheel

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.900 
currently it's making about 230 wheel
horsepower<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:49.170> it's<00:03:50.130> been<00:03:50.340> stripped<00:03:50.640> down<00:03:50.790> a

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
horsepower and it's been stripped down a

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.750 
horsepower and it's been stripped down a
little<00:03:51.210> bit<00:03:51.420> so<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.930> probably<00:03:52.140> weighs<00:03:52.530> about

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
little bit so it probably weighs about

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:06.290 
little bit so it probably weighs about
2,500<00:03:53.760> pounds

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.020 
that also obviously in this video I
don't<00:04:14.290> have<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:14.740> driving<00:04:15.550> or<00:04:15.670> doing<00:04:15.880> anything

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
don't have it driving or doing anything

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.960 
don't have it driving or doing anything
