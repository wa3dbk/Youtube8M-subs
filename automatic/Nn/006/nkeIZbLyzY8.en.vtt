00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.880
 one of the activities that continue with low coefficients is breeding 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:15.489
 causing a bottleneck in livestock production 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.210
 there is a rate of unemployment I think that only 63% 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.029
 only 63 hundred dean cows given 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.480
 they do not create a calf 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.480
 before pt 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.320
 the faculty of agronomy and the inia 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.719
 have determined a relationship between body state 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.640
 and the percentage of pregnancy 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.620
 which allows the producer with simple management measures 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.690
 identify and improve 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.100
 the conditions of the breeding herd 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.920
 to achieve 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.920
 80% procrea 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.520
 paca 4 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.519
 is the categorization by body condition 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.780
 from the cows to the environment 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.180
 this categorization then begins safe 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.430
 cow preserved 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.870
 a cc 8 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.550
 vacillate excessively fat 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.620
 the categories are second and cc 2 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.190
 they are very thin cows 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.190
 too many plates to get stuck 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.210
 p 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.680
 the cow cc3 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.210
 it's that skinny cow 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.070
 slightly pulped 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.120
 and with certain special management measures 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.180
 can achieve 80% procreation 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.550
 to 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.619
 the boat 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.620
 cc 3 points 5 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.150
 achieve this prosperous 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
 with drink - r 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.770
 labaka cc4 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.940
 with reasonable feeding and handling 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.610
 easily reach 80% procrea 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.259
 while the cows 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:20.620
 cc 5 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.119
 and cc 6 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:23.049
 biava cows 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.519
 pt and fat 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.879
 they can arrive well 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.879
 to 90 and more 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.179
 dan 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:47.259
 what we have been appreciating 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:51.320
 is a practical classification of a breeding herd 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.199
 according to food handling measures 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:57.439
 and each of the different categories will receive 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:30.529
 On the other hand, 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:57.669
 nothing 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.819
 once the parties have been classified 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.599
 if they paint the udders 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.539
 to assist in criticizing the turners of the cows in each category 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.639
 a different color is used 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.639
 for each category of low 

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:16.529
 is 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.289
 the calves whose brands have been integrated into this category 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.249
 they receive a precocious weaning 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:28.330
 together with a preferential feeding of these cows 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.179
 allows them to continue to obtain an adequate percentage of procrea 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:34.120
 but nevertheless 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.979
 the weanling calves in a precocious way 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.340
 they should receive supplementary feeding 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.550
 to achieve adequate development 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.550
 and not admit its further development 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:57.689
 this category of cows whose body condition is somewhat better 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:00.569
 they receive a somewhat different treatment 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.809
 their calves are detected temporarily 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.219
 they are in tabriz ados by feet to 14 days 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:10.229
 but they keep 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.229
 together with your hands 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.990
 this allows the cow to rise quickly 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.300
 and I achieved 80% of desired procrea 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.009
 once you remove the tablet the turners 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.740
 recover weight quickly 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.840
 CC cows 4 only need to receive adequate food 

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:45.379
 the last category of cows 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:47.110
 michael very good condition 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.789
 they also receive a normal treatment 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:54.499
 but come the extreme stew food shortage can even be 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:59.169
 sacrifice a little percent dread of the worse body condition categories 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.849
 because what you are trying to achieve 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:04.889
 is that as many casualties as possible 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.199
 says that in childbirth 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.199
 shenzhen 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:15.599
 Another point that affects the percentage of procrea of ​​the breeding herd 

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:18.580
 is the percentage of procrea 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.220
 of heifers first calving with calves at the foot 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.689
 they are of the breeding herd category 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:28.689
 more inclined ap ansa 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:37.520
 they must receive enough food to continue their own 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.379
 developing 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:43.229
 raise your calf and achieve a body condition cc 4 at birth 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:49.600
 there are other basic points directly involved the one involved 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.600
 to get a good percentage of procreating 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.479
 p 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:58.070
 It is necessary to count 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.550
 with an adequate subdivision to be able to handle the different categories 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:04.279
 many times 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:07.089
 no more paddocks are needed 

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:10.550
 a puff and chopped of the existing ones 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.099
 reserving some pastures for the categories of highest requirement 

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:23.749
 although with an adequate management of natural pastures 

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:27.089
 do not work with peeled fields 

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:28.849
 but with availability 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.119
 it is possible to achieve a rodeo good condition 

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:34.860
 that allows to achieve the desired goals 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.650
 a good management measure 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.180
 is to have a certain area of ​​improved pastures 

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:45.300
 which, strategically used, can be a very useful tool 

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.169
 important to manage those categories 

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:51.169
 of highest requirement 

00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:59.819
 another possible tool at critical moments 

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:02.819
 in extrapredial qualification 

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:05.039
 pardos bográn 

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:05.949
 which 

00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:08.779
 given a correct economic correlation 

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:10.009
 they can be very useful
