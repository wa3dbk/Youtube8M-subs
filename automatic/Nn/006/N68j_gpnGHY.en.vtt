00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
some of the fake ones are white or

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.269 
some of the fake ones are white or
various<00:00:27.390> other<00:00:27.480> colors<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.199> if<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.220> a

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.420 

another<00:00:33.809> thing<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.170> want<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.440> look<00:00:34.590> at<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
another thing you want to look at is the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.119 
another thing you want to look at is the
tab<00:00:36.079> if<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.140> look<00:00:37.410> at<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> stitching<00:00:37.890> around

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
tab if you look at the stitching around

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.729 
tab if you look at the stitching around
the<00:00:38.309> tab<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.790> clean<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.420> lot<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.350> times<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the tab it's clean a lot of times the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.350 
the tab it's clean a lot of times the
fakes<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.280> they<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.700> they<00:00:41.820> cut<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.210> out

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
fakes what they do is they cut it out

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.139 
fakes what they do is they cut it out
and<00:00:42.600> they<00:00:42.930> stitch<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.770> another<00:00:44.040> tab<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:45.059> you

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
and they stitch in another tab so you

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.970 
and they stitch in another tab so you
should<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.629> able<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.930> tell<00:00:46.140> if<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> stitching

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
should be able to tell if the stitching

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.779 
should be able to tell if the stitching
isn't<00:00:47.280> clean<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.719> fake<00:00:48.930> pair

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
isn't clean like this it's a fake pair

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.420 
isn't clean like this it's a fake pair
some<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.969> Levi's<00:00:51.300> they<00:00:51.930> make<00:00:52.289> don't<00:00:53.129> have

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
some of the Levi's they make don't have

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.959 
some of the Levi's they make don't have
it<00:00:53.969> has<00:00:54.149> are<00:00:54.510> by<00:00:54.870> itself<00:00:55.309> doesn't<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.520> Levi's

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it has are by itself doesn't have Levi's

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.279 
it has are by itself doesn't have Levi's
written<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.899> doesn't

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
written on it but that doesn't

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.650 
written on it but that doesn't
necessarily<00:00:58.379> mean<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.280> fake<00:00:59.460> pair<00:00:59.699> Levi's

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
necessarily mean it's a fake pair Levi's

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.460 
necessarily mean it's a fake pair Levi's
just<00:01:01.050> arbitrarily<00:01:02.870> puts<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.080> registered

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
just arbitrarily puts the registered

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.710 
just arbitrarily puts the registered
trademark<00:01:04.580> only<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.790> some<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> pairs

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.240 

another<00:01:09.720> thing<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.020> want<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.260> look<00:01:10.439> at<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
another thing you want to look at is the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.310 
another thing you want to look at is the
part<00:01:11.490> number<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.450> particular<00:01:12.780> pair<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.290> a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
part number so this particular pair is a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.929 
part number so this particular pair is a
501<00:01:14.070> zero<00:01:14.939> 194<00:01:15.750> which<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> dark<00:01:16.740> blue<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.189> it

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
501 zero 194 which is a dark blue and it

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.700 
501 zero 194 which is a dark blue and it
should<00:01:18.150> match<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.630> number<00:01:18.930> inside<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> pair

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
should match the number inside the pair

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.749 
should match the number inside the pair
of<00:01:19.799> pants<00:01:20.189> so

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.399 

if<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.939> open<00:01:27.180> up<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> pair<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.659> pants<00:01:27.930> there

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
if you open up the pair of pants there

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.330 
if you open up the pair of pants there
should<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> tag<00:01:29.070> here<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:31.229> tag<00:01:31.500> should

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:44.389 

read<00:01:38.119> 501<00:01:39.170> 0<00:01:40.170> 1<00:01:40.679> 9<00:01:40.920> 4<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.619> those<00:01:43.860> two<00:01:44.159> should

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
read 501 0 1 9 4 so those two should

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.480 
read 501 0 1 9 4 so those two should
match<00:01:47.119> another<00:01:48.119> thing<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.420> look<00:01:48.569> for<00:01:48.869> are<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
match another thing to look for are the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.109 
match another thing to look for are the
rivets<00:01:50.880> all<00:01:51.780> Levi's<00:01:52.729> will<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.149> LS<00:01:55.250> SF<00:01:56.310> Co

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
rivets all Levi's will have the LS SF Co

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.550 
rivets all Levi's will have the LS SF Co
so<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.319> you<00:01:58.439> look<00:01:58.619> at<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.890> ribbon<00:02:00.439> you<00:02:01.439> can

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
so if you look at this ribbon you can

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.100 
so if you look at this ribbon you can
see<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.950> has<00:02:02.159> Levi<00:02:02.819> Strauss<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.179> San<00:02:03.599> Francisco

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
see it has Levi Strauss a San Francisco

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.669 
see it has Levi Strauss a San Francisco
company<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.679> it<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:05.009> all<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.179> other<00:02:06.209> rivets

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.370 

although<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.830> rivets<00:02:11.190> should<00:02:11.700> say<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.060> same

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
although the rivets should say the same

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.740 
although the rivets should say the same
so<00:02:13.380> look<00:02:13.709> throughout<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.160> pants<00:02:14.549> and<00:02:14.750> make
