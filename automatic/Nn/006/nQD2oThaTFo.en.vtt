renewed lash look I've had this for a
while<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.760> kind<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.120> used<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.750> for<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.470> while

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
while and I kind of used it for a while

then I stopped and I've started using it

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.160 
then I stopped and I've started using it
again<00:03:44.460> and<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:45.090> does<00:03:45.270> really<00:03:45.510> help<00:03:45.720> make<00:03:46.020> your

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
again and it does really help make your

lashes look a little bit stronger and a
little<00:03:48.360> bit<00:03:48.690> glossy<00:03:48.870> or<00:03:49.200> it<00:03:49.290> doesn't<00:03:49.470> make

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
little bit glossy or it doesn't make

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.350
