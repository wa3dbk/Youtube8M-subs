00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
universe I'm actually inclined to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.650 
universe I'm actually inclined to
believe<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.579> they're<00:00:56.910> not<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.420> be

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660

material<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> movie<00:01:00.359> I'll<00:01:00.809> talk<00:01:01.020> about

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
material in the movie I'll talk about

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.869 
material in the movie I'll talk about
that<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> little<00:01:01.559> bit<00:01:01.680> later<00:01:01.980> but<00:01:02.609> now<00:01:02.730> let's

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
that a little bit later but now let's

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.100 
that a little bit later but now let's
talk<00:01:03.030> about<00:01:03.149> some<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> other<00:01:03.629> characters

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
talk about some of the other characters

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.380 
talk about some of the other characters
so<00:01:04.710> remember<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.670> original<00:01:05.760> Star<00:01:06.360> Wars

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
so remember in the original Star Wars

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.109 
so remember in the original Star Wars
trilogy<00:01:06.570> Luke<00:01:07.350> Skywalker<00:01:07.890> was<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.250> teenager<00:01:08.760> in

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
trilogy Luke Skywalker was a teenager in

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.910 
trilogy Luke Skywalker was a teenager in
the<00:01:09.150> first<00:01:09.479> film<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.869> think<00:01:09.930> he's<00:01:10.140> about<00:01:10.350> 18

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the first film I think he's about 18

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.620 
the first film I think he's about 18
somebody<00:01:11.760> might<00:01:11.880> be<00:01:11.970> able<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.180> correct<00:01:12.360> me<00:01:12.600> on

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
somebody might be able to correct me on

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.200 
somebody might be able to correct me on
this<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.590> basically<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.430> movie<00:01:14.820> for

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
this but basically this is a movie for

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.749 
this but basically this is a movie for
kids<00:01:15.689> not<00:01:16.170> like<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.650> George<00:01:16.979> Lucas<00:01:17.130> prequels

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
kids not like the George Lucas prequels

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.609 
kids not like the George Lucas prequels
as<00:01:18.000> they<00:01:18.390> were<00:01:18.450> for<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:18.810> really<00:01:19.170> little<00:01:19.350> kids

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
as they were for like really little kids

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.649 
as they were for like really little kids
but<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.610> was<00:01:20.729> gonna<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> really<00:01:21.390> young

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
but this was gonna be a really young

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.320 
but this was gonna be a really young
cast<00:01:21.990> with<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> few<00:01:22.920> exceptions<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:24.119> means

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
cast with a few exceptions that means

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.390

change<00:01:44.310> about<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> story<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.630> even<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:45.930> they

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
change about the story so even if they

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.359 
change about the story so even if they
do<00:01:46.110> use<00:01:46.409> some<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> expanded<00:01:47.220> universe

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.620 
if you think about it that way that old
character<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.860> probably<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.700> Jedi<00:01:57.090> Master<00:01:57.270> the

character is probably a Jedi Master the
70-something<00:01:58.229> character<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:59.310> means

70-something character that means

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.370 
70-something character that means
there's<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> group<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.360> people<00:02:00.689> at<00:02:00.810> least<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.140> few

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
there's a group of people at least a few

together as a group that's not

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
matically especially if they're trying

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.850 
matically especially if they're trying
to<00:02:09.690> film<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.170> lot<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.410> scenes<00:02:10.590> with<00:02:10.709> those

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
to film a lot of scenes with those

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.530 
to film a lot of scenes with those
characters<00:02:11.310> together<00:02:11.520> they<00:02:12.060> want<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.420> get

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
characters together they want to get

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.790 
characters together they want to get
them<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.930> set

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
them on set

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.470 
them on set
soon<00:02:13.980> as<00:02:14.070> possible<00:02:14.550> just<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.180> see<00:02:15.360> how

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
soon as possible just so you can see how

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.360 
soon as possible just so you can see how
their<00:02:15.630> chemistry<00:02:15.990> works<00:02:16.230> together<00:02:16.440> remember

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
their chemistry works together remember

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.700 
their chemistry works together remember
they're<00:02:17.520> starting<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:17.850> film<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.420> early<00:02:18.750> 2014

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
they're starting to film in early 2014

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.320 
they're starting to film in early 2014
so<00:02:19.920> they<00:02:20.160> actually<00:02:20.520> will<00:02:20.640> probably<00:02:20.790> have<00:02:21.060> most

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
so they actually will probably have most

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.880 
so they actually will probably have most
of<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.570> cast<00:02:21.780> by<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.020> end<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.380> year<00:02:22.620> and

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
of the cast by the end of the year and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.200 
of the cast by the end of the year and
if<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.190> think<00:02:23.370> about<00:02:23.460> it<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:23.940> George

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
if you think about it in this George

if you think about it in this George

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
gonna see Luke Skywalker inside a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.310 
gonna see Luke Skywalker inside a
holocron<00:02:39.000> that's<00:02:39.810> right<00:02:39.960> even<00:02:40.110> though

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
holocron that's right even though

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.110 
holocron that's right even though
they've<00:02:40.500> signed<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.950> original<00:02:41.400> cast<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.910> come

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
they've signed the original cast to come

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.220 
they've signed the original cast to come
back<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.540> doesn't<00:02:42.870> mean<00:02:42.960> that<00:02:42.990> they're

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
back that doesn't mean that they're

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.020 
back that doesn't mean that they're
going<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.470> appear<00:02:43.800> on<00:02:43.950> set<00:02:44.280> I'm<00:02:44.550> guessing<00:02:44.940> that

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
going to appear on set I'm guessing that

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.520 
going to appear on set I'm guessing that
that<00:02:45.090> forty-something<00:02:45.810> character<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.350> not

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
that forty-something character is not

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.900 
that forty-something character is not
going<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.770> be<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.860> Jedi<00:02:47.190> he's<00:02:47.460> going<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.730> take

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
going to be a Jedi he's going to take

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.880 
going to be a Jedi he's going to take
the<00:02:48.030> place<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.300> Han<00:02:48.720> Solo<00:02:48.750> would<00:02:49.230> occupy<00:02:49.710> in

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
the place that Han Solo would occupy in

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.620 
the place that Han Solo would occupy in
the<00:02:49.980> story<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.610> they're<00:02:51.210> probably<00:02:51.330> gonna<00:02:51.510> try

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
the story and they're probably gonna try

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.960 
the story and they're probably gonna try
and<00:02:51.810> groom<00:02:51.990> him<00:02:52.170> for<00:02:52.380> this<00:02:52.440> new<00:02:52.650> trilogy

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
and groom him for this new trilogy

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.830 
and groom him for this new trilogy
hopefully<00:02:53.970> he'll<00:02:54.120> be<00:02:54.240> just<00:02:54.390> as<00:02:54.540> good<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.780> a

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
hopefully he'll be just as good of a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.200 
hopefully he'll be just as good of a
scoundrel<00:02:55.080> as<00:02:55.470> Harrison<00:02:55.830> Ford<00:02:56.070> was<00:02:56.280> I'm<00:02:57.000> also

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
scoundrel as Harrison Ford was I'm also

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.730 
scoundrel as Harrison Ford was I'm also
guessing<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.810> other<00:02:58.110> character<00:02:58.560> will

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
guessing that that other character will

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.960 
guessing that that other character will
be<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.860> politician<00:02:59.190> just<00:02:59.640> because<00:02:59.850> it

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
be a politician just because it

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.940 
be a politician just because it
describes<00:03:00.330> them<00:03:00.450> as<00:03:00.570> being<00:03:00.810> very<00:03:00.960> smart<00:03:01.680> and

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
describes them as being very smart and

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.860 
describes them as being very smart and
out<00:03:02.460> of<00:03:02.610> shape<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.330> kind<00:03:03.540> of<00:03:03.570> describes

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
out of shape and that kind of describes

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.810 
out of shape and that kind of describes
most<00:03:04.200> politicians<00:03:04.440> one<00:03:05.340> of<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.520> strange

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
most politicians one of the strange

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.700 
most politicians one of the strange
things<00:03:06.030> about<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.450> though<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.930> absence

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
things about this though is the absence

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.340 
things about this though is the absence
of<00:03:07.920> any<00:03:08.040> female<00:03:08.550> adult<00:03:08.940> characters<00:03:09.420> remember

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
this is a JJ Abrams movie and most of

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.790 
this is a JJ Abrams movie and most of
his<00:03:12.660> movies<00:03:12.810> even<00:03:13.230> though<00:03:13.440> they<00:03:13.590> might<00:03:13.740> be

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
his movies even though they might be

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.730 
his movies even though they might be
really<00:03:14.370> nostalgic<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.270> wistful<00:03:15.900> oh<00:03:16.140> isn't<00:03:16.680> it

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
really nostalgic and wistful oh isn't it

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.590 
really nostalgic and wistful oh isn't it
being<00:03:16.860> really<00:03:17.010> positive<00:03:17.580> in<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.730> end<00:03:17.880> think

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
being really positive in the end think

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.270 
being really positive in the end think
of<00:03:18.720> super<00:03:19.050> 8<00:03:19.260> even<00:03:19.530> though<00:03:19.800> it<00:03:19.980> was<00:03:20.070> a<00:03:20.100> little

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
of super 8 even though it was a little

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.100 
of super 8 even though it was a little
bit<00:03:20.489> dark<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.180> little<00:03:21.420> bit<00:03:21.510> depressing<00:03:21.750> at

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
bit dark and a little bit depressing at

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.050 
bit dark and a little bit depressing at
times<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.650> ended<00:03:22.920> on<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.040> really<00:03:23.340> positive<00:03:23.550> note

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
times it ended on a really positive note

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.910 
times it ended on a really positive note
so<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.810> think<00:03:24.989> that's<00:03:25.260> what<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:25.470> Star<00:03:25.739> Wars

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
so I think that's what this Star Wars

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.260 
so I think that's what this Star Wars
movie<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.250> going<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.489> be<00:03:26.580> like<00:03:26.790> it's<00:03:27.000> not<00:03:27.120> gonna

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
movie is going to be like it's not gonna

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.390 
movie is going to be like it's not gonna
be<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.510> really<00:03:27.870> awful<00:03:28.140> depressing<00:03:29.130> movie

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
be a really awful depressing movie

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.620 
be a really awful depressing movie
you're<00:03:29.610> gonna<00:03:29.730> walk<00:03:29.940> away<00:03:30.060> feeling<00:03:30.300> very

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
you're gonna walk away feeling very

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.449 
you're gonna walk away feeling very

in the kitchen and movie studios and

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.810 
in the kitchen and movie studios and
directors<00:03:46.709> like<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.190> keep<00:03:47.370> things<00:03:47.580> as<00:03:47.730> simple

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.770

though JJ Abrams has said many times
that<00:04:19.200> he<00:04:19.320> doesn't<00:04:19.650> play<00:04:19.769> for<00:04:19.859> fans

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459
