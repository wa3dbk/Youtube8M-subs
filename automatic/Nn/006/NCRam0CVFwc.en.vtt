some<00:01:26.610> chord<00:01:27.240> shapes<00:01:34.610> play<00:01:35.610> slow<00:01:35.819> at<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.030> same

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:36.209 
some chord shapes play slow at the same

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:37.760 
some chord shapes play slow at the same
time<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.690> that's<00:01:36.869> kind<00:01:37.080> of<00:01:37.110> like<00:01:37.319> the<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
time so that's kind of like the the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.249 
time so that's kind of like the the
advantage<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.670> especially<00:01:39.049> older<00:01:40.049> blues

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
advantage and especially older blues

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.550 
advantage and especially older blues
guitar<00:01:40.680> players<00:01:40.950> from<00:01:41.430> Mississippi<00:01:42.560> around

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
guitar players from Mississippi around

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.429 
guitar players from Mississippi around
the<00:01:43.619> 30s<00:01:44.039> and<00:01:44.189> 40s<00:01:44.990> such<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.110> Blind<00:01:46.350> Willie

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the 30s and 40s such as Blind Willie

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.499 
the 30s and 40s such as Blind Willie
Johnson<00:01:46.890> they<00:01:47.100> would<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.340> held<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.880> think

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
Johnson they would have held it I think

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.819 
Johnson they would have held it I think
on<00:01:48.719> the<00:01:48.840> fourth<00:01:49.049> finger<00:01:49.200> because<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.619> just

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
on the fourth finger because it just

00:01:49.829 --> 00:02:12.780 
on the fourth finger because it just
enables<00:01:50.039> them<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.399> get<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.539> whole

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.040 

figure<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.980> use<00:02:16.910> quite<00:02:17.180> thick<00:02:17.450> glass<00:02:17.720> I

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
figure so I use quite thick glass I

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.900 
figure so I use quite thick glass I
don't<00:02:18.260> see<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:18.739> clearly<00:02:19.190> but<00:02:19.520> it's<00:02:19.670> quite

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
don't see this clearly but it's quite

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.449 
don't see this clearly but it's quite
thick<00:02:20.180> it's<00:02:20.720> quite<00:02:20.930> heavy<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.620> gives<00:02:22.400> me

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
thick it's quite heavy so that gives me

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.420 
thick it's quite heavy so that gives me
a<00:02:22.610> bit<00:02:22.730> more<00:02:22.910> sustain<00:02:23.890> also<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.069> string<00:02:25.310> gauge

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
a bit more sustain also the string gauge

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.410 
a bit more sustain also the string gauge

is<00:02:46.299> D<00:02:47.299> open<00:02:47.600> D<00:02:47.930> tuning<00:02:47.959> which<00:02:48.769> goes<00:02:49.069> D<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.730> D<00:02:50.769> F

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
is D open D tuning which goes D a D F

sharp<00:02:51.830> a<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:54.200> D<00:02:54.410> so<00:02:54.739> that<00:02:55.610> enables<00:02:56.150> me<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.299> just

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
sharp a to D so that enables me to just

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.300 
sharp a to D so that enables me to just
play<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:56.930> record<00:02:57.260> like<00:02:57.440> this

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
play that record like this

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.980 
play that record like this
that's<00:02:59.850> like<00:03:00.030> my<00:03:00.150> personal<00:03:00.300> in<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.810> blue

that's like my personal in the blue
versus<00:03:01.290> D<00:03:01.700> now<00:03:02.700> if<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:02.880> go<00:03:03.030> up<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.569> fifth

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
versus D now if I go up to the fifth

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:11.120 
versus D now if I go up to the fifth
fret<00:03:07.580> which<00:03:08.580> is<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.730> G<00:03:09.000> chord<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.740> then<00:03:10.740> my<00:03:10.890> five

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
fret which is a G chord and then my five

now when I'm sliding I've got to make

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.530 
now when I'm sliding I've got to make
sure<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.440> I'm<00:03:37.590> completely<00:03:38.220> over<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.239> threat

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
sure that I'm completely over the threat

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.350 
sure that I'm completely over the threat
not<00:03:40.380> in<00:03:40.560> between<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:41.040> frets<00:03:41.280> right<00:03:41.970> over<00:03:42.300> as

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
not in between the frets right over as

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.080 
not in between the frets right over as
much<00:03:42.930> as<00:03:43.050> I<00:03:43.140> can<00:03:43.200> be<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:44.370> for<00:03:44.519> example<00:03:44.880> if<00:03:44.970> I'm

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
much as I can be so for example if I'm

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.559 
much as I can be so for example if I'm
going<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.300> play<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.980> full<00:03:47.370> chord<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:48.030> G<00:03:48.060> chord

you<00:04:32.090> think<00:04:32.300> you<00:04:32.810> can<00:04:32.990> do<00:04:33.110> just<00:04:33.139> to<00:04:33.440> make<00:04:34.039> sure

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069 
you think you can do just to make sure

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.920 
you think you can do just to make sure
that<00:04:34.280> you<00:04:34.370> get<00:04:34.490> used<00:04:34.699> to<00:04:34.759> I'm<00:04:35.419> stepping<00:04:35.870> up

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
that you get used to I'm stepping up

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.990 
that you get used to I'm stepping up
those<00:04:36.139> frets<00:04:36.410> so<00:04:36.740> here<00:04:37.610> we're<00:04:37.729> going<00:04:37.849> to<00:04:37.910> go

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
those frets so here we're going to go

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:48.339 
those frets so here we're going to go
from<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.270> third<00:04:38.479> fret<00:04:45.729> okay<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:48.110> next<00:04:48.289> thing

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
from the third fret okay the next thing

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.159 
from the third fret okay the next thing
I<00:04:48.500> wanted<00:04:48.680> to<00:04:48.800> talk<00:04:49.190> about<00:04:49.250> is<00:04:49.520> far<00:04:49.669> brighter

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
I wanted to talk about is far brighter

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.499 
I wanted to talk about is far brighter
so<00:04:51.310> let's<00:04:52.310> just<00:04:52.490> try<00:04:52.639> that<00:04:52.699> chord<00:04:53.090> again<00:04:53.330> that

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
so let's just try that chord again that

00:04:53.509 --> 00:05:02.320 
so let's just try that chord again that
g<00:04:53.720> chord<00:05:00.280> you<00:05:01.280> can<00:05:01.340> see<00:05:01.580> that<00:05:01.759> the<00:05:02.000> vibrato

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
g chord you can see that the vibrato

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.189 
g chord you can see that the vibrato
helps<00:05:02.750> you<00:05:02.870> get<00:05:03.319> your<00:05:03.729> court<00:05:04.729> sustained<00:05:05.199> the

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
helps you get your court sustained the

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.089 
helps you get your court sustained the
classic<00:05:06.620> kind<00:05:06.830> of<00:05:06.919> blues<00:05:08.380> phrase<00:05:09.380> using<00:05:09.949> a

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
classic kind of blues phrase using a

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:17.499 
classic kind of blues phrase using a
slide<00:05:15.610> okay<00:05:16.610> so<00:05:16.669> you<00:05:16.789> can<00:05:16.880> see<00:05:16.909> some<00:05:17.180> bagua

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:17.509 
slide okay so you can see some bagua

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.450 
slide okay so you can see some bagua
today<00:05:17.870> I'm<00:05:18.199> sliding<00:05:18.500> from<00:05:18.680> the<00:05:18.800> tenth<00:05:19.069> fret<00:05:19.340> to

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
today I'm sliding from the tenth fret to

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:26.020 
today I'm sliding from the tenth fret to
the<00:05:19.520> twelfth<00:05:19.849> fret<00:05:24.610> and<00:05:25.610> you<00:05:25.699> can<00:05:25.849> you<00:05:26.000> can

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
the twelfth fret and you can you can

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.879 
the twelfth fret and you can you can
think<00:05:26.360> of<00:05:26.479> the<00:05:26.599> vibrato<00:05:26.960> by<00:05:27.319> the<00:05:27.380> human<00:05:27.740> voice

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
think of the vibrato by the human voice

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.640 
think of the vibrato by the human voice
where<00:05:28.220> if<00:05:28.490> you're<00:05:29.060> singing<00:05:29.300> a<00:05:29.479> notes<00:05:30.409> with

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
where if you're singing a notes with

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.710 
where if you're singing a notes with
your<00:05:30.740> voice<00:05:30.949> the<00:05:31.400> vibrato<00:05:31.729> gets<00:05:32.060> quicker<00:05:32.360> and

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
your voice the vibrato gets quicker and

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.590 
your voice the vibrato gets quicker and
they<00:05:32.810> fade<00:05:33.050> away<00:05:33.349> so<00:05:33.380> you<00:05:33.620> can<00:05:33.740> try<00:05:33.889> that

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.970 

and<00:05:38.600> then<00:05:39.020> again<00:05:39.230> that<00:05:39.350> helps<00:05:39.680> with<00:05:39.890> the

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
and then again that helps with the

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.970 
and then again that helps with the
sustain<00:05:40.310> as<00:05:40.430> well<00:05:41.590> okay<00:05:42.590> I'm<00:05:42.680> just<00:05:42.770> going<00:05:42.890> to

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980
