want there's another way and I've been
kind<00:02:10.990> of<00:02:11.080> practicing<00:02:11.560> testing<00:02:11.980> this<00:02:12.070> out<00:02:12.280> you

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
kind of practicing testing this out you

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.510 
kind of practicing testing this out you
can<00:02:13.060> kind<00:02:13.240> of<00:02:13.360> turn<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.900> knife<00:02:14.190> sideways<00:02:15.190> and

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
can kind of turn the knife sideways and

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.910 
can kind of turn the knife sideways and
when<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.420> cut<00:02:16.720> into<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:17.260> actually<00:02:17.410> is<00:02:17.740> like

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
when you cut into it it actually is like

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.700 
when you cut into it it actually is like
peels<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:19.240> outer<00:02:19.570> layer<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.080> ball<00:02:20.350> up<00:02:20.560> a

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
peels the outer layer of the ball up a

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.260 
peels the outer layer of the ball up a
little<00:02:20.890> bit<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:22.120> actually<00:02:24.090> catches<00:02:25.090> the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
little bit and that actually catches the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.820 
little bit and that actually catches the
wyndham<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.960> know<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.260> movement<00:02:26.710> of<00:02:26.770> the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
wyndham you know the movement of the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.880 
wyndham you know the movement of the
ball<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:28.840> one's<00:02:29.050> something<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.560> can<00:02:29.710> try

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
ball so that one's something you can try

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.740 
ball so that one's something you can try
out<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.310> guys<00:02:30.490> can<00:02:30.700> test<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:31.030> out<00:02:31.090> and

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
out to you guys can test that out and

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.660 
out to you guys can test that out and
let<00:02:31.930> me<00:02:32.050> know<00:02:32.080> what<00:02:32.320> you<00:02:32.470> guys<00:02:32.560> think<00:02:32.830> but

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
let me know what you guys think but

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.920 
let me know what you guys think but
right<00:02:33.880> now<00:02:33.940> I've<00:02:34.270> been<00:02:34.390> using<00:02:34.570> this<00:02:34.690> pattern

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
right now I've been using this pattern

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.990 
right now I've been using this pattern
and<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:36.070> can<00:02:36.190> ask<00:02:36.340> Kevin<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.690> Sylvie<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:39.000> a

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
and you can ask Kevin and Sylvie and a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.100 
and you can ask Kevin and Sylvie and a
couple<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.270> these<00:02:40.330> other<00:02:40.480> guys<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:40.720> I've

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
couple of these other guys that I've

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:53.160 
couple of these other guys that I've
been<00:02:41.880> dialed<00:02:42.880> in<00:02:43.000> with<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.720> pattern

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.470 

again<00:02:54.170> we<00:02:54.290> want<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.530> be<00:02:54.850> firm<00:02:55.850> you<00:02:56.210> want<00:02:56.390> to

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
again we want to be firm you want to

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.250 
again we want to be firm you want to
have<00:02:56.570> a<00:02:56.600> firm<00:02:57.010> suppressing<00:02:58.010> their

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.000 

and<00:03:04.189> when<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.430> make<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.670> cut<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.799> don't

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
and when you make a cut that you don't

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.199 
and when you make a cut that you don't
go<00:03:07.129> over<00:03:07.610> it<00:03:07.640> again<00:03:07.909> you<00:03:08.569> just<00:03:08.810> one<00:03:09.500> go<00:03:10.209> it's

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
go over it again you just one go it's

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.460 
go over it again you just one go it's
like<00:03:12.760> when<00:03:13.760> you<00:03:13.879> drill<00:03:14.150> board<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:15.019> get<00:03:15.290> one

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
like when you drill board you get one

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.190 
like when you drill board you get one
shot<00:03:15.500> at<00:03:15.739> it<00:03:15.920> if<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:16.939> try<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.480> cut<00:03:17.810> over<00:03:18.079> the

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
shot at it if you try to cut over the

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.240 
shot at it if you try to cut over the
same<00:03:18.439> line<00:03:18.890> you'll<00:03:19.760> actually<00:03:19.909> push<00:03:20.480> down<00:03:21.250> the

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
same line you'll actually push down the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.369 
same line you'll actually push down the
ridge<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:22.940> you<00:03:23.030> created<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.840> if<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:24.260> can

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
ridge that you created and if you can

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.899 
ridge that you created and if you can
see<00:03:24.560> it's<00:03:24.709> coming<00:03:24.920> up<00:03:25.010> real<00:03:25.159> nice<00:03:25.370> on<00:03:25.579> here<00:03:27.909> so

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
see it's coming up real nice on here so

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.080 
see it's coming up real nice on here so
if<00:03:29.329> you<00:03:30.230> go<00:03:30.620> across<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:31.310> same<00:03:31.549> line<00:03:31.819> you'll

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
if you go across the same line you'll

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.770 
if you go across the same line you'll
end<00:03:32.209> up<00:03:32.269> pushing<00:03:33.189> that<00:03:34.189> raised<00:03:34.579> part<00:03:35.090> down<00:03:35.540> in

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
end up pushing that raised part down in

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.199 
end up pushing that raised part down in
the<00:03:35.930> ball<00:03:36.109> and<00:03:36.530> you<00:03:36.769> lose<00:03:36.920> that<00:03:37.280> inconsistency

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
the ball and you lose that inconsistency

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.339 
the ball and you lose that inconsistency
and<00:03:38.810> if<00:03:39.170> all<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.590> phrase<00:03:39.890> they<00:03:40.670> come<00:03:40.849> on<00:03:40.970> their

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
and if all the phrase they come on their

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.800 
and if all the phrase they come on their
leave<00:03:42.349> moment<00:03:42.799> now<00:03:43.519> go<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.879> top<00:03:44.030> from<00:03:44.540> one

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
leave moment now go to the top from one

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.830 
leave moment now go to the top from one
line<00:03:45.019> without<00:03:45.349> going<00:03:46.269> without<00:03:47.269> actually

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
line without going without actually

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.410 
line without going without actually
being<00:03:48.049> on<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.500> line<00:03:48.970> start<00:03:49.970> above<00:03:50.209> it<00:03:50.389> and

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
being on the line start above it and

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.879 
being on the line start above it and
then<00:03:50.750> just<00:03:50.900> go<00:03:51.109> straight<00:03:51.319> across<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:51.769> the

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
then just go straight across to the

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.690 
then just go straight across to the
other<00:03:51.920> line<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:52.849> again<00:03:53.120> just<00:03:53.329> one<00:03:53.959> line<00:03:54.700> right

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
other line so again just one line right

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.050 
other line so again just one line right
down<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:56.000> center<00:03:56.180> of<00:03:56.329> the<00:03:56.420> ball<00:03:56.659> there

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.559

choose one side and you keep going to

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.180 
choose one side and you keep going to
about<00:04:06.840> right<00:04:07.050> you<00:04:07.410> know<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.590> wear<00:04:07.830> one<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.069> the
