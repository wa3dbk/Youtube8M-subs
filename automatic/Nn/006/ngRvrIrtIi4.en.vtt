 Here we have our butterflies out 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.790
 then tinker around the head 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.710
 Of course we need colors for ours 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.309

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.320
 we have different forms here 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.320
 the stencils then we need brushes 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:59.120
 We personally have a nice design 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.949
 paper from volleya used here 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:07.200

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.430
 craft materials such as scissors and sang 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.800
 then we start our first moth 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.340
 to paint 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.360
 just the round head brace with the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:37.160
 paint in pink completely inside and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.160
 let it dry outside and then 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.030
 The template will be on the back of 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:50.910
 this beautiful paper 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:53.720
 recorded and cut out now 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.720
 members 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.220
 both parts together put one 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.800
 We have butterfly out 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.960
 made of transparent paper and the 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.520
 other butterflies just from the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.520
 beautiful design paper 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.970
 the different forms of each other 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.480
 put or respectively the different ones 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.480
 sizes 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:33.840
 Now we are planning a face with this 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.040
 we make the hole for the drill 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:47.070
 fill the fill are rotated out of degrees 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:54.120
 and on top we put a little bugs 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:56.280
 Balls, of course, also the wire in the hole 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.760
 Fix yourself with one again 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.760
 hot glue gun 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:11.150
 and with a multi will fit now 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:23.020
 made a nice bow and now 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:26.020
 then something else attached to the body 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:39.110
 felt wool with attach 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:41.330
 a face paint on, and the clip 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.030
 couple on this butterfly wing 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.330
