00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
35% reduced-sodium whatever it is so if

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:17.819

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
out day 11 where I talk about how to

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.740 
out day 11 where I talk about how to
actually<00:02:20.680> calculate<00:02:21.159> sodium<00:02:21.969> levels<00:02:22.269> and

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
actually calculate sodium levels and

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.690 
actually calculate sodium levels and
things<00:02:23.079> like<00:02:23.290> sauces<00:02:23.799> beans<00:02:24.069> anything<00:02:24.549> like

that and if you are trying to reduce

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.979 
that and if you are trying to reduce

what<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.590> can<00:02:47.889> do<00:02:48.129> is<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.489> can<00:02:48.609> put<00:02:48.939> them<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.329> a

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
what you can do is you can put them in a

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.229 
what you can do is you can put them in a
strainer<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:49.989> rinse<00:02:50.079> it<00:02:50.829> out<00:02:50.980> take<00:02:51.909> a<00:02:51.970> lot<00:02:52.209> of

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
strainer and rinse it out take a lot of

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.809 
strainer and rinse it out take a lot of
water<00:02:52.480> rinse<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.109> beans<00:02:53.349> around<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:54.010> try<00:02:54.639> and

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
water rinse the beans around and try and

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.580 
water rinse the beans around and try and
get<00:02:54.939> some<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.389> sodium<00:02:55.629> off<00:02:55.989> it's<00:02:56.409> not

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
get some of the sodium off it's not

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.409 
get some of the sodium off it's not
gonna<00:02:56.739> get<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.069> all<00:02:57.250> up<00:02:57.430> obviously<00:02:58.060> because<00:02:58.389> a

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:58.419 
gonna get it all up obviously because a

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.479 
gonna get it all up obviously because a
lot<00:02:58.659> of<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.870> will<00:02:58.989> have<00:02:59.139> soaked<00:02:59.409> in<00:02:59.620> but<00:03:00.280> it's

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
lot of it will have soaked in but it's

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.520 
lot of it will have soaked in but it's
better<00:03:00.760> than<00:03:00.849> just<00:03:01.239> putting<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.720> cañon<00:03:02.230> like

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
better than just putting the cañon like

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.510 
better than just putting the cañon like
how<00:03:02.829> it<00:03:02.980> is

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.090 

I<00:03:06.870> had<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.900> few<00:03:08.140> people<00:03:08.320> who<00:03:08.470> were<00:03:08.650> asking<00:03:09.010> this

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
I had a few people who were asking this

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.710 
I had a few people who were asking this
question<00:03:09.520> so<00:03:09.670> I<00:03:09.730> wanted<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.120> answer<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.510> today

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
question so I wanted to answer it today

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.070 
question so I wanted to answer it today
and<00:03:10.990> that<00:03:11.170> is<00:03:11.380> what<00:03:11.830> is<00:03:12.070> my<00:03:12.370> height<00:03:12.790> I'm<00:03:13.660> a

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
and that is what is my height I'm a

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.840 
and that is what is my height I'm a
natural<00:03:14.500> starting<00:03:14.770> weight<00:03:15.070> for<00:03:15.790> the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
natural starting weight for the

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.460 
natural starting weight for the
beginning<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.270> this<00:03:16.390> experiment<00:03:16.990> was<00:03:17.020> 108

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
beginning of this experiment was 108

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.730 
beginning of this experiment was 108
point<00:03:18.070> two<00:03:18.520> or<00:03:18.760> point<00:03:19.030> four<00:03:19.210> I<00:03:19.240> believe<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:19.870> my

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
point two or point four I believe and my

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.920 
point two or point four I believe and my
natural<00:03:20.950> weight<00:03:21.370> usually<00:03:21.910> falls<00:03:22.120> between<00:03:22.330> 105

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
natural weight usually falls between 105

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.510 
natural weight usually falls between 105
and<00:03:22.990> 110<00:03:23.530> somewhere<00:03:24.010> in<00:03:24.100> there<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.280> usually

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
and 110 somewhere in there I usually

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.820 
and 110 somewhere in there I usually
don't<00:03:24.880> go<00:03:25.060> much<00:03:25.600> on<00:03:25.780> either<00:03:25.960> side<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.290> that<00:03:26.410> and

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
don't go much on either side of that and

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.020 
don't go much on either side of that and

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
my eyes are starting to go away they're

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.880 
my eyes are starting to go away they're
still<00:03:40.360> there<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:41.170> can<00:03:41.350> see<00:03:41.530> them<00:03:41.710> they're

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
still there you can see them they're
