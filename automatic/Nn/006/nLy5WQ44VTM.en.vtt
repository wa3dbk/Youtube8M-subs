line so I'm keeping the starting point

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.260 
line so I'm keeping the starting point
at<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.870> right<00:02:14.110> place<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.650> I'm<00:02:15.340> going<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.970> line

have them floating but if you're doing
that<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:46.140> will<00:04:46.290> have<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.590> backtrack<00:04:46.800> each<00:04:47.340> one

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
that you will have to backtrack each one

00:04:47.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
that you will have to backtrack each one
of<00:04:48.240> these<00:04:48.720> arcs<00:05:04.430> and<00:05:05.430> we'll<00:05:06.330> go<00:05:06.480> back<00:05:06.690> to<00:05:06.840> the

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
of these arcs and we'll go back to the

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:21.040 
of these arcs and we'll go back to the
center<00:05:07.320> again

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.019

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
threads up and sew the ends in so that's

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.839 
threads up and sew the ends in so that's
us<00:05:33.840> finished<00:05:33.870> spiral<00:05:34.830> going<00:05:35.430> in<00:05:35.669> that

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
us finished spiral going in that

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.989 
us finished spiral going in that
direction<00:05:36.029> if<00:05:36.689> we<00:05:37.139> want<00:05:37.680> we<00:05:38.310> can<00:05:38.520> turn<00:05:38.789> the

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:38.999 
direction if we want we can turn the

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:42.230 
direction if we want we can turn the
spiral<00:05:39.389> upside<00:05:39.810> down<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:40.379> work<00:05:41.279> the<00:05:41.729> spiral

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
spiral upside down and work the spiral

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.420 
spiral upside down and work the spiral
going<00:05:42.689> in<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:43.020> opposite<00:05:43.439> direction<00:05:43.710> on<00:05:44.219> top

going in the opposite direction on top
of<00:05:44.580> this<00:05:44.789> one<00:05:46.009> we<00:05:47.009> have<00:05:47.159> a<00:05:47.189> number<00:05:47.520> of

of this one we have a number of

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.689 
of this one we have a number of
different<00:05:47.969> spacing<00:05:48.749> measurements<00:05:49.349> on<00:05:49.699> that
