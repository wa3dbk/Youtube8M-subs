nice<00:00:26.070> little<00:00:26.570> little<00:00:27.570> thing<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:28.019> had

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
nice little little thing that we had

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.380 
nice little little thing that we had
together<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.740> lot<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.949> people<00:00:29.130> do<00:00:29.369> tend<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.029> have

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
together a lot of people do tend to have

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.510 
together a lot of people do tend to have
them<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.599> their<00:00:30.779> coat<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.830> if<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.160> own<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> long

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
them in their coat so if you own a long

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.010 
them in their coat so if you own a long
coat<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.880> can<00:00:32.940> kinda<00:00:33.239> just<00:00:33.360> put<00:00:33.510> your<00:00:33.660> coat<00:00:33.989> a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
coat you can kinda just put your coat a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.600 
coat you can kinda just put your coat a
bit<00:00:34.260> around<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.070> can't<00:00:35.309> really<00:00:35.370> see

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
bit around and so you can't really see

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.530 
bit around and so you can't really see
then<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.210> looks<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.600> SAT<00:00:36.809> there<00:00:37.050> I

does feel hard and it feels like it's

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.580 
does feel hard and it feels like it's
never<00:01:08.970> going<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.299> get<00:01:09.420> better<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:10.049> if<00:01:10.320> you

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
never going to get better but if you

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.840 
never going to get better but if you
speak<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> somebody<00:01:11.159> else<00:01:11.430> he<00:01:11.549> was<00:01:11.640> gone

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
speak to somebody else he was gone

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.240 
speak to somebody else he was gone
through<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> same<00:01:12.210> thing<00:01:12.720> you'll<00:01:13.650> find<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
through the same thing you'll find that

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.100 
through the same thing you'll find that
it<00:01:14.520> does<00:01:14.760> get<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.000> lot<00:01:15.210> easier<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.780> gets<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.990> lot

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
it does get a lot easier it gets a lot

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.580 
it does get a lot easier it gets a lot
better<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.590> becomes<00:01:16.890> second<00:01:17.610> nature<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.000> I

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
better and it becomes second nature to I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.170 
better and it becomes second nature to I
would<00:01:19.590> breastfeed<00:01:20.130> her<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.520> then<00:01:20.640> he<00:01:20.880> would

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
would breastfeed her and then he would

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.420 
would breastfeed her and then he would
be<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.080> window<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.590> her<00:01:22.710> back<00:01:23.009> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
he put her back in beds so we still did

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.370 
he put her back in beds so we still did
share<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.090> he<00:01:27.180> still<00:01:27.390> got<00:01:27.509> up<00:01:27.659> with<00:01:27.840> me<00:01:28.020> but

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
share it and he still got up with me but

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.990 
share it and he still got up with me but
it<00:01:28.590> wasn't<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.009> fact<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.640> had<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.880> give

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
it wasn't the fact that we had to give

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.460 
it wasn't the fact that we had to give
her<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.119> bottle<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.689> she'd<00:01:31.079> let<00:01:31.200> me<00:01:31.229> know<00:01:31.380> when

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
her a bottle and she'd let me know when

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.569 
her a bottle and she'd let me know when
she<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:31.710> hungry<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.009> whenever<00:01:32.310> she<00:01:32.460> was

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
she was hungry so whenever she was

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.249 
she was hungry so whenever she was
hungry<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.329> take<00:01:33.630> her<00:01:33.720> out<00:01:33.840> fees<00:01:34.079> or

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
hungry it was take her out fees or

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.490 
hungry it was take her out fees or
wherever<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.619> was<00:01:35.450> no<00:01:36.450> way<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.750> someone<00:01:37.320> can

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
wherever I was no way that someone can

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.230 
wherever I was no way that someone can
tell<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.040> should<00:01:38.070> breastfeed<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.030> be

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
tell you you should breastfeed and be

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.710 
tell you you should breastfeed and be
pressurized<00:01:39.780> into<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> think<00:01:41.040> that

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
pressurized into it but I think that

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.969 
pressurized into it but I think that
it's<00:01:42.720> all<00:01:42.930> about<00:01:43.110> what<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.320> feel<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.799> going<00:01:43.920> to

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
it's all about what you feel is going to

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.860 
it's all about what you feel is going to
be<00:01:44.070> best<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.670> your<00:01:44.820> baby

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:58.330 

you

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.399 

you
