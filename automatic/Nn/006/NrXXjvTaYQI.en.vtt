over here you have learn the letters
learn<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.840> letter<00:00:37.050> sounds<00:00:38.300> find<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.570> before

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
learn the letter sounds find it before

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.459 
learn the letter sounds find it before
and<00:00:40.500> after<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.190> music<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.840> we're<00:00:43.020> gonna<00:00:43.110> start

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
and after and music so we're gonna start

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.279 
and after and music so we're gonna start
up<00:00:43.649> here<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> first<00:00:44.730> mode<00:00:45.050> learn<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
letters and in this mode I it just gives

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.000 
letters and in this mode I it just gives
you<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.289> name<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> letters<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.860> it's

you the name of the letters so it's

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.429 
you the name of the letters so it's
pretty<00:01:05.189> simple<00:01:05.700> there<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.600> um<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.020> helps<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
pretty simple there but um it helps the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.039 
pretty simple there but um it helps the
child<00:01:07.710> learn<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.400> letters<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.869> this<00:01:12.869> is

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
child learn the letters and this is

learn the letter sounds and then next

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.890 
learn the letter sounds and then next
we're<00:01:33.329> gonna<00:01:33.390> have<00:01:33.659> find<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:39.689> wants

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
we're gonna have find it and it wants

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
you to find the letter by recognizing

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:51.980 
you to find the letter by recognizing
the<00:01:43.560> sound<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:51.060> then<00:01:51.210> as<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.600> find<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the sound and then as you find the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.510 
the sound and then as you find the
letter<00:01:52.170> H<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.560> asking<00:01:58.799> us<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.100> find<00:01:59.250> the

letter H and it's asking us to find the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.740 
letter H and it's asking us to find the
letters<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:05.000> let's<00:02:06.000> see<00:02:06.149> what<00:02:06.299> happens<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:06.630> we

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
letters is let's see what happens if we

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.180 
letters is let's see what happens if we
get<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.990> wrong<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.439> wants<00:02:07.649> us<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.770> find<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
get it wrong it wants us to find the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.980 
get it wrong it wants us to find the
letter<00:02:08.340> Y

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.450 

so<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.320> doesn't<00:02:13.470> really<00:02:13.710> tell<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.160> if<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> get
