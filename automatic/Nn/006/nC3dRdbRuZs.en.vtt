take two or one whatever this is like a
sturdy<00:01:04.199> one<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.799> nice<00:01:05.010> not<00:01:05.339> like<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.610> cheap

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
sturdy one so it's nice not like a cheap

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.969 
sturdy one so it's nice not like a cheap
one<00:01:06.000> then<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.869> put<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.409> right<00:01:07.619> there<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.950> you

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
one then you put on right there and you

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.020 
one then you put on right there and you
blew<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.299> okay<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.409> grew<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.729> I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
blew it okay so you grew it and like I

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.120 
blew it okay so you grew it and like I
made<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> different<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.619> smaller<00:01:13.890> version

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
made a different it's a smaller version

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.700 
made a different it's a smaller version
and<00:01:14.900> that's<00:01:15.900> because<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.229> was<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.500> showing

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and that's because I was just showing

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.969 
and that's because I was just showing
you<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:17.970> took<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.170> grew<00:01:19.680> them<00:01:19.890> all

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you so I took this I grew them all

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.700 
you so I took this I grew them all
together<00:01:21.320> you<00:01:23.780> can<00:01:24.780> see<00:01:24.990> right<00:01:25.020> there<00:01:25.409> glued

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
together you can see right there glued

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.840 
together you can see right there glued
it<00:01:25.830> together<00:01:26.479> then<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:28.400> traced<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.820> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
it together then I traced this on a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.149 
it together then I traced this on a
piece<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.119> paper<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.890> don't<00:01:31.920> see

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
piece of paper so like you don't see

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.219 
piece of paper so like you don't see
like<00:01:32.430> all<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.759> glue<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.540> rules<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
like all the glue and all the rules and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.240 
like all the glue and all the rules and
stuff<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.770> traced<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.900> put<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.799> like

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
stuff I traced it you put it on and like

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.850 
stuff I traced it you put it on and like
you<00:01:38.460> hide<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.049> can't<00:01:40.350> really

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
you hide it but like you can't really

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.710 
you hide it but like you can't really
see<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.220> gun<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.850> an<00:01:42.030> either/or<00:01:42.210> shape

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
see the gun so it's an either/or shape

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.780 
see the gun so it's an either/or shape
to<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.890> draw<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.159> here<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.640> like

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
to it then you can draw on here and like

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.080 
to it then you can draw on here and like
you<00:01:44.939> tape<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:46.020> glue<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:47.090> turns

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
you tape it on you can glue it on turns

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.800 
you tape it on you can glue it on turns
into<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.610> I<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.850> connect<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> board

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
into this and I can connect the board

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.679 
into this and I can connect the board
you<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.200> scroll<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.950> piece<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.340> paper<00:01:53.689> to

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
you just scroll up a piece of paper to

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.260 
you just scroll up a piece of paper to
turn<00:01:54.899> into<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.880> or<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:57.960> make<00:01:58.110> little

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
turn into this or you can make little

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.880 
turn into this or you can make little
anything<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.899> want<00:02:01.759> like<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.420> you
