karna seen in Cardassian acts in your
body<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> buffer<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.039> for<00:00:53.219> example<00:00:53.250> when

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
body is a buffer so for example when

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.069 
body is a buffer so for example when
you're<00:00:53.820> lifting<00:00:53.969> weights<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
you're lifting weights and on that a

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.010 
you're lifting weights and on that a
threat<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.239> can't<00:00:57.239> do<00:00:57.449> any<00:00:57.629> more<00:00:57.719> it's

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
threat and can't do any more it's

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.330 
threat and can't do any more it's
because<00:00:58.320> your<00:00:58.440> muscles<00:00:58.620> are<00:00:58.920> getting<00:00:59.190> more

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
because your muscles are getting more

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.209 
because your muscles are getting more
acidic<00:01:00.170> there's<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> pain<00:01:01.500> threshold<00:01:02.039> there

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
acidic there's a pain threshold there

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.560 
acidic there's a pain threshold there
and<00:01:02.430> normally<00:01:02.760> you'd<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.000> rack<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and normally you'd have to rack the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.440 
and normally you'd have to rack the
weight<00:01:03.750> up<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.170> arrest<00:01:04.790> what<00:01:05.790> beta<00:01:06.000> alanine

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
weight up and arrest what beta alanine

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.789 
weight up and arrest what beta alanine
is<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.840> do<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.350> will<00:01:07.470> allow<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
do that extra rep or two because it will

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.410
