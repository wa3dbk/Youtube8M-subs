00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
personally I think the sculpt is

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.040 
personally I think the sculpt is
horrible<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.830> doesn't<00:00:35.010> look<00:00:35.129> anything<00:00:35.370> like

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
something like that doesn't look

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.549

anything like him

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.140 
anything like him
it's<00:00:40.680> okay<00:00:40.949> other<00:00:41.100> than<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.760> decent

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
it's okay other than that it's a decent

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.430 
it's okay other than that it's a decent
sculpt<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:42.780> doesn't<00:00:43.019> look<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
they did a good job with the suit with

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.400 
they did a good job with the suit with
the<00:00:50.130> mix<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.790> cloth<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.480> plastic

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the mix of the cloth and the plastic

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.600 
the mix of the cloth and the plastic
parts<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.800> looks<00:00:52.980> pretty<00:00:53.219> good<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
parts it looks pretty good the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.100 
parts it looks pretty good the
articulation<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.210> pretty<00:00:54.450> good<00:00:54.600> we'll<00:00:54.989> go

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.869 
articulation is pretty good we'll go
through<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.410> all<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.309> as<00:00:56.489> an<00:00:56.610> overview

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
through it all but just as an overview

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.670 
through it all but just as an overview
it's<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> pretty<00:00:57.390> nice<00:00:57.629> figure<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.200> only<00:00:58.469> thing

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
it's a pretty nice figure the only thing

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.319 
it's a pretty nice figure the only thing
really<00:00:58.829> holding<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> back<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.879> head

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
really holding it back is the head

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.420 
really holding it back is the head

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
sculpt he's just over six inches tall so

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.090 
sculpt he's just over six inches tall so
no<00:01:02.879> big<00:01:03.059> deal<00:01:03.239> there<00:01:03.589> he<00:01:04.589> comes<00:01:04.800> with<00:01:05.070> his

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
no big deal there he comes with his

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.520 
no big deal there he comes with his
lightsaber<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.960> course<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.259> can<00:01:07.380> take

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
lightsaber and of course you can take

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.160 
lightsaber and of course you can take
the<00:01:07.740> beam<00:01:07.950> part<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.060> snap<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.990> to

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the beam part out and snap this on to

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.320 
the beam part out and snap this on to
his<00:01:10.289> belt<00:01:10.560> using<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.950> little<00:01:11.100> peg<00:01:11.430> which<00:01:12.149> is

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
his belt using that little peg which is

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.880 
his belt using that little peg which is
okay<00:01:12.660> but<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.930> imagine<00:01:13.259> most<00:01:13.380> people<00:01:13.680> are<00:01:13.770> gonna

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
okay but I imagine most people are gonna

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.680 
okay but I imagine most people are gonna
pose<00:01:14.130> him<00:01:14.369> with<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.880> with<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> lightsaber

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
pose him with the with the lightsaber

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.100 
pose him with the with the lightsaber
activated<00:01:16.560> or<00:01:16.950> ignited<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.509> heads<00:01:18.690> do<00:01:18.899> just

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
activated or ignited the heads do just

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.719 
activated or ignited the heads do just
pop<00:01:19.259> off<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.619> ball<00:01:19.800> peg<00:01:20.069> there<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.459> we<00:01:20.520> have

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
pop off the ball peg there and we have

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.710 
pop off the ball peg there and we have
the<00:01:21.000> hinge<00:01:22.009> and<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.250> ball<00:01:23.429> peg<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.569> neck

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the hinge and the ball peg the neck

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.180 
the hinge and the ball peg the neck
paint<00:01:24.990> doesn't<00:01:25.350> really<00:01:25.500> match<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.770> face

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
paint doesn't really match the face

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.589 
paint doesn't really match the face
paint<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.640> don't<00:01:26.759> know<00:01:26.819> how<00:01:27.000> well<00:01:27.179> you<00:01:27.300> can<00:01:27.420> tell

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:27.599 
paint I don't know how well you can tell

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:30.710 
paint I don't know how well you can tell
on<00:01:27.810> camera<00:01:27.890> in<00:01:28.890> person<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.910> pretty<00:01:30.270> obvious

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
on camera in person it's pretty obvious

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.510 
on camera in person it's pretty obvious
it's<00:01:31.170> not<00:01:31.319> so<00:01:31.649> much<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.009> that's<00:01:32.190> gonna<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it's not so much so that's gonna be a

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.999 
it's not so much so that's gonna be a
problem<00:01:32.880> necessarily<00:01:33.660> but<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.899> is<00:01:34.050> obvious

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
problem necessarily but it is obvious

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.960 
problem necessarily but it is obvious
that<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:36.060> doesn't<00:01:36.360> match<00:01:37.550> this<00:01:38.550> is<00:01:38.729> hard

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that it doesn't match this is hard

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.790 
that it doesn't match this is hard
plastic<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.229> can<00:01:40.349> still<00:01:40.530> get<00:01:40.679> the

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
plastic here but you can still get the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.589 
plastic here but you can still get the
shoulders<00:01:41.160> posed<00:01:41.429> pretty<00:01:41.849> well<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.569> a

00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:42.599 
shoulders posed pretty well we have a

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:44.960 
shoulders posed pretty well we have a
ball<00:01:42.840> hinge<00:01:43.110> up<00:01:43.319> there<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.369> no<00:01:44.520> problems

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
ball hinge up there so no problems

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.669 
ball hinge up there so no problems
really<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.360> have<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.599> swiveling<00:01:46.200> bicep

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
really we have this swiveling bicep

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.339 
really we have this swiveling bicep
hinge<00:01:46.950> which<00:01:47.160> gives<00:01:47.369> us<00:01:47.459> almost<00:01:47.849> a<00:01:47.970> 45<00:01:48.360> or<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.810> 90

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:49.349 
hinge which gives us almost a 45 or a 90

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:52.309 
hinge which gives us almost a 45 or a 90
degree<00:01:49.619> Bend<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:50.940> these<00:01:51.330> swiveling

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
degree Bend we have these swiveling

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.130 
degree Bend we have these swiveling
wrist<00:01:52.830> hinge<00:01:53.190> which<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.880> okay<00:01:54.239> you<00:01:54.840> seem<00:01:54.989> to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
wrist hinge which is okay you seem to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.779 
wrist hinge which is okay you seem to
have<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.289> bit<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.649> trigger<00:01:55.920> finger<00:01:56.190> there<00:01:56.550> but

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
have a bit of a trigger finger there but

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.070 
have a bit of a trigger finger there but
I<00:01:56.849> think<00:01:57.030> that'll<00:01:57.239> be<00:01:57.270> alright<00:01:57.660> for<00:01:57.840> posing

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
I think that'll be alright for posing

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.540 
I think that'll be alright for posing
them<00:01:58.319> if<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.500> need<00:01:58.679> to<00:01:58.709> with<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.130> lightsaber

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
them if we need to with the lightsaber

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.300 
them if we need to with the lightsaber
this<00:02:00.330> side<00:02:00.539> same<00:02:00.780> articulation<00:02:01.110> but<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.130> have

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
this side same articulation but we have

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.160 
this side same articulation but we have
the<00:02:02.580> obviously<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.209> different<00:02:03.660> sculpt<00:02:03.989> which

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the obviously the different sculpt which

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.020 
the obviously the different sculpt which
is<00:02:04.319> nicely<00:02:04.679> painted<00:02:04.890> nicely<00:02:05.459> sculpted<00:02:05.580> so

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
is nicely painted nicely sculpted so

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.620 
is nicely painted nicely sculpted so
that's<00:02:06.209> good

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
that's good

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.330 
that's good
we<00:02:07.050> have<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> diaphragm<00:02:07.860> joint<00:02:08.160> that's

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
we have the diaphragm joint that's

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.219 
we have the diaphragm joint that's
really<00:02:08.580> low<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.270> doesn't<00:02:09.599> give<00:02:09.720> us<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.959> great

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
really low it doesn't give us a great

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.839 
really low it doesn't give us a great
range<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.619> motion<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.190> not<00:02:11.340> too<00:02:11.550> bad

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
range of motion but it's not too bad

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.170 
range of motion but it's not too bad
so<00:02:12.480> I'm<00:02:12.630> okay<00:02:12.930> with<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.580> we<00:02:14.580> do<00:02:14.760> have<00:02:14.940> this

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
so I'm okay with that we do have this

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.650 
so I'm okay with that we do have this
kind<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.680> soft<00:02:16.680> plastic<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.610> then<00:02:17.790> cloth<00:02:18.060> for

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
kind of soft plastic and then cloth for

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.839 
kind of soft plastic and then cloth for
the<00:02:18.720> skirt<00:02:19.170> part<00:02:19.469> which<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.709> okay<00:02:20.189> because<00:02:20.400> it

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
the skirt part which is okay because it

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.580 
the skirt part which is okay because it
allows<00:02:21.480> for<00:02:21.719> the<00:02:21.780> articulation<00:02:22.049> will<00:02:22.469> work

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
allows for the articulation will work

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.229 
allows for the articulation will work
just<00:02:22.620> fine<00:02:23.129> we<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.489> bring<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.790> hips<00:02:24.000> all<00:02:24.209> the

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
just fine we can bring the hips all the

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.130 
just fine we can bring the hips all the
way<00:02:24.360> forward

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
way forward

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.200 
way forward
not<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:25.830> far<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.250> side<00:02:26.520> but<00:02:26.790> that's<00:02:26.940> not<00:02:27.180> a

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
not so far to the side but that's not a

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.380 
not so far to the side but that's not a
huge<00:02:27.630> deal<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.290> thigh<00:02:28.560> swivel<00:02:29.390> zero

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390

this guy is a pretty good success the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.250 
this guy is a pretty good success the
only<00:02:53.550> thing<00:02:54.060> that's<00:02:54.240> really<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.660> complaint<00:02:55.020> for

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
only thing that's really a complaint for

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.890 
only thing that's really a complaint for
me<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.130> lack<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.760> likeness<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.630> the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
me is the lack of a likeness to the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.560 
me is the lack of a likeness to the
actual<00:02:58.590> actor<00:02:59.070> which<00:02:59.610> maybe<00:02:59.910> it's<00:03:00.120> not<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.270> huge

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
actual actor which maybe it's not a huge

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.300 
actual actor which maybe it's not a huge
deal<00:03:00.750> for<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:01.320> not<00:03:01.380> really<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> huge<00:03:02.250> deal

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
deal for you it's not really a huge deal

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.979 
deal for you it's not really a huge deal
for<00:03:02.550> me<00:03:02.760> since<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.150> didn't<00:03:03.360> really<00:03:03.390> like<00:03:03.750> the

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
for me since I didn't really like the

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.140 
for me since I didn't really like the
actor<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:04.380> played<00:03:04.739> him<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.820> just<00:03:05.850> would<00:03:06.120> have

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
actor that played him it just would have

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.940 
actor that played him it just would have
been<00:03:06.239> nice<00:03:06.540> since<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.930> is<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.080> movie<00:03:07.500> figure

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
been nice since it is a movie figure

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.040 
been nice since it is a movie figure
that<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.610> should<00:03:08.970> look<00:03:09.270> like<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.720> guy<00:03:09.840> in<00:03:09.959> the

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
that it should look like the guy in the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.720 
that it should look like the guy in the
movie<00:03:10.380> but<00:03:10.950> it's<00:03:11.100> still<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.310> really<00:03:11.489> good

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
movie but it's still a really good

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.729 
movie but it's still a really good
figure<00:03:12.060> nonetheless<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:13.230> lightsaber<00:03:13.650> is

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
figure nonetheless the lightsaber is

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.830 
figure nonetheless the lightsaber is
nice<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.220> blue<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.820> translucent<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.660> looks

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
nice and blue and translucent and looks

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.110 
nice and blue and translucent and looks
good<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:16.410> I'm<00:03:16.980> happy<00:03:17.040> with<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.580> guy<00:03:17.760> it's<00:03:17.970> got

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
good so I'm happy with this guy it's got

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.640 
good so I'm happy with this guy it's got
pretty<00:03:18.420> decent<00:03:18.630> paint<00:03:18.989> applications

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
pretty decent paint applications

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.830 
pretty decent paint applications
throughout<00:03:20.300> could<00:03:21.300> have<00:03:21.390> used<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.600> little<00:03:21.630> bit

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
throughout could have used a little bit

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.930 
throughout could have used a little bit
