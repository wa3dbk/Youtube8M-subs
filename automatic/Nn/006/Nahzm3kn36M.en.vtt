what<00:00:16.400> an<00:00:16.700> XD<00:00:17.090> k<00:00:17.240> sidecar<00:00:17.750> is<00:00:17.869> what<00:00:18.080> they<00:00:18.200> do<00:00:18.349> the

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
what an XD k sidecar is what they do the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.260 
what an XD k sidecar is what they do the
sidecar<00:00:19.010> is<00:00:19.160> that<00:00:19.310> things<00:00:19.520> thing<00:00:19.700> on<00:00:19.820> top<00:00:20.000> has

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
sidecar is that things thing on top has

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.019 
sidecar is that things thing on top has
a<00:00:20.300> lot<00:00:20.510> of<00:00:20.540> beeswax<00:00:21.170> about<00:00:21.380> them<00:00:21.849> as<00:00:22.849> you<00:00:23.000> can

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
a lot of beeswax about them as you can

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.480 
a lot of beeswax about them as you can
see<00:00:23.300> the<00:00:23.540> fat<00:00:23.810> side<00:00:24.110> cars<00:00:24.410> are<00:00:24.590> different<00:00:24.980> so

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
see the fat side cars are different so

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.939 
see the fat side cars are different so
it<00:00:25.610> really<00:00:25.820> depends<00:00:26.180> and<00:00:26.529> you<00:00:27.529> hook<00:00:27.650> it<00:00:27.770> up<00:00:27.859> to

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
it really depends and you hook it up to

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.120 
it really depends and you hook it up to
the<00:00:28.039> computer<00:00:28.430> using<00:00:28.670> a<00:00:29.090> USB<00:00:29.119> printer<00:00:29.750> cable

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
the computer using a USB printer cable

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.160 
the computer using a USB printer cable
so<00:00:31.130> what<00:00:31.279> the<00:00:31.340> sidecut<00:00:31.760> does<00:00:32.029> is<00:00:32.330> when<00:00:33.050> you

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
so what the sidecut does is when you

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.520 
so what the sidecut does is when you
build<00:00:33.410> an<00:00:33.739> Xbox<00:00:34.100> 360<00:00:34.670> project<00:00:35.150> in<00:00:35.960> Visual

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
360 game display a file now what does

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.780 
360 game display a file now what does
layout<00:00:41.870> file<00:00:42.080> does<00:00:42.320> is<00:00:42.620> it<00:00:43.340> allows<00:00:43.489> you<00:00:43.700> to

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
layout file does is it allows you to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.479 
layout file does is it allows you to
emulate<00:00:44.059> a<00:00:44.210> DVD<00:00:44.630> drive<00:00:44.930> to<00:00:45.620> actually<00:00:46.190> make<00:00:46.460> it

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
emulate a DVD drive to actually make it

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.959 
emulate a DVD drive to actually make it
think<00:00:47.000> that<00:00:47.379> there's<00:00:48.379> a<00:00:48.440> disc<00:00:48.649> in<00:00:48.829> there<00:00:49.010> I'll

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
think that there's a disc in there I'll

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:51.610 
think that there's a disc in there I'll
explain<00:00:50.239> more<00:00:50.450> in<00:00:50.570> a<00:00:50.629> minute<00:00:50.719> I'm<00:00:51.260> not<00:00:51.440> gonna

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
explain more in a minute I'm not gonna

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.110 
explain more in a minute I'm not gonna
use<00:00:51.770> this<00:00:51.890> as<00:00:52.070> this<00:00:52.190> is<00:00:52.340> just<00:00:52.489> a<00:00:52.579> sample<00:00:52.940> one

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
use this as this is just a sample one

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.180 
use this as this is just a sample one
I'm<00:00:53.840> going<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:54.170> use<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.590> one<00:00:54.739> here<00:00:54.980> which<00:00:55.100> I

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
I'm going to use the one here which I

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.860 
I'm going to use the one here which I
have<00:00:55.219> which<00:00:55.520> is<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.820> Gears<00:00:56.059> of<00:00:56.120> War<00:00:56.239> 3<00:00:56.660> beta

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
have which is the Gears of War 3 beta

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.830 
have which is the Gears of War 3 beta
one<00:00:57.399> so<00:00:58.399> you<00:00:58.489> just<00:00:58.760> open<00:00:58.910> you<00:00:59.360> double<00:00:59.600> click<00:00:59.719> on

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
one so you just open you double click on

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.869 
one so you just open you double click on
it<00:00:59.960> then<00:01:00.200> it<00:01:00.320> brings<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:00.649> to<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.860> editor<00:01:01.190> you

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
it then it brings you to the editor you

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.420 
it then it brings you to the editor you
also<00:01:02.149> edit<00:01:02.449> your<00:01:02.480> directories<00:01:03.410> and<00:01:03.620> rules<00:01:04.190> and

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
also edit your directories and rules and

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.529 
also edit your directories and rules and
whatnot<00:01:04.550> if<00:01:04.759> you<00:01:04.850> really<00:01:05.059> want<00:01:05.239> to<00:01:05.330> but<00:01:05.479> I

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
whatnot if you really want to but I

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:07.200 
whatnot if you really want to but I
don't<00:01:06.380> know<00:01:06.440> anything<00:01:06.649> about<00:01:06.740> that

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
don't know anything about that

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.719 
don't know anything about that
so<00:01:08.210> validate<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.869> files<00:01:09.140> you<00:01:10.130> know<00:01:10.250> you<00:01:10.610> know

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
so validate the files you know you know

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.050 
so validate the files you know you know
tiling<00:01:11.180> mode<00:01:11.300> you<00:01:11.450> got<00:01:11.570> accurate<00:01:12.880> typical<00:01:13.880> and

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
tiling mode you got accurate typical and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.300 
tiling mode you got accurate typical and
no<00:01:14.180> timing<00:01:14.689> now<00:01:14.869> accurate<00:01:15.500> means<00:01:15.799> it'll<00:01:16.100> be

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
no timing now accurate means it'll be

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.100 
no timing now accurate means it'll be
the<00:01:16.430> same<00:01:16.640> loading<00:01:16.909> times<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:17.540> act<00:01:17.840> pretty

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
the same loading times and act pretty

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.770 
the same loading times and act pretty
much<00:01:18.200> as<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:18.380> disk<00:01:18.760> typical<00:01:19.760> a<00:01:20.119> little<00:01:20.689> bit

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
much as a disk typical a little bit

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.510 
much as a disk typical a little bit
faster<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:21.380> no<00:01:21.560> timing<00:01:21.950> means<00:01:22.130> it'll<00:01:22.340> act

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
faster and no timing means it'll act

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.160 
faster and no timing means it'll act
like<00:01:22.729> it's<00:01:22.850> just<00:01:22.970> files<00:01:23.979> now<00:01:25.840> we<00:01:26.840> want<00:01:27.049> to<00:01:27.110> do

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
like it's just files now we want to do

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.109 
like it's just files now we want to do
is<00:01:27.380> just<00:01:27.530> click<00:01:27.740> emulate<00:01:28.189> on<00:01:28.310> here<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:28.909> when<00:01:29.060> I

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
is just click emulate on here and when I

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.060 
is just click emulate on here and when I
do<00:01:29.240> that<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.900> watch<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:31.689> closing<00:01:32.689> reading

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
do that you watch it closing reading

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.490 
do that you watch it closing reading
play<00:01:34.070> game<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.900> then<00:01:35.900> you<00:01:36.020> can<00:01:36.140> see<00:01:36.290> all<00:01:36.380> the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
play game and then you can see all the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.300 
play game and then you can see all the
data<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:36.890> whatnot<00:01:37.280> passing<00:01:37.790> through<00:01:38.060> on<00:01:38.990> here

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
data and whatnot passing through on here

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.130 
data and whatnot passing through on here
now<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.759> benefits<00:01:41.119> of<00:01:41.180> this<00:01:41.329> is<00:01:41.600> when

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
now the benefits of this is when

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.010 
now the benefits of this is when
developers<00:01:42.829> testing<00:01:43.509> they<00:01:44.509> don't<00:01:44.720> have<00:01:44.869> to

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
developers testing they don't have to

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.950 
developers testing they don't have to
burn<00:01:45.200> discs<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:46.340> play<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.790> games<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.299> they

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
burn discs to play the games and they

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.600 
burn discs to play the games and they
don't<00:01:48.110> have<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.320> constantly<00:01:48.500> move<00:01:48.950> files<00:01:49.340> over

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
don't have to constantly move files over

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.289 
don't have to constantly move files over
they<00:01:49.729> can<00:01:49.909> just<00:01:50.119> launch<00:01:50.479> them<00:01:50.720> from<00:01:50.750> that<00:01:52.299> now

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
they can just launch them from that now

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.450 
they can just launch them from that now
as<00:01:53.750> you'll<00:01:53.930> see<00:01:54.110> here<00:01:54.380> this<00:01:54.829> should<00:01:55.250> launch
