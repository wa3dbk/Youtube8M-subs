product<00:07:42.779> I<00:07:42.930> had<00:07:43.409> to<00:07:43.560> you<00:07:44.310> can't<00:07:44.610> use<00:07:45.149> magnet

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.050 
product I had to you can't use magnet

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.070 
product I had to you can't use magnet
with<00:07:46.919> this<00:07:47.099> because<00:07:47.520> they<00:07:48.240> stick<00:07:48.539> up<00:07:48.629> too<00:07:48.839> far

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 
with this because they stick up too far

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.709 
with this because they stick up too far
so<00:07:49.289> I<00:07:49.319> had<00:07:49.529> to<00:07:49.560> use<00:07:49.680> a<00:07:49.800> double<00:07:50.159> sided<00:07:50.370> tape<00:07:50.719> for

00:07:51.709 --> 00:07:51.719 
so I had to use a double sided tape for

00:07:51.719 --> 00:07:54.800 
so I had to use a double sided tape for
these<00:07:51.870> but<00:07:52.439> this<00:07:52.680> also<00:07:52.889> fits<00:07:53.399> the<00:07:53.520> NYX<00:07:54.330> trios

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:54.810 
these but this also fits the NYX trios

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.779

if you want to deep off those and put

00:07:56.789 --> 00:07:58.159 
if you want to deep off those and put
them<00:07:56.909> in<00:07:57.000> here<00:07:57.089> they<00:07:57.240> fit<00:07:57.449> perfectly<00:07:57.870> just

00:07:58.159 --> 00:07:58.169 
them in here they fit perfectly just

00:07:58.169 --> 00:07:59.899 
them in here they fit perfectly just
like<00:07:58.319> the<00:07:58.439> mac<00:07:58.649> but<00:07:59.189> you<00:07:59.310> do<00:07:59.430> have<00:07:59.580> to<00:07:59.729> put

00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:03.719 
you have to use the double sided tape

00:08:03.719 --> 00:08:05.779 
you have to use the double sided tape
