00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:29.470
 which is a nice thing to hear 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:36.430
 this buzz here all day so 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.430
 Pope then a satisfaction is beautiful

 the home of honey is a product 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.320
 ancient that is obtained with the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.070
 fermentation of water and honey at that 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.400
 right honey proportion ferment 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.649
 becomes intro honey or heathrow melis from 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.170
 Latin water to say I call it hydro 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.080
 honey because it is easier to understand which 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.549
 aims and becomes a becomes a drink 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.920
 very good 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.830
 the very ancient ancient hydro honey 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.450
 2 dead naval wagons and recipes 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.740
 living liter honey became 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.850
 immortals 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.520
 but probably because I think that a 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.830
 barbarian who lived in the forest than two 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.600
 liters of honey dro got drunk is 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:42.020
 become immortal or not drunk 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.020
 out 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.880
 this is the drones and it is left to ferment 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.570
 with a temperature like today 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.420
 as then followed by a little follow 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.509
 fermentations can not be poured when 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.119
 when it became a kind of wine e 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.119
 then it is left open it becomes vinegar 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.430
 no 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.020
 the enzyme- rich salts enzymes 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.120
 minerals 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.090
 they are then used to fix the others again 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.340
 minerals to create a flora anyway 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.460
 right intestinal bacterial grown 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.110
 similar in food in this sense is not 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.540
 that if you all go or have a wedding dinner you 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.930
 eat all the coffee and sweet courses 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.950
 ammazzacaffè and then the proceeds of 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.780
 tv management vinegar digest obviously 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.330
 simply city ​​can help but you 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.190
 works the intestine well e 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.920
 should eliminate fermentations 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.770
 bowel movements that occur with 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.220
 poor nutrition and you eat a 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:59.910
 example meat and cheese bring 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.360
 fermentations well the stress is anyway 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.540
 always a factor related to the intestine 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.710
 colitis are the two things I connected 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.990
 I think if it works well for you 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.400
 the intestine works well for you so many 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.470
 people had benefits for 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.560
 make vinegar do not use much 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.140
 in the salad it is used in bittersweet I 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.080
 I personally use it for example 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.960
 I make the mushrooms or aubergines clean 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.670
 in the vinegar and it is class of honey then it 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.490
 I dry 24 hours and helmet 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.000
 in oil and they are delicious that it is a 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.270
 natural vinegar a certain which is not with 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.430
 Chemical acids absolutely does not contain 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.000
 chemicals are ferment timedia 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.000
 flag 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.560
 no
