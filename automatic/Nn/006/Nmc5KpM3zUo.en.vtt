 performance with the least heat it 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:33.119
 China he comes first here top top 20 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:37.420
 Russian room on the tenth here is 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.610
 China indicators in the first place Russia 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.710

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.610
 Chinese garlic already ate here no one 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.140

 Russian garlic moreover Igor was 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.330
 tinkoff himself developed and implemented 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.039
 production of growing equipment 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.500
 garlic processing 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.840
 it has no analogues existing 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.239
 European equipment technologically 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.629
 more complex and ten times more expensive 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.970
 therefore orders for shebekinskiye seeders and 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.220
 cleaning machines come from all over 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.260

 business plan receive demand grants for 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.830
 Russian garlic is so great that 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.170
 Shebekino farmer buys it from 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.390
 population of many private owners 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.299

 their volumes to cover the needs 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.319
 the market is no longer enough but here's the paradox 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.069
 Belgorod region Shebekinsky 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.709
 garlic 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.880
 no follow him from all over the country but 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.890
 local sellers 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.890
 consider buying more profitable 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.799
 Chinese garlic is the basis 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:37.310
 northern regions 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:42.450
 Sakhalin takes Kamchatka garlic 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:45.019
 Well, but also the cities even take the shop 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.630
 chain stores that sell 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:52.370
 planting seeds store 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:57.299
 Nizhny Novgorod take it Samara Saratov 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:00.090
 Orenburg here and when processing which 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:07.650
 take on sausage cannery 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:10.640
 plants mainly 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:15.180
 mostly in the area nobody i somehow with 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:19.500
 Russia from all Russia sock I 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:22.440
 offered garlic your garlic like 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.440
 the farmer's shop is called here they are 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:31.380
 told themselves to bring and 50 pounds 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:33.360
 a week and 50 rubles 50 rubles each 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:38.520
 you better Chinese to trade them to ours 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.889
 garlic is not a bargain price if i 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.910
 I can sell for 90 rubles for 100 rubles 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:47.039
 per kilogram then why should I give one 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.220
 same shop farmer or other 50 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.220
 rubles 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.200
 vegetable growing and gardening this is exactly 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.700
 the case when the population is not needed 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.200
 persuade to support domestic 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.600
 manufacturer 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.060
 food safety issues 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.460
 common sense is always on 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.010
 the side of local fruits and vegetables 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.410
 but as it turned out this market is still 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.470
 open field for entrepreneurship 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.419

 branches of agriculture but with 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.080
 subject to the use of modern 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.490
 the implementation of which requires 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.680
 considerable investment 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.350
 this is why the region accepts 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.310
 development and support programs 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.639
 vegetable growing and gardening 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.710
 they are still at the initial stage of implementation 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:38.229
 but according to the laws of economics take advantage 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.850
 a chance at the beginning of the market development 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.550
 means to occupy it 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.290
 the lion's share on this new goodbye 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.270
 accents in a week we will place them in 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.290
 the correct order on the air world 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.919
 white mountains point ru 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.919
