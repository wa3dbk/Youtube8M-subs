00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
are watching us be MTW and we're just

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.229 
are watching us be MTW and we're just

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
like the underdog and it was unexpected

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.089 
like the underdog and it was unexpected
because<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.810> shoutcasters<00:02:43.290> thought<00:02:43.439> the<00:02:43.620> MTW

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
because the shoutcasters thought the MTW

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.280 
because the shoutcasters thought the MTW
we're<00:02:44.280> gonna<00:02:44.370> win<00:02:44.639> and<00:02:44.969> we<00:02:45.840> ended<00:02:46.049> up<00:02:46.169> winning
