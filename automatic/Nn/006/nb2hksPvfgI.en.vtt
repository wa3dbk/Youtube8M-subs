because<00:00:23.000> I<00:00:23.390> don't<00:00:23.600> know<00:00:23.660> if<00:00:23.779> you<00:00:23.840> can<00:00:23.960> see<00:00:24.109> in

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
because I don't know if you can see in

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.660 
because I don't know if you can see in
the<00:00:24.289> kill<00:00:24.500> feed<00:00:24.770> but<00:00:25.010> I<00:00:25.039> got<00:00:25.220> matched<00:00:25.430> up<00:00:25.550> with

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
the kill feed but I got matched up with

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.990 
the kill feed but I got matched up with
X<00:00:25.910> job<00:00:26.180> and<00:00:27.189> that's<00:00:28.189> not<00:00:28.430> really<00:00:28.490> the<00:00:28.939> only

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
X job and that's not really the only

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.460

especially with acog personally like
when<00:04:07.600> i<00:04:07.630> use<00:04:07.990> it<00:04:08.140> i<00:04:08.200> get<00:04:08.320> a<00:04:08.380> lot<00:04:08.530> of<00:04:08.590> recoil<00:04:08.830> with

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
when i use it i get a lot of recoil with

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.880 
when i use it i get a lot of recoil with
it<00:04:09.430> but<00:04:09.670> people<00:04:10.540> I've<00:04:10.870> noticed<00:04:11.440> say<00:04:11.710> that

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
it but people I've noticed say that

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.450 
it but people I've noticed say that
there<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.040> no<00:04:12.250> recoil<00:04:12.580> whatsoever<00:04:13.180> to<00:04:13.300> it<00:04:14.460> but

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
there is no recoil whatsoever to it but

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.580 
there is no recoil whatsoever to it but
every<00:04:15.880> time<00:04:16.030> I<00:04:16.090> seem<00:04:16.420> to<00:04:16.510> use<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:16.780> just<00:04:17.200> flares

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
every time I seem to use it just flares

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.530 
every time I seem to use it just flares
up<00:04:17.799> on<00:04:18.040> me<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:18.370> it's<00:04:18.670> really<00:04:18.760> annoying<00:04:19.299> so<00:04:19.330> I

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
up on me and it's really annoying so I

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.730 
up on me and it's really annoying so I
don't<00:04:19.960> use<00:04:20.080> it<00:04:20.260> at<00:04:20.350> all<00:04:20.470> but

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
don't use it at all but

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.980 
don't use it at all but
the<00:04:23.250> new<00:04:23.400> maps<00:04:23.669> again<00:04:25.099> I've<00:04:26.099> been<00:04:26.310> using<00:04:26.580> the

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
the new maps again I've been using the

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.600 
the new maps again I've been using the
ak-74<00:04:27.990> shoot<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:28.500> lot<00:04:28.830> on<00:04:29.039> them<00:04:29.190> because<00:04:29.310> that's

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
ak-74 shoot a lot on them because that's

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.610 
ak-74 shoot a lot on them because that's
really<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.000> only<00:04:30.120> way<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:30.419> can<00:04:30.630> like<00:04:31.319> clear

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
really the only way you can like clear

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.719 
really the only way you can like clear
out<00:04:31.770> campers<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.940> get<00:04:33.389> drop<00:04:33.569> shadow<00:04:34.699> but<00:04:35.699> uh

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
out campers and get drop shadow but uh

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.689 
out campers and get drop shadow but uh
because<00:04:36.590> everyone<00:04:37.590> just<00:04:37.740> camps<00:04:38.220> like<00:04:38.400> it

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
because everyone just camps like it

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.850 
because everyone just camps like it
seems<00:04:39.300> like<00:04:39.509> the<00:04:40.050> new<00:04:40.199> maps<00:04:40.440> are<00:04:40.680> way<00:04:40.830> more

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
seems like the new maps are way more

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.980 
seems like the new maps are way more
connection<00:04:41.550> based<00:04:41.759> then<00:04:42.180> like<00:04:42.539> it<00:04:42.720> has<00:04:42.960> been

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
connection based then like it has been

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.460 
connection based then like it has been
before<00:04:43.380> and<00:04:43.800> I<00:04:44.759> have<00:04:44.880> no<00:04:45.090> idea<00:04:45.270> why<00:04:45.479> but<00:04:45.930> three

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
before and I have no idea why but three

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.540 
before and I have no idea why but three
shots<00:04:46.800> would<00:04:47.069> be<00:04:47.250> famas<00:04:48.150> in<00:04:48.539> now<00:04:49.280> like<00:04:50.280> it

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
shots would be famas in now like it

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.939 
shots would be famas in now like it
doesn't<00:04:51.000> kill<00:04:51.330> people<00:04:51.360> where<00:04:52.020> if<00:04:52.410> I<00:04:52.560> get<00:04:52.740> shot

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
doesn't kill people where if I get shot

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.790 
doesn't kill people where if I get shot
once<00:04:53.250> it<00:04:53.520> kills<00:04:53.729> me<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.349> my<00:04:55.349> connections

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
once it kills me and my connections

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.200 
once it kills me and my connections
