00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.110
 approve shock but with them analyte 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.119
 can play not so reads himself 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:21.840
 prefers bad they do not even own 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.840
 one blow to the world more killed another hell 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.599
 Well, it could happen 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.450
 They were at number 19 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.850
 I won't say that I will be caught by surprise 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.010
 lovato hit was heavy tight 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.940
 I am text parallel with yesterday's match 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.190
 lizun head yes but i'm not ready yet 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.600
 I can tell from replays on to determine 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.899
 how much is to blame here 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.570
 if the Israeli goalkeeper is to blame first 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.579
 attack numerical first attack in which 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.070
 six or seven people took part 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.390
 the slope thoughts together 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.010
 Azerbaijani team Daavat position 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.680
 took the wrong one 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.399
 by himself or so planned by him 19 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.399
 national team number 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.320
 the gate is at fault 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.590
 if from defender the moment of impact did not see 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.780
 later pushed late 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.219
 doesn't matter should have seen 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.869
 In this case, and this is what we are 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.320
 threatened left to come but still 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.050
 developed not so fast and 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:36.770
 the choice of position and during this quo 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:38.570
 like there and even a draw will not give but on the game 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.000
 of essentially last minute and 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.680
 the merchant will help you sleep better here 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.100
 good gear that's good gear 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.170
 goal transfer yes if not yourself new 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.030
 must be because rushed into 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.920
 penalty 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.920
 left very active defender 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.470
 the correct position of the transfer it was 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.990
 done 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.540
 Already then the channel is our queen transfer 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.159
 there is no longer mattered to sleep 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.649
 protector on 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.239
 the viewer here is the correct position to 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.209
 center kept and here on the ball 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.030
 considered abs they just mark the translation 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.130
 whether you pass a couple back do not correctly say 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.870
 open up in api there is a situation when 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.940
 there is only one goalkeeper or one field 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.810
 player or no one left this 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.770
 the situation is combined v.d. 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.910
 here 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.910
 and somehow compares the score 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:37.010
 well, by the way, just yesterday 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:39.310
