does make quite a big difference I then

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.630 
does make quite a big difference I then

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
that's the first thing that I'd usually

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:15.440 
that's the first thing that I'd usually
do

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.280 

kind<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.140> like<00:02:16.290> painting

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.470 

same<00:02:23.830> time<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.250> concealers<00:02:24.819> getting<00:02:25.120> blended

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
same time the concealers getting blended

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:36.030 
same time the concealers getting blended
in

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.399 

looks<00:02:36.640> quite<00:02:36.849> aggressive<00:02:37.360> on<00:02:37.930> camera<00:02:38.290> but

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
looks quite aggressive on camera but

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:44.039 
looks quite aggressive on camera but
this<00:02:38.860> brush<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:40.260> really<00:02:41.260> soft<00:02:42.780> it's<00:02:43.780> getting

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
this brush is really soft it's getting

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.520 
this brush is really soft it's getting
it<00:02:44.170> all<00:02:44.260> blended<00:02:44.680> in

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
it all blended in

00:02:46.530 --> 00:03:08.700 
it all blended in
lastly<00:02:47.670> forehead

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.980 

just<00:03:09.400> try<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:09.820> get<00:03:10.270> under<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.660> neck<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:10.870> little

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
just try and get under the neck a little

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.510 
just try and get under the neck a little
bit<00:03:11.350> just<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:11.800> there<00:03:11.950> is<00:03:12.070> a<00:03:12.100> smooth

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
bit just so that there is a smooth

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.490 
bit just so that there is a smooth
gradient<00:03:12.730> it's<00:03:13.330> not<00:03:13.480> like<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.870> harsh<00:03:14.200> line

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
gradient it's not like that harsh line

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.540 
gradient it's not like that harsh line
okay<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.520> would<00:03:15.700> be<00:03:15.910> my<00:03:17.280> studio<00:03:18.280> fix

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
okay so that would be my studio fix

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.300 
okay so that would be my studio fix
fluid<00:03:19.050> applied<00:03:20.050> I<00:03:20.380> would<00:03:20.620> usually<00:03:20.740> just<00:03:20.950> move

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
fluid applied I would usually just move

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.030 
fluid applied I would usually just move
on<00:03:21.520> to<00:03:21.700> just<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.510> bit<00:03:22.660> of<00:03:22.780> highlighting<00:03:23.680> under

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
on to just a bit of highlighting under

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.670 
on to just a bit of highlighting under
the<00:03:24.310> brow<00:03:24.550> and<00:03:24.880> I'd<00:03:25.180> use<00:03:25.420> my<00:03:25.450> sleek<00:03:25.990> face

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
the brow and I'd use my sleek face

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.810 
the brow and I'd use my sleek face
contour<00:03:27.640> kit<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:30.340> one<00:03:30.520> on<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.730> right<00:03:30.880> here

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
contour kit this one on the right here

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.970 
contour kit this one on the right here
I'm<00:03:33.820> gonna<00:03:33.970> take<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.240> chunky<00:03:34.810> amount<00:03:35.110> on<00:03:35.830> the

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
I'm gonna take a chunky amount on the

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:49.900 
I'm gonna take a chunky amount on the
brush

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:04:02.080 

to<00:03:50.510> apply<00:03:52.330> so<00:03:53.330> that's<00:03:53.540> quite<00:03:53.780> blended

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.690 

so<00:04:02.599> that<00:04:02.750> would<00:04:02.900> be<00:04:03.110> one<00:04:03.290> brow<00:04:03.530> you<00:04:04.370> can<00:04:04.520> see

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
so that would be one brow you can see

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.000 
so that would be one brow you can see
the<00:04:04.819> difference<00:04:05.270> that<00:04:05.420> it<00:04:05.660> makes<00:04:05.930> between<00:04:06.739> the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
the difference that it makes between the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:32.530 
the difference that it makes between the
two

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.870 

and<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:33.200> that<00:04:33.320> would<00:04:33.440> be<00:04:33.500> my<00:04:34.070> under<00:04:34.730> eye

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880

so<00:06:35.970> don't<00:06:36.270> be<00:06:36.479> a<00:06:36.750> little<00:06:37.169> bit<00:06:37.319> scared<00:06:37.620> of<00:06:37.770> the

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
so don't be a little bit scared of the

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.570 
so don't be a little bit scared of the
shade<00:06:39.120> because<00:06:39.990> when<00:06:40.620> I<00:06:40.680> put<00:06:40.830> it<00:06:40.919> on<00:06:41.039> it<00:06:41.520> just

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
shade because when I put it on it just

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.059 
shade because when I put it on it just
kind<00:06:42.030> of<00:06:42.180> blends<00:06:42.599> in<00:06:42.810> and<00:06:43.050> the<00:06:43.590> reason<00:06:43.860> I<00:06:43.919> like

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:44.069 
kind of blends in and the reason I like

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:46.430 
kind of blends in and the reason I like
to<00:06:44.280> put<00:06:44.460> this<00:06:44.580> on<00:06:44.789> on<00:06:45.060> top<00:06:45.330> is<00:06:45.509> because<00:06:45.870> it's

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
to put this on on top is because it's

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.159 
to put this on on top is because it's
