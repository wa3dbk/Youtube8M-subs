lot<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.310> typical<00:01:56.790> workouts<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.630> conditioning

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
lot of typical workouts and conditioning

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.380 
lot of typical workouts and conditioning
programs<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.799> met<00:01:59.009> cons<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.909> will<00:02:00.090> get<00:02:00.240> them

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
programs and met cons that will get them

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.120 
programs and met cons that will get them
in<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.570> lot<00:02:00.750> better<00:02:00.930> shape<00:02:01.079> at<00:02:01.560> lighter<00:02:01.799> weights

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
in a lot better shape at lighter weights

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.120 
in a lot better shape at lighter weights
but<00:02:02.820> those<00:02:03.030> really<00:02:03.509> don't<00:02:03.810> cross<00:02:04.530> over<00:02:04.770> too

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
but those really don't cross over too

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.670 
but those really don't cross over too
much<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.640> terms<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.149> heavier<00:02:07.140> weights<00:02:07.380> for

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
much in terms of heavier weights for

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.040 
much in terms of heavier weights for
longer<00:02:08.069> met<00:02:08.310> cons<00:02:08.580> in

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
longer met cons in

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.800 
longer met cons in
typical<00:02:10.560> programming<00:02:11.070> so<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.360> best

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
typical programming so really the best

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.230 
typical programming so really the best
way<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.110> attack<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.070> best<00:02:14.250> way<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.490> to

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
way to attack that the best way to to

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.960 
way to attack that the best way to to
force<00:02:15.540> yourself<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:17.100> get<00:02:17.550> better<00:02:17.760> at<00:02:17.940> that

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
force yourself to to get better at that

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.650 
force yourself to to get better at that
and<00:02:18.180> allow<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:19.080> choke<00:02:19.800> through<00:02:20.190> and

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
and allow you to choke through and

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.600 
and allow you to choke through and
really<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:22.770> know<00:02:22.800> crush<00:02:23.160> those<00:02:23.400> type<00:02:23.580> of

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
really you know crush those type of

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.940 
really you know crush those type of
workouts<00:02:24.120> when<00:02:24.270> they<00:02:24.390> pop<00:02:24.660> up<00:02:24.690> is<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.680> follow

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
workouts when they pop up is to follow

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.010 
workouts when they pop up is to follow
this<00:02:26.250> really<00:02:26.550> done<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.790> simple<00:02:27.180> type<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.660> rep

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
this really done a simple type of rep

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.560 
this really done a simple type of rep
scheme<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.980> we<00:02:29.190> put<00:02:29.400> together<00:02:29.520> based<00:02:30.390> off

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
scheme that we put together based off

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.960 
scheme that we put together based off
any<00:02:30.750> workout<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.560> pops<00:02:31.830> up<00:02:32.070> these<00:02:32.760> are<00:02:32.880> on

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
any workout that pops up these are on

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.970 
any workout that pops up these are on
the<00:02:33.030> main<00:02:33.210> side<00:02:33.570> at<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.440> know<00:02:34.530> at<00:02:34.650> your<00:02:34.770> box

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
the main side at a you know at your box

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.240 
the main side at a you know at your box
and<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.870> know<00:02:36.990> gym<00:02:37.410> or<00:02:37.590> one<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:37.950> put

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
and you know gym or one that you put

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.440 
and you know gym or one that you put
together<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.760> know<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:38.910> really<00:02:39.180> need<00:02:39.270> to

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
together you know you really need to

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.830 
together you know you really need to
work<00:02:39.660> on<00:02:39.930> by<00:02:40.710> taking<00:02:41.160> these<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:42.060> ratio<00:02:42.510> and

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
work on by taking these this ratio and

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.800 
work on by taking these this ratio and
applying<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.070> your<00:02:44.430> workout<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.240> really

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
applying it to your workout is really

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.900 
applying it to your workout is really
going<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.050> allow<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.710> work<00:02:46.980> more<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:47.760> that

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
going to allow you to work more in that

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.600 
going to allow you to work more in that
power<00:02:48.180> endurance<00:02:48.630> level<00:02:49.260> at<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.130> right<00:02:50.340> rep

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
power endurance level at the right rep

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.700 
power endurance level at the right rep
range<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.180> you're<00:02:51.330> able<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.690> benefit<00:02:52.110> overall

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
range so you're able to benefit overall

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.190 
range so you're able to benefit overall
and<00:02:53.130> become<00:02:53.460> a<00:02:53.490> better<00:02:53.610> crossfitter<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:54.930> what

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
and become a better crossfitter so what

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.500 
and become a better crossfitter so what
this<00:02:55.410> means<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:56.100> be<00:02:56.250> you're<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:57.060> increase<00:02:57.360> your

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
this means to be you're to increase your

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.440 
this means to be you're to increase your
power<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.990> strength<00:02:58.230> endurance<00:02:58.590> numbers<00:02:59.070> is

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
power and strength endurance numbers is

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.490 
power and strength endurance numbers is
basically<00:03:00.450> if<00:03:00.840> if<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.980> workout<00:03:02.570> it<00:03:03.570> has<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.870> you

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
basically if if a workout it has a you

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.380 
basically if if a workout it has a you
know<00:03:04.530> we<00:03:04.800> can<00:03:04.920> fit<00:03:05.070> say<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.280> couplet<00:03:05.700> or<00:03:05.970> triplet

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
know we can fit say a couplet or triplet

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.260 
know we can fit say a couplet or triplet
and<00:03:06.540> one<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.320> movements<00:03:07.620> has<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.280> total<00:03:08.910> of

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
and one of the movements has a total of

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.760 
and one of the movements has a total of
100<00:03:10.050> plus<00:03:10.320> reps<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:11.180> then<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.540> want<00:03:12.960> to<00:03:13.200> make

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
100 plus reps and then you want to make

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.890 
100 plus reps and then you want to make
sure<00:03:13.800> that<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.280> run<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.880> know<00:03:15.330> prescribed

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
sure that you run it you know prescribed

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.420 
sure that you run it you know prescribed
from<00:03:16.500> there<00:03:16.709> it<00:03:16.830> starts<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.220> get<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.370> little

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
from there it starts to get a little

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.120 
from there it starts to get a little
different<00:03:18.000> is<00:03:18.209> if<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.320> workout<00:03:19.890> has

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
different is if that workout has

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.910 
different is if that workout has
anywhere<00:03:20.610> between<00:03:20.760> 50<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.420> 100<00:03:21.989> reps<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.830> are

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
anywhere between 50 to 100 reps you are

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.500 
anywhere between 50 to 100 reps you are
related<00:03:23.720> 50%<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:24.930> your<00:03:25.080> 1<00:03:25.350> rep<00:03:25.590> max<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:26.190> that

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
related 50% of your 1 rep max of that

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.660 
related 50% of your 1 rep max of that
movement<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:27.840> if<00:03:28.320> it's<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.709> if<00:03:29.190> it's<00:03:29.400> front

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
movement so if it's a if it's front

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.660 
movement so if it's a if it's front
squat<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:30.720> have<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.260> total<00:03:31.620> like<00:03:31.770> 75<00:03:32.310> reps

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
squat and you have a total like 75 reps

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.699 
squat and you have a total like 75 reps
in<00:03:32.880> there<00:03:33.090> then<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.900> want<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.260> run<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.680> a

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
in there then you want to run that a

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.080 
in there then you want to run that a
minimum<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.670> know<00:03:35.760> 50%<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:37.140> 500<00:03:37.770> 315<00:03:38.459> that

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
minimum of you know 50% so 500 315 that

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.300 
minimum of you know 50% so 500 315 that
would<00:03:39.300> put<00:03:39.510> me<00:03:39.690> somewhere<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.440> know<00:03:40.560> 100<00:03:41.430> 160

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
would put me somewhere you know 100 160

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.130 
would put me somewhere you know 100 160
155<00:03:45.140> 160<00:03:46.140> for<00:03:46.830> my<00:03:47.310> workout<00:03:47.730> for<00:03:48.060> all<00:03:48.150> 50<00:03:48.570> to<00:03:48.750> 100

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
155 160 for my workout for all 50 to 100

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.870 
155 160 for my workout for all 50 to 100
reps<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.590> really<00:03:49.890> start<00:03:50.130> hammering<00:03:50.459> and

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
reps to really start hammering and

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.550 
reps to really start hammering and
helping<00:03:51.540> more<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.870> power<00:03:52.080> endurance

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
helping more of the power endurance

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.760

strength<00:03:53.550> endurance<00:03:53.940> type<00:03:54.330> level<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.230> then

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
strength endurance type level and then

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.040 
strength endurance type level and then
finally<00:03:56.280> if<00:03:56.400> it's<00:03:56.550> a<00:03:56.640> workout<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.750> would

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
finally if it's a workout that I would

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.690 
finally if it's a workout that I would
say<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.290> know<00:03:58.410> some<00:03:58.680> 50<00:03:59.250> reps

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
say you know some 50 reps

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.330 
say you know some 50 reps
I<00:03:59.850> put<00:04:00.510> 45<00:04:00.959> up<00:04:01.200> here<00:04:01.410> just<00:04:01.680> because<00:04:01.830> I<00:04:02.190> was

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
I put 45 up here just because I was

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.240 
I put 45 up here just because I was
thinking<00:04:02.640> something<00:04:02.850> more<00:04:03.120> like<00:04:03.480> Fran<00:04:04.130> but<00:04:05.130> if

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
thinking something more like Fran but if

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.770 
thinking something more like Fran but if
you<00:04:05.400> really<00:04:05.670> want<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.000> attack<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.570> really

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
you really want to attack and really

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.220 
you really want to attack and really
want<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:06.989> force<00:04:07.290> yourself<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.830> get<00:04:08.010> used<00:04:08.280> to

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
want to force yourself to get used to

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.690 
want to force yourself to get used to
moving<00:04:10.230> heavier<00:04:10.620> weight<00:04:10.800> for<00:04:11.040> longer<00:04:11.370> periods

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
moving heavier weight for longer periods

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.880 
moving heavier weight for longer periods
of<00:04:11.760> time<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.150> building<00:04:12.450> up<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:12.660> power<00:04:13.290> and

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
of time and building up that power and

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.710 
of time and building up that power and
power<00:04:14.580> endurance<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.239> strength<00:04:15.390> endurance

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
power endurance and strength endurance

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.780 
power endurance and strength endurance
then<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.500> were<00:04:16.620> on<00:04:16.859> something<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.459> movement

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
then you were on something a movement

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.460 
then you were on something a movement
that<00:04:17.970> sub<00:04:18.359> 50<00:04:19.049> reps<00:04:19.320> at<00:04:20.310> 75%<00:04:21.150> you're

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
that sub 50 reps at 75% you're

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.100 
that sub 50 reps at 75% you're
so<00:04:22.620> for<00:04:22.889> example<00:04:22.979> last<00:04:23.520> time<00:04:23.699> I<00:04:23.970> actually<00:04:24.690> did

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
so for example last time I actually did

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.050 
so for example last time I actually did
a<00:04:25.139> heavy<00:04:25.380> thruster<00:04:26.130> single<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.580> was<00:04:26.699> somewhere

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
a heavy thruster single it was somewhere

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.969 
a heavy thruster single it was somewhere
believe<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.780> was<00:04:27.900> at<00:04:28.100> 285<00:04:29.100> and<00:04:29.930> so<00:04:30.930> if<00:04:31.350> I<00:04:31.650> wanted

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
believe I was at 285 and so if I wanted

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.210 
believe I was at 285 and so if I wanted
to<00:04:32.040> run<00:04:32.370> Fran<00:04:32.850> purely<00:04:33.810> based<00:04:34.050> off<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.350> power

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
to run Fran purely based off a power

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.770 
to run Fran purely based off a power
endurance<00:04:35.639> and<00:04:36.030> building<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.510> strength

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
endurance and building and strength

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.689 
endurance and building and strength
endurance<00:04:37.050> and<00:04:37.290> building<00:04:37.620> that<00:04:37.800> side<00:04:38.160> up<00:04:38.460> I

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
endurance and building that side up I

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.830 
endurance and building that side up I
would<00:04:39.240> take<00:04:39.449> to<00:04:40.020> you<00:04:40.800> know<00:04:40.919> to<00:04:40.979> 75<00:04:41.699> to<00:04:42.120> 85<00:04:42.510> and

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
would take to you know to 75 to 85 and

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.150 
would take to you know to 75 to 85 and
run<00:04:43.290> at<00:04:43.440> 75%<00:04:43.979> of<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:45.090> I'd<00:04:45.389> be<00:04:45.540> 140<00:04:46.260> um<00:04:46.500> I

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
run at 75% of that so I'd be 140 um I

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.159 
run at 75% of that so I'd be 140 um I
don't<00:04:47.790> know<00:04:47.910> I<00:04:48.000> can't<00:04:48.330> do<00:04:48.449> math<00:04:48.690> on<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:48.960> fly

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
don't know I can't do math on the fly

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.040 
don't know I can't do math on the fly
140<00:04:49.889> plus<00:04:50.010> another<00:04:51.380> 72<00:04:52.820> plus<00:04:53.820> another<00:04:54.090> yeah<00:04:54.360> 72

10 205 someone that 200 and 210 range I

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.680 
10 205 someone that 200 and 210 range I
believe<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:59.760> can<00:04:59.910> don't<00:05:00.090> check<00:05:00.300> my<00:05:00.449> math<00:05:00.660> and

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
believe you can don't check my math and

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.590 
believe you can don't check my math and
if<00:05:01.050> I'm<00:05:01.229> wrong<00:05:01.500> don't<00:05:02.370> hate<00:05:02.550> me<00:05:02.729> but<00:05:02.940> it<00:05:03.300> would

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
if I'm wrong don't hate me but it would

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.290 
if I'm wrong don't hate me but it would
be<00:05:03.750> so<00:05:04.050> I<00:05:04.080> would<00:05:04.320> be<00:05:04.410> running<00:05:04.620> Fran<00:05:05.010> add<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.430> tour

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
be so I would be running Fran add a tour

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.980 
be so I would be running Fran add a tour
and<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:07.050> tutor<00:05:07.919> pounds<00:05:08.520> for<00:05:09.330> thrusters<00:05:09.810> and

and a tutor pounds for thrusters and

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.529 
and a tutor pounds for thrusters and
that<00:05:10.110> is<00:05:10.289> going<00:05:10.500> to<00:05:10.620> just<00:05:10.949> destroy<00:05:11.639> me<00:05:11.880> but

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
that is going to just destroy me but

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
know body and system used to handling

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.390 
know body and system used to handling
heavier<00:05:21.930> weights<00:05:22.260> for<00:05:22.590> longer<00:05:22.949> periods<00:05:23.310> of

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
heavier weights for longer periods of

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.379 
heavier weights for longer periods of
time<00:05:23.460> and<00:05:24.050> operating<00:05:25.050> at<00:05:25.199> am<00:05:25.950> a<00:05:26.280> heavier<00:05:26.880> level

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
time and operating at am a heavier level

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.050 
time and operating at am a heavier level
so<00:05:27.990> start<00:05:28.650> plugging<00:05:28.919> this<00:05:29.190> type<00:05:29.430> of<00:05:29.460> formula

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
so start plugging this type of formula

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.510 
so start plugging this type of formula
