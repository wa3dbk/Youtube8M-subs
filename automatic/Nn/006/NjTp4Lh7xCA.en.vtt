patients is truly the best thing for

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.639 
patients is truly the best thing for
them<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.190> really<00:00:51.059> believe<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.329> at<00:00:51.840> Penn<00:00:52.260> our

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
them I really believe that at Penn our

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.229 
them I really believe that at Penn our
department<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.309> really<00:00:53.430> second<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.000> none<00:00:54.180> in

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239

department is really second to none in
this<00:00:54.510> country<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.230> have<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:56.360> technology

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
this country we have the technology

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.720 
this country we have the technology
available<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.930> very<00:00:58.260> few<00:00:58.469> people<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:59.010> one

available that very few people have one
of<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> technologies<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.570> here<00:01:01.350> is

of the technologies we have here is

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.930 
of the technologies we have here is

therapy it's a technique in which we

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.120 
therapy it's a technique in which we
will<00:01:06.360> be<00:01:06.420> able<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.930> maximize<00:01:07.530> amount<00:01:08.040> of
