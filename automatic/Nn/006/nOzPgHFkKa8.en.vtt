00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.959 
there are a lot of women who don't
normally<00:01:51.049> play<00:01:51.409> in<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:51.979> bigger<00:01:52.250> events<00:01:52.789> maybe

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
normally play in the bigger events maybe

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.819 
normally play in the bigger events maybe
because<00:01:53.390> they're<00:01:53.630> intimidated<00:01:53.750> by<00:01:54.469> the<00:01:54.530> men

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
because they're intimidated by the men

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.499 
because they're intimidated by the men
or<00:01:55.310> they<00:01:55.520> just<00:01:55.549> don't<00:01:55.700> feel<00:01:55.909> comfortable<00:01:55.969> and

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
or they just don't feel comfortable and

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.959 
or they just don't feel comfortable and
I<00:01:56.539> think<00:01:57.219> showing<00:01:58.219> that<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:58.670> know<00:01:58.759> woman

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
I think showing that you know woman

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.730 
I think showing that you know woman
could<00:01:59.240> win<00:01:59.450> would<00:01:59.929> be<00:02:00.079> really<00:02:00.259> great<00:02:00.469> for<00:02:00.500> the

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
could win would be really great for the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.620 
could win would be really great for the
game<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.250> I<00:02:01.700> think<00:02:01.909> you<00:02:01.969> would<00:02:02.060> attract<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.509> lot

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
game and I think you would attract a lot

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.630 
game and I think you would attract a lot
of<00:02:02.659> people<00:02:02.990> as<00:02:03.109> well<00:02:03.289> so<00:02:03.619> that<00:02:03.649> would<00:02:03.859> be<00:02:03.890> thing

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
of people as well so that would be thing

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.039 
of people as well so that would be thing
really<00:02:04.939> positive<00:02:05.479> there's<00:02:05.659> been<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:05.810> lot<00:02:06.020> of

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
really positive there's been a lot of

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.349 
really positive there's been a lot of
