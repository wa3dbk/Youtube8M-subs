00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.919
 hello together I'll show you now 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:12.030
 the sky go website with him 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:13.830
 different offers from sky online 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.839
 see for example bundesliga 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.260
 champions league so sport in itself or 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.570
 even the latest movies or series and 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.500
 so on I'll show you that now always 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.930
 with me on the laptop 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.890
 For this he would simply have to webbrowser 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.119
 open and go to sky go 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.660
 I have that here already 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.170
 then the idea has the home page 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.530
 the page and then have to be here too 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.440
 then log in the skater first 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.300
 you automatically get an account 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.489
 conclusion of a contract 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.090
 So as I said if you now to 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.640
 example bundesliga then want to look 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.410
 close your bundesliga bundesliga 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.270
 contract and then automatically 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.390
 the opportunity to use 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.420
 For that he is concerned with password and 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.170
 your username on the homepage and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.990
 log in 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.939
 I have already done that and 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.170
 then just go to sport then 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.210
 now had the opportunity here to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.640
 choose and for example football england 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.549
 premier league football bundesliga 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.369
 conference golf european tour 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.110
 Here you have to say that then 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.390
 always on the packages arrives the one at 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.659
 booked sky means if you for example 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.619
 only the Bundesliga package has the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.270
 not possible now 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.090
 the english premier league itself 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.090
 to watch or the golf tournament 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.340
 You would then need to be under one 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.979
 other package for example then that 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.950
 premium package I have my case now 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.360
 posted here the bundesliga package and 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.430
 then go here on the times 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.680
 possibility of bundesliga saturday 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.979
 conference and click on it 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.500
 and then it continues now 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.759
 and then I can strengthen here now 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.960
 select start the video and then 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.820
 is now first a location check 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.540
 made system is the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.020
 authorization- 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:14.320
 and then we see we are already 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.630
 also online and then the 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.580
 to follow the conference of the Bundesliga 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:26.290
 the quality is very good the picture is 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:28.600
 most of the time razor-sharp and and 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.890
 is actually a very comfortable way and 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.810
 The Bundesliga is then 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.880
 to watch even if you're on the road 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:40.750
 because the sky go website is there too 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.209
 for the mobile as a sky go app what really 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.320
 a very practical thing is good then 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.320
 I wish you much fun
