00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.480
 hello everyone welcome to another video 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.189
 commented on new gt information 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.110
 5 rockstar games was published 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.060
 several hours and I just realized 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.800
 now thanks to two people who me 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.259
 They have said on twitter that they are Miguel 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.599
 angel and gerard thank you very much both 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.279
 Well, I just woke up 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.259
 right now you are never normal at 4 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.700
 the morning because then this happens to you and you 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.950
 you know hours after new things 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.750
 of the gta and on new things like this 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.180
 in the first photo and the best one in me 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.710
 opinion we see a shark here and it seems 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.690
 a shark like that of far cry 3 or 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.820
 It is not a white shark but it could be 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.320
 a bull shark or something like that but good 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.699
 It's cool to him because he 'll attack you, it's like 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.379
 the great redemption but better still 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.879
 now with sharks also because they 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.219
 can swim in the vision render is not 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.920
 could then in this other picture we see 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.649
 a small submarine of these one 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.329
 person or two to explore the background 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.620
 marine because it has to be huge and 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:08.740
 huge and fly a lot and surely good 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.100
 if they do it well there is no air reserve 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.590
 infinite if you do not have some bottles 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.479
 of air but maybe hard hours like that 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.340
 I do not know what they will do if it is realistic and 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.890
 you can not be 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.630
 an indefinite time under water or 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.880
 that you can be like two hours 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.100
 but is that who is going to throw two 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.450
 hours underwater so may not 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.700
 put it like gasoline of 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.740
 still do not know if they are going to 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.840
 put a good one here we see the dog's 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.789
 franklin called chop 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.820
 sitting in the passenger seat and 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.609
 this looks like a voodoo car or a morning or 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.380
 one of that style and little else I can take 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.270
 from this photo in this other photo we see 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.090
 michael who seems to be a little 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.069
 seen me I do not think I'm looking 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.409
 straight I think it's looking a bit like 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.950
 with oblique eyes 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.740
 still looking at something that is close to 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.319
 him and it looks like he's half a disc gives me 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.299
 the feeling seems a bit and well 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:08.259
 behind we see franklin and trevor 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:10.720
 supported on the woman's red sentinel 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.330
 michael known to woman 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.760
 michael had a feel lxs tuned red 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.530
 and that is a red car is a sentinel 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.870
 it will be the same sentinel that is added in 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.610
 the trailer 2 when they saved the son of 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.160
 michael last photograph what 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.450
 we see is a hunt and in the distance further back 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.190
 this is not a fighter this is an airplane 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.500
 large that looks the same andromeda or 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.299
 the typical military cargo plane that 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.220
 it came out in trailer 2 when it came out 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.110
 shamrock throwing himself with a car from him 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.420
 Well here comes trevor driving this 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.069
 big plane it is even possible that it is 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.660
 the same mission that just took off 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.549
 from the airport and Trevor is 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.609
 carrying and when in the area of 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:49.299
 desert is shot with him with the ika jeep 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:51.819
 parachute and that bottom hunt does not 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.680
 it seems neither franklin nor maikel because 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.000
 it looks like he's wearing a helmet so he could 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.829
 be a military fighter that wants to shoot down 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Trevor for stealing that plane and I do not 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.860
 well up here at the end of the video 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.460
 I hope you liked it 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.460
 and until next time
