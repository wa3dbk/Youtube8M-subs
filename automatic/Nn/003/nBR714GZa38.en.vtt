one thing we made larger was the battery
in<00:04:41.590> fact<00:04:42.130> iphone<00:04:42.700> 4<00:04:43.000> delivers<00:04:43.510> up<00:04:43.690> to<00:04:43.750> forty

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
in fact iphone 4 delivers up to forty

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.900 
in fact iphone 4 delivers up to forty
percent<00:04:44.620> more<00:04:44.919> talk<00:04:45.130> time

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
percent more talk time

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.170 
percent more talk time
and<00:04:47.480> we<00:04:47.690> started<00:04:48.290> with<00:04:48.760> completely<00:04:49.760> opposing

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
and we started with completely opposing

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.720 
and we started with completely opposing
goals<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:50.900> we<00:04:51.560> wanted<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:51.890> make<00:04:52.070> this<00:04:52.220> iphone

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
goals and we wanted to make this iphone

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.000 
goals and we wanted to make this iphone
more<00:04:53.390> capable<00:04:53.900> we<00:04:54.200> wanted<00:04:54.470> to<00:04:54.530> add<00:04:54.710> more

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
more capable we wanted to add more

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.790 
more capable we wanted to add more
feature<00:04:55.340> and<00:04:55.970> yet<00:04:56.690> at<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.840> same<00:04:56.900> time<00:04:57.110> we

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
feature and yet at the same time we

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.320 
feature and yet at the same time we
wanted<00:04:58.070> to<00:04:58.100> make<00:04:58.220> it<00:04:58.370> smaller<00:04:58.580> and<00:04:58.970> even

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
wanted to make it smaller and even

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.570 
wanted to make it smaller and even
thinner<00:04:59.630> and<00:04:59.990> that<00:05:00.770> lets<00:05:00.980> us<00:05:01.100> some<00:05:01.310> really

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
thinner and that lets us some really

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.930 
thinner and that lets us some really
surprising<00:05:01.880> innovation<00:05:03.640> and<00:05:04.640> we<00:05:04.760> developed

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
surprising innovation and we developed

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.690 
surprising innovation and we developed
an<00:05:05.300> entirely<00:05:05.840> new<00:05:06.020> grade<00:05:06.530> stainless<00:05:07.190> steel

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
an entirely new grade stainless steel

steel frame functions is the antenna but

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.570 
steel frame functions is the antenna but
also<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.810> primary<00:05:18.050> structure<00:05:18.830> giving<00:05:19.400> us

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
also the primary structure giving us
