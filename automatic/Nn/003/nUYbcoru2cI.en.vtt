00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.769
 after 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.820
 it's a crazy thing with 7 this 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.559
 car who so the last 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.440
 representative of high-end French 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.969
 that our minis are to know is that 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.360
 does it sells today more in 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.830
 China in France its first market 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.989
 it is already the china villa in the 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.480
 sedans a little classic such incident 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:29.079
 because ultimately our policies that 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:33.040
 sit down and who are not 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:36.520
 enough my opinion non tran supporters 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.780
 minds and should know that it's already 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.899
 what is exported in chief is 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.579
 unbelievable so here it is here is the 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.670
 508 in front of them they did they did 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.079
 good job what and not need 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.280
 to explain to people that there is a 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.710
 formula that I like a lot 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.649
 a little observers whom I greet at 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.760
 passage who said gilles vidal is 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.589
 got to shut up the mouths to the more 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.600
 young julie access director ten years 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.030
 and it is true that he has he closed the 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.800
 calenders and wild and the ones to tighten 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.199
 their now he has a thousand of lyon at 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.490
 middle after that they were there you 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.540
 I showed you will see a small excerpt 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.650
 I had not spent the last time 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.630
 in which I did with him where he 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.980
 talk about what he wants to do with 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.570
 the creeks why he does that for 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.970
 what to know that we are still 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.110
 completely in status and something 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.630
 we do not see love parties and fires 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.900
 day are here they flashing are over 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.120
 dense or even light signature this 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.710
 which is very important now has sold 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.290
 the xenon headlights you go 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.120
 now all edges fouquereau citizen 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.520
 will be done using a 44-3 mast his 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.820
 side then in there there are plenty of 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.700
 have concluded and techno and consuming 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.320
 less is very beautiful he had said 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.960
 pidal who wanted technology this is the 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.890
 look 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.500
 it's true that it changes the face then 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.560
 they did it also behind nothing 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.130
 claw-shaped lights a corbiÃ¨res 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.049
 pink material is politics night 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.390
 it's clear a bit like a halo 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.950
 complete very good thing they removed 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:10.190
 the lah with chrome keys that had 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.470
 because often we sign luxury has to 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.700
 little expense by adding that 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.440
 adding chrome is crystal clear beyond 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.610
 to remove it I think it makes good sense very 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.430
 well on the other hand is a small detail 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.900
 for once the people of the design of 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.040
 sailboats that line of bodywork 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.170
 who actually if we look very closely 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.390
 continue on fire but if you are from 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.430
 far away you have the impression that there is a 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.440
 break in this blog the bodywork 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.050
 resume there good I think it's wanted 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.060
 but in addition we have a lot of days 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.780
 there is a set like that the csc 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.700
 it's still a little bit 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.870
 difficult 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.160
 and then then on this kind of bagnols 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.870
 which actually is for the Minister 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.579
 but to the fleet manager ie 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.160
 especially to people who will buy for 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.450
 the quarters with the real fight it is 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.790
 on the engines on emissions 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.590
 of co2 so there are new ones 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.880
 engines that are all Euro6 compliant 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.489
 to standards the standards euro6 these standards 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.140
 European countries demand emissions 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.620
 the most demanding pollution 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.910
 so there is a 160 horsepower thp 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.709
 who really good that I led game 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.250
 and its costs we do not take back who makes him 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.720
 125 g and then the diesels are 1,150 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.670
 horses which is 105 grams that 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.540
 go there will be the bulk of the westerlies 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.769
 deinol and then there are 180 horses and 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.790
 always with their he now proposes 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.290
 their 6-speed automatic transmission 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.650
 children 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.209
 and it's not bad it's a good compromise 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.400
 I prefer a hundred times the senses is 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.879
 what we are going to see we really see that 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.879
 it is an audi a4 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:47.439
 it's the big sun life on a the 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.439
 lease orc 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.210
 finally what I told you this name 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.510
 minister that's what will see reborn and 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.980
 me that most of the time in the back 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.780
 then will take advantage of this handful of 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.460
 keeping that little light thing 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.460
 are added a little gadget in general 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.520
 offered message as long as he sees there is 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.710
 in a way it's art to 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.140
 the back of these atmospheres 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.850
 will confide power and 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.340
 opposition 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.700
 so the 508 has a side of the courtroom in 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.900
 does a little confessions yes for 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.340
 conclude I would say it's still 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.890
 well damn my car is a little 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.120
 heavy but overall this makes three 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.120
 quarter of an hour that I drive is at that 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.280
 it would be like a rib of beef 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.409
 which would be a bit overcooked it's up to 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.819
 to say that it's good meat but 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.039
 you have a little overcooked without 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.599
 to say that the air so little too much of abbas is 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.569
 a little bit we sing we feel it 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:50.210
 is very good base but by the weight 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:51.740
 probably wanting a little bit of 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.780
 firmness on the counter 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.849
 but the base is very good here 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.879
 and to give another picture of what 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.860
 it's just a 508 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.479
 it's for me it would be really cdh 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.710
 halfway between a mercedes and an audi 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.320
 you 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.060
 classified an older generation coming 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.370
 and an audi a4 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.110
 for me it's a bit of a mix of these 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.940
 two of these two that's what they have 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.940
 wanted good you forget bmc very right 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.930
 Here it is 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:26.699
 good copies good student well as to 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.699
 will do better next time says better 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.960
 the more playful but there is a 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.550
 well 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.550
 a beautiful car 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.120
 no 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.100
 quite if we observe at 500 liters 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.940
 if the team actually take out the lion 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.350
 goes down a quarter by taclant of 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.150
 verticalize norms and me why do you 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.300
 their food on the lady in pink explains 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.620
 also long discussion cd also 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.000
 fo change to change 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.070
 not just I think there are some 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.460
 major automotive trends and to 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.979
 the time we are going to say the 90s and 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.900
 2000 the and the faces before being 13 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.130
 years old rolls at the end of life it was not a 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.270
 obligation surely there must have been a 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:10.530
 tendency to return to school 13 years 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.510
 rolled and so the different codes 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:16.590
 graphics of each brand distributed 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:18.419
 on his front sides so rolled the lion 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.090
 the rise was something strong of 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.800
 very visible and line and maintenance and 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.020
 instead of two if we want to play a 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.669
 certain elegance a certain minimalism 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.440
 at the level of graphical interventions 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.940
 on a front side for example 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.139
 the moment the grille which is still 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.120
 in cause enough upscale finally 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.949
 the logo of the calender that was playing was 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.360
 a very long time we see quite well 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.460
 green to verticalize gain of 7 hours 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.840
 but also to lengthen in perception the 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.030
 hood finally same radiation as paris 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.280
 and toy games elegance 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.440
 this is his face on the elegance of 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.229
 the more upscale side of the 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.870
 silhouette a very approach 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.789
 interesting and rosanna particular 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.380
 are simple the version why not 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:57.000
 can give an incredible character to the 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.280
 car is perfectly legitimate since 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.970
 it was present for almost thirty 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.970
 in the history of peugeot
