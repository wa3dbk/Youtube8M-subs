first<00:00:24.439> first<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.590> table<00:00:30.109> it's<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.189> is

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
first first on table it's it's this is

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.780 
first first on table it's it's this is
also<00:00:32.730> big<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.649> don't<00:00:34.649> know<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.160> don't<00:00:35.370> know<00:00:35.550> but

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
also big I don't know I don't know but

better<00:00:42.170> better<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.440> better<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.219> we

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
better better and better and that we

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.299 
better better and better and that we
show<00:00:44.579> character<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.899> are<00:00:46.050> good<00:00:46.770> team<00:00:47.039> for
