anti-american I can't answer that I
can't<00:01:43.890> answer<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.429> you<00:01:44.969> can<00:01:45.359> assume<00:01:46.020> that

there is a certain amount of

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.410 
there is a certain amount of
rabble-rousing<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.399> even<00:01:50.939> think<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.240> that's

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
rabble-rousing I even think that that's

rabble-rousing I even think that that's
the<00:01:51.570> wrong<00:01:51.780> expression<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:52.500> your<00:01:52.890> if<00:01:53.130> your

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
the wrong expression if your if your

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.639 
the wrong expression if your if your

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
profound way you can obviously presume

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.800
