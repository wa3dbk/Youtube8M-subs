it's a totally different story and
probably<00:06:39.849> should<00:06:40.120> be<00:06:40.409> performed<00:06:41.409> in<00:06:41.740> another

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 
probably should be performed in another

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:43.889 
probably should be performed in another
concept<00:06:42.490> just<00:06:42.759> these<00:06:42.909> two<00:06:43.210> together<00:06:43.629> with

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:43.899 
concept just these two together with

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:45.119 
concept just these two together with
something<00:06:44.199> else<00:06:44.379> so<00:06:44.589> I<00:06:44.620> think<00:06:44.740> we'll<00:06:45.009> be<00:06:45.039> fine

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:45.129 
something else so I think we'll be fine

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:48.990 
something else so I think we'll be fine
with<00:06:45.550> these<00:06:45.729> first<00:06:46.659> four
