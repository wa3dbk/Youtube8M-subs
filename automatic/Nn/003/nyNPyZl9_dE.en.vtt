00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:09.400
 In general, the next order from 15 to 22 siri 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.790
 box viburnum 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:16.630
 Hatch should have such a box turned out 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.980
 height is 44 45 centimeters just 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.180
 so he 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.980
 sat down did not interfere with its width maximum then 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.610
 there is again doing 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:32.949
 all available space between the arches and here 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.370
 as usual port setting somewhere 33 35 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.030
 hertz 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.750
 approximately in these areas of the square 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.390
 little relative level 260 270 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.949
 squares the calculation was more even 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.949
 the shelf here as usual terminals 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:56.520
 so the game is a result of a sucker channel to mac should 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.520
 audio 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.149
 shooting ass 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.910

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.609
 actually have a game this spirit kanalnik

 4 ohms while on the warm-up that is speaker 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:59.840
 the day before he was brought oak barrels edge 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.630
 turned out to be honest around 90 8 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.390
 liters principle landmark was the music and 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.579
 not too low blacks basically everything 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.900
 He plays of course as he will dissolve 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:15.769
 much lower than pleasant but so far 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:18.650
 I hope soon when the customer and remove the flex 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.579
 I already have his car and am not mistaken 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.900
 It seems to be x 900 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.480
 actually it will be much 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.170
 more interesting than my two-channel themes 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.170
 more in 1st 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.800
 noticed some feature of the car 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.290
 interesting on previous tracks was sharp 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.930
 recession that is sines from top to bottom and 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:10.030

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.640
 the role in the course of somewhere 30 hertz staggers 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.670
