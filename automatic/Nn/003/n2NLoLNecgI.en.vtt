Oh<00:00:05.140> righto<00:00:06.140> sure<00:00:07.330> vibrato<00:00:08.330> I<00:00:08.809> have<00:00:09.650> some

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
Oh righto sure vibrato I have some

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.310 
Oh righto sure vibrato I have some
exercises<00:00:10.549> that<00:00:10.700> I<00:00:10.730> find<00:00:11.090> are<00:00:11.270> quite<00:00:11.690> useful

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
exercises that I find are quite useful

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.109 
exercises that I find are quite useful
although<00:00:13.039> the<00:00:13.369> broader<00:00:13.610> there<00:00:13.820> different

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:14.119 
although the broader there different

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.599 
although the broader there different
kinds<00:00:14.150> of<00:00:14.510> a<00:00:14.600> rod<00:00:14.809> so<00:00:15.309> I'm<00:00:16.309> going<00:00:16.460> to<00:00:16.490> talk

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
kinds of a rod so I'm going to talk

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.460 
kinds of a rod so I'm going to talk
about<00:00:16.670> handle<00:00:17.420> Bronner<00:00:17.630> right<00:00:17.900> now<00:00:18.109> and

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
about handle Bronner right now and

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.169 
about handle Bronner right now and
that's<00:00:18.920> that's<00:00:19.250> used<00:00:19.609> a<00:00:19.759> lot

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:20.179 
that's that's used a lot

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.489 
that's that's used a lot
so<00:00:20.660> what<00:00:21.529> exercise<00:00:22.160> which<00:00:23.060> is<00:00:23.089> a<00:00:23.630> little<00:00:24.259> bit

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:24.499 
so what exercise which is a little bit

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.370 
so what exercise which is a little bit
probably<00:00:25.099> quite<00:00:25.400> common<00:00:25.910> is<00:00:26.060> to<00:00:26.660> put<00:00:26.929> your

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
probably quite common is to put your

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.339 
probably quite common is to put your
second<00:00:28.220> finger<00:00:28.329> which<00:00:29.329> is<00:00:29.359> this<00:00:29.810> one<00:00:30.079> here

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
second finger which is this one here

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.210 
second finger which is this one here
long<00:00:30.740> finger<00:00:31.189> right<00:00:32.180> up<00:00:32.390> here<00:00:32.950> not<00:00:33.950> down<00:00:33.980> here

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
long finger right up here not down here

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.910 
long finger right up here not down here
you<00:00:34.670> can<00:00:34.940> but<00:00:35.329> I<00:00:35.540> think<00:00:36.020> it's<00:00:36.170> easier<00:00:36.680> if<00:00:36.800> you

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
you can but I think it's easier if you

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.640 
you can but I think it's easier if you
feel<00:00:37.220> this<00:00:37.730> a<00:00:38.000> little<00:00:38.300> bit<00:00:38.540> close<00:00:39.230> to<00:00:39.260> where

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
feel this a little bit close to where

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.610 
feel this a little bit close to where
your<00:00:39.770> hand<00:00:40.040> is<00:00:40.280> anyway<00:00:41.120> to<00:00:41.180> do<00:00:41.420> this<00:00:41.690> and<00:00:41.960> then

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
your hand is anyway to do this and then

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.660 
your hand is anyway to do this and then
you<00:00:42.860> roll<00:00:43.190> your<00:00:43.370> fingertip<00:00:43.970> back<00:00:45.520> towards<00:00:46.520> the

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
you roll your fingertip back towards the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.870 
you roll your fingertip back towards the
pegs<00:00:46.970> and<00:00:47.720> then<00:00:48.050> move<00:00:48.380> it<00:00:48.560> back<00:00:48.740> where<00:00:49.280> it<00:00:49.370> was

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
pegs and then move it back where it was

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.540 
pegs and then move it back where it was
now<00:00:50.870> you<00:00:50.930> can't<00:00:51.380> think<00:00:51.680> of<00:00:51.830> moving<00:00:52.040> it<00:00:52.310> back

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
now you can't think of moving it back

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.520 
now you can't think of moving it back
and<00:00:52.910> then<00:00:53.030> rolling<00:00:53.360> it<00:00:53.450> forward<00:00:53.530> but

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
and then rolling it forward but

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.280 
and then rolling it forward but
generally<00:00:55.070> speaking<00:00:55.100> if<00:00:55.790> you<00:00:56.480> do<00:00:56.690> that<00:00:56.900> your

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
generally speaking if you do that your

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.620 
generally speaking if you do that your
note<00:00:57.530> lights<00:00:57.920> down<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.250> little<00:00:58.400> too<00:00:58.700> high<00:00:58.940> cuz

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
note lights down a little too high cuz

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.510 
note lights down a little too high cuz
you<00:00:59.780> know<00:00:59.840> you<00:00:59.900> put<00:01:00.170> your<00:01:00.350> finger<00:01:00.650> here<00:01:00.950> for

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
you know you put your finger here for

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.910 
you know you put your finger here for
broto<00:01:01.820> varies<00:01:02.240> the<00:01:02.390> pitch<00:01:02.630> it<00:01:02.960> makes<00:01:03.620> it<00:01:03.770> go

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
broto varies the pitch it makes it go

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.820 
broto varies the pitch it makes it go
slightly<00:01:04.430> lower<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:05.059> slightly<00:01:05.720> higher<00:01:05.990> it's

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
slightly lower and slightly higher it's

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.700 
slightly lower and slightly higher it's
slightly<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.570> I<00:01:08.840> like<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.229> roll<00:01:09.530> the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
slightly and so I like to roll the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.530 
slightly and so I like to roll the
fingertip<00:01:10.100> back

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
fingertip back

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.030 
fingertip back
and<00:01:12.290> a<00:01:13.220> good<00:01:13.400> ideas<00:01:13.820> shout<00:01:14.240> because<00:01:15.080> gradually

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
and a good ideas shout because gradually

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.670 
and a good ideas shout because gradually
you<00:01:16.190> need<00:01:16.400> to<00:01:16.490> go<00:01:16.640> a<00:01:16.670> little<00:01:16.790> faster

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
you need to go a little faster

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.200 
you need to go a little faster
so<00:01:18.680> let's<00:01:18.950> say<00:01:19.070> you<00:01:19.220> start<00:01:19.250> off<00:01:19.700> like<00:01:19.970> this

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
so let's say you start off like this

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.960 
so let's say you start off like this
with<00:01:20.900> a<00:01:20.930> wide<00:01:21.280> slow<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.460> wide<00:01:22.630> then<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:24.320> say<00:01:24.560> 1

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
with a wide slow and wide then you say 1

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.160 
with a wide slow and wide then you say 1
1<00:01:26.620> 2<00:01:27.620> 1<00:01:28.360> 2

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
1 2 1 2

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.530 
1 2 1 2
I'm<00:01:30.470> going<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:30.800> faster<00:01:31.310> 1<00:01:32.300> 2<00:01:32.950> 1<00:01:33.950> 2<00:01:34.250> as<00:01:35.150> you<00:01:35.390> get

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
I'm going to faster 1 2 1 2 as you get

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.540 
I'm going to faster 1 2 1 2 as you get
faster<00:01:35.750> you<00:01:36.500> want<00:01:36.770> you're<00:01:37.070> going<00:01:37.220> to<00:01:37.280> want<00:01:37.460> to

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
faster you want you're going to want to

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.140 
faster you want you're going to want to
get<00:01:37.670> narrow<00:01:38.060> is<00:01:38.840> if<00:01:39.080> it's<00:01:39.320> too<00:01:39.650> wide<00:01:40.160> you<00:01:40.880> can't

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
get narrow is if it's too wide you can't

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.350 
get narrow is if it's too wide you can't
go<00:01:41.270> fast<00:01:41.480> it<00:01:41.870> takes<00:01:42.020> too<00:01:42.260> long<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.190> this<00:01:44.150> way

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
go fast it takes too long so this way

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.899 
go fast it takes too long so this way
one<00:01:44.720> two<00:01:45.220> one<00:01:46.220> two

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.649 

gradually<00:01:49.750> you'll<00:01:50.049> get<00:01:50.229> it<00:01:50.350> faster<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:52.329> you

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
gradually you'll get it faster so you

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.230 
gradually you'll get it faster so you
don't<00:01:53.289> need<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.530> use<00:01:53.619> your<00:01:53.649> bow<00:01:53.920> at<00:01:54.280> first<00:01:54.670> but

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
don't need to use your bow at first but

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.539 
don't need to use your bow at first but
if<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:55.390> really<00:01:55.719> want<00:01:55.899> to<00:01:55.990> know<00:01:56.399> what<00:01:57.399> it's

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
if you really want to know what it's

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.490 
if you really want to know what it's
sounding<00:01:58.030> like<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:58.509> can<00:01:58.720> do<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:58.990> yeah

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.479 

now<00:02:04.250> they<00:02:04.460> will<00:02:04.610> look<00:02:04.790> faster

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:21.479 

nothing<00:02:09.489> faster<00:02:11.790> now<00:02:12.790> more<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:21.250> don't

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
nothing faster now more so and you don't

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.890 
nothing faster now more so and you don't
want<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.730> make<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.090> vibrato<00:02:22.390> too<00:02:22.660> wide

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
want to make the vibrato too wide

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.880 
want to make the vibrato too wide
especially<00:02:23.739> when<00:02:24.280> you're<00:02:24.430> up<00:02:24.550> high<00:02:28.890> because

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
especially when you're up high because

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.150 
especially when you're up high because
apply<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.569> press<00:02:31.989> even<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> fingers<00:02:32.709> have<00:02:33.040> to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
apply you press even the fingers have to

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.949 
apply you press even the fingers have to
be<00:02:33.280> much<00:02:33.430> closer<00:02:33.700> together<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.360> spacing<00:02:34.840> is

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
be much closer together the spacing is

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.140 
be much closer together the spacing is
really<00:02:35.290> close<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:36.130> think<00:02:36.489> about<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.910> if<00:02:36.970> you

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
really close so think about it if you

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.759 
really close so think about it if you
move<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.510> pitch<00:02:37.750> too<00:02:38.080> much<00:02:38.319> you're<00:02:38.590> going<00:02:38.709> to

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
move the pitch too much you're going to

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.470 
move the pitch too much you're going to
get<00:02:38.920> like<00:02:39.099> three<00:02:39.370> notes<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.970> don't<00:02:40.000> want<00:02:40.299> that

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
get like three notes you don't want that

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.660 
get like three notes you don't want that
so<00:02:40.959> it<00:02:41.110> takes<00:02:41.380> something<00:02:41.680> doing<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.220> do<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.400> very

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
so it takes something doing to do a very

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.210 
so it takes something doing to do a very
small<00:02:42.850> ones<00:02:43.239> too<00:02:43.569> but<00:02:43.840> anyway<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.739> start<00:02:45.100> out

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
small ones too but anyway you start out

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:55.080 
small ones too but anyway you start out
down<00:02:45.430> here<00:02:53.459> then<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:54.610> can<00:02:54.760> use<00:02:54.910> different

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
down here then you can use different

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.790 
down here then you can use different
fingers

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.460

and<00:03:04.980> it's<00:03:05.880> good<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.300> press<00:03:06.690> your<00:03:06.930> thumb<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:07.380> a

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
and it's good to press your thumb just a

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.040 
and it's good to press your thumb just a
little<00:03:07.920> bit<00:03:08.040> or<00:03:08.340> make<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.180> some<00:03:09.420> very<00:03:09.750> light

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
little bit or make it some very light

little bit or make it some very light
some<00:03:10.830> people<00:03:11.220> like<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.400> do<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:11.790> exercise

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
some people like to do this exercise

some people like to do this exercise
with<00:03:12.600> their<00:03:12.750> thumb<00:03:12.990> away<00:03:13.350> from<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.710> neck

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
with their thumb away from the neck

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.820 
with their thumb away from the neck
that's<00:03:14.730> very<00:03:15.180> interesting<00:03:15.900> because<00:03:16.350> that

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
that's very interesting because that

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.580 
that's very interesting because that
forces<00:03:17.280> your<00:03:17.640> ham<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.600> do<00:03:18.780> all<00:03:18.960> the<00:03:19.140> work<00:03:19.320> in

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
forces your ham to do all the work in

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.190 
forces your ham to do all the work in
your<00:03:19.770> end<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.070> have<00:03:20.280> freedom<00:03:20.730> in<00:03:21.090> your<00:03:21.690> hand

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
your end you have freedom in your hand

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.980 
your end you have freedom in your hand
you<00:03:22.740> don't<00:03:22.890> clutch<00:03:23.610> it<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:24.300> can't<00:03:24.540> press<00:03:24.750> too

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
you don't clutch it you can't press too

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.170 
you don't clutch it you can't press too
tightly<00:03:25.290> but<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.250> have<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.580> press<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:27.000> note

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
tightly but you have to press the note

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.330 
tightly but you have to press the note
down<00:03:27.450> enough<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:28.110> feel<00:03:28.350> is<00:03:28.560> rolling<00:03:29.130> back<00:03:29.310> and

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
down enough the feel is rolling back and

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.620 
down enough the feel is rolling back and
forth<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:31.470> that's<00:03:31.650> one<00:03:31.950> exercise<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.880> this

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
forth so that's one exercise and this

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.230 
forth so that's one exercise and this
other<00:03:33.840> one<00:03:34.110> which<00:03:34.770> I<00:03:35.040> really<00:03:35.400> like<00:03:35.610> because<00:03:35.910> it

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
other one which I really like because it

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.480 
other one which I really like because it
really<00:03:36.930> gets<00:03:37.110> your<00:03:37.380> hand<00:03:37.710> to<00:03:38.070> know<00:03:38.220> which

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
really gets your hand to know which

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.280 
really gets your hand to know which
direction<00:03:38.730> you're<00:03:39.060> going<00:03:39.090> see<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.020> first

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
direction you're going see the first

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.170 
direction you're going see the first
one's<00:03:40.560> good<00:03:40.830> but<00:03:41.070> sometimes<00:03:41.310> people<00:03:41.880> will<00:03:42.030> go

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
one's good but sometimes people will go

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.390 
one's good but sometimes people will go
this<00:03:42.390> direction<00:03:42.930> we<00:03:43.080> don't<00:03:43.290> want<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.620> want

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
this direction we don't want that want

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.460 
this direction we don't want that want
to<00:03:44.520> go<00:03:44.640> along<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.390> side<00:03:45.630> of<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.900> string<00:03:46.200> along

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
to go along the side of the string along

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.620 
to go along the side of the string along
the<00:03:46.680> length<00:03:46.860> of<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.100> string<00:03:47.400> maybe<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.330> little

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
the length of the string maybe a little

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.100 
the length of the string maybe a little
bit<00:03:48.900> sideways<00:03:49.200> just<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.860> here
