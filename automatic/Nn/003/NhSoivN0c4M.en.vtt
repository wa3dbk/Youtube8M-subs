not<00:01:40.560> really<00:01:40.740> much<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.310> about<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.579> not

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
not really much we can do about that not

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.060 
not really much we can do about that not
got<00:01:42.509> much<00:01:42.540> removal<00:01:43.229> going<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.200> five<00:01:46.860> of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
got much removal going on so five of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.149 
got much removal going on so five of
three<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:49.040> I<00:01:51.229> could've<00:01:52.229> us<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.560> activate<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
three and I could've us it activate the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.370 
three and I could've us it activate the
wind<00:01:53.340> resides<00:01:53.670> there<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.149> as<00:01:54.990> he<00:01:55.170> only<00:01:55.259> had

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
wind resides there but as he only had

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.139 
wind resides there but as he only had
one<00:01:55.590> manner<00:01:55.799> open<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.340> figured<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.119> would

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
one manner open I figured that I would

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.819 
one manner open I figured that I would
be<00:01:57.390> better<00:01:57.540> off<00:01:57.689> playing<00:01:57.990> out<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.200> hero<00:01:58.500> blade

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
be better off playing out the hero blade

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.060 
be better off playing out the hero blade
hold<00:02:00.170> considering<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.500> don't<00:02:01.829> know<00:02:01.950> of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
hold considering that I don't know of

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.709 
hold considering that I don't know of
any<00:02:02.189> one<00:02:02.670> man<00:02:02.820> account<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:03.329> spell<00:02:03.509> that

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
any one man account with spell that

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.020 
any one man account with spell that
would<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:03.930> been<00:02:04.049> able<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.320> counter<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:06.500> so<00:02:07.500> I

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
would have been able to counter it so I

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.249 
would have been able to counter it so I
think<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.179> been<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> bigger<00:02:09.629> advantage<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
think it's been a bigger advantage to

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.290 
think it's been a bigger advantage to
get<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.440> hero<00:02:10.590> on<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.979> board<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.910> it's<00:02:12.209> very

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
get the hero on the board so it's very

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.790 
get the hero on the board so it's very
difficult<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.750> deal<00:02:12.959> with<00:02:12.989> and

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
difficult to deal with and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.560 
difficult to deal with and
bounce<00:02:14.280> he's<00:02:14.670> probably<00:02:14.880> not<00:02:15.090> got<00:02:15.270> any<00:02:15.420> way<00:02:15.540> to

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
bounce he's probably not got any way to

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.450 
bounce he's probably not got any way to
deal<00:02:15.840> with<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.080> once<00:02:16.230> it's<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.530> the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
deal with it once it's on the

substantially<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.670> biggest<00:03:23.970> threat<00:03:24.380> or<00:03:25.380> at

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
substantially the biggest threat or at

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.729 
substantially the biggest threat or at

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.190 
could attack with the hero this term but
I<00:03:33.780> figured<00:03:34.620> it'd<00:03:34.680> be<00:03:34.770> better<00:03:34.950> if<00:03:35.190> ya<00:03:35.989> got<00:03:36.989> more

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.750 

so<00:04:54.230> I<00:04:54.260> block<00:04:54.560> with<00:04:54.680> exactly<00:04:55.040> one<00:04:55.220> soldier<00:04:55.610> I

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
so I block with exactly one soldier I

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.920 
so I block with exactly one soldier I
should<00:04:56.000> be<00:04:56.030> able<00:04:56.210> to<00:04:57.580> kill<00:04:58.580> in<00:04:58.700> exactly<00:04:59.510> 14

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
should be able to kill in exactly 14

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.380 
should be able to kill in exactly 14
damage<00:05:00.260> as<00:05:01.100> it<00:05:01.160> turns<00:05:01.460> out<00:05:01.580> i<00:05:01.640> luckily<00:05:02.060> top

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
damage as it turns out i luckily top

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.330 
damage as it turns out i luckily top
deck<00:05:02.600> another<00:05:03.110> out<00:05:03.320> which<00:05:03.800> is<00:05:03.980> intangible

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
deck another out which is intangible

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.950 
deck another out which is intangible
virtue<00:05:06.250> so<00:05:07.250> if<00:05:07.460> even<00:05:08.060> if<00:05:08.180> I<00:05:08.300> wasn't<00:05:08.600> able<00:05:08.750> to

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
virtue so if even if I wasn't able to

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.720 
virtue so if even if I wasn't able to
make<00:05:08.990> the<00:05:09.200> 14<00:05:09.470> damage<00:05:09.740> I<00:05:09.890> would<00:05:09.919> have<00:05:10.130> won<00:05:10.520> with

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
make the 14 damage I would have won with

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.600 
make the 14 damage I would have won with
that<00:05:10.910> but<00:05:11.810> I<00:05:12.110> wasn't<00:05:12.830> quite<00:05:13.010> as<00:05:13.190> lucky<00:05:13.340> is

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
that but I wasn't quite as lucky is

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.720 
that but I wasn't quite as lucky is
there<00:05:14.380> it<00:05:15.380> looks<00:05:15.560> like<00:05:15.650> because<00:05:16.070> I<00:05:16.250> would<00:05:16.610> have

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
there it looks like because I would have

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.680 
there it looks like because I would have
actually<00:05:17.090> won<00:05:17.360> either<00:05:17.540> way<00:05:17.780> I<00:05:17.990> believe<00:05:18.620> so

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
actually won either way I believe so

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.300 
actually won either way I believe so
really<00:05:20.690> tight<00:05:20.900> but<00:05:21.230> we<00:05:21.410> managed<00:05:21.919> to<00:05:21.980> squeeze

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
really tight but we managed to squeeze

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.960 
really tight but we managed to squeeze
out<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:22.610> win<00:05:22.760> their<00:05:23.230> very<00:05:24.230> close<00:05:24.620> and<00:05:25.610> there

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
out the win their very close and there

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.930 
out the win their very close and there
let's<00:05:26.300> get<00:05:26.419> them<00:05:26.540> to<00:05:26.660> game<00:05:26.780> two
