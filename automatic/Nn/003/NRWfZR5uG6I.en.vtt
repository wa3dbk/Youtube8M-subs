00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.930
 hello guys welcome to live is 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.610
 snowing outside and it's really cold 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.250
 so it's a good day to cook with 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.929
 Alvaro today we are going to prepare a recipe 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.029
 that I have not prepared in my fucking life but 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.009
 that I wanted to try a long time ago and 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.539
 It is very simple to have breakfast for 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:26.490
 Even for dessert 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.289
 and these are the ingredients 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.320
 only with that we're going to do some 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.230
 banana pancakes ok let's go there 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.670
 good first of all 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.240
 is to open the banana 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.920
 that is, peel it 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.790
 your pleasure to the one in good condition 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.060
 as you can see 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:53.280
 and nothing gets chopped and gets 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.280
 inside the blender 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.360
 then the eggs 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.020
 and 2 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.680
 then we take the blender 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.120
 because if we are not going to roll the bar 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.120
 and we 're going 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.229
 and it's already good, it 's no but it's already 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.229
 the blender 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.400
 and now this here I already prepared 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.060
 warm 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.060
 we miss it 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.550
 and there goes a 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.550
 this to the maximum 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.020
 and this should be done 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.719
 we take a spatula 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.060
 to 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.620
 no luck and no weeks of age 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.170
 missing a bit still 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.170
 she smells she smells 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.890
 yes 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.879
 ah 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.750
 ok let's turn it around I promise 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.560
 nothing 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.560
 oh my cut 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:24.130

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.680
 a perfect pancake 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.379
 perfectly made 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.590
