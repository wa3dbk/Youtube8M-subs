00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.369 
94 runecrafting so it did manage to do
it<00:00:44.159> good<00:00:44.489> times<00:00:44.839> although<00:00:45.839> this<00:00:46.050> week<00:00:46.260> you

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379

have<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.680> UM<00:00:46.800> dungeon<00:00:47.190> even<00:00:47.370> think<00:00:47.519> about<00:00:47.610> so

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
have the UM dungeon even think about so

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.520 
have the UM dungeon even think about so
for<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.180> most<00:00:48.329> part<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.809> don't<00:00:49.199> really<00:00:49.289> done

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
for the most part I don't really done

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.770 
for the most part I don't really done
anything<00:00:49.770> else<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.879> account<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.449> just

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
anything else on this account I just

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.209 
anything else on this account I just
went<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.050> salmon<00:00:52.379> did<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> bit<00:00:52.739> dungeoneering

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
went on salmon did a bit dungeoneering

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.290 
went on salmon did a bit dungeoneering
so<00:00:53.879> yeah<00:00:54.829> probably<00:00:55.829> should<00:00:56.370> maybe<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:57.149> some

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
so yeah probably should maybe do some

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.880 
so yeah probably should maybe do some
dungeon<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.930> window<00:00:58.230> although<00:00:58.769> i<00:00:58.800> think

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
dungeon on this window although i think

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.770 
dungeon on this window although i think
is<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.129> last<00:00:59.340> day<00:00:59.519> of<00:00:59.550> double<00:00:59.940> tokens<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.570> I

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
is the last day of double tokens so I

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.570 
is the last day of double tokens so I
don't<00:01:01.620> know<00:01:01.710> Lucy<00:01:02.460> Robbins<00:01:02.820> ah<00:01:04.280> but<00:01:05.280> anyway<00:01:05.550> I

don't know Lucy Robbins ah but anyway I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.400 
don't know Lucy Robbins ah but anyway I
