00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
obviously feel are just some growth from

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.229 
obviously feel are just some growth from
our<00:00:46.739> younger<00:00:47.039> players<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.700> past<00:00:48.000> couple

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
our younger players have the past couple

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.029 
our younger players have the past couple
games<00:00:48.510> kind<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.870> giving<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.140> preparation<00:00:49.829> for

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
games kind of giving you preparation for

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.689 
games kind of giving you preparation for
this<00:00:50.160> type<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.489> game<00:00:51.079> I<00:00:52.079> think<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> surface

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
this type of game I think on the surface

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.610 
this type of game I think on the surface
you<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.940> say<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> think<00:00:54.719> inside<00:00:55.350> that

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
you can say that but I think inside that

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.500 
you can say that but I think inside that
there's<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.039> nervousness<00:00:56.850> or<00:00:57.180> with

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
there's going to be nervousness or with

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.590 
there's going to be nervousness or with
everybody<00:00:57.960> involved<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:59.309> think<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.390> most

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
everybody involved and I think the most

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.049 
everybody involved and I think the most
important<00:01:01.170> thing<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.379> us<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.309> time<00:01:02.850> that

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
important thing for us is the time that

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.579 
important thing for us is the time that
we<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.329> now<00:01:03.570> between<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.110> morning<00:01:04.350> and

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
we have now between this morning and

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.700 
we have now between this morning and
tonight<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.180> get<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.510> rest<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
tonight is just to get the the rest the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.490 
tonight is just to get the the rest the
nutrition<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.460> make<00:01:09.119> sure<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.540> our<00:01:09.689> mental

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
nutrition and make sure that our mental

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.560 
nutrition and make sure that our mental
approach<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.340> where<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.939> needs<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
approach is where it needs to be and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.960 
approach is where it needs to be and
that's<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.590> test<00:01:14.159> that's<00:01:14.369> going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.640> come<00:01:14.790> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that's the test that's going to come to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.429 
that's the test that's going to come to
our<00:01:15.000> group<00:01:15.270> you've<00:01:15.630> worked<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:15.900> hard<00:01:16.020> getting

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
our group you've worked so hard getting

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.530 
our group you've worked so hard getting
these<00:01:16.920> guys<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> right<00:01:17.970> condition<00:01:18.390> all

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
these guys in the right condition all

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.660 
these guys in the right condition all
season<00:01:18.900> long<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.950> really<00:01:20.310> starting<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
season long is that really starting to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.460 
season long is that really starting to
show<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.119> maybe<00:01:21.659> having<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.170> little<00:01:22.259> extra

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
show and maybe having that little extra

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.940 
show and maybe having that little extra
jump<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:22.979> their<00:01:23.130> legs<00:01:23.310> especially<00:01:24.740> last<00:01:25.740> night

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
jump in their legs especially last night

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.210 
jump in their legs especially last night
I<00:01:26.360> think<00:01:27.360> when<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.659> go<00:01:27.780> game<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.229> game<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.890> you

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
I think when you go game to game and you

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.620 
I think when you go game to game and you
see<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.470> emotions<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.560> are<00:01:31.740> played<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.159> how

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
see the emotions that are played and how

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.690 
see the emotions that are played and how
physically<00:01:33.630> draining<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.680> be<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.490> just

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
physically draining it can be we we just

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.810 
physically draining it can be we we just
hope<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:35.970> that's<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.960> case<00:01:37.009> that<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.640> have

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
hope that that's the case that we have

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.690 
hope that that's the case that we have
you<00:01:39.450> know<00:01:39.540> ample<00:01:40.079> amount<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.920> energy<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.490> some

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
you know ample amount of energy and some

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.550 
you know ample amount of energy and some
speed<00:01:42.000> we're<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.570> hockey<00:01:42.780> club<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.229> has<00:01:43.380> to

speed we're a hockey club that has to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.280 
speed we're a hockey club that has to
skate<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.130> success<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.079> that<00:01:46.079> won't

skate to have success and that won't

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.590 
skate to have success and that won't
change<00:01:46.409> if<00:01:47.100> we're<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.340> skating<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.090> moving

which<00:06:13.900> TV<00:06:14.110> do<00:06:14.230> you<00:06:14.260> think<00:06:14.440> has<00:06:14.560> more<00:06:14.590> pressure

which TV do you think has more pressure

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.310 
which TV do you think has more pressure
on<00:06:15.130> them<00:06:15.250> tonight<00:06:15.370> I<00:06:15.700> think<00:06:16.630> both<00:06:16.900> teams<00:06:16.930> have

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
on them tonight I think both teams have

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.380 
on them tonight I think both teams have
pressure<00:06:17.590> when<00:06:18.430> you<00:06:18.490> play<00:06:18.640> seven<00:06:19.000> game<00:06:19.180> it

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
pressure when you play seven game it

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.750 
pressure when you play seven game it
doesn't<00:06:19.510> really<00:06:19.780> there's<00:06:20.590> no<00:06:20.800> real<00:06:21.040> pressure

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
doesn't really there's no real pressure

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.190 
doesn't really there's no real pressure
on<00:06:21.970> one<00:06:22.150> team<00:06:22.360> or<00:06:22.510> the<00:06:22.540> other<00:06:22.750> I<00:06:22.810> think<00:06:23.050> both

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
on one team or the other I think both

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.430 
on one team or the other I think both
teams<00:06:23.230> have<00:06:23.650> equal<00:06:23.950> amount<00:06:24.190> of<00:06:24.250> pressure
