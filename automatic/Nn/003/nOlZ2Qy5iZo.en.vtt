what this does is allows higher to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.940 
what this does is allows higher to
actually<00:00:44.370> encapsulate<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> food<00:00:45.950> 360

what<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.270> allows<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> food<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.590> cook

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
what this allows is the food to cook

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.610

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
what we like to do is preheat first what

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.580 
what we like to do is preheat first what
I<00:01:05.820> recommend<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.510> most<00:01:06.810> other<00:01:07.020> friable

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
I recommend this for most other friable

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.410 
I recommend this for most other friable
food<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.460> temperatures<00:01:09.030> starting

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
food the temperatures starting

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.109 
food the temperatures starting
temperature<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.869> about<00:01:09.930> 400<00:01:10.380> degrees<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.970> we

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
temperature of about 400 degrees so we

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.190 
temperature of about 400 degrees so we
set<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:16.009> then<00:01:17.009> what<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:18.200> do

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
set that here and then what we do is do

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.289 
set that here and then what we do is do
one<00:01:19.470> click<00:01:19.740> over<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.220> left<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.820> put<00:01:21.000> out<00:01:21.119> to
