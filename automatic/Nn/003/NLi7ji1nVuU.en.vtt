eyes and then on the top is just studs
and<00:01:34.439> cylinders<00:01:35.220> cylinders<00:01:36.119> are<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.360> hold

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
and cylinders cylinders are to hold

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.929 
and cylinders cylinders are to hold
chain<00:01:36.900> around<00:01:37.189> to<00:01:38.189> make<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:38.549> more<00:01:38.729> dense

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
whole front is smooth and these like 1

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.580 
whole front is smooth and these like 1
by<00:01:50.310> 4<00:01:50.549> plates<00:01:51.090> or<00:01:51.360> held<00:01:51.540> together<00:01:51.689> by<00:01:51.930> jumpers

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
by 4 plates or held together by jumpers

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.160 
by 4 plates or held together by jumpers
all<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> way<00:01:53.009> across<00:01:53.329> give<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.990> down

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
all the way across give it up and down

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.190 
all the way across give it up and down
flow<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:57.469> then<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.369> side<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.930> has<00:02:01.049> this

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
flow and then on the side it has this

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.480 
flow and then on the side it has this
little<00:02:01.259> hole<00:02:01.649> which<00:02:01.829> i'll<00:02:01.950> be<00:02:02.070> showing<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.310> it

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
little hole which i'll be showing you it

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.090 
little hole which i'll be showing you it
sees<00:02:02.700> four<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.899> then<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.380> back<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:04.950> a

plate<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:07.849> that's<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.060> basically

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
plate and that's it basically

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.740 
plate and that's it basically
and<00:02:10.759> it's<00:02:10.880> pretty<00:02:11.060> big<00:02:11.270> compared<00:02:11.570> to<00:02:11.630> my<00:02:11.720> other

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.840 
and it's pretty big compared to my other
plants<00:02:12.290> but<00:02:12.500> what<00:02:13.040> are<00:02:13.100> you<00:02:13.160> gonna<00:02:13.250> do<00:02:13.400> they

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
plants but what are you gonna do they

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.780 
plants but what are you gonna do they
have<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.240> have<00:02:14.390> good<00:02:14.600> detail<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.080> stuff<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:15.790> so

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
have to have good detail and stuff so so

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.810 
have to have good detail and stuff so so
the<00:02:17.300> way<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.600> works<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:18.400> it's<00:02:19.400> pretty<00:02:19.550> simple

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
the way this works is it's pretty simple

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.480 
the way this works is it's pretty simple
but<00:02:20.260> complex<00:02:21.260> at<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.500> same<00:02:21.650> time<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:22.310> makes

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
but complex at the same time that makes

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.470 
but complex at the same time that makes
any<00:02:22.580> sense<00:02:22.700> I'll<00:02:23.980> take<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.130> grade<00:02:25.280> Buster<00:02:25.670> put

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
any sense I'll take the grade Buster put

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.800 
any sense I'll take the grade Buster put
it<00:02:26.600> over<00:02:27.290> fits<00:02:27.800> perfectly<00:02:28.340> on<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.730> grave<00:02:29.480> and

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
it over fits perfectly on the grave and

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.740 
it over fits perfectly on the grave and
then<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.530> take<00:02:30.709> this<00:02:30.890> piece<00:02:31.100> here<00:02:31.280> which<00:02:31.750> is

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
then you take this piece here which is

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.840 
then you take this piece here which is
just<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.790> 1<00:02:34.790> by<00:02:35.440> something<00:02:36.440> long<00:02:36.830> on<00:02:37.070> this

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
just a 1 by something long on this

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.930 
just a 1 by something long on this
handle<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.720> then<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.770> stick<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.640> through<00:02:40.790> the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
handle and then you stick it through the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.220 
handle and then you stick it through the
hole<00:02:41.120> on<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.420> side<00:02:43.060> one<00:02:44.060> second<00:02:44.480> this<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:45.020> kind

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
hole on the side one second this is kind

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.560 
hole on the side one second this is kind
of<00:02:45.290> hard<00:02:48.310> there<00:02:49.310> we<00:02:49.370> go<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:50.150> just<00:02:50.300> take<00:02:50.420> it

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
of hard there we go you just take it

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.890 
of hard there we go you just take it
through<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.810> hole<00:02:50.930> on<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.140> side<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:52.330> as<00:02:53.330> you

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
through the hole on the side and as you

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.780 
through the hole on the side and as you
can<00:02:54.020> see<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.290> part<00:02:54.920> of<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.070> handlebars<00:02:55.520> still

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
can see the part of the handlebars still

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.550

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
there all I have to do is lean it back

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.490 
there all I have to do is lean it back
and<00:02:58.459> then<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.820> grave<00:02:59.030> comes<00:02:59.390> off<00:02:59.600> with<00:03:00.470> ease

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500
