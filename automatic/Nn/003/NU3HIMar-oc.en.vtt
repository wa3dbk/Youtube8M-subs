00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.950
 the usual try a Mediterranean sea 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.930
 bank turn this corner this rock on the next inlet 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.930
 where the beach faces breathtaking cliffs 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.620
 there are very few people 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.190
 quiet place then today there is no breath of wind I must say 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.620
 which is very very hot 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.410
 and therefore also the umbrella remain still 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.970
 the flat 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.720
 fixate 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.330
 the opus beach which is therefore its boiling point of fire 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.280
 cuttings 10 and a half was almost possible to put your feet on 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.280
 on fire 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.450
 and this technique casts umbrella tips and umbrellas and is hidden from 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.090
 from these plants 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.690
