integrally<00:00:10.440> integrally<00:00:11.429> means<00:00:11.910> whole<00:00:12.330> wheat

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
integrally integrally means whole wheat

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.230 
integrally integrally means whole wheat
and<00:00:13.469> so<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.740> want<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.130> start<00:00:14.460> with<00:00:14.700> some<00:00:15.000> whole

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
and so you want to start with some whole

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.609 
and so you want to start with some whole
wheat<00:00:15.450> flour<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:15.960> want<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.170> show<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
wheat flour and I want to show you the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.210 
wheat flour and I want to show you the
difference<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.789> whole<00:00:18.240> wheat<00:00:18.510> flour

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
difference this is whole wheat flour

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.650 
difference this is whole wheat flour
remember<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.520> word<00:00:20.820> beg<00:00:22.010> brand<00:00:23.660> endosperm

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
remember the word beg brand endosperm

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.560 
remember the word beg brand endosperm
and<00:00:24.930> germ<00:00:25.710> that's<00:00:26.430> what's<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.060> whole<00:00:27.330> wheat

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and germ that's what's in whole wheat

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.960 
and germ that's what's in whole wheat
flour<00:00:27.599> as<00:00:28.230> opposed<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.699> see<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
flour as opposed to this you see the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.669 
flour as opposed to this you see the
difference<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.420> color<00:00:30.660> between<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.470> more

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
difference in color between this is more

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.650 
difference in color between this is more
Brown<00:00:31.980> looking<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:33.450> have

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
Brown looking and here we have

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.010 
Brown looking and here we have
unbleached<00:00:34.290> all-purpose<00:00:34.680> flour<00:00:35.579> which<00:00:36.420> only

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
unbleached all-purpose flour which only

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.619 
unbleached all-purpose flour which only
has<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.739> B<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.610> endosperm

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
has the B the endosperm

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.040 
has the B the endosperm
it<00:00:39.840> doesn't<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.680> brand<00:00:41.309> or<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.790> germ<00:00:42.750> so

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
it doesn't have the brand or the germ so

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.110 
it doesn't have the brand or the germ so
this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.500> really<00:00:43.829> nutritious<00:00:44.489> it's<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.910> whole

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
this is really nutritious it's the whole

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.600 
this is really nutritious it's the whole
wheat<00:00:45.480> kernel<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.410> because<00:00:47.219> we're<00:00:47.430> using

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
wheat kernel and because we're using

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.029 
wheat kernel and because we're using
whole<00:00:48.000> wheat<00:00:48.059> today<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:49.379> works<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.920> little

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
whole wheat today it works a little

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.740 
whole wheat today it works a little
differently<00:00:50.640> than<00:00:50.760> unbleached<00:00:51.390> all-purpose

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
differently than unbleached all-purpose

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.959 
differently than unbleached all-purpose
flour<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.860> going<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.219> take<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> little<00:00:53.730> bit

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
flour it's going to take a little bit

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.810 
flour it's going to take a little bit
more<00:00:54.210> time<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.989> rise<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:56.160> how<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.670> get

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
more time to rise so how do you get

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.360 
more time to rise so how do you get
around<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.780> get<00:00:58.469> around<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.190> by

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
around that you get around it by

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.900 
around that you get around it by
creating<00:00:59.699> a<00:01:00.210> mother<00:01:00.719> dough<00:01:01.340> obiga<00:01:02.340> as<00:01:02.579> it's

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
creating a mother dough obiga as it's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.270 
creating a mother dough obiga as it's
called<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.510> Italian<00:01:03.629> or<00:01:04.260> if<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.650> English<00:01:05.070> it's

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
called a sponge and it's a dough that's

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.280 
called a sponge and it's a dough that's
going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.850> give<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.240> second<00:01:09.689> dough<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> little

you allow this to ferment for about Oh
35<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.509> 40<00:01:51.930> minutes<00:01:51.960> it'll<00:01:52.560> start<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.860> get

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
35 to 40 minutes it'll start to get

35 to 40 minutes it'll start to get
bubbly<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.880> smell<00:01:54.270> yeasty<00:01:54.869> it'll<00:01:55.829> increase

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
bubbly and smell yeasty it'll increase

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.399 
bubbly and smell yeasty it'll increase
in<00:01:56.460> volume<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:57.180> little<00:01:57.329> bit<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.840> once<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.200> have

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
in volume a little bit so once you have

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.050 
in volume a little bit so once you have
it<00:01:58.560> all<00:01:58.710> mixed<00:01:59.399> you<00:02:00.149> want<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.390> cover<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
it all mixed you want to cover it and

put it off somewhere in a warm place to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.700 
put it off somewhere in a warm place to
rise<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.020> cover<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.350> with<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.560> little

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.070 
rise so just cover it with a little
piece<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.190> plastic<00:02:08.789> wrap<00:02:09.330> they<00:02:09.810> put<00:02:09.989> it

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
piece of plastic wrap they put it

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.920 
piece of plastic wrap they put it
somewhere<00:02:10.259> warm<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.709> rise

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
somewhere warm to rise

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.780 
somewhere warm to rise
and<00:02:12.620> when<00:02:13.280> it's<00:02:13.459> risen<00:02:15.459> it'll<00:02:16.459> look<00:02:16.549> something

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
and when it's risen it'll look something

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.009 
and when it's risen it'll look something
like<00:02:17.000> this<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.750> see<00:02:19.269> here<00:02:20.269> we<00:02:20.420> have<00:02:20.689> one

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
like this you see here we have one

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.960 
like this you see here we have one
that's<00:02:22.780> very<00:02:23.780> yeasty<00:02:24.349> smelling<00:02:25.220> see<00:02:25.760> how

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
that's very yeasty smelling see how

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:26.920 
that's very yeasty smelling see how
fluffy<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.720> is

and now that's ready to put together

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.910 
and now that's ready to put together
with<00:02:29.299> our<00:02:29.540> second<00:02:30.079> dough<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:30.439> we<00:02:30.470> have<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.799> make

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
with our second dough so we have to make

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.920 
with our second dough so we have to make
another<00:02:31.220> dough<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:32.090> that's<00:02:32.299> all<00:02:32.510> ready<00:02:32.750> so

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
another dough so that's all ready so

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.099 
another dough so that's all ready so
we're<00:02:33.079> going<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.230> start<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:33.769> our<00:02:34.189> mixer<00:02:35.090> with<00:02:36.079> a

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
we're going to start in our mixer with a

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:41.110 
we're going to start in our mixer with a
cup<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.530> warm<00:02:37.400> water<00:02:37.549> between<00:02:38.620> 110<00:02:39.730> 115<00:02:40.730> days

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
cup of warm water between 110 115 days

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.240 
cup of warm water between 110 115 days
is<00:02:41.420> perfect<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.560> if<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.769> make<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:42.950> lot<00:02:43.189> of

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
is perfect and if you make a lot of

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.740 
is perfect and if you make a lot of
dough<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:43.519> just<00:02:43.909> know<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.569> right

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
dough you just know the right

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.180 
dough you just know the right
temperature<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.349> the<00:02:45.470> water<00:02:45.680> but<00:02:45.980> if<00:02:46.099> you

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
temperature of the water but if you

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.550 
temperature of the water but if you
don't<00:02:46.459> then<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:46.849> want<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.120> get<00:02:47.299> an

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
don't then you want to get an

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.080 
don't then you want to get an
instant-read<00:02:48.560> thermometer<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:49.340> put<00:02:49.849> it<00:02:49.940> in

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
instant-read thermometer and put it in

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.910 
instant-read thermometer and put it in
the<00:02:50.209> water<00:02:50.389> check<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.900> see<00:02:51.079> that<00:02:51.109> you<00:02:51.349> have<00:02:51.590> the

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
the water check to see that you have the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.949 
the water check to see that you have the
right<00:02:52.099> temperature<00:02:52.549> again<00:02:53.540> we're<00:02:53.720> going<00:02:53.870> to

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
right temperature again we're going to

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.479 
right temperature again we're going to
put<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.379> teaspoon<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.970> dry<00:02:56.569> yeast<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.250> water

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
put a teaspoon of dry yeast in the water

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.240 
put a teaspoon of dry yeast in the water
and<00:02:59.389> we're<00:02:59.540> just<00:02:59.629> going<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.870> mix<00:03:00.019> that<00:03:00.170> up

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.960 

and<00:03:04.430> we're<00:03:05.060> going<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.570> add<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:09.080> sponge<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.730> the

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
and we're going to add the sponge so the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.390 
and we're going to add the sponge so the
sponge<00:03:11.330> goes<00:03:11.810> in<00:03:14.440> but<00:03:15.440> all<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.980> sponge<00:03:16.340> in<00:03:16.640> it

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
sponge goes in but all the sponge in it

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.510 
sponge goes in but all the sponge in it
remember<00:03:19.400> this<00:03:19.580> is<00:03:19.790> our<00:03:20.740> fourth<00:03:21.740> shadow<00:03:22.250> the

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
remember this is our fourth shadow the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.070 
remember this is our fourth shadow the
one<00:03:22.670> that's<00:03:22.820> going<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.150> give<00:03:23.300> us<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.660> extra

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
one that's going to give us that extra

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.100 
one that's going to give us that extra
oomph<00:03:24.470> that's<00:03:24.860> going<00:03:25.070> to<00:03:25.160> help<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:26.420> gluten<00:03:26.930> in

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
oomph that's going to help the gluten in

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.340 
oomph that's going to help the gluten in
the<00:03:27.470> dough<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:28.180> then<00:03:29.180> we<00:03:29.660> have<00:03:29.990> our

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
the dough and then we have our

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.620 
the dough and then we have our
unbleached<00:03:31.070> flour<00:03:31.340> or<00:03:31.940> a<00:03:32.000> whole<00:03:32.420> wheat<00:03:32.600> flour

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
unbleached flour or a whole wheat flour

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.330 
unbleached flour or a whole wheat flour
rather<00:03:33.080> we're<00:03:33.260> not<00:03:33.350> using<00:03:33.500> unbleached<00:03:33.950> today

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
rather we're not using unbleached today

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.270 
rather we're not using unbleached today
here's<00:03:35.060> our<00:03:35.240> whole<00:03:35.510> wheat<00:03:35.720> flour<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:36.470> this<00:03:37.100> is

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
here's our whole wheat flour and this is

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.120 
here's our whole wheat flour and this is
something<00:03:37.580> called<00:03:38.090> wheat<00:03:38.510> gluten<00:03:39.050> this<00:03:39.920> is

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
something called wheat gluten this is

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.030 
something called wheat gluten this is
something<00:03:40.460> that<00:03:40.580> also<00:03:40.820> helps<00:03:41.630> dough<00:03:42.020> rise<00:03:42.620> and

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
something that also helps dough rise and

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.910 
something that also helps dough rise and
you<00:03:43.100> can<00:03:43.250> buy<00:03:43.460> this<00:03:43.600> in<00:03:44.600> a<00:03:44.810> grocery<00:03:45.290> store<00:03:45.590> just

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
you can buy this in a grocery store just

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.890 
you can buy this in a grocery store just
called<00:03:46.460> wheat<00:03:46.730> gluten<00:03:46.940> so<00:03:47.360> you<00:03:47.420> want<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.750> mix

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
called wheat gluten so you want to mix

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.060 
called wheat gluten so you want to mix
that<00:03:48.200> around<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:49.990> we<00:03:50.990> also<00:03:51.230> need<00:03:51.680> salt

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
that around and we also need salt

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.790 
that around and we also need salt
because<00:03:52.700> salt<00:03:53.120> will<00:03:53.810> control<00:03:54.290> the

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
because salt will control the

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.920 
because salt will control the
fermentation<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:56.030> dough<00:03:56.210> you<00:03:56.540> don't<00:03:56.720> put

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
fermentation of the dough you don't put

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.270 
fermentation of the dough you don't put
salt<00:03:57.140> in<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.530> dough<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.920> dough<00:03:57.950> is<00:03:58.250> just

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
salt in the dough the dough is just

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.280 
salt in the dough the dough is just
going<00:03:58.610> to<00:03:58.670> run<00:03:58.880> rampant<00:03:59.360> so<00:03:59.930> this<00:04:00.140> will

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
going to run rampant so this will

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.220 
going to run rampant so this will
control<00:04:00.710> the<00:04:01.040> development<00:04:01.280> of<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:02.120> yeast<00:04:02.960> and

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
control the development of the yeast and

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.180 
control the development of the yeast and
also<00:04:04.220> provides<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:05.000> flavor<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.780> gives<00:04:06.740> color

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
also provides the flavor and gives color

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.130 
also provides the flavor and gives color
to<00:04:07.400> whatever<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:08.120> are<00:04:08.270> making<00:04:08.540> so<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:08.959> put

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
to whatever you are making so you put

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.420 
to whatever you are making so you put
the<00:04:09.260> salt<00:04:09.290> in<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:11.320> then<00:04:12.320> we<00:04:12.500> want<00:04:12.770> some<00:04:13.010> olive

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
the salt in and then we want some olive

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.699 
the salt in and then we want some olive
oil<00:04:13.670> so<00:04:14.300> for<00:04:14.480> this<00:04:14.570> I<00:04:14.750> like<00:04:14.959> to<00:04:15.110> use<00:04:15.230> about<00:04:15.530> Oh

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
oil so for this I like to use about Oh
