00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello today i will show you 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.899
 how to tire the skates to the it's this 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.269
 whether ice skates or 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.370
 look skates and so first of all 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.929
 he will make you your meal of one by your 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.750
 skates as well as your hands no tool 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.619
 special so first of all we're going 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.119
 loosen the skate the laces of the world 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.320
 so we're already serving seven years 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.859
 missing by always taking them two by 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.460
 two to not do not to them 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.489
 leave that as it is 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.320
 and then we will hold tongue is Arabic a 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.320
 once this is done a son's foot 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.890
 this is my footsteps and we 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.149
 let's go now to tightening the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.539
 skate so for that little technique he 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.520
 must start as low as possible 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:00.210
 so me here so I'll have to start 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.329
 from here so we blend the right wire and the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.339
 son left and one just pulls 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.189
 hard enough it must have done that 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.810
 makes me a little bumps and we pull my 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.869
 in the air we take those from 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.100
 below and pulling and so on 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.229
 care must be taken to keep them 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.939
 look like otherwise they left themselves a 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.430
 little bit but it's not very serious if 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.110
 you can let go and you have 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.240
 just to tighten with the other 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.450
 so the one we get to the end we 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.490
 pulls a little in the queues removes 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.829
 concerts and tightens 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.040
 like everything in the beginning we want to understand 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.689
 at the nuts the scene a place like that one 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.409
 turn to have a better grip 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.890
 he draws to finish once this 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.960
 is did you have you just had 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:58.409
 closed like a there it's normal 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:01.409
 that's just a double 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.610
 knot to avoid that the csd face and that 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.159
 you bother their fans every time 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.540
 I hope that my video will have you 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.590
 more and see you soon for next 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.590
 goodbye videos
