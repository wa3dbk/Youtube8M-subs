00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.500
 welcome for this new video 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.930
 today we find ourselves for a tutorial 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.940
 to install and download the mode 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.030
 feed the beats launcher so that's it 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.889
 the launcher that I use for the series 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.480
 let's play industrial kraft bill kraft 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.170
 so just already you're going 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.300
 go to the site of feed the beast so 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.550
 you clicked son of bill on your 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.939
 search engine so on feed the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.830
 beast point com so here it goes 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.859
 Normally this is the translate I am 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.809
 crazy are you going here in dao india is 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.170
 here you will see download the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.750
 customer 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.719
 so if you will have the point bar tea 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.980
 here you will have the exe you download 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.039
 the exe so the exe is simply 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.379
 this one is the launcher after if you 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.940
 want to make a server you download 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.190
 on the server but I have not project 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.430
 try so I will not be able to you 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.170
 give details about the server 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.039
 so just after you go 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.930
 in download so where your 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.129
 launcher normally settled there 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.780
 there is on my desk just 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.020
 because I move them I moved 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.540
 place and you are going to have normally 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:18.240
 that exe here then you're going to have to 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.450
 you will open the launcher so there 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.180
 like me it's already done 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.430
 it's a little me I can not you 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.210

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.189
 easter etc 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.770
 but it's very simple I'm going to 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.149
 explain all that so here when you 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.119

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.450
 you normally identify 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.860
 minecraft you can not have two 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.870
 cracked versions of minecraft 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.050
 you have to do it so there 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.180
 you see darling easter words 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.010
 and there it will start to download 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.160
 the mode not that I'm going to cut because 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.360
 I do not need that word of Easter 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:39.330
 so after that you go to brian 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:41.640
 gay buggy canceled go yes I got it 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.020
 crazy thanks so there when you have 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.100
 downloaded the tag mode so there for 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.910
 the moment I have that the vote has 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.430
 wolf 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.270
 so you see a little jingle feed the 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.220
 beast then you'll see so that's okay 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.290
 to be the normal game so that's going to be a 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.660
 little long is a little worry I think 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.850
 that it's not a problem my computer is 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.220
 just that it's a little long I 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.770
 do not know why it's still a 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.800
 a little bit long to open I think that 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.870
 the words if we look at the travel console 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.490
 they are loading every 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.980
 all modes so that's why in 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.040
 being charged all modules ouais 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.989
 that's it 1122 loaded all modes all 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.140
 the modules and where so it's a bit long 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.570
 it's longer than a normal minecraft 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.660
 so that's a bit expensive but here it is 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.530
 take a minute not even I think he 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.970
 should still they hurry 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.390
 because you do not you'll not have you 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.390
 all day 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.200
 so here's the here you see in mode 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.910
 so here are all the modes you 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.340
 have your password are 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.350
 installed here 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.560
 so here I hope that following the 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:50.310
 you simply get more and 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.920

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.930
