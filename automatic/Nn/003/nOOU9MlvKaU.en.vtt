00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
was to get into the district finals and

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.060 
was to get into the district finals and
then<00:00:43.270> go<00:00:43.450> from<00:00:43.600> there<00:00:43.690> we<00:00:44.290> achieved<00:00:44.680> our<00:00:44.830> goal

then go from there we achieved our goal

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.160 
then go from there we achieved our goal
so<00:00:45.760> they<00:00:45.910> learned<00:00:46.180> about<00:00:46.300> setting<00:00:46.810> a<00:00:46.870> goal<00:00:46.990> and

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
so they learned about setting a goal and

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.080 
so they learned about setting a goal and
working<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.620> get<00:00:47.770> there<00:00:48.010> then<00:00:48.610> we<00:00:48.760> ran<00:00:48.940> into

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
working to get there then we ran into

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.750 
working to get there then we ran into
the<00:00:49.450> buzzsaw<00:00:49.690> Clearwater<00:00:50.500> and<00:00:50.710> that's<00:00:51.430> okay

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
the buzzsaw Clearwater and that's okay

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.220 
the buzzsaw Clearwater and that's okay
because<00:00:51.970> that<00:00:52.330> was<00:00:52.480> also<00:00:52.690> part<00:00:52.900> of<00:00:53.170> the

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
because that was also part of the

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.320 
because that was also part of the
process<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.830> experience<00:00:54.340> you<00:00:54.790> don't<00:00:55.210> ever

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
process the experience you don't ever

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.360 
process the experience you don't ever
know<00:00:55.600> it's<00:00:55.900> kind<00:00:56.110> of<00:00:56.140> like<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.740> Rays<00:00:56.950> and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
know it's kind of like the the Rays and

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.550 
know it's kind of like the the Rays and
in<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.940> World<00:00:58.150> Series<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:58.750> so<00:00:58.990> it's<00:00:59.290> part<00:00:59.530> of

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
in the World Series and so it's part of

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.160 
in the World Series and so it's part of
the<00:00:59.650> process<00:00:59.800> they've<00:01:00.250> learned<00:01:00.520> and<00:01:01.170> that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
the process they've learned and that

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.189 
the process they've learned and that
they<00:01:02.380> want<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:02.710> get<00:01:02.860> back<00:01:03.539> I'm<00:01:04.539> Jay<00:01:04.809> given

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:54.989 
experiences an experience you know it

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:57.139 
experiences an experience you know it
makes<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.319> lot<00:01:55.470> she'll<00:01:56.189> run<00:01:56.369> off<00:01:56.579> fence<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
makes a lot she'll run off fence and

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.089 
makes a lot she'll run off fence and
they're<00:01:57.599> both<00:01:57.810> she<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.289> Laurier<00:01:58.679> would<00:01:58.979> have

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
they're both she and Laurier would have

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.219 
they're both she and Laurier would have
become<00:01:59.459> kind<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.849> interchangeable<00:02:00.569> either

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
become kind of interchangeable either

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.260 
become kind of interchangeable either
one<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.469> them<00:02:01.649> can<00:02:01.890> take<00:02:02.099> over<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.549> top<00:02:02.729> and

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
one of them can take over up top and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.330 
one of them can take over up top and
even<00:02:03.629> one<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:04.110> go<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.319> the<00:02:04.439> wing<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.890> play<00:02:05.099> and

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
even one can go to the wing and play and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.190 
even one can go to the wing and play and
obviously<00:02:06.239> they<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.569> take<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.869> ball<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
obviously they can take the ball of the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.240 
obviously they can take the ball of the
basket<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:08.840> think<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.619> other<00:02:10.649> players

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
