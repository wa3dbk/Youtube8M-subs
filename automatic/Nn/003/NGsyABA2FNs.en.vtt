 hello guys welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.860
 from the youtube channel maniacs tv mi 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.870
 name is emmanuel and you can find me 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.480
 on twitter by atlanta tico tico today 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.579
 play top 5 of addictive games number 4 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.499
 and we start with the number 5 that these 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.699
 it corresponds to bit and I say a funny 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.039
 game where what first comes out to 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.960
 receive of its graphic quality once 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.789
 more in the world pixelar world takes the 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.289
 header and the developers of this 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.269
 title does not add generate a casual game 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.039
 where we are a little abuse that should 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.419
 reach as high as possible avoiding 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.130
 stay stuck by the different 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.110
 obstacles and without touching us 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.180
 fish all this while we grab 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.650
 different chests a simple game but 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.720
 of high quality especially for the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.640
 lovers of retro games the post 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.440
 number 4 this time is for Robert bundle 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.480
 another casual game for those moments 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.160
 where we are bored we will put with the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.080
 pixel art as graphics chosen by the 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.180
 development team something that feels 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.800
 very well this title the goal is 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.030
 make touches on the screen just when 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.400
 the pump passes through the middle of the vehicle 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.140
 the same will work for both 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.930
 lanes and if in either of the two we 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.850
 We made mistakes but we ended up making mistakes 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.710
 It is very easy to make a touch when 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.939
 a bomb is still near the car will be 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.200
 enough for us to tell us 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.020
 points and we many messages from 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.880
 retry 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.759
 casual game fun and pretty that 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.350
 hiding place number 3 is for you 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.390
 and game that does not catch you this really 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.009
 in which games for the first time in the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.509
 that's not a small oval which has 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.860
 a physics that not only elevate us a 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.929
 little for each touch the screen that 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.490
 we realize the goal of the game is 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.439
 move forward without that the middle line of the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.569
 screen which also shaped us 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.280
 touch while we do that we should 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.990
 grab the different diamonds that we 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.189
 we will find which ones we 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.079
 will serve to change the style of 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.909
 ovalo there are really many for 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.469
 develop an interesting game very 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.869
 simple and that surely they are going to throw you 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:41.189
 if you like this kind of title are missing 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.750
 only two posts but if you are 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.579
 liking this top I ask you please 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.679
 he dislikes the video thank you so much 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.049
 now yes with less with the number one 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.459
 2 cristian corresponds to hit him 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.039
 we will have to use our reflections of 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.720
 100% motor since the goal is 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.520
 advance through both lanes in simultaneous 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.959
 done when all the circles but 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.420
 also dodging the squares at 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.549
 same time the game may seem 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.630
 easy if we saw the circles but not 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.670
 no chance to do because otherwise 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.469
 we would lose the game has some 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.789
 simple graphics but well achieved other 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.619
 title that adds to the list of games 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.180
 casual of this top 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.460
 finally the game that played the most in this 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.410
 last time was his life 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.450
 the goal is to advance from a point to a 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.890
 a b point to be successful we will have 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.210
 to leave the finger tight 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.900
 of the length that we want to give to our 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.060
 stick 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.980
 that will allow us to be frequent if we 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.900
 we pass or we need we want to 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.220
 empty and we will start again be 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.540
 break to make those clouds discount 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.280
 different quantities we can 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.690
 unlock new characters and if 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.220
 we want about the marked square it 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.500
 they added an extra point to the score 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.780
 final that this turn is the fifth and 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.190
