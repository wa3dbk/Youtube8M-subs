00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:04.660
 but who wants can value myself for the second day of our game 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.739
 yes, there is no opening game 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:10.000
 to encounter 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.859
 technically 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:15.079
 the German national team has game during the week Euro 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.480
 much is coming 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.599
 for the first game 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.939
 the second matchday is between FC Schalke 04 and the 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.019
 Tottenham they can 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.119
 I think that 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.070
 Scheike 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.070
 2xu performed 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.990
 currently moving 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.990
 was playing against Wolfsburg 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.620
 Although there are also bad against Stuttgart but 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.010
 what's coming 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.670
 the next meeting is between 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.500
 the Hamburger SV and 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.810
 the hardness out 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.110
 Berlin 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.890
 at this meeting 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.020
 where memories come to life 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.070
 Mushroom - the Berlin band I was in the first round that was the case 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.890
 worry about that in the back 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.539
 The Tur Tur Tur Tur I believe clock I knew really well as a toilet it 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.020
 Noront 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.120
 now in the new season when the new dealers and the force 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.300
 previously stands 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.190
 and that's why I suspect that this game draws out, namely 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.190
 Men one to one 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.990
 the next meeting is too late 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.730
 first FC Nuremberg 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.740
 Hannover 96 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.189
 was that now? 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.189
 this gate was Cissé 45 o'clock 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.010
 who knows who knows 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.910
 so 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.180
 from my side he one 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.180
 and who wants to spot 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.430
 No Erna 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.900
 only if the opponent won so with Ach and crash 1 0 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.669
 does not say much 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.049
 I believe that Hannover 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.239
 with 3 to 1 0 Merck 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.239
 this time 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.409
 the next meeting is between 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:30.879
 the Free Democrats 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.369
 Tip FSV Mainz 05 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:36.369
 the Mainzers have been 2 0 in Leverkusen 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.419
 Worms 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.419
 had persistent 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:45.510
 came for their game 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.229
 calculate higher I would say 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.229
 we are really complete at the moment 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:54.349
 and 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.349
 Augsburgs as a freshman 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.459
 To make Opel 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.560
 and that's why I think that Freiburg this game wins against Mainz 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.560
 with 2 to 1 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:15.919
 the next meeting between TSG Hoffenheim 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.649
 Borussia Dortmund 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:19.499
 because Dortmund 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:23.759
 really partly thought either the HSV plays next season in the 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.649
 second league 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:29.039
 and where really b-class of the Champions League 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:32.039
 Dortmund played 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:35.589
 Places and the Hasbro midfield 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.980
 He had the second case male Hoffenheim 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.269
 and where necessary 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.269
 Draw with 2 to 2 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:55.539
 The next meeting is between VfL Wolfsburg 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.169
 FC Bayern Munich 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:00.789
 lost against Gladbach 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:04.259
 what was suddenly on top of interpret Munich 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:05.210
 Wolfsburg 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.479
 what exactly that 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.479
 done what I said 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:15.509
 SLA go Oberhof won under a win against Cologne 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:19.419
 against the Bayern but we do not look 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.400
 celebrate 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.569
 only real 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:25.509
 Wosz win and they do it with a tight 2 to 1 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.850
 the next encounter is the top game of the matchday what 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.999
 really times 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.969
 sympathetic 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:40.519
 namely between Borussia Mönchengladbach and VfB Stuttgart 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.050
 Gladbach has defeated Bayern with 1 0 so it's worth it 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.760
 continue for color and for the team and 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.789
 Stuttgarter is a Roman appreciated 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.789
 we have everything 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.470
 I think that this game 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.949
 set off five goals 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:00.800
 but 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.800
 Gladbach quitter with 3 to 2 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.639
 da Gladbach really strength 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:12.689
 towards the gate 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:15.969
 Timo too 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:18.969
 it can happen 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.880
 the next opponent national average FC Kaiserslautern and d 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.830
 at this meeting 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.110
 Augsburg has not made it yet 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.110
 noisy has bets 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.139
 but we are in the first league 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.689
 Augsburg fought and fought 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:44.169
 and they will definitely do that now 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.400
 first win with 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.400
 23 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.309
 the last match is between Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.650
 since someone has already written 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.909
 but already earlier from Oberwart became so 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:09.909
 we managed to win against Lautern 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.550
 can rate a tour but Leverkusen somehow 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:20.259
 I think that Bremen that 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:23.889
 Game further wishes to win fourth with a 2 to 1 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.969
 those were the tips of the second matchday 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:34.619
 you can give your tips 

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:36.349
 You can have my tips 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:37.749
 improve 

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:39.949
 also say something my tip 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:42.729
 my comments statements and fled 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.169
 that he simply stays with us 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.180
 folds this video walls wants to see 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.349
 best engine back up so best on Pocher
