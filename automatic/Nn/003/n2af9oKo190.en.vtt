00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.149 
six chapters each are about half an hour
long<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.210> game<00:01:36.600> was<00:01:36.780> fairly<00:01:37.259> short<00:01:37.650> which

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
long so the game was fairly short which

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.980 
long so the game was fairly short which
is<00:01:38.280> fine<00:01:38.460> by<00:01:38.670> me<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:39.060> if<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.780> was<00:01:39.869> any

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.330 
is fine by me because if it was any
longer<00:01:40.290> I'd<00:01:40.380> feel<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.950> game<00:01:41.159> was

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
longer I'd feel like the game was

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.929 
longer I'd feel like the game was
starting<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.729> drag<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.210> quite<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> bit<00:01:43.939> the

starting to drag on quite a bit the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.249 
starting to drag on quite a bit the
story<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.329> definitely<00:01:45.780> not<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> strong<00:01:46.200> suit
