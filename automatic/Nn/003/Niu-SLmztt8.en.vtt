like it's gonna quickly show around some

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.580 
like it's gonna quickly show around some
of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> hardware<00:00:22.080> then<00:00:22.289> some<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
of the hardware then some of the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.560 
of the hardware then some of the

I'll<00:00:24.840> just<00:00:25.800> start<00:00:26.039> off<00:00:26.070> with<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> quick<00:00:26.760> size

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
I'll just start off with a quick size

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.040 
I'll just start off with a quick size
comparison<00:00:27.750> here<00:00:28.650> against<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.220> Nokia<00:00:29.779> n95<00:00:30.779> a

gigabyte<00:00:31.439> as<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:31.830> see<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.309> seems<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.669> bit

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
gigabyte as you can see it seems a bit

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.150 
gigabyte as you can see it seems a bit
narrower<00:00:33.329> than<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.880> n95<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.350> bit<00:00:37.500> thinner

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
narrower than the n95 and a bit thinner

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.060 
narrower than the n95 and a bit thinner
from<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> side<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.879> profile<00:00:39.360> as<00:00:39.510> well<00:00:40.070> but

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
from the side on profile as well but

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.770 
from the side on profile as well but
overall<00:00:41.370> about<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> same<00:00:41.760> height<00:00:42.030> not<00:00:42.719> too

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
overall about the same height not too

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.900 
overall about the same height not too
far<00:00:43.260> off<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.559> size<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.370> about<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> same

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
far off in size so it's about the same

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.580 
far off in size so it's about the same
portability<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.960> probably<00:00:46.140> won't<00:00:46.379> stick

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
portability just probably won't stick

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.209 
portability just probably won't stick
here<00:00:46.770> quite<00:00:46.950> as<00:00:47.039> much<00:00:47.219> as<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:49.219> just

here quite as much as this one just
quickly<00:00:50.550> she<00:00:50.730> was<00:00:50.879> well<00:00:51.059> couple<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> box

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
quickly she was well couple of the box

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.750 
quickly she was well couple of the box
contents<00:00:52.920> there's<00:00:53.100> not<00:00:53.250> an<00:00:53.340> awful<00:00:53.640> lot<00:00:53.730> of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
contents there's not an awful lot of
