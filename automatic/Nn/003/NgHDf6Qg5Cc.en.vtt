got an Angela local feature stole stole
it<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.929> he's<00:00:12.929> been<00:00:12.960> going<00:00:13.590> through<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:14.040> whole

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
it and he's been going through a whole

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.920 
it and he's been going through a whole
bunch<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.759> materials<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.480> 3d<00:00:16.350> print<00:00:17.930> alright

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
bunch of materials the 3d print alright

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.650 
bunch of materials the 3d print alright
so<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:20.070> are<00:00:20.100> trying<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.699> push<00:00:20.939> what<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.539> do

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
so we are trying to push what you can do

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.859 
so we are trying to push what you can do
with<00:00:21.900> 3d<00:00:22.080> printers<00:00:22.500> by<00:00:23.420> instead<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.600> just

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
with 3d printers by instead of just

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.210 
with 3d printers by instead of just
tweaking<00:00:25.470> around<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> printers

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
tweaking around on the printers

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.160 
tweaking around on the printers
themselves<00:00:26.730> changing<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> materials<00:00:28.050> that

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
themselves changing the materials that

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.839 
themselves changing the materials that
were<00:00:28.320> using<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.070> we're<00:00:29.429> using<00:00:29.580> more

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
were using so that we're using more

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.310 
were using so that we're using more
advanced<00:00:30.119> materials<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:31.759> leverage<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
advanced materials to leverage the

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.450 
advanced materials to leverage the
physical<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.590> chemical<00:00:34.710> properties<00:00:35.160> of

those<00:00:35.579> materials<00:00:36.200> to<00:00:37.200> be<00:00:37.320> able<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> lot

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
those materials to be able to do a lot

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.700 
those materials to be able to do a lot
more<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.280> our<00:00:38.399> 3d<00:00:38.670> printers<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.660> beyond<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
more with our 3d printers so beyond the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.119 
more with our 3d printers so beyond the
standard<00:00:41.719> ABS<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.829> some

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
standard ABS that we have we have some

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.880 
standard ABS that we have we have some
some<00:00:44.550> kind<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> specialty<00:00:45.840> materials<00:00:45.989> like<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
some kind of specialty materials like a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.750 
some kind of specialty materials like a
conductive<00:00:47.579> ABS<00:00:48.200> and<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.680> course<00:00:49.950> normal<00:00:50.370> PLA

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
conductive ABS and of course normal PLA

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.750 
conductive ABS and of course normal PLA
but<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.149> also<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.739> would<00:00:52.739> infuse<00:00:53.100> PLA<00:00:53.730> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
but we also have would infuse PLA and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.689 
but we also have would infuse PLA and
some<00:00:54.690> PLA<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:56.129> also<00:00:56.460> feel<00:00:56.670> like

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
some PLA is that that also feel like

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.889 
some PLA is that that also feel like
sandstone<00:00:59.870> alright<00:01:00.870> yeah<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.570> we<00:01:03.570> also<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
sandstone alright yeah so we also have a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.310 
sandstone alright yeah so we also have a
sandstone<00:01:04.320> tli<00:01:06.770> on<00:01:07.770> top<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.460> have

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
sandstone tli on top of that we have

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.370 
sandstone tli on top of that we have
hips<00:01:10.320> which<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.830> high<00:01:11.189> impact<00:01:11.640> polystyrene

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
hips which is high impact polystyrene

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.630 
hips which is high impact polystyrene
and<00:01:13.380> hips<00:01:13.740> has<00:01:13.950> some<00:01:14.250> really<00:01:14.460> great

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
and hips has some really great

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.149 
and hips has some really great
functionality<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.080> print<00:01:16.350> hips<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
functionality that we can print hips and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.789 
functionality that we can print hips and
abs<00:01:17.549> together<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.659> saw<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.259> one<00:01:19.470> print

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
abs together in one saw in one print

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.100 
abs together in one saw in one print
using<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.430> dual<00:01:20.610> extrusion<00:01:20.939> machine<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.930> we

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
using a dual extrusion machine and we

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.590 
using a dual extrusion machine and we
can<00:01:22.290> use<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.650> hips<00:01:22.860> as<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.610> support<00:01:24.030> material

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
can use the hips as the support material

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.399 
can use the hips as the support material
hips<00:01:25.110> as<00:01:25.320> dissolvable<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.990> natural<00:01:27.990> solvent

peels and lemon peels and when we

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.539 
peels and lemon peels and when we
dissolve<00:01:33.990> away<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.799> left<00:01:34.979> with<00:01:35.130> only

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
dissolve away we can be left with only

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.810 
dissolve away we can be left with only
the<00:01:36.329> ABS<00:01:36.750> behind<00:01:37.200> giving<00:01:38.130> us<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.430> ability<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
extreme through this also means that we

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.999 
extreme through this also means that we
can<00:01:48.090> print<00:01:48.450> more<00:01:48.600> mechanics<00:01:49.200> along<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.799> it

by being able to print the mechanics and

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.010 
by being able to print the mechanics and
then<00:01:53.130> separate<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> mechanical<00:01:54.210> portions

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
then separate the mechanical portions

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.410 
then separate the mechanical portions
away<00:01:55.710> from<00:01:55.890> each<00:01:56.009> other<00:01:56.159> by<00:01:56.759> dissolving<00:01:57.329> away

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.380 
and one of the the real exciting ones is
is<00:02:14.659> printing<00:02:15.290> in<00:02:15.379> nylon<00:02:15.849> nylon<00:02:16.849> has<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.060> little

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
is printing in nylon nylon has a little

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.000 
is printing in nylon nylon has a little
bit<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.599> flex<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.290> but<00:02:18.620> it's<00:02:18.739> very

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
bit of flex to it but it's very

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.680 
bit of flex to it but it's very
unreactive<00:02:19.519> with<00:02:20.060> on<00:02:20.209> mitts<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.510> other

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
unreactive with on mitts and other

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.399 
unreactive with on mitts and other
materials<00:02:21.349> so<00:02:21.980> being<00:02:22.940> able<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.239> direct<00:02:23.959> print

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
materials so being able to direct print

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.070 
materials so being able to direct print
molds<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:24.980> cast<00:02:25.760> your<00:02:25.940> things<00:02:26.269> into<00:02:26.569> them<00:02:26.750> as

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
molds and cast your things into them as

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.670 
molds and cast your things into them as
well<00:02:27.440> as<00:02:27.790> being<00:02:28.790> able<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.180> use<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.959> for<00:02:30.379> its

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
well as being able to use it for its

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.410 
well as being able to use it for its
strength<00:02:31.280> characteristics<00:02:31.730> because<00:02:32.269> it's

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
strength characteristics because it's

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.140 
strength characteristics because it's
very<00:02:32.599> very<00:02:32.870> strong<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:33.799> leveraging<00:02:34.670> all<00:02:35.120> of

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
very very strong so leveraging all of

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.789 
very very strong so leveraging all of
these<00:02:35.360> materials<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.110> how<00:02:36.200> we<00:02:36.260> combine<00:02:36.680> them

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
these materials and how we combine them

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.619 
these materials and how we combine them
together<00:02:36.950> we<00:02:37.700> can<00:02:37.879> try<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.120> do<00:02:38.299> a<00:02:38.329> lot<00:02:38.569> more

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
together we can try to do a lot more

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.990 
together we can try to do a lot more
with<00:02:38.959> our<00:02:39.049> 3d<00:02:39.349> printers<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:41.319> just<00:02:42.319> because

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
with our 3d printers and just because

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.410 
with our 3d printers and just because
this<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.299> only<00:02:44.510> piece<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.590> lay<00:02:46.579> brick<00:02:46.940> that

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
this is the only piece of lay brick that

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.069 
this is the only piece of lay brick that
exists<00:02:47.930> at<00:02:48.200> Maker<00:02:48.530> Faire<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:50.030> feels<00:02:50.450> like<00:02:50.780> very

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
exists at Maker Faire it feels like very

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.039 
exists at Maker Faire it feels like very
light<00:02:51.560> weight<00:02:51.859> room<00:02:52.609> temperatures<00:02:53.299> stand<00:02:53.690> so

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
light weight room temperatures stand so

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.610 
light weight room temperatures stand so
which<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.190> bizarre<00:02:56.170> but<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.290> doesn't<00:02:57.530> feel

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
which is bizarre but it doesn't feel

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.660 
which is bizarre but it doesn't feel
like<00:02:57.680> brick<00:02:58.579> ish<00:02:58.879> yeah<00:02:59.420> so<00:02:59.959> okay<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.890> this

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
like brick ish yeah so okay and this

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.349 
like brick ish yeah so okay and this
label<00:03:02.569> wood<00:03:02.810> feels<00:03:03.349> like<00:03:03.909> somebody<00:03:04.909> took<00:03:04.940> a

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
label wood feels like somebody took a

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.069 
label wood feels like somebody took a
rasp<00:03:05.629> too<00:03:06.379> empty<00:03:06.829> oh<00:03:07.209> yeah<00:03:08.209> oh<00:03:08.239> yeah<00:03:08.810> that's<00:03:09.019> a
