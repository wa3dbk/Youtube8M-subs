cannibal<00:00:03.600> Shogun<00:00:03.929> here<00:00:04.200> I'm<00:00:04.410> getting<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.799> lot

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
cannibal Shogun here I'm getting a lot

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.280 
cannibal Shogun here I'm getting a lot
of<00:00:04.980> questions<00:00:05.490> about<00:00:05.730> this<00:00:06.240> elevator<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:07.230> I

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
of questions about this elevator that I

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.100 
of questions about this elevator that I
built<00:00:07.620> on<00:00:07.859> my<00:00:08.160> track<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.639> roads<00:00:08.849> home<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.780> I'm

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
built on my track the roads home so I'm

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.080 
built on my track the roads home so I'm
not<00:00:10.260> going<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.469> do<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.620> proper<00:00:10.950> tutorial<00:00:11.759> on<00:00:12.030> how

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
not going to do a proper tutorial on how

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.240 
not going to do a proper tutorial on how
to<00:00:12.330> build<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.809> but<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.139> am<00:00:13.380> gonna<00:00:13.500> fire<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.980> up<00:00:14.070> in

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
to build it but I am gonna fire it up in

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.279 
to build it but I am gonna fire it up in
the<00:00:14.340> editor<00:00:14.639> here<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.150> kind<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.900> show<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.049> how

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
the editor here and kind of show you how

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.680 
the editor here and kind of show you how
its<00:00:16.470> put<00:00:16.619> together<00:00:16.789> so<00:00:17.789> we'll<00:00:17.970> first<00:00:18.300> thing<00:00:18.510> as

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
its put together so we'll first thing as

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.269 
its put together so we'll first thing as
we<00:00:18.840> move<00:00:19.020> down<00:00:19.050> you'll<00:00:19.500> see<00:00:19.560> two<00:00:19.859> turbines

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
we move down you'll see two turbines

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.759 
we move down you'll see two turbines
there<00:00:20.609> they<00:00:20.760> provide<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.119> lift<00:00:21.680> here's<00:00:22.680> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
there they provide the lift here's the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.490 
there they provide the lift here's the
actual<00:00:23.340> elevator<00:00:24.180> platform<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:25.109> everything

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
actual elevator platform and everything

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.529 
actual elevator platform and everything
else<00:00:25.680> physics<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.340> enabled<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:26.880> everything

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
else physics is enabled on everything

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.300 
else physics is enabled on everything
and<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:28.230> well<00:00:28.410> as<00:00:28.439> everything<00:00:28.769> being<00:00:29.039> glued

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
and as well as everything being glued

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.330 
and as well as everything being glued
together<00:00:29.490> I've<00:00:30.029> got<00:00:30.390> four<00:00:30.869> linear<00:00:31.650> dampeners

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
together I've got four linear dampeners

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.110 
together I've got four linear dampeners
on<00:00:32.550> each<00:00:32.730> corner<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:35.190> middle<00:00:35.520> here<00:00:35.880> I've<00:00:36.059> got

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
on each corner the middle here I've got

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.350 
on each corner the middle here I've got
a<00:00:36.660> slider<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.829> slider<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.520> just<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.969> try<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
a slider the slider is just to try and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.580 
a slider the slider is just to try and
keep<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.840> going<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> path<00:00:40.829> straight<00:00:41.250> up<00:00:41.550> and

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
keep it going on a path straight up and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.779 
keep it going on a path straight up and
then<00:00:43.590> obviously<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.340> middle<00:00:44.610> there<00:00:44.760> is

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
then obviously in the middle there is

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.819 
then obviously in the middle there is
the<00:00:45.120> trigger<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.780> hit<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.200> activate<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the trigger that you hit to activate the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.590 
the trigger that you hit to activate the
whole<00:00:46.980> thing<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> trigger<00:00:48.059> activates

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
whole thing so the trigger activates

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.479 
whole thing so the trigger activates
physics<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> animation<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.100> these<00:00:50.250> two

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
physics and the animation on these two

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.970 
physics and the animation on these two
turbines<00:00:50.850> two<00:00:51.629> turbines<00:00:52.020> are<00:00:52.289> glued<00:00:52.530> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
turbines two turbines are glued to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.740 
turbines two turbines are glued to
another<00:00:53.730> slider<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:56.239> then<00:00:57.239> all<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.420> way<00:00:57.629> at

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
another slider and then all the way at

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.830 
another slider and then all the way at
the<00:00:57.840> top<00:00:57.930> here<00:00:58.500> we've<00:00:59.219> got<00:00:59.250> lash<00:01:00.030> trigger<00:01:00.480> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the top here we've got lash trigger and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.290 
the top here we've got lash trigger and
two<00:01:01.170> crossbeams<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.670> will<00:01:02.910> stop<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
two crossbeams here that will stop the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.130 
two crossbeams here that will stop the
lift<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:05.360> there's<00:01:06.360> some<00:01:06.570> room<00:01:06.780> all<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> way

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
lift and there's some room all the way

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.780 
lift and there's some room all the way
at<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.260> top<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.010> turbines<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.640> go

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
at the top here for the turbines to go

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.660 
at the top here for the turbines to go
because<00:01:08.970> they're<00:01:09.270> well<00:01:09.570> above<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:11.100> actual

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
because they're well above the actual

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.149 
because they're well above the actual
lift<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.960> when<00:01:13.380> you're<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:13.950> you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
lift so that when you're going up you

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.359 
lift so that when you're going up you
never<00:01:14.520> see<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.840> turbines<00:01:16.290> up<00:01:16.530> there<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.979> I'm

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
never see the turbines up there and I'm

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.030 
never see the turbines up there and I'm
just<00:01:17.640> showing<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.030> here<00:01:18.330> how<00:01:18.509> how<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.680> last

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
just showing you here how how that last

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.450 
just showing you here how how that last
trigger<00:01:20.340> deactivates<00:01:21.119> physics<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:22.460> something

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
trigger deactivates physics on something

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.850 
trigger deactivates physics on something
they're<00:01:23.640> probably<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.299> platform<00:01:24.860> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
they're probably the platform and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.760 
they're probably the platform and
finally<00:01:26.430> uh<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.350> had<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.740> you

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
finally uh you know if if you had if you

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.039 
finally uh you know if if you had if you
can<00:01:29.009> Center<00:01:29.369> things<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.090> lock<00:01:30.630> them<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
can Center things and lock them to the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.960 
can Center things and lock them to the
driving<00:01:31.320> line<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.860> helps<00:01:32.220> keep<00:01:32.820> your

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
driving line that helps keep your

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.460 
driving line that helps keep your
movement<00:01:33.119> go<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.630> direction<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.079> want<00:01:34.110> so

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
movement go in the direction you want so

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.870 
movement go in the direction you want so
that's<00:01:34.619> part<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> reason<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.520> those<00:01:35.610> two

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
that's part of the reason for those two

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.819 
that's part of the reason for those two
things<00:01:36.060> they're<00:01:36.750> also<00:01:36.990> there<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.439> kind<00:01:37.740> of

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
things they're also there to kind of

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.640 
things they're also there to kind of
give<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.189> place<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.490> sit<00:01:38.909> because<00:01:39.530> like<00:01:40.530> I

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
give you a place to sit because like I

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.499 
give you a place to sit because like I
said<00:01:40.710> my<00:01:41.100> sliders<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.240> are<00:01:42.360> not

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
said my sliders on this one are not

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.780 
said my sliders on this one are not
really<00:01:42.720> perfect<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.829> don't<00:01:44.130> ride<00:01:44.549> it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
really perfect and if you don't ride it

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.780 
really perfect and if you don't ride it
right<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> center<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.259> could<00:01:46.740> drift<00:01:47.670> a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
right in the center it could drift a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.789 
right in the center it could drift a
little<00:01:47.820> too<00:01:48.180> far<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.479> either<00:01:48.659> side<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.110> get

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
little too far to either side and get

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.249 
little too far to either side and get
stuck<00:01:50.270> there<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.990> was

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
stuck there you have it this was

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.710 
stuck there you have it this was
basically<00:01:52.740> my<00:01:53.159> first<00:01:53.430> successful<00:01:54.090> attempt<00:01:54.570> at

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
basically my first successful attempt at

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.539 
basically my first successful attempt at
building<00:01:54.869> an<00:01:55.200> elevator<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.680> goes<00:01:55.829> up<00:01:56.219> I've

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
building an elevator that goes up I've

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.490 
building an elevator that goes up I've
seen<00:01:56.850> some<00:01:57.060> other<00:01:57.240> solutions<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> problem

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
seen some other solutions to the problem

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.050 
seen some other solutions to the problem
and<00:01:58.680> I'd<00:01:58.920> say<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.579> probably<00:01:59.909> not

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
and I'd say that this is probably not

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.719 
and I'd say that this is probably not
the<00:02:00.240> best<00:02:00.450> one<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.890> works<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.369> people

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
the best one but it works and people

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.850 
the best one but it works and people
been<00:02:02.880> asking<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.560> provide

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
been asking so I like to provide

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.840 
been asking so I like to provide
hopefully<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.850> found<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.210> informative
