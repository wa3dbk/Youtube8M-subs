00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.019

 crocodile turtles beetles live 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.250
 Blaster sanatorium Vasserman but no way 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.360

 here's another stupid update 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.570
 the interesting thing is that when the tail 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.239

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.420

 my gargantua was created by the binder than in 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.180
 Mass he has already many impressive 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.010
 work mikecroft so this robot was 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.070
 created without any command block 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.259
 it can even create survival in general 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.150
 it's just real cars 3 kills 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.430
 it would be cool if you made a server with 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.009
 these robots would have to fight back 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.290
 hide from them all sorts of shelters 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.860

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.110

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.640

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.950

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.140
