I was supposed to type this is a great
keyboard<00:02:28.700> but<00:02:29.570> I<00:02:29.769> missed<00:02:30.769> the<00:02:31.100> S<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:31.640> that's

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
keyboard but I missed the S so that's

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.900 
keyboard but I missed the S so that's
the<00:02:32.060> problem<00:02:32.329> that<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.690> have<00:02:32.959> with<00:02:32.989> this

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
the problem that I have with this

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.910 
the problem that I have with this
keyboard<00:02:34.910> I'm<00:02:35.690> not<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:35.989> con<00:02:36.230> is<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:36.739> this

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
keyboard I'm not a con is that this

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.729 
keyboard I'm not a con is that this
keyboard<00:02:37.220> has<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:38.030> feature<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.810> when<00:02:39.650> you

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
keyboard has a feature that when you

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.069 
keyboard has a feature that when you
lock<00:02:39.980> your<00:02:40.160> device<00:02:40.579> and<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.450> press<00:02:41.690> any<00:02:41.959> key

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
lock your device and you press any key

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.740 
lock your device and you press any key
it<00:02:42.620> will<00:02:42.829> just<00:02:43.040> basically<00:02:43.459> unlock<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.239> for<00:02:44.420> you

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
it will just basically unlock it for you

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.380 
it will just basically unlock it for you
I<00:02:44.780> find<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:45.829> feature<00:02:46.100> not<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:47.090> useful

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
I find this feature not that useful

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.860 
I find this feature not that useful
because<00:02:48.140> if<00:02:49.070> I<00:02:49.220> put<00:02:49.459> this<00:02:49.579> in<00:02:49.790> my<00:02:49.820> pocket<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.570> I

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
because if I put this in my pocket and I

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.229 
because if I put this in my pocket and I
accidentally<00:02:51.590> hit<00:02:51.859> a<00:02:51.920> key<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.489> will<00:02:53.030> just

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
accidentally hit a key and will just

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.330 
accidentally hit a key and will just
unlock<00:02:53.570> my<00:02:53.810> device<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.410> waste<00:02:54.739> battery

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
unlock my device and waste battery

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.030

another<00:02:55.880> pro<00:02:56.209> about<00:02:56.630> this<00:02:56.930> keyboard<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.680> that

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
another pro about this keyboard is that

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.819 
another pro about this keyboard is that
it<00:02:58.609> has<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.820> very<00:02:59.150> long<00:02:59.390> battery<00:02:59.720> charge<00:03:00.170> so<00:03:00.739> you

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
it has a very long battery charge so you

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.650 
it has a very long battery charge so you
don't<00:03:01.040> have<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.310> worry<00:03:01.519> about<00:03:01.700> losing<00:03:02.090> battery
