00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.210
 this house of the gentlemen half and tim 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210
 jones 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.770
 it is located in 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.900
 two hills east of playa del 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.320
 coconut 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.040
 in a lot really with some views 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.400
 sensational 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.690
 so it's designed so that 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.640
 all spaces 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.820
 they had a view of the sea 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.410
 and 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.300
 It is a pleasure 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.460
 probably eventually to do 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.540
 a house of a residence to be 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.540
 American couple 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.870
 in addition to the fabulous view that 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.390
 it has towards the coconut beach bay 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.700
 and have one 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.430
 a characteristic is a special and 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.400
 gap that is a rock formation 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.280
 of large proportions in the part of 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.560
 the back of the house that initially 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.490
 he went 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.170
 almost like a problem to solve and that to 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.200
 the long one became one of the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.070
 characteristics maybe more more 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.610
 important spaces because 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.640
 most of the spaces also live 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:05.130
 towards this rock that somehow 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.130
 it also goes on 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.310
 interior spaces are introduced 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.670
 two 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.930
 good 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.719
 two 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.469
 the layout of the house the 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.469
 configuration 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.920
 It was basically designed in three modules or 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.170
 three areas 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:51.010
 different being the first 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:54.930
 to the south in the access area 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.430
 two bedrooms with their bathrooms and a 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.730
 apartment 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.650
 with access and a very independent life 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.670
 the rest of the house 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.670
 at the other end 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.200
 It was located in the master bedroom as well 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.430
 as a suite 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.940
 with his bath and very removed from the rest of 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.390
 the house that is the central module for a 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.910
 bridge 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.610
 of wood that floats over the pool and 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.300
 that opens onto the pool with the 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.300
 sliding doors 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.750
 the main area is an open space 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.280
 where the 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:43.070
 the dining room are integrated into the area 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.720
 of the main recreation of the house that is 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.470
 a terrace that looks directly onto the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.170
 pool that flies on the ground 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.840
 communicated direct view to the sea and now to 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.110
 the one that incorporates a kitchen also 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.990
 very open 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:03.070
 that opens onto this main terrace 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:08.140
 to a side terrace kind of of a 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:12.030
 breakfast table and that incorporates 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:17.060
 the rock as one of the fingers 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.060
 of the strongest design elements 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.860
 maybe another short of the spaces that 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.300
 they have 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.260
 a special interest is the bedroom 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:35.500
 main thing that is said to me 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.500
 so that the bed 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.030
 according to tara you will almost almost not reach 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.330
 get to literally a mirror of 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.330
 Water 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.390
 integrates the pool with a waterfall this 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.390
 water mirror the only separation with 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.890
 the bed is one the glass doors that 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.490
 they open completely then it 's the 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.020
 feeling of being in the in the 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.640
 bedroom and especially the bed is 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:08.180
 almost as total integration to the soul and 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.180
 the outside 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.960
 do not 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.980
 great transparency was achieved in all 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:45.620
 the spaces using 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:49.330
 in the concrete columns that do 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.330
 float the covers 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:00.720
 and what causes a total opening of 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.720
 the spaces between each other and outwards 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.980
 in summary the house 11 is a house of 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:15.840
 playtime 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:15.840
 in a privileged place for its views 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.720
 what do you expect 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:26.260
 integrate these views to the house of 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:29.170
 views of the sea from a forest reserve 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.950
 awesome green and training 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.660
 rocky 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.810
 in the back of the house and 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:39.110
 integrate them integrating the spaces 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:42.760
 interiors and exteriors and creating a 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.760
 auspicious place for rest 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.490
 family life rather than recreation
