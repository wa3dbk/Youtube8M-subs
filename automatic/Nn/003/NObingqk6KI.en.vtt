acer<00:00:12.150> aspire<00:00:12.210> one<00:00:13.670> 532<00:00:14.670> H<00:00:14.820> -<00:00:15.179> two<00:00:15.450> five<00:00:15.660> eight

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
acer aspire one 532 H - two five eight

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.640 
acer aspire one 532 H - two five eight
eight<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:17.270> netbook<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.420> pretty<00:00:18.990> fast<00:00:19.320> I

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
eight so this netbook is pretty fast I

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.179 
eight so this netbook is pretty fast I
was<00:00:20.930> compelled<00:00:21.930> with<00:00:22.410> how<00:00:22.590> fast<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.070> was

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
was compelled with how fast it was

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.320 
was compelled with how fast it was
compared<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.680> my<00:00:25.680> other<00:00:25.710> computers<00:00:26.369> um<00:00:26.580> it's

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
compared to my other computers um it's

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.720 
compared to my other computers um it's
it's<00:00:28.320> got<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> six<00:00:28.920> cell<00:00:29.130> battery<00:00:29.160> that

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
it's got a six cell battery that

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.100 
it's got a six cell battery that
protrudes<00:00:30.420> from<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.929> bottom<00:00:31.380> right<00:00:31.619> here

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
protrudes from the bottom right here

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.020 
protrudes from the bottom right here
that's<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:34.380> reason<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.800> bought<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.160> was

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
that's one reason I bought it was

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.959 
that's one reason I bought it was
because<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:37.860> six<00:00:38.100> cell<00:00:38.280> battery<00:00:38.309> came<00:00:38.820> out

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
because of the six cell battery came out

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.850 
because of the six cell battery came out
from<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> bottom<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.690> not<00:00:39.809> from<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.590> side<00:00:40.800> so

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
from the bottom and not from the side so

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.350 
from the bottom and not from the side so
it<00:00:41.340> looks<00:00:41.870> relatively<00:00:42.870> thin<00:00:43.260> right<00:00:43.500> here<00:00:43.710> um

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
it looks relatively thin right here um

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.330 
it looks relatively thin right here um
I'll<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.390> go<00:00:45.719> over<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> side<00:00:47.129> here

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
I'll just go over this on the side here

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.690 
I'll just go over this on the side here
we<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.780> chart<00:00:48.780> wall<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.530> port<00:00:49.800> charger

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
we have the chart wall the port charger

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.770 
we have the chart wall the port charger
port<00:00:50.969> here's<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.930> wall<00:00:52.739> charger<00:00:53.160> came<00:00:53.399> with

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
port here's the wall charger came with

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.580 
port here's the wall charger came with
pretty<00:00:54.780> nice<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.829> bit<00:00:56.010> bigger<00:00:56.219> than<00:00:56.340> um

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
pretty nice it's a bit bigger than um

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.680 
pretty nice it's a bit bigger than um
Cardon<00:00:59.219> arm<00:01:00.379> cell<00:01:01.379> phone<00:01:01.559> charger<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.969> it's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
Cardon arm cell phone charger but it's

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.380 
Cardon arm cell phone charger but it's
laptop<00:01:04.199> charger<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.769> whatever<00:01:05.400> compensates

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
laptop charger so whatever compensates

laptop charger so whatever compensates
for<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:07.140> got<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> 15<00:01:07.640> pin<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.939> VGA<00:01:09.869> port

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
for that it's got a 15 pin a VGA port

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:18.950 
for that it's got a 15 pin a VGA port
two<00:01:10.920> USB<00:01:10.950> port<00:01:11.729> two<00:01:12.600> USB<00:01:12.630> 2.0<00:01:13.619> ports<00:01:17.780> we<00:01:18.780> got

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
two USB port two USB 2.0 ports we got

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.820 
two USB port two USB 2.0 ports we got
indicator<00:01:19.439> lights<00:01:19.740> right<00:01:19.979> here<00:01:21.770> all<00:01:22.770> right

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830

lights it looks pretty thin and I'd say

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.840 
lights it looks pretty thin and I'd say
it<00:01:46.350> looks<00:01:46.530> pretty<00:01:46.590> thin<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.220> laptop<00:01:47.579> there's

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
it looks pretty thin for laptop there's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.200 
it looks pretty thin for laptop there's

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.649 
whatever whatever is called when you
first<00:02:02.549> get<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.030> going<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.210> come<00:02:03.450> with<00:02:03.630> a

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
first get it it's going to come with a

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.810 
first get it it's going to come with a
little<00:02:03.990> chip<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.920> looks<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.640> is

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
little chip that looks like this this is

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.169 
little chip that looks like this this is
a<00:02:05.850> plastic<00:02:06.149> chip<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.689> hold<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.369> to<00:02:08.369> protect<00:02:08.849> it

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
a plastic chip to hold it to protect it

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.500 
a plastic chip to hold it to protect it
from<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:10.739> outside<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.120> keep<00:02:12.330> the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
from the outside and so you keep the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.550 
from the outside and so you keep the
internals<00:02:13.020> safe<00:02:13.260> I

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
internals safe I

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.100 
internals safe I
um<00:02:14.720> we<00:02:15.720> have<00:02:16.010> headphone<00:02:17.010> microphone<00:02:17.520> USB<00:02:18.390> 2.0

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
um we have headphone microphone USB 2.0

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.020 
um we have headphone microphone USB 2.0
and<00:02:19.730> Kensington<00:02:20.730> lock<00:02:21.090> right<00:02:21.330> there<00:02:21.420> um<00:02:21.780> also

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
and Kensington lock right there um also

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.110 
and Kensington lock right there um also
there's<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:25.069> Ethernet<00:02:26.069> works<00:02:26.790> pretty<00:02:26.970> good

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
there's the Ethernet works pretty good

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.140 
there's the Ethernet works pretty good
um<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:28.290> then<00:02:28.440> when<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:28.830> flip<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.160> over<00:02:29.310> with
