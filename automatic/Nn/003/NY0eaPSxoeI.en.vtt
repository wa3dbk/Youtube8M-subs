here so that you can actually set

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.640 
here so that you can actually set
another<00:01:06.060> program<00:01:06.510> now<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.750> may<00:01:07.170> not<00:01:07.320> want<00:01:07.590> to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
another program now you may not want to

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.830 
another program now you may not want to
do<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> permanent<00:01:08.610> basis<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.720> may

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
do that on a permanent basis you may

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.480 
do that on a permanent basis you may
just<00:01:10.020> want<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.260> make<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> temporary<00:01:10.799> change<00:01:10.979> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
just want to make a temporary change and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.570 
just want to make a temporary change and
if<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:12.689> then<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.680> book<00:01:13.860> explains<00:01:14.340> how<00:01:14.520> you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
if you do then the book explains how you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.030 
if you do then the book explains how you
do<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.960> push<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> memory<00:01:16.650> key<00:01:16.860> now

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
do that if you push the memory key now

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.219 
do that if you push the memory key now
and<00:01:17.280> makes<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.610> permanent<00:01:18.060> change<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:19.049> that

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
and makes it a permanent change for that

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.789 
and makes it a permanent change for that
size<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.210> if<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> set<00:01:21.840> here<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:22.170> LV<00:01:22.500> 11

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
size so if you have a set here at LV 11

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.429 
size so if you have a set here at LV 11
by<00:01:22.890> 17<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:24.450> make<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> permanent<00:01:25.259> change

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
by 17 and you make a permanent change

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.210 
by 17 and you make a permanent change
and<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.920> memorize<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:27.890> it'll<00:01:28.890> it'll

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and you memorize it then it'll it'll

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.390 
and you memorize it then it'll it'll
stay<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.640> way<00:01:30.439> until<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.680> change<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.100> again

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
stay that way until you change it again

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.219 
stay that way until you change it again
but<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.180> want<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.479> change<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:33.810> for

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
but if you want to change you just for

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.319 
but if you want to change you just for
that<00:01:34.350> booklet<00:01:35.189> run<00:01:35.490> because<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.939> papers<00:01:36.299> a
