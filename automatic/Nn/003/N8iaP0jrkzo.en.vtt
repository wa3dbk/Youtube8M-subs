00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.690
 Today I explain you here 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.450
 the app where he is, so to speak, your internet 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.790
 from your iphone can pass on 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.369
 a computer or the other ipod 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.310
 touch or on a psp or playstation 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.009
 3 to each again enabled device on 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.349
 Anyway, you can pass on good 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.270
 The first thing you do is start with that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:39.390
 of course, have your iphone gejailbreakt 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.910
 she has to open and then she has 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.790
 the data have loaded 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.920
 and then he is already learning this 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.520
 get page and then stand here 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.170
 may 4.0 either click here or 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.730
 if you like that at a later date 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.040
 makes and that is no longer here 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:02.940
 just go to search and then 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.729
 you click on it and give it once 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.009
 then you take the blue marked that 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.009
 everything is marked is in syria that 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.410
 stands for that it costs something and 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.250
 Here you see also costs on 20 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.619
 U.S. dollar 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.660
 but you have a first time you have 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.610

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.990

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:52.530

 then you open up but still open 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.290

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.569

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.569
 back again back 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.860
 So then you go up there and then click 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:20.730
 So here on applications really 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:23.010
 completely back to date so far only 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.200
 even at this time stressed back time 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:30.020
 always back and then you click here 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:36.920
 on applications then you go down 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:41.730
 and go and seek may exist here 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:44.220
 then you explain it like that and then you have to 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.040
 you here in this folder you have to 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.480
 Go back down and have the file 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:54.360
 search the web is called without underline 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.430
 only may web that must be so white 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.330
 shown but be really watch 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.880
 that the file is then click on it 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:06.420
 and then you have to look at the text 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.720
 select so then here is the 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:15.120
 displayed here and the whole wanted then 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:18.510
 edit above and now he gets there 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.030
 Just put it on and delete everything there 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.910
 now in it lets delete you out 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.410
 which is yet so I'm I 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.050
 I have a text here now 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.700
 I have to insert the here 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.680
 previously sent via e mail via 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.210
 mine about my own account 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.700
 Simply by yourself through the e-mail 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.730
 Sent the text I do then still 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.440
 times in the description with with insert 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.270
 and download that to you 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:47.570
 the download can so now is 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:50.700
 important that you do that here 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:53.460
 the date also changes the date where you 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:56.990
 the times have downloaded so 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:00.540
 trial version that was now on my 14th 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.220
 and you just have to watch us 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.810
 that really makes exactly me so 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.940
 Thinking makes a difference day 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.250
 nothing but it should be really right 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.450
 be exact and I have four 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.070
 decades has already tried 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:15.030
 that's why it's the 14th for me 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:19.470
 and then you just finish and 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:21.050
 then safely and then finished again 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:26.479
 and that fits now and now 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:28.629
 you go out now you get there again 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.629
 it 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:34.930
 now you have the conditions 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.930
 accept 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:45.440
 ok so now you are asking yourself that now 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:48.770
 or now he tells you that's yours 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:52.879
 iphone somehow restarted 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:56.830
 now you have to exit first and then 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:56.830
 The whole thing is done three times now 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:06.409
 Well 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:13.180
 as soon as your iphone restarts 

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:15.369
 you can do the my way now 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.119
 use it and it will always be down then 

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:18.759
 stand 

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:20.379
 that the trial and three days 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:22.330
 But this is not the case 

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:25.270
 Every day, nine out of nine men sap 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.819
 the state is running in three days 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.439
 so test version off so no worry that will 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:29.919
 easy to stay and always will be 

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:31.809
 his 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:35.309
 I hope I helped you with that 

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:35.309
 Until next time
