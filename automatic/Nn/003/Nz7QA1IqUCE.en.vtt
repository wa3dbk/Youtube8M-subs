probably instant queue lasers I want
that<00:00:26.679> oh<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.900> didn't<00:00:42.210> boss<00:00:43.210> final<00:00:44.820> line<00:00:45.820> with<00:00:46.000> me

that oh I didn't boss final line with me

00:00:46.120 --> 00:01:01.610 
that oh I didn't boss final line with me
let's<00:00:46.390> do<00:00:46.570> it<00:00:46.719> oh<00:00:50.820> come<00:00:51.820> on<00:00:52.059> that<00:00:52.270> was<00:00:52.300> cheap<00:00:52.690> I

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.460 

found<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:02.829> safe<00:01:03.010> spot

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:19.010 

goddammit<00:01:10.470> another<00:01:11.040> car<00:01:11.340> level<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.750> now<00:01:18.869> we're

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
goddammit another car level so now we're

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.750 
goddammit another car level so now we're
going<00:01:19.260> down<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> tubes<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> internet<00:01:20.729> I

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
going down the tubes of the internet I

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.950 
going down the tubes of the internet I
guess<00:01:21.290> this<00:01:22.290> must<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.150> mother<00:01:24.150> brain<00:01:24.660> of

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
guess this must be the mother brain of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.510 
guess this must be the mother brain of
the<00:01:25.050> internet<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.500> something<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the internet or something like the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.440 
the internet or something like the
ultimate<00:01:26.880> server<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> future<00:01:29.450> something

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
ultimate server of the future something

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.730 
ultimate server of the future something
like<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.630> i'm<00:01:30.960> sure<00:01:31.170> i<00:01:33.290> wouldn't<00:01:34.290> quote<00:01:34.560> me

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
like that i'm sure i wouldn't quote me

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.490 
like that i'm sure i wouldn't quote me
on<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.860> I'm<00:01:35.310> probably<00:01:35.550> wrong<00:01:36.320> that's<00:01:37.320> just

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
on that I'm probably wrong that's just

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.560 
on that I'm probably wrong that's just
my<00:01:37.590> guess<00:01:42.110> what<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.380> nonsense<00:01:44.570> being

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
my guess what is this nonsense being

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:54.969 
my guess what is this nonsense being
attacked<00:01:45.899> by<00:01:46.080> giant<00:01:46.140> pieces<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.950> flame<00:01:47.280> now

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979

more<00:01:55.979> instant<00:01:56.460> death<00:01:56.580> lasers<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.929> be<00:01:58.080> a

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
more instant death lasers can you be a

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.630 
more instant death lasers can you be a
little<00:01:58.200> more<00:01:58.440> visible<00:01:58.890> with<00:01:59.039> a<00:01:59.070> little<00:01:59.310> design

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
little more visible with a little design

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:11.870
