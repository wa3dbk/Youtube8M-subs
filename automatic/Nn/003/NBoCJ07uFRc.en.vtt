00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.729 
then took a dremel tool in the cutout
little<00:00:37.710> lips<00:00:38.149> to<00:00:39.149> place<00:00:39.390> your<00:00:39.660> rods<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.590> reels

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.830 
little lips to place your rods and reels
in<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.309> they<00:00:41.520> won't<00:00:41.640> slide<00:00:42.000> around<00:00:42.030> or<00:00:42.660> move

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
in so they won't slide around or move

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.889 
in so they won't slide around or move
very<00:00:43.050> much<00:00:43.370> when<00:00:44.370> you're<00:00:44.489> paddling<00:00:44.780> as<00:00:45.780> you

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
very much when you're paddling as you

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.389 
very much when you're paddling as you
can<00:00:46.020> see<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.230> locks<00:00:46.440> into<00:00:46.649> place<00:00:46.739> there<00:00:47.190> pretty

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
can see it locks into place there pretty

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.529 
can see it locks into place there pretty
well<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.920> that's<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.760> works<00:00:53.910> out<00:00:54.120> pretty<00:00:54.239> good

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
well so that's it works out pretty good

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.680 
well so that's it works out pretty good
and<00:00:54.829> then<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.860> attached<00:00:56.219> them<00:00:56.520> using<00:00:56.940> zip<00:00:57.180> ties

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
and then I attached them using zip ties

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.170 
and then I attached them using zip ties
just<00:00:58.559> zip<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.160> know<00:00:59.250> zip<00:00:59.699> ties<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
just zip you know zip ties it to the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.180 
just zip you know zip ties it to the
crate<00:01:00.390> drilled<00:01:00.930> some<00:01:01.079> holes<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.559> run<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> zip

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
crate drilled some holes and run the zip

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.490 
crate drilled some holes and run the zip
ties<00:01:02.370> through<00:01:02.579> works<00:01:03.059> out<00:01:03.210> pretty<00:01:03.359> well<00:01:03.510> but

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
ties through works out pretty well but

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.080 
ties through works out pretty well but
you<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.739> store<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.250> know<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.850> put<00:01:05.970> your

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090

look<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:33.079> falls<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.350> there

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
look at it and it just it falls in there

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.850 
look at it and it just it falls in there
nice<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.070> snug<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:36.360> not<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:37.140> know<00:01:37.320> moving

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
nice and snug it's not you know moving

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.069 
nice and snug it's not you know moving
you<00:01:38.610> know<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.210> only<00:01:39.420> way<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:39.930> like

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
you know the only way to get it is like

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.929 
you know the only way to get it is like
picking<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.619> up<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:40.979> as<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.490> as<00:01:41.640> a

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
picking it up but as you can see as a

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.149 
picking it up but as you can see as a
lift<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.450> mean<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.049> pretty<00:01:43.079> good<00:01:43.350> so

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
lift I mean it's in there pretty good so

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.520 
lift I mean it's in there pretty good so
you<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.520> worry<00:01:44.729> about<00:01:45.229> this<00:01:46.229> box
