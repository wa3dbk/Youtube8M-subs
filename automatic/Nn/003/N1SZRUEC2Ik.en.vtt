00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
whole way through what was the most

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.969

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
I think when I lost three Orleans in the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.899 
I think when I lost three Orleans in the
beginning<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.509> final<00:01:27.990> table<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.909> was

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
beginning of the final table and was

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.300 
beginning of the final table and was
like<00:01:30.119> below<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.049> ever<00:01:31.320> stack<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.100> was<00:01:32.280> a

like below the ever stack so it was a

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.090 
like below the ever stack so it was a
