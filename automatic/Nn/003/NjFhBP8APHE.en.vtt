some footage in the timeline we can add

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.039 
some footage in the timeline we can add
effects<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.910> filters<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.900> can

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
way to do that is with an adjustment

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.440 
way to do that is with an adjustment
layer<00:03:21.709> really<00:03:22.340> similar<00:03:22.579> to<00:03:22.790> photoshop<00:03:22.940> and

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
the adjustment layer i can press play

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.979 
the adjustment layer i can press play
and<00:04:19.430> now<00:04:19.820> we<00:04:19.910> see<00:04:20.090> that<00:04:20.269> the<00:04:20.509> footage<00:04:20.750> that<00:04:20.959> I

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
and now we see that the footage that I

and now we see that the footage that I
shot<00:04:21.079> has<00:04:21.530> a<00:04:21.560> little<00:04:21.859> bit<00:04:22.460> of<00:04:22.520> a<00:04:22.669> purple<00:04:23.030> hue<00:04:23.270> so

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
shot has a little bit of a purple hue so

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.890 
shot has a little bit of a purple hue so
we<00:04:24.320> can<00:04:24.440> pause<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:24.979> no<00:04:25.880> other<00:04:26.120> clips<00:04:26.479> that<00:04:26.750> we

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
we can pause that no other clips that we

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.730 
we can pause that no other clips that we
have<00:04:27.169> in<00:04:27.320> here<00:04:27.560> are<00:04:27.740> still<00:04:29.169> colored<00:04:30.169> normally

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740

very<00:04:31.550> nice<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:32.599> balanced<00:04:32.840> for<00:04:33.050> daylight

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
very nice and balanced for daylight

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.490 
very nice and balanced for daylight
outside<00:04:34.330> but<00:04:35.330> what<00:04:35.449> we<00:04:35.539> can<00:04:35.660> do<00:04:35.900> is<00:04:36.110> drag<00:04:36.320> that

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
outside but what we can do is drag that

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.110 
outside but what we can do is drag that
adjustment<00:04:36.919> layer<00:04:37.039> across<00:04:37.250> all<00:04:37.580> those<00:04:37.699> clips

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
adjustment layer across all those clips

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.480 
adjustment layer across all those clips
and<00:04:38.360> it'll<00:04:38.539> apply<00:04:38.870> that<00:04:39.199> same<00:04:39.560> color<00:04:40.160> correct

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
and it'll apply that same color correct

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.879

I've<00:04:53.509> created<00:04:53.750> a<00:04:54.020> new<00:04:54.139> sequence<00:04:54.410> here<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:55.039> I'm

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
I've created a new sequence here and I'm

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.890 
I've created a new sequence here and I'm
going<00:04:55.370> to<00:04:55.460> double<00:04:55.550> click<00:04:55.729> on<00:04:55.940> that<00:04:56.120> and<00:04:56.330> i'm

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
going to double click on that and i'm

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.980 
going to double click on that and i'm
going<00:04:57.020> to<00:04:57.080> add<00:04:57.289> that<00:04:57.680> first<00:04:58.130> shot<00:04:58.340> of<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.490> wall

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.870 
going to add that first shot of the wall
twice<00:04:59.990> to<00:05:00.320> our<00:05:00.440> clip<00:05:00.740> so<00:05:00.949> we<00:05:01.039> can<00:05:01.220> a<00:05:01.370> be<00:05:01.610> it<00:05:01.699> so

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
twice to our clip so we can a be it so

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.640 
twice to our clip so we can a be it so
you<00:05:01.940> can<00:05:02.060> see<00:05:02.210> kind<00:05:02.389> of<00:05:02.509> go<00:05:02.570> before<00:05:02.960> and<00:05:03.259> after

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
so we have the two clips in our sequence

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.810 
so we have the two clips in our sequence
