00:00:13.438 --> 00:00:15.638
 Time flew here. 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:18.696

 The time we have to live 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.314
 It's now or never again 

00:00:35.543 --> 00:00:36.904
 Can the sun come out 

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:38.332
 It may rain 

00:00:38.332 --> 00:00:41.024
 I'll be here with you. 

00:00:41.024 --> 00:00:43.639
 The beauty of an ordinary day 

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:46.728
 Only those who see know how it is 

00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:48.163
 Can the sun come out 

00:00:48.163 --> 00:00:49.627

00:01:09.893 --> 00:01:12.153
 Nothing makes me forget 

00:01:12.153 --> 00:01:15.071
 Every moment with you 

00:01:15.071 --> 00:01:17.727
 They are memories that in the end 

00:01:17.727 --> 00:01:20.504
 I take forever. 

00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:23.525
