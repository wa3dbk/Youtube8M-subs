00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.330
 hello how about youtube friends like 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.490
 I hope you are very well 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.350
 today we are going to see a package of 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.809
 new mods that has been asking me 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.840
 quite a lot of people and it has to do with the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.939
 planet series vegeta especially what 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.250
 which is the third season since it is the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.919
 most recent in this third season 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.349
 you can have the same mods that 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.910
 are using in that series and also 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.800
 they can select if they want to remove 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.020
 one that you do not like or can 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.140
 completely select the installation 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.970
 identical in this package you have to say 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.720
 that the version of minecraft that 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.450
 uses is version 1.4 points 7 as well 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.950
 which is not the most recent but 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.780
 is the one that is being used in the series 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.820
 and therefore this package decides in 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.220
 so we're going to have to play in 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.260
 that version of minecraft 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.180
 I also tell them that to those who 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.280
 are going to say to update it to the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.380
 latest versions of minecraft because no 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.590
 it's going to be possible since some of the 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.530
 mods have not left for 1.5 and so 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.650
 we can not update this package so much 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.510
 to that latest version now to begin 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.610
 with the installation the only thing they should 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.110
 do is download the file that is 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.960
 found in the description of this 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.400
 video which is the launcher and once 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.540
 that you have downloaded it will have 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.520
 the compressed file 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.490
 this file you must of 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.810
 extract it or open it to be able to take out 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.450
 the folder that is in your 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.760
 inside that folder we're going to open it 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.490
 and we will find all these files 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.020
 the only thing that we should execute would be 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.750
 This file found here 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.670
 above that basically this is the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.830
 application so we should give it 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.320
 Double click or run to start 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.030
 our installation window 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.740
 once it appears then that 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.140
 installation window as you see here 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.909
 we would only need us 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.340
 select the mods that we want to have 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.260
 installed in my case I want to have 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.090
 an identical installation so I'm going to 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.369
 leave everything marked so that I put it 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.890
 identical and then and only 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.750
 it would be necessary to click on the install button 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.369
 so that then the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.560
 installation of the mods that we have 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.420
 selected in those boxes and 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.310
 basically when you finish already 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.920
 will have the minecraft point folder 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.780
 created with all the mods also 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.270
 includes what is the textures package 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.790
 so that you can play and follow 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.260
 the vegetable planet series so 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.209
 I hope you liked this package 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.650
 of mods if you have any questions or 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.750
 some problem regarding the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.910
 installation tell me in the pages of 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.160
 facebook or twitter so that I can 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.959
 can help so I hope you have them 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.959
 liked and see you until next time
