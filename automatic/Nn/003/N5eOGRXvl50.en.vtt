00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 very good to all welcome another day 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.370
 more to the previous program channel in this 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.080
 video I will teach how to increase the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.450
 ram memory of your device 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.670
 your computer then on a laptop 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.070
 can be a desktop computer can be 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.000
 the computer you what ye 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.320
 only that I am going to do with a 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.670
 windows computer so it's going to be 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.050
 compatible with computers that have 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.210
 Windows version but equally we 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.490
 have it then be computer or windows 8.1 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.140
 windows 10 does not matter then how is it going to 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.519
 follow a very simple tunnel and what 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.260
 We will need it to be a pendrive 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.480
 what are we going to use as 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.470
 additional memory I have to tell you that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.110
 clear how to expand the memory 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.219
 using our pendrive and so 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.989
 we are going to give you a little more 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.550
 speed and we're going to improve memory 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.620
 ram and expand what we are looking for 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.149
 in this tutorial so as I say I do not 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.950
 I roll up more and let's start with the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.780
 video 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.220
 well, I fill your computer and what 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.310
 I recommend is that you have introduced a 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.680
 pendrive between 4 and 8 gb since it is the 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.750
 ideal size so we can add more 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.610
 space to our memory and optimize the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.320
 to the maximum so nothing once you already 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.910
 we have introduced simply what 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.380
 let's do it is a way we're going to 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.690
 have to erase everything we have in 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.700
 our pendrive is that nothing simply 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.170
 we give you to start the format we are going to 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.640
 ask that all are going to be deleted 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.960
 we go to yes and we wait for 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.070
 that that format 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.020
 simply what we are going to do is 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.520
 tutorial is to expand ram memory 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.680
 using the memories of our 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.119
 pendrive so we're going to have to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.130
 click the right button on our 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.960
 pendrive properties and let's render 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.940
 bust we are going to give you to use this 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.440
 device and we add the maximum value 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.090
 we check that we can not add more 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.660
 in megabytes and once we have it 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.700
 ready to accept as we give you will see 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.259
 it will not be said that this drawing is 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.300
 configuring in memory so nothing 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.130
 simply because we wait a few 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.740
 seconds and this will be completed 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.970
 satisfactorily once you've already 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.070
 let's have done nothing simply 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.960
 let's see how the alpendre will be 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.060
 filling a little better capacity the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.560
 capacity and this because the program already 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.110
 are you using 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.159
 that memory so that it's like memory 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.659
 branches so we're going to have to 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.299
 configure it also other little things to 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.159
 that this works for the better so 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.320
 let's go to the menu we go where he puts team 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.960
 press right button and go to where 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.270
 puts properties so as you see it is 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.280
 very simple computer right button and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.110
 where we properties click on 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.880
 him so we 're just going to go to 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.440
 protection of the system and we will have 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.200
 what to look for the options option 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.090
 advanced as you see out there we have it 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.010
 the option of advanced options and it's not 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.870
 nothing complicated simply once 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.150
 we have already found him we are going to where 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.549
 puts configuration in the section of 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.110
 performance and here once you 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.780
 we have given then we are going to give it again 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.900
 advanced options and we have to look 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.989
 the option where it changes in the part 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.700
 of virtual memory so let's 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.530
 change and here we're going to have to also 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.910
 to touch a couple of things we're going to 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.440
 uncheck the option that we have 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.849
 marked already 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.280
 by default it's worth it so simply 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.170
 click to unmark the and this we 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.940
 enable then that we can change a 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.590
 series of values ​​here we also have 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.079
 to give it up where it puts the size 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.680
 personalized we're going to have to touch what 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.239
 OK 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.799
 and they are not going to re-enable 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.780
 two boxes for us to enter 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.819
 information as we will see below we have 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.799
 recommended and the aggregate currently 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.930
 so we 're just going to have to 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.819
 enter the value of recommended 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.430
 let's introduce it in initial size and 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.620
 in maximum size let's put it in the 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.000
 two the two boxes we are going to put the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.319
 number of megabytes that will appear to us 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.879
 we do not have to put mine 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.680
 you have to put what you think to 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.299
 you the value that appears to you 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.430
 recommended is the one that you are going to have to 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.560
 put in also initial and maximum size 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.939
 so we just give it to accept and 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.769
 that in the changes they require a 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.030
 restart so nothing just go 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.129
 to have to start there we give to 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.900
 apply we accept and we have to go 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.909
 closing everything because it is in the middle of 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.439
 close then giving him to apply or he will 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.329
 accept so do not say it takes 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.859
 a reboot and we're going to do 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.629
 case and we're going to restart our 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.209
 computer is very important it is worth 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.799
 let's have our our pendrive that 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.510
 with which we have done these already always 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.250
 plugged in as it's going to be by our 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.989
 expansion of ram memories 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.609
 if we remove it because our computer is going 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.739
 to lose that ram memory that he had 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.329
 assigned to maintain those those changes are 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.950
 very important and once rebooted already 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.070
 you can enjoy more ram memory in 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.520
 your device 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.520
 so good guys 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.430
 subscribe or for many more viewed as 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.720
 you know this channel Prokart 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.550
 review since you are going to be able to us 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.470
 a lot more content related to 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.910
 the world of technology so if you 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.530
 I liked that you will go through 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.170
