00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.640
 Wagner did something he had never done before. 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.800
 He no longer literally returns the motifs. 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.160
 They develop, also in the negative. There are also motives that crumble. 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.880
 Especially at the end, where the Götterdämmerung motif falls apart. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.120
 When the Siegfried motif returns for the last time, it falls apart. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.280
 He used that dramaturgical effect much less in his early works. 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.480
 The motifs always returned there in the same form. 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.520
 I have sung many Götterdämmerungen, in all kinds of staging. 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.800
 But here the mise-en-scene bears the stamp of Pierre Audi. 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.200
 He demands that even the smallest movements are correct ... 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.560
 and that all cans and all steps are fully synchronous. 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.040
 That makes the rehearsals very tough. 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 Sometimes you have something of: Is it not good enough now? 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.280
 But it has resulted in a unique overall picture ... 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.720
 and that makes this Ring a very special one. 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.760
 We consciously opted for a different approach than in Bayreuth ... 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.880
 but it had to remain typical of Wagner ... 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.440
 because the audience must be drawn into the show. 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.560
 Then you can focus more on the music and the lyrics. 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.880
 You can also work in much more detail in the scenes ... 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 then when the stage is so far away. 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.240
 Wagner was a completely unique musical genius. 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.800
 People keep saying that he allowed himself to be used politically ... 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.200
 and that he himself was politically wrong, but that is all independent of his genius. 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.440
 You should definitely look at the person Wagner with a critical eye. 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.960
 But his work is so fascinating, so fantastic and so unique ... 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.080
 that you cannot ignore its enormous significance for music history. 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.480
 It is beyond doubt for me ... 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.920
 otherwise I would not have been able to conduct the Ring 32 times and Parsifal 50 times. 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.080
 I am a Wagner enthusiast, not a Wagner admirer. That is something else.
