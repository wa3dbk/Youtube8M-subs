00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
you're popping it kind of power power

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.180 
you're popping it kind of power power

that jig is staying in the strike is on

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.360 
that jig is staying in the strike is on
longer<00:02:40.349> when<00:02:40.500> you're<00:02:40.620> normally<00:02:40.799> throwing<00:02:41.310> a

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
jig and reeling it fast it's coming

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.570 
jig and reeling it fast it's coming
really<00:02:43.230> quick<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.799> fish<00:02:44.010> has<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.370> really

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
really quick and a fish has to really

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.240 
really quick and a fish has to really
quickly<00:02:45.239> commit<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.140> sometimes<00:02:46.829> they<00:02:47.040> miss

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
quickly commit to it sometimes they miss

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.979 
quickly commit to it sometimes they miss
it<00:02:47.459> sometimes<00:02:47.849> they<00:02:48.030> follow<00:02:48.329> and<00:02:48.599> turn<00:02:48.780> you

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
it sometimes they follow and turn you

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.089 
it sometimes they follow and turn you
never<00:02:49.200> know<00:02:49.349> it<00:02:49.530> but<00:02:49.650> when<00:02:49.769> it's<00:02:49.890> sitting

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
never know it but when it's sitting

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.199 
never know it but when it's sitting
there<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.400> one<00:02:50.610> spot<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.090> it's

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
there in that one spot and it's

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.330 
there in that one spot and it's
pulsating<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.380> it's<00:02:52.530> swimming<00:02:52.829> yet<00:02:53.130> it's

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
pulsating and it's swimming yet it's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.460 
pulsating and it's swimming yet it's
kind<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.610> in<00:02:53.819> slow<00:02:54.480> motion<00:02:54.780> but<00:02:55.110> it's<00:02:55.260> staying

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
kind of in slow motion but it's staying

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.350 
kind of in slow motion but it's staying
up<00:02:55.829> you<00:02:56.310> know<00:02:56.430> there's<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.700> lot<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:56.970> have<00:02:57.090> longer

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
up you know there's a lot to have longer

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.119 
up you know there's a lot to have longer
to<00:02:57.599> commit<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.110> come<00:02:58.290> get<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.560> jig<00:02:58.980> and

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
to commit to come get that jig and

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.949 
to commit to come get that jig and
that's<00:02:59.310> what<00:02:59.610> makes<00:03:00.150> them<00:03:00.329> bite<00:03:00.569> it<00:03:00.780> and

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
that's what makes them bite it and

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.380 
that's what makes them bite it and
that's<00:03:01.590> why<00:03:01.769> that<00:03:01.950> power<00:03:02.190> swimming<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.879> think

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
that's why that power swimming I think

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.000 
that's why that power swimming I think
is<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:04.079> know<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.410> first<00:03:04.590> thing<00:03:04.829> I<00:03:04.950> do

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
is you know the first thing I do

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.890 
is you know the first thing I do
everywhere<00:03:05.549> I<00:03:05.579> go<00:03:05.879> now<00:03:06.060> I'll<00:03:06.209> do<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.690> way

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
everywhere I go now I'll do it that way

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.140 
everywhere I go now I'll do it that way
it<00:03:07.379> also<00:03:07.530> pops<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.250> braid<00:03:08.519> right<00:03:08.849> at<00:03:09.030> the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
it also pops the braid right at the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.729 
it also pops the braid right at the
water<00:03:09.360> surface<00:03:09.629> makes<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.200> little<00:03:10.349> ticking

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
water surface makes a little ticking

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.410 
water surface makes a little ticking
sound<00:03:11.040> like<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.280> craw<00:03:11.579> fish<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:12.000> think

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
sound like a craw fish I think

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.710 
sound like a craw fish I think
and<00:03:12.540> also<00:03:13.730> you<00:03:14.730> know<00:03:14.849> if<00:03:14.970> you've<00:03:15.090> got<00:03:15.120> rattles

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
and also you know if you've got rattles

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.870 
and also you know if you've got rattles
on<00:03:15.840> your<00:03:15.989> jig<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.349> makes<00:03:16.530> your<00:03:16.709> jig<00:03:16.920> rattle<00:03:17.400> so

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
on your jig it makes your jig rattle so

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.819 
on your jig it makes your jig rattle so
that's<00:03:18.060> several<00:03:18.690> reasons<00:03:19.109> why<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.319> do<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.680> that

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
that's several reasons why I do it that

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.190 
that's several reasons why I do it that
way<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.250> works<00:03:20.430> really<00:03:20.700> well<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.959> set

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
way and it works really well and to set

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.870 
way and it works really well and to set
up<00:03:22.319> you<00:03:22.500> being<00:03:22.889> you've<00:03:23.069> got<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.400> use<00:03:23.519> braids

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
up you being you've got to use braids

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.370 
up you being you've got to use braids
that's<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.299> whole<00:03:24.450> deal<00:03:24.600> ever<00:03:24.840> some<00:03:25.139> people

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
that's the whole deal ever some people

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.780 
that's the whole deal ever some people
ask<00:03:25.560> all<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.829> times<00:03:26.100> can<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.430> do<00:03:26.579> it<00:03:26.700> without

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
ask all the times can you do it without

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.610 
ask all the times can you do it without
braids<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.600> don't<00:03:27.780> think<00:03:27.989> you<00:03:28.079> can<00:03:28.230> braid

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
braids and I don't think you can braid
