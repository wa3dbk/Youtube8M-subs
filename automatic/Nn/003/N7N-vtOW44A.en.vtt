00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
don't you think you're trying to be in a

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.269 
don't you think you're trying to be in a
dick<00:00:23.550> about<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:24.320> he<00:00:25.320> didn't<00:00:25.560> actually<00:00:25.769> say<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279

dick about it he didn't actually say the
last<00:00:26.519> part<00:00:26.849> but<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.240> guarantee<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.840> that

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
last part but I can guarantee you that

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.929 
last part but I can guarantee you that
if<00:00:28.320> he<00:00:28.439> had<00:00:28.560> more<00:00:28.830> characters<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.550> work<00:00:29.580> with

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
if he had more characters to work with

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.460 
if he had more characters to work with
that's<00:00:30.240> exactly<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:30.990> do<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.109> want<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.289> say

but<00:00:32.130> then<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.399> slept<00:00:32.969> on<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.630> thought

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
but then I slept on it and I thought

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.020 
but then I slept on it and I thought
Derek<00:00:34.350> perhaps<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.920> want<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.250> seek<00:00:35.579> out<00:00:35.760> yet

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
Derek perhaps you want to seek out yet

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.580 
Derek perhaps you want to seek out yet
another<00:00:36.329> version<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.050> review<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.469> because

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
another version and review it because

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.440 
another version and review it because
clearly<00:00:37.980> that's<00:00:38.460> what<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> internet<00:00:39.210> wants

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
clearly that's what the internet wants

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.240 
clearly that's what the internet wants
either<00:00:40.079> because<00:00:40.440> they<00:00:40.590> want<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.040> give<00:00:41.219> it

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
either because they want you to give it

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.850 
either because they want you to give it
a<00:00:41.489> fair<00:00:41.940> shake<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.870> more<00:00:43.020> positive<00:00:43.260> review

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
a fair shake and a more positive review

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.010 
a fair shake and a more positive review

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
or because they're just huge jerk-offs

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.380 
or because they're just huge jerk-offs
who<00:00:46.410> want<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.680> watch<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.129> slowly<00:00:47.760> descend

don't<00:03:46.150> even<00:03:46.420> know<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.720> they<00:03:47.049> even<00:03:47.079> exist

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
don't even know that they even exist

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.920 
don't even know that they even exist
anymore<00:03:48.220> because<00:03:48.910> once<00:03:49.150> they're<00:03:49.420> off<00:03:49.540> into

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
anymore because once they're off into

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.259 
anymore because once they're off into
the<00:03:50.019> internet<00:03:50.500> they're<00:03:50.980> just<00:03:51.280> they<00:03:51.489> just<00:03:51.519> and

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
the internet they're just they just and

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.660 
the internet they're just they just and
the<00:03:52.389> internet<00:03:52.780> is<00:03:52.810> like<00:03:53.109> space<00:03:53.530> they<00:03:54.459> just

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
the internet is like space they just

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.000 
the internet is like space they just
float<00:03:55.060> forever

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
float forever

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.680 
float forever
although<00:03:57.010> space<00:03:57.340> is<00:03:57.549> like<00:03:57.700> a<00:03:57.760> vacuum<00:03:58.060> and

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
although space is like a vacuum and

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.870 
although space is like a vacuum and
there's<00:03:59.079> no<00:03:59.260> oxygen<00:03:59.530> so<00:04:00.130> if<00:04:00.220> you<00:04:00.370> float<00:04:00.670> in

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
there's no oxygen so if you float in

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.500 
there's no oxygen so if you float in
space<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.600> will<00:04:01.690> literally<00:04:02.049> die<00:04:02.500> instantly

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
space you will literally die instantly

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.120 
space you will literally die instantly
which<00:04:04.510> is<00:04:04.690> kind<00:04:05.019> of<00:04:05.109> like<00:04:05.260> playing<00:04:05.500> pac-man

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
which is kind of like playing pac-man

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.120 
which is kind of like playing pac-man
