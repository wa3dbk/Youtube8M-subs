 powerful mazembe englebert 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.040

 the other african champion roger clavet

 raza breaks the screen to great happiness 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.250
 of his project coach brings us to the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.869
 times an offensive diversity because it 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.420
 can play almost anywhere but 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.830
 especially a realism it is it is as soon 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.720
 we approach the goal we really feel 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.310
 that he has this quality that can still 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.170
 improve but he already has a quality of 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.750
 fantastic passes a quality 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.100
 of elimination a call quality and a 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.570
 quality of finish 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.370
 spearhead of séwé sport de san pedro 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.930
 with which he failed in the final of the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.840
 Confederation Cup last year 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.570
 roger to salty 22 years is all-powerful 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.809
 mazembe first and foremost to progress the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.840
 Unemployment ed is a great club 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.870
 of Africa and this choice it is purely 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.469
 personal and because it's a stepping stone 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.680
 for me 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.289
 to learn better because I had 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.339
 been solicited by several clubs in 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.930
 europe but the chalet tp mazembe c it's 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.439
 still an apprenticeship because I am 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.729

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.200
 waiting for this departure scheduled for 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.549
 europe this is at the stage that mazembe 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.110
 the Ivorian repeats its ranges 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.060
 it is he who offers himself the first 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.549
 opportunity of this match against the stadium 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.470
 Malian before being at the origin of the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.000
 fault that allows kasusula to open the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.000
 score on a sumptuous free kick

 Moses Katumbi Chapwe President of the Club 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.860
 lou choice he did bring this 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.430
 season is satisfied but rather think about 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.830
 team 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.570
 until then he scored goal you know 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.760
 for a player for the game he must 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.440
 mark the goal but it's the system of 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.810
