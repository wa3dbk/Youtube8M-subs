00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 and a whole sky a little metropolitan media 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.220
 there is information that two 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.529
 passenger aircraft almost 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.599
 faced over moscow reported that 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.599
 airliner airline flight 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.040
 Moscow for some unknown reason 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.360
 deviated from the course and was on the way 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.900
 utair aircraft 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.900
 she flew from arkhangelsk and both boeing 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.000
 were at the same height of 600 meters each 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.570
 for a minute, while the distances between 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 they are not reduced to two and a half 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.109
 kilometers escape disaster 2 itself 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.210
 second plane 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.600
 I had to take it higher, but the first one was sharp 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.309
 turned right as a result Transaero liner 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.410
 found himself in the restricted area he crossed 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.870
 the city limits and flew over Kutuzov skim 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.739
 by prospectus especially well 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.680
 landed 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.690
 however , the company has denied the fact 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.550
 dangerous crew approach timely 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.949
 professionally responded to the failure 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.140
 ground automatics in 1000 nominally 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.149
 landed manually when 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.710
 this is no dangerous approach to other 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.960
 by aircraft 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.619
 airlines had no threat for 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.390
 passenger safety did not arise 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.330
 called dangerous convergence of aircraft in 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.100
 the air is not so rare when 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.290
 This happened when between liners 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.450
 only a few hundred meters remained to the press 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.520
 write that something similar happened about 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.470
 two weeks ago and again in the sky above 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.549
 metropolitan area two passenger 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.770
 the sides missed each other at a distance of 450 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.390
 meters well, true in height all 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.100
 ended safely sent 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.900
 expert with competent behavior 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.590
 pilots all this is not a threat 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.590
 for people 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.249
 the face is not immediately attacked by noon and 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.950
 catastrophes that comes possibly 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:53.030
 the proportions of any state along the way we 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.030
 worked normally
