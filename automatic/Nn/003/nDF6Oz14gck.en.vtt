into my old let's play world don't worry
this<00:00:16.980> world<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.609> backed<00:00:17.880> up<00:00:18.090> as<00:00:18.330> well<00:00:18.539> if

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
this world is backed up as well if

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.689 
this world is backed up as well if
anything<00:00:19.109> goes<00:00:19.410> horribly<00:00:19.830> wrong<00:00:19.949> with<00:00:20.520> this

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.639 
don't don't appear in this version of
the<00:00:40.350> code<00:00:40.680> yet<00:00:41.750> I<00:00:42.750> don't<00:00:43.170> know<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.440> that's

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the code yet I don't know if that's

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.410 
the code yet I don't know if that's
because<00:00:43.710> they're<00:00:44.100> fixing<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.640> or<00:00:44.820> if<00:00:45.149> it's

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
because they're fixing it or if it's

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
because it's something weird with the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.930 
because it's something weird with the
lighting<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.260> deep<00:00:49.680> levels<00:00:50.160> as<00:00:50.340> well<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.760> see

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
lighting at deep levels as well you see

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.020 
lighting at deep levels as well you see
it's<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.930> up<00:00:52.170> very<00:00:52.469> well<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.340> don't<00:00:53.940> know

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it's not it up very well so I don't know

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.470 
it's not it up very well so I don't know
what<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> deal<00:00:54.480> with<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.199> um<00:00:56.390> need<00:00:57.390> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
what the deal with that is but um need a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.330 
what the deal with that is but um need a
couple<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.870> mushrooms<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.890> yeah<00:00:59.070> apparently

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
couple of mushrooms so yeah apparently

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.770 
couple of mushrooms so yeah apparently
natural<00:01:00.239> mushroom<00:01:00.629> biomes<00:01:01.020> don't<00:01:01.379> spawn<00:01:02.629> in

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.679 

on<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.890> rowing<00:01:08.100> at<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.490> moment<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.390> can

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
on the rowing at the moment but you can

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.679 
on the rowing at the moment but you can
create<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.170> giant<00:01:10.590> mushrooms<00:01:11.100> by<00:01:11.630> using<00:01:14.689> bone

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
create the giant mushrooms by using bone

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.789 
create the giant mushrooms by using bone
meal<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.460> normal<00:01:17.460> mushrooms<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.780> we'll<00:01:19.530> go<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
meal on normal mushrooms so we'll go and

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:28.580 
meal on normal mushrooms so we'll go and
see<00:01:19.860> if<00:01:20.159> that's<00:01:20.340> actually<00:01:20.640> true<00:01:20.939> or<00:01:21.390> not<00:01:27.590> so

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
see if that's actually true or not so

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.289 
see if that's actually true or not so
yeah<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> seems<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.549> hard<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.090> light

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
yeah it seems like it's hard to do light

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.350 
yeah it seems like it's hard to do light
stuff<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.869> deeper<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.409> are<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:32.119> don't<00:01:33.119> know<00:01:33.270> if

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
stuff the deeper you are I don't know if

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.530 
stuff the deeper you are I don't know if
that's<00:01:33.509> intentional<00:01:33.689> or<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:38.000> so<00:01:39.000> should

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
that's intentional or not and so should

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.560 
that's intentional or not and so should
be<00:01:39.689> no<00:01:39.900> war<00:01:40.170> here<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:42.079> know<00:01:43.079> um<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.350> do<00:01:43.530> don't<00:01:43.979> I

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
be no war here I know um I do don't I

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.359 
be no war here I know um I do don't I
just<00:01:45.570> noticed<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.200> as<00:01:46.409> well<00:01:46.530> now<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.829> chests

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
just noticed this as well now the chests

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.639 
just noticed this as well now the chests
are<00:01:47.549> different<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.270> earth<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.409> have

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
are different the earth that I have

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.670 
are different the earth that I have
behind<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.310> chests<00:01:50.790> used<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.570> be<00:01:51.689> hidden<00:01:52.079> but

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
behind the chests used to be hidden but

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.149 
behind the chests used to be hidden but
now<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.890> have<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.310> tidy<00:01:53.549> those<00:01:53.850> balls<00:01:54.149> up<00:01:54.920> well<00:01:55.920> I

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
now I have to tidy those balls up well I

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.850 
now I have to tidy those balls up well I
won't<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.780> continue<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.469> play<00:01:58.649> this

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
won't have to if I continue to play this

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.850 
won't have to if I continue to play this
welder<00:01:59.369> will<00:01:59.810> but<00:02:00.810> i<00:02:00.869> think<00:02:01.140> i<00:02:01.229> might<00:02:01.380> start<00:02:01.740> a

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
welder will but i think i might start a

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.160 
welder will but i think i might start a
new<00:02:02.040> world<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.210> if<00:02:03.479> your<00:02:03.630> local<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.960> copy

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
new world so that if your local can copy

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.999 
new world so that if your local can copy
the<00:02:04.409> seed<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.899> anything<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.020> find<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.860> go

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the seed and anything I find you can go

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.820 
the seed and anything I find you can go
check<00:02:08.250> out<00:02:08.429> yourself<00:02:09.410> because<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.440> what

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
check out yourself because this what

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.660 
check out yourself because this what
will<00:02:11.009> be<00:02:11.220> up<00:02:11.400> too<00:02:11.849> much<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.270> mishmash

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
will be up too much of a mishmash

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.820 
will be up too much of a mishmash
