 attention to everyone because we are in a 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.970
 new news has to do with watch 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:34.480
 attention box because the game needs 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:38.410
 help a lot seems to be that whatsapp 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.120
 docs is scribbled in will you not only 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.100
 delays the day of its release but 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.559
 who is now a creative director and 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.670
 he spoke on his twitter account and he has 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.550
 requested help this is already enough 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.410
 worrying 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.350
 ubisoft said that this week will be 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.850
 very important the umbrella 2 the past 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.300
 Thursday it was finally announced that the 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.129
 date of birth was going to be May 27 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.720
 after a lot of talk rumors 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.510
 a lot of the channel about the game by 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.190
 end is confirmed but there was a doubt already 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.470
 that in the promotional trailer it appeared 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.140
 the wii logo did not mean that 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.740
 would leave on the same day also none of that 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.899
 did he confirmed his delay and now the 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.080
 creative director of the game asks for help 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.369
 for the nintendo console version 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.250
 it really is quite enigmatic because 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.440
 the creative director who asks for help or 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.440
 is very up to the neck or the version of 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.590
 wii u is in pretty bad shape 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.600
 the truth is that it is not the only thing that yesterday 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.310
 Yesterday he had to answer in 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.570
 ubisoft after the announcement of the date of 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.280
 launch because it's something a very good 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.120
 you already know with the graphic quality of the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.480
 game had to leave creations from 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.040
 denying a soft denied that he came down from 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.090
 game will lower its quality of the version of 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.520
 excel 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.190
 well, it must be said that soap opera has been 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.640
 long long long but good now yes 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.030
 do not 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.780
 Jonathan Boring his creative director at 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.510
 a twitter account the modding was 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.780
 answering several tweets about coarse 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.850
 in will you that allowed us to know a 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.010
 little bit more the reason for the delay in 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.260
 first place indicated that they needed 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.020
 focus on the game experience and 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.500
 they needed a little staff to 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.400
 wii 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.580
 with said he also needed to help 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.750
 that like the other platforms the 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.670
 windows version will also be 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.040
 multiplayer and maybe it will be the world 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.080
 open logically something that according to him 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.080
 is contributing to these 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.209
 logistical complications at the time of 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.160
 develop rooms in the console 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.660
 nintendo in the description source 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.540
 you have everything all all the evidence 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.170
 really he said it's a matter of 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.230
 Logistics 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.110
 or I really Marjah has come in 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.410
 everything on top or what is really happening 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.140
 with this game what fear gives me also 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.470
 same as the 360 the titans version 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.550
 Failed this game, it scares me so 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.950
 that with the good look he had and the 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.520
 crap that seems to do 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.170
 make a generational game what do you want 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.599
 say this then it will come out in the 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.350
 previous and in the current generation something 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:28.690
 that for me is a mistake and forget ropes 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.350
 developers forgot to please for 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.690
 it's a tremendous mistake to work for 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.090
 save others because the money takes you 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.040
 in many places and in the end it does not 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.170
 no good version that's my opinion 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.850
 a hug to all the favorites we 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.850
 we see the next thank you for being there
