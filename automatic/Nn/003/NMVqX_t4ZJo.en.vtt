if<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.630> makes<00:01:15.810> sense<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.649> only<00:01:16.890> use<00:01:17.039> these

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
if that makes sense so I only use these

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
I must have been that like a period of

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.130 
I must have been that like a period of
time<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.329> I<00:01:21.420> use<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.900> mic<00:01:22.159> for<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.810> week<00:01:24.810> or<00:01:24.990> so

I think it's cinnamon that it smells

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.009 
I think it's cinnamon that it smells
like<00:02:59.150> and<00:03:00.150> then<00:03:00.330> leaves<00:03:00.540> your<00:03:00.630> hair<00:03:00.750> smell

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
like and then leaves your hair smell

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.920 
like and then leaves your hair smell
like<00:03:01.050> that<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.530> if<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.850> are<00:03:02.910> washing<00:03:03.209> hair<00:03:03.569> and

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
like that so if you are washing hair and

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.059 
like that so if you are washing hair and
you<00:03:04.050> don't<00:03:04.140> want<00:03:04.319> a<00:03:04.350> strong<00:03:04.530> smell<00:03:04.769> than<00:03:04.950> this

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.190 
smooth um which I really liked about it
and<00:03:21.569> I<00:03:21.630> really<00:03:21.780> like<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.959> smell<00:03:22.430> um<00:03:23.989> it's<00:03:24.989> not

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
and I really like the smell um it's not

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.990 
and I really like the smell um it's not
cheap<00:03:25.470> though<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:26.010> think<00:03:26.069> they<00:03:26.549> call<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.760> pro

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
cheap though I think they call it pro

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.610 
cheap though I think they call it pro
because<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.299> wasn't<00:03:27.480> like<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.870> section<00:03:28.260> box<00:03:28.380> I

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
because it wasn't like a section box I

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.229 
because it wasn't like a section box I
think<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.100> might<00:03:29.280> have<00:03:29.370> been<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.519> bit<00:03:29.700> cheaper<00:03:30.060> I

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
think it might have been a bit cheaper I

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.120 
think it might have been a bit cheaper I
find<00:03:30.750> out<00:03:30.870> how<00:03:30.930> much<00:03:31.049> these<00:03:31.200> are<00:03:31.350> online<00:03:31.500> but
