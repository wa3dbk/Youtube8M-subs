I<00:00:08.790> can't<00:00:09.790> say<00:00:10.030> enough<00:00:10.330> good<00:00:10.570> things<00:00:10.630> about<00:00:11.080> the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.290 
I can't say enough good things about the

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.400 
I can't say enough good things about the
conversion<00:00:11.830> to<00:00:12.100> Schneider<00:00:12.880> own<00:00:13.120> chassis<00:00:13.690> once

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
conversion to Schneider own chassis once

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.720 
conversion to Schneider own chassis once
we<00:00:14.530> converted<00:00:14.890> the<00:00:15.070> Schneider<00:00:15.280> own<00:00:15.460> chassis

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
we converted the Schneider own chassis

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.069 
we converted the Schneider own chassis
x'<00:00:15.940> it<00:00:16.150> was<00:00:16.240> like<00:00:16.390> night<00:00:16.570> and<00:00:16.599> day

00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:17.079 
x' it was like night and day

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.319 
x' it was like night and day
when<00:00:17.380> we<00:00:17.619> were<00:00:17.769> using<00:00:18.009> a<00:00:18.400> chassis<00:00:19.089> pool<00:00:19.300> I

when we were using a chassis pool I

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.689 
when we were using a chassis pool I
would<00:00:19.689> generally<00:00:19.929> have<00:00:20.199> to<00:00:20.349> flip<00:00:20.650> a<00:00:20.919> chassis

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:21.699 
would generally have to flip a chassis

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.460 
would generally have to flip a chassis

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
it on to a chassis and good repair since

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.400 
it on to a chassis and good repair since
we've<00:00:34.540> converted<00:00:34.810> the<00:00:35.020> Schneider<00:00:35.260> own

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
we've converted the Schneider own

we've converted the Schneider own
chassis<00:00:35.860> I've<00:00:36.310> probably<00:00:36.850> flipped<00:00:37.210> a<00:00:37.450> chassis

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.740 
chassis I've probably flipped a chassis
maybe<00:00:38.890> twice<00:00:39.310> in<00:00:39.490> the<00:00:39.550> last<00:00:39.670> six<00:00:39.940> months<00:00:40.240> the

new chassis have impacted a couple of

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.390

standpoint with our own chassis is we

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.130

chassis is have allowed myself and all
of<00:01:40.060> our<00:01:40.150> drivers<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.810> increase<00:01:41.470> our

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
productivity because our turnaround time

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.680 
productivity because our turnaround time
is<00:01:43.840> so<00:01:43.990> much<00:01:44.140> shorter<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.880> the

is so much shorter and the the

is so much shorter and the the
maintenance<00:01:47.080> is<00:01:47.320> so<00:01:47.500> much<00:01:47.650> better<00:01:47.860> it<00:01:48.159> allows

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
maintenance is so much better it allows

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.210 
maintenance is so much better it allows

our<00:01:58.900> drivers<00:01:59.260> have<00:01:59.439> more<00:01:59.979> confidence<00:02:00.580> and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
our drivers have more confidence and

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.609 
our drivers have more confidence and
safety<00:02:01.180> when<00:02:01.570> they're<00:02:01.689> pulling<00:02:02.049> our<00:02:02.320> chassis

safety when they're pulling our chassis

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.500 
safety when they're pulling our chassis
is<00:02:02.830> compared<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.549> leased<00:02:03.820> equipment<00:02:04.420> that

is compared to the leased equipment that

excited about fins these chassis it's
made<00:02:09.849> life<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.270> much<00:02:10.330> easier
