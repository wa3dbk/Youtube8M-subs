00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.510
 with our present 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.849
 ah 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.220
 now 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.590
 now is the most important moment 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.450
 Yellow is a kind of throne which 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.280
 The bride goes up and the girls take her 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.910
 that accompany it and that we sing it in 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.910
 the writers 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:53.310
 of ten thousand euros when the girlfriend of 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.230
 clothing depends on the economic power that 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.330
 have the role of the couple in a 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.340
 Moroccan wedding is to teach everyone 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.100
 the guests the purchasing power of 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.780
 families are exhibited with this dance and 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 with the three dresses that the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.100
 girlfriend throughout the night 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.430
 How are you 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.420
 how much can he carry on top of that 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.420
 you are excited to vicente 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.930
 same 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.439
 because only Spanish girls dance 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.960
 most women are not 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.880
 used to share or celebrate 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.700
 a wedding with men because they tend to 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.560
 separate are usually separated 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.079
 they are ashamed not encouraged as 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.770
 we encourage ourselves in the fashion of carving 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.770
 the little glasses 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.020
 best 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:13.420
 Paula imagined that her wedding was going to be 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.420
 as well as created with raised hands 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.040
 what does this mean because I believe that people 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.110
 is really here with me this is the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.209
 second time they leave and how many times 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.650
 more is one more very happy is one 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.300
 experience that until this is not 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.300

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.120
 Y 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.890
 this second dish is lemon chicken 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.890
 butter drug 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.810
 and there we see a group of girls 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.000
 young headlines that are of age 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.190
 marriageable on the building without 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.810
 a wedding always comes another wedding because 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.420
 you have seen how beautiful they are 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.420
 pain with the condemned ones and it is 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.100
 a makeup because they get so pretty 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.120
 induce themselves look also future husband 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.120
 let's say it better 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.080
 because she has gotten so pretty 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.880
 what's up with that 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.230
 to her friend 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.090
 so good 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.770
 usually culminate with the wedding dress 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.350
 traditional white is the big one too 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.780
 is used because his singer was in 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.240
 the Catholic rite of the 12th a new 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.240
 incorporation for the most own bride 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.359
 what they mean means that you're 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.359
 very pretty is gleaming 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.290
 the most cut means he was 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.850
 until the end of the wedding and I have it 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.889
 to teach my husband when he gets to 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.019
 house when a Moroccan woman paid a 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.910
 wedding a special occasion to leave 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.240
 your house is like a proof of 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.160
 spend a ball we put the candy 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.220
 inside the napkins we put them 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.570
 inside and you could already tell me they have to 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.570
 bring and passport to home 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.480

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.099
 under rope 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.550
 now all cars always stop and 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.650
 we go all over the town removing by 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.830
 all the town at three thirty of the 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.830

 I 'm telling you , it 's early 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:24.460
 without the ritual of cars honking and 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.460
 the turn signals on there is no wedding 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.220
