00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
constantly and I don't know why he's not

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.080 
constantly and I don't know why he's not
in<00:03:38.889> Phase<00:03:39.189> II<00:03:39.220> I'm<00:03:39.489> it's<00:03:39.760> probably<00:03:39.879> just

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
in Phase II I'm it's probably just

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.059 
in Phase II I'm it's probably just
because<00:03:40.209> there's<00:03:40.989> gonna<00:03:41.079> be<00:03:41.260> an<00:03:41.349> RC<00:03:41.650> coming<00:03:41.949> up

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
because there's gonna be an RC coming up

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.920 
because there's gonna be an RC coming up
hopefully<00:03:42.609> phase<00:03:43.090> picks<00:03:43.359> them<00:03:43.509> up<00:03:43.569> from<00:03:43.780> this

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
hopefully phase picks them up from this

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.780 
hopefully phase picks them up from this
I<00:03:44.139> also<00:03:44.560> think<00:03:44.739> phase<00:03:44.949> should<00:03:45.129> pick<00:03:45.250> up<00:03:45.340> super

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
I also think phase should pick up super

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.159 
I also think phase should pick up super
it's<00:03:45.939> another<00:03:46.150> guy<00:03:46.329> that<00:03:46.509> I've<00:03:46.599> talked<00:03:46.930> about

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.219 
a bit and some of my old commentaries
one<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.239> commentators<00:03:49.659> on<00:03:49.750> voice<00:03:50.019> of

one of the commentators on voice of

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.539 
one of the commentators on voice of
community<00:03:50.650> should<00:03:50.739> go<00:03:50.859> check<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:51.189> out<00:03:51.250> I

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
community should go check that out I

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.039 
community should go check that out I
talked<00:03:51.819> about<00:03:52.000> how<00:03:52.090> I<00:03:52.120> thought<00:03:52.419> super<00:03:52.840> should

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
talked about how I thought super should

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.170 
talked about how I thought super should
be<00:03:53.199> in<00:03:53.620> phase<00:03:53.919> as<00:03:54.129> well<00:03:54.280> because<00:03:54.609> super<00:03:55.030> is<00:03:55.150> a

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
be in phase as well because super is a

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.939 
be in phase as well because super is a
crazy<00:03:55.629> play<00:03:55.959> super<00:03:56.319> should<00:03:56.470> have<00:03:56.590> made<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.829> in

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949 
crazy play super should have made it in

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.879 
crazy play super should have made it in
in<00:03:57.189> my<00:03:57.430> opinion<00:03:57.669> in<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.269> first<00:03:58.479> phase<00:03:59.259> five<00:03:59.530> RC

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
in my opinion in the first phase five RC

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.949 
in my opinion in the first phase five RC
but<00:04:00.159> he<00:04:00.310> didn't<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:00.759> I<00:04:01.299> guess<00:04:01.449> that's<00:04:01.569> okay<00:04:01.930> i

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
but he didn't and I guess that's okay i

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.330 
but he didn't and I guess that's okay i
guess<00:04:02.379> that<00:04:02.530> he's<00:04:02.650> gonna<00:04:02.739> have<00:04:02.889> to<00:04:02.979> work<00:04:03.099> hard

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
guess that he's gonna have to work hard

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.740 
guess that he's gonna have to work hard
this<00:04:03.459> time<00:04:03.639> and<00:04:03.849> I'm<00:04:03.939> kind<00:04:04.120> of<00:04:04.150> excited<00:04:04.419> to<00:04:04.569> see
