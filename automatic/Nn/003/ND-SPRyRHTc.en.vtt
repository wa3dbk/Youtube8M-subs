that I uploaded back in January and I

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.570 
that I uploaded back in January and I
just<00:00:17.130> used<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.580> little<00:00:17.940> heart<00:00:18.390> cut<00:00:18.779> out<00:00:19.580> to

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
just used a little heart cut out to

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.759 
just used a little heart cut out to
create<00:00:21.029> those<00:00:21.270> hearts<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:21.990> they're<00:00:22.590> all

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
create those hearts so that they're all

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:23.570 
create those hearts so that they're all
the<00:00:23.010> same

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the same

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.759 
the same
and<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.300> first<00:00:24.769> tangle<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.980> called<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.820> Dex<00:00:27.769> it

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
and this first tangle is called a Dex it

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.349 
and this first tangle is called a Dex it
was<00:00:28.980> one<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.400> ones<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.820> did<00:00:30.029> back<00:00:30.179> in

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
was one of the ones that I did back in

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.770 
was one of the ones that I did back in
January<00:00:30.840> like<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.260> said<00:00:31.880> and<00:00:32.880> overall<00:00:33.510> this

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
January like I said and overall this

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.110 
January like I said and overall this
tingled<00:00:34.590> only<00:00:34.890> took<00:00:35.070> about<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.670> little<00:00:35.969> less

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
tingled only took about a little less

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.569 
tingled only took about a little less
than<00:00:36.360> an<00:00:36.510> hour<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:37.050> do<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.590> done<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.100> three

you want to join or not but yeah then I

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.150 
you want to join or not but yeah then I
realized<00:01:00.780> later<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.620> did<00:01:01.890> miss<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
realized later on that I did miss a

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.590 
realized later on that I did miss a
little<00:01:02.930> piece<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.170> one<00:01:04.610> but<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:06.119> here

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
little piece of that one but on here

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.859 
little piece of that one but on here
this<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.830> tangle<00:01:08.670> called<00:01:08.939> AIDS<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
this one is the tangle called AIDS and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.330 
this one is the tangle called AIDS and
then<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.650> one<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:12.650> tangle<00:01:13.650> called

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
then this one is the tangle called

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.929 
then this one is the tangle called
Xin<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:17.960> so<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.200> January<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:20.009> did<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> total<00:01:20.610> of

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
Xin and so in January we did a total of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.950 
Xin and so in January we did a total of
eight<00:01:21.380> tutorials<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.970> this<00:01:23.970> one<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.659> called

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
eight tutorials and this one is called

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.429 
eight tutorials and this one is called
diamonds<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.170> squares<00:01:29.570> this<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> very<00:01:31.140> easy

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
diamonds and squares this is a very easy

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.270 
diamonds and squares this is a very easy
tangle<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.810> good<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.380> fill<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.829> spaces

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
tangle and it's good to fill in spaces

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.190 
tangle and it's good to fill in spaces
like<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.360> don't<00:01:36.570> know<00:01:36.689> what<00:01:36.810> else<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
like this if you don't know what else to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.499 
like this if you don't know what else to
do<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:39.350> then<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.710> flower<00:01:41.130> vine<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.360> this

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
do and then this is flower vine and this

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.350 
do and then this is flower vine and this
is<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> simplified<00:01:43.380> version<00:01:43.520> of<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> didn't

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
is a simplified version of that I didn't

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.560 
is a simplified version of that I didn't
instead<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.170> doing<00:01:46.530> six<00:01:46.920> flowers<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.390> did

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
instead of doing six flowers I just did

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.770 
instead of doing six flowers I just did
three<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.490> felt<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:50.939> space<00:01:51.420> there<00:01:51.750> and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
three and I felt in that space there and

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.380 
three and I felt in that space there and
then<00:01:52.140> colored<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.920> little<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.579> little

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
then colored in the little the little

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.660 
then colored in the little the little
ribbon<00:01:54.869> thing<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.530> goes<00:01:55.710> around<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.219> all<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
ribbon thing that goes around it all and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
ribbon thing that goes around it all and
this<00:01:57.649> tangle<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.950> called<00:01:59.280> decor<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:02.930> this<00:02:03.930> one

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
this tangle is called decor and this one

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.290 
this tangle is called decor and this one
is<00:02:05.360> called<00:02:06.360> four<00:02:06.899> corners<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.890> one<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.369> one

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
is called four corners this one is one

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.859 
is called four corners this one is one
of<00:02:09.420> my<00:02:09.599> favorites<00:02:10.110> now<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:10.590> kind
