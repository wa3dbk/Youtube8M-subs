thoughts<00:02:58.820> about<00:02:59.060> that<00:02:59.120> in<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.630> minute<00:02:59.720> and<00:03:00.500> of

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
thoughts about that in a minute and of

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.170 
thoughts about that in a minute and of
course<00:03:00.680> you've<00:03:00.950> got<00:03:00.980> vengeful<00:03:01.640> retreat<00:03:02.030> where

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
course you've got vengeful retreat where

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.880 
course you've got vengeful retreat where
you<00:03:02.240> vault<00:03:02.540> back<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:02.990> avoid<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.380> next<00:03:03.650> attack

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
you vault back and avoid the next attack

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.070 
you vault back and avoid the next attack
or<00:03:04.070> spell<00:03:04.340> directed<00:03:04.880> at<00:03:04.970> you<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.420> then<00:03:05.990> you

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
or spell directed at you and then you

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.050 
or spell directed at you and then you
got<00:03:06.200> double<00:03:06.560> jump<00:03:06.770> so<00:03:07.580> basically<00:03:07.940> they're

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
got double jump so basically they're

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.400 
got double jump so basically they're
going<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.240> have<00:03:08.360> huge<00:03:08.660> amount<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:08.960> mobility

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
going to have huge amount of mobility

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.050 
going to have huge amount of mobility
and<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.740> course<00:03:09.950> double<00:03:10.250> jump<00:03:10.460> is<00:03:10.610> part<00:03:10.940> of

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
and of course double jump is part of

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.660 
and of course double jump is part of
that<00:03:11.240> mobility<00:03:11.510> bundle<00:03:12.050> they<00:03:12.170> get

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
that mobility bundle they get

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.830 
that mobility bundle they get
unfortunately<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:13.700> probably<00:03:14.270> means<00:03:14.510> while

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
unfortunately that probably means while

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.050 
unfortunately that probably means while
you<00:03:14.960> explain<00:03:15.260> tactics<00:03:15.800> every<00:03:16.340> demon<00:03:16.760> hunter

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
you explain tactics every demon hunter

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.460 
you explain tactics every demon hunter
is<00:03:17.210> going<00:03:17.240> to<00:03:17.420> be<00:03:17.510> bouncing<00:03:17.930> around<00:03:18.050> all<00:03:18.410> over

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
is going to be bouncing around all over
