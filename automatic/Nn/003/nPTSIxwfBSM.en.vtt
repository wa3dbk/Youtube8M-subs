00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello everyone we hear 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.279
 found again for an outfit of the 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.519
 day a day outfit in shades of 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.040
 beige kamel from brens little china is 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.740
 very comfortable and feminine so I 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.859
 start from the top then up I 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.080
 door is a dress that I wear in 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.340
 tunic that comes from new look sites she 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.810
 may be you see a little longer 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.699
 but it's going to be relatively short so 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.529
 I can not wear that in dress 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.330
 so I like to wear it on cases 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.029
 are and pretty tight pants 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.430
 so here is this little dress say 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.920
 from us frozen water with a 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.730
 belt that I bought at ping which 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.440
 she is good because she is 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.350
 elastic so it is well suited to 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.600
 all and at all sizes like 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.230
 small my game will not come back on 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.930
 accessories 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.510
 I will carry a very small bag where 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.180
 can easily slip the notebook not 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.309
 just the bare necessities that I come 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.280
 to have on the site forever 21 which she 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.289
 is always available 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.079
 so then I wear a quarter are 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.629
 ribbed beige will leave very good that comes 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.210
 from the Bershka site which is not expensive 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.680
 all I have from the country 19 euros and I had 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.720
 really and that with big sneakers 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.070
 offset 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.840
 as she I 'm going to you zoom in one of 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.760
 closer to this for loans so the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.470
 pants that host I told you about 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.549
 so here I have just seen her on the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.380

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.130
 available is available in others 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.140
 colors 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.119
 it is very comfortable against 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.130
 know that they cut small so me 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.320
 I was I take the price of the m but he 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.340
 put a little tight so do not hesitate to 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.740
 take a size above 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.150

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.220

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.320

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.680
 it is the big box of France tension 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.450
 it's a bit of the big part of it all 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.829
 kind of compensated sneakers that exist 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.780

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.070
 ajaccio shop at 30 euros pretty much 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.799
 I chose kamel because I find 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.290
 that it's a color that goes with everything 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:02.150
 black glee of beige 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.440
