00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
little bit more boiling through the top

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.729 
little bit more boiling through the top

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
and then after is just really smoothing

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:14.309 
and then after is just really smoothing
it<00:03:06.799> out<00:03:11.319> so<00:03:12.319> we're<00:03:12.439> going<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.620> attach<00:03:12.980> this

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319

section<00:03:15.319> to<00:03:16.060> one<00:03:17.060> side<00:03:17.450> of<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.680> bun<00:03:18.889> and

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:19.189 
section to one side of the bun and

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:20.470 
section to one side of the bun and
you're<00:03:19.430> going<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.579> wrap<00:03:19.879> it<00:03:19.909> all<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.269> way

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
you're going to wrap it all the way

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:32.200 
you're going to wrap it all the way
around<00:03:20.629> as<00:03:20.900> tight<00:03:21.109> as<00:03:21.230> possible

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
just spray each section and that would

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:35.040 
just spray each section and that would
just<00:04:21.020> kind<00:04:21.140> of<00:04:21.230> hold<00:04:21.410> it<00:04:21.530> all<00:04:21.680> in<00:04:21.800> place

so<00:04:35.650> what<00:04:35.800> I'm<00:04:35.860> going<00:04:36.009> to<00:04:36.069> do<00:04:36.220> with<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.520> pony

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
so what I'm going to do with the pony

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.369 
so what I'm going to do with the pony
tail<00:04:37.120> section<00:04:37.599> is<00:04:39.419> split<00:04:40.419> it<00:04:40.539> into<00:04:40.690> two<00:04:41.050> and

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
tail section is split it into two and

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:42.960 
tail section is split it into two and
just<00:04:41.800> carry<00:04:41.979> it<00:04:42.069> through<00:04:42.129> a<00:04:42.310> little<00:04:42.580> bit<00:04:42.759> and

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
with the ends of the hair will again

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.420 
with the ends of the hair will again
we're<00:04:52.659> going<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:52.870> get<00:04:53.020> twisted<00:04:53.590> kind<00:04:54.069> of<00:04:54.190> into

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
we're going to get twisted kind of into

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:11.170 
we're going to get twisted kind of into
another<00:04:54.699> loop<00:04:54.970> against<00:04:55.629> the<00:04:55.840> bunt

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.270 

so<00:05:11.810> if<00:05:11.900> you<00:05:12.020> see<00:05:12.229> any<00:05:12.560> ends<00:05:12.740> that<00:05:12.979> are<00:05:13.009> still

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
so if you see any ends that are still

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.219 
so if you see any ends that are still
kind<00:05:13.520> of<00:05:13.639> poking<00:05:14.030> out<00:05:14.150> make<00:05:14.750> sure<00:05:14.780> you<00:05:15.050> twist

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
kind of poking out make sure you twist

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.680 
kind of poking out make sure you twist
them<00:05:15.560> in<00:05:17.020> and<00:05:18.020> just<00:05:18.350> pin<00:05:19.039> them<00:05:19.330> again<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.570> the

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
them in and just pin them again to the

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.920 
them in and just pin them again to the
bomb<00:05:21.310> okay<00:05:22.310> so<00:05:22.370> we're<00:05:22.669> going<00:05:23.509> through<00:05:23.720> to<00:05:23.840> the

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
bomb okay so we're going through to the

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.469 
bomb okay so we're going through to the
front<00:05:24.050> section<00:05:24.590> now<00:05:25.000> this<00:05:26.000> has<00:05:26.150> already<00:05:26.300> been

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
front section now this has already been

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.300 
front section now this has already been
told<00:05:26.900> so<00:05:27.139> it's<00:05:27.259> got<00:05:27.380> a<00:05:27.410> nice<00:05:27.620> little<00:05:27.889> wave<00:05:28.130> in

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
told so it's got a nice little wave in

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.879 
told so it's got a nice little wave in
it<00:05:28.460> and<00:05:29.060> what<00:05:29.180> we<00:05:29.300> can<00:05:29.449> do<00:05:29.600> is<00:05:29.870> have<00:05:30.680> many

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
it and what we can do is have many

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.200 
it and what we can do is have many
options<00:05:31.100> you<00:05:31.460> know<00:05:31.520> we<00:05:31.669> can<00:05:31.850> comb<00:05:32.030> it<00:05:32.180> through

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
options you know we can comb it through

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.820 
options you know we can comb it through
and<00:05:32.690> just<00:05:32.720> having<00:05:32.990> much<00:05:33.229> more<00:05:33.259> straighter

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
and just having much more straighter

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.790 
and just having much more straighter
sleeker<00:05:34.370> look<00:05:34.550> or<00:05:35.539> we<00:05:35.720> can<00:05:35.900> kind<00:05:36.139> of<00:05:36.199> put<00:05:36.770> a

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
sleeker look or we can kind of put a

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.820 
sleeker look or we can kind of put a
nice<00:05:37.039> kind<00:05:37.280> of<00:05:37.400> wave<00:05:37.610> into<00:05:38.060> it<00:05:38.240> so<00:05:38.930> I<00:05:39.229> think

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
nice kind of wave into it so I think

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.439 
nice kind of wave into it so I think
today<00:05:40.190> we're<00:05:40.669> just<00:05:40.820> going<00:05:40.970> to<00:05:41.000> try<00:05:41.210> and<00:05:41.240> put<00:05:41.419> a

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
today we're just going to try and put a

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:46.650 
today we're just going to try and put a
nice<00:05:41.630> kind<00:05:41.840> of<00:05:42.729> vintage<00:05:43.729> star<00:05:44.660> wave<00:05:44.900> and<00:05:45.229> just

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
nice kind of vintage star wave and just

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.350 
nice kind of vintage star wave and just
put<00:05:47.660> it<00:05:47.690> all<00:05:47.960> the<00:05:48.080> way<00:05:48.110> through<00:05:48.530> and<00:05:49.270> to<00:05:50.270> the

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
put it all the way through and to the

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.999 
put it all the way through and to the
back<00:05:50.479> of<00:05:50.509> the<00:05:50.690> bar<00:05:50.900> so<00:05:51.349> as<00:05:51.500> you<00:05:51.590> can<00:05:51.710> see<00:05:51.889> the

back of the bar so as you can see the

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:53.620 
back of the bar so as you can see the
hair<00:05:52.190> is<00:05:52.280> just<00:05:52.310> kind<00:05:52.940> of<00:05:53.000> fooling<00:05:53.270> it's<00:05:53.419> a<00:05:53.479> nice

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 
really nice color elegant pins and we're

00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:59.090 
really nice color elegant pins and we're
just<00:06:57.690> going<00:06:57.810> to<00:06:58.020> literally<00:06:58.440> just<00:06:58.710> put<00:06:58.949> them

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 
just going to literally just put them

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.550 
just going to literally just put them
through<00:06:59.600> just<00:07:00.600> to<00:07:00.660> finish<00:07:00.900> off<00:07:01.169> that<00:07:01.199> back

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
through just to finish off that back

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.860 
through just to finish off that back
area<00:07:01.800> and<00:07:02.550> this<00:07:02.699> will<00:07:02.880> really<00:07:03.210> kind<00:07:03.630> of<00:07:03.690> make

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
area and this will really kind of make

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.610
