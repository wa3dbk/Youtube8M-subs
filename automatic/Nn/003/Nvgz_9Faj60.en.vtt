00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
courts to learn the chord progressions

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.549 
courts to learn the chord progressions
and<00:00:35.470> then<00:00:35.860> three<00:00:36.420> learn<00:00:37.420> to<00:00:38.379> play<00:00:38.530> the

of you know step three is you put the

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.080 
of you know step three is you put the
chord<00:01:08.740> progressions<00:01:09.159> together<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:09.880> if<00:01:10.000> the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
chord progressions together so if the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.170 
chord progressions together so if the
word<00:01:10.240> each<00:01:10.450> one<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.920> other<00:01:12.009> time<00:01:12.280> so<00:01:12.640> we're

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
word each one one other time so we're

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.520 
word each one one other time so we're
going<00:01:13.299> to<00:01:13.420> do<00:01:13.509> that<00:01:13.630> right<00:01:13.689> now<00:01:13.840> so<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.259> first

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
okay so you get the basic idea that so

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.720 
okay so you get the basic idea that so
that's<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.680> first<00:02:22.860> progression<00:02:23.460> now<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
that's the first progression now the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.830 
that's the first progression now the
setup<00:02:24.150> second<00:02:24.720> progression<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.680> going<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.010> be

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
setup second progression is going to be

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:36.080 
setup second progression is going to be
e<00:02:27.840> minor<00:02:29.330> d<00:02:30.950> c<00:02:32.390> g<00:02:33.500> ok<00:02:34.670> that's<00:02:35.670> going<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:35.940> repeat

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
e minor d c g ok that's going to repeat

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.610 
e minor d c g ok that's going to repeat
a<00:02:36.150> couple<00:02:36.480> times<00:02:36.660> we're<00:02:37.260> going<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.440> use<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
a couple times we're going to use the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.400 
a couple times we're going to use the
same<00:02:37.860> strum<00:02:38.280> pattern<00:02:38.640> then<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:40.080> third

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
same strum pattern then the third

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.830 
same strum pattern then the third
progression<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.160> going<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.400> go<00:02:41.490> E<00:02:41.670> minor<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:43.350> G

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
progression is going to go E minor to G

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:54.170 
progression is going to go E minor to G
B<00:02:45.840> minor<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.350> G<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:48.180> then<00:02:48.420> e<00:02:48.660> minor<00:02:48.900> D<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:51.120> G<00:02:53.180> ok

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
B minor to G and then e minor D to G ok

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.850 
B minor to G and then e minor D to G ok
so<00:02:54.240> let's<00:02:54.690> just<00:02:54.930> review<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.530> then<00:02:55.620> I'll<00:02:55.710> play

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
so let's just review and then I'll play

all<00:03:35.450> right<00:03:35.570> so<00:03:35.780> progression<00:03:36.350> one

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:04:00.470 

the<00:03:47.920> rest<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.310> you

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:14.820 

the<00:04:00.690> progression<00:04:01.319> three

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.520 

so<00:04:15.830> this<00:04:16.250> is<00:04:16.370> a<00:04:16.400> great<00:04:16.609> example<00:04:16.790> of<00:04:17.359> how<00:04:17.530> you

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
so this is a great example of how you

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.020 
so this is a great example of how you
learn<00:04:18.739> a<00:04:18.769> few<00:04:19.130> different<00:04:19.280> progressions<00:04:19.940> and

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
learn a few different progressions and

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.910 
learn a few different progressions and
you<00:04:20.150> put<00:04:20.329> them<00:04:20.480> all<00:04:20.570> together<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:21.320> then<00:04:21.829> you

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
you put them all together and then you

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.530 
you put them all together and then you
can<00:04:22.040> add<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.310> vocals<00:04:22.790> like<00:04:23.090> I<00:04:23.240> showed<00:04:23.480> you

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.000 
earlier and you're playing a complete
song<00:04:25.820> so<00:04:26.480> that's<00:04:26.720> a<00:04:26.870> great<00:04:27.110> example<00:04:27.260> of<00:04:27.710> what<00:04:27.980> I

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
song so that's a great example of what I

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.610 
song so that's a great example of what I
call<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.430> one<00:04:28.640> two<00:04:28.820> three<00:04:29.120> guitar<00:04:30.050> method<00:04:30.260> and
