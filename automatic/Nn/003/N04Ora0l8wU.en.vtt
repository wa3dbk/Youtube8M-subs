 brightens better 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:33.390

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:58.170
 Let's make the ball very soft. 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.059

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:14.909
 the movement of the bow pulled two 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.299

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.520
 It's difficult here that I'm alone. 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.430

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:54.390

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.390

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.440
