you're<00:00:35.850> going<00:00:35.879> to<00:00:36.030> see<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.420> signatures<00:00:37.050> so

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
you're going to see here signatures so

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.319 
you're going to see here signatures so
you<00:00:37.440> can<00:00:37.679> tap<00:00:37.859> into<00:00:38.070> managing<00:00:38.550> signatures<00:00:39.089> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
you can tap into managing signatures and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.310 
you can tap into managing signatures and
you're<00:00:39.449> going<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> see<00:00:39.839> that<00:00:40.019> you<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.289> some

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.619 
you're going to see that you have some
signature<00:00:41.010> behaviors<00:00:41.550> here<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.449> can

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
signature behaviors here you can

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.739 
signature behaviors here you can
actually<00:00:43.429> set<00:00:44.429> signatures<00:00:44.999> for<00:00:45.300> composing

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:45.749 
actually set signatures for composing

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.729 
actually set signatures for composing
replying<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.710> forwarding<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:48.289> currently<00:00:49.289> only

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
replying and forwarding I currently only

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.880 
replying and forwarding I currently only
have<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.039> signature<00:00:50.519> set<00:00:50.940> up<00:00:51.179> for<00:00:51.890> one

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
have a signature set up for one

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.619 
have a signature set up for one
signature<00:00:53.309> per<00:00:53.670> email<00:00:53.850> account<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.420> don't

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
signature per email account I don't

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.239 
signature per email account I don't
really<00:00:54.809> need<00:00:55.050> different<00:00:55.319> signatures<00:00:55.979> for

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:56.249 
really need different signatures for

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:58.099 
really need different signatures for
when<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.429> reply<00:00:56.850> or<00:00:56.909> forward<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.569> use<00:00:57.749> the<00:00:57.899> same

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
when I reply or forward I use the same

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.069 
when I reply or forward I use the same
standard<00:00:58.589> signature<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.999> what<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.569> do<00:01:00.749> is<00:01:00.960> I

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
standard signature so what I can do is I

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.739 
standard signature so what I can do is I
can<00:01:01.109> pop<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.010> compose<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.389> just<00:01:03.569> have

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
can pop in to compose and I just have

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.050 
can pop in to compose and I just have
them<00:01:03.960> ticked<00:01:04.229> off<00:01:04.409> as<00:01:04.769> composed<00:01:05.550> signature

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
them ticked off as composed signature

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.870 
them ticked off as composed signature
for<00:01:06.240> all<00:01:06.360> now<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.290> can<00:01:07.590> tap<00:01:07.830> into<00:01:08.100> my<00:01:08.280> actual

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
for all now I can tap into my actual

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.530 
for all now I can tap into my actual
signatures<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.250> see<00:01:11.250> what<00:01:11.729> signatures<00:01:12.329> I

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
signatures and see what signatures I

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.889 
signatures and see what signatures I
have<00:01:12.750> set<00:01:13.049> for<00:01:13.500> each<00:01:13.979> one<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.820> these<00:01:15.000> so

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
have set for each one of these so

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.130 
have set for each one of these so
obviously<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:17.610> my<00:01:17.700> Ally<00:01:17.880> at<00:01:18.119> pixel<00:01:18.479> fixed<00:01:18.780> com
