like<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.920> lost<00:01:26.159> earlier<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.420> lose<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
like I lost earlier then you lose the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.429 
like I lost earlier then you lose the
cup<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.130> goes<00:01:29.250> past<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.030> ball<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:31.079> base<00:01:31.290> of

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
cup if it goes past the ball the base of

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.429 
cup if it goes past the ball the base of
the<00:01:31.500> ball<00:01:31.680> drop<00:01:31.950> off<00:01:32.159> without<00:01:33.140> getting<00:01:34.140> bugs

the ball drop off without getting bugs

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.350 
the ball drop off without getting bugs
in<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.799> then<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.970> lose<00:01:39.290> that<00:01:40.290> carp<00:01:40.619> anyway

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
in it then you lose that carp anyway

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.609 
in it then you lose that carp anyway
obviously<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.420> idea<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.810> game<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.170> when

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
obviously the idea of the game is when

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.219 
obviously the idea of the game is when
you've<00:01:43.770> run<00:01:43.950> out<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.100> balls<00:01:44.369> or<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.659> can't<00:01:46.110> get

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
you've run out of balls or you can't get

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.249 
you've run out of balls or you can't get
a<00:01:46.290> morning<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.649> cups<00:01:47.060> then<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.020> they

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
a morning the cups then that is it they

one<00:02:43.530> now<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.560> idea<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.099> you<00:02:47.220> want<00:02:47.250> all<00:02:47.549> the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
one now so the idea is you want all the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.580 
one now so the idea is you want all the
boards<00:02:47.970> purple<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:50.250> flip<00:02:50.459> all<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.640> points

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
boards purple to flip all the points

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.640 
boards purple to flip all the points
obviously<00:02:52.590> but<00:02:53.040> keep<00:02:53.220> dropping<00:02:53.580> them<00:02:53.670> out

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
obviously but keep dropping them out

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.210 
obviously but keep dropping them out
unless<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:57.180> see<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:58.170> best<00:02:58.380> on<00:02:58.560> just<00:02:58.890> paying
