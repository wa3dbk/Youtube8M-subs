00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.420 
pickaxe enabled another one of the
commands<00:04:54.310> is<00:04:54.460> /<00:04:55.330> g<00:04:55.720> m-e<00:04:56.200> and<00:04:56.560> then<00:04:57.130> whatever<00:04:57.250> he

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
commands is / g m-e and then whatever he

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.480 
commands is / g m-e and then whatever he
wants<00:04:57.760> for<00:04:58.060> example<00:04:58.450> if<00:04:58.570> I<00:04:58.690> want<00:04:59.130> if<00:05:00.130> I<00:05:00.280> want

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
wants for example if I want if I want

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.700 
wants for example if I want if I want
dirt<00:05:00.729> I<00:05:00.910> type<00:05:01.120> dirt<00:05:01.450> and<00:05:01.750> it'll<00:05:02.169> give<00:05:02.289> me<00:05:02.440> dirt

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
dirt I type dirt and it'll give me dirt

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.560 
dirt I type dirt and it'll give me dirt
and<00:05:03.039> it<00:05:03.220> also<00:05:03.340> works<00:05:03.610> for<00:05:03.729> the<00:05:03.850> numeral<00:05:04.270> value

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
and it also works for the numeral value

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.110 
and it also works for the numeral value
so<00:05:04.870> we<00:05:05.800> can<00:05:05.919> build<00:05:06.070> dirty<00:05:06.460> so<00:05:06.550> you<00:05:06.580> can<00:05:06.940> place

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
so we can build dirty so you can place

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.730 
so we can build dirty so you can place
it<00:05:07.300> so<00:05:07.539> that's<00:05:07.990> how<00:05:08.080> you<00:05:08.169> can<00:05:08.260> build<00:05:08.470> stuff

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
it so that's how you can build stuff

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.300 
it so that's how you can build stuff
those<00:05:09.610> are<00:05:09.789> some<00:05:10.000> of<00:05:10.390> the<00:05:10.450> tools<00:05:11.220> so<00:05:12.220> we're

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
those are some of the tools so we're

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.580 
those are some of the tools so we're
gonna<00:05:12.430> come<00:05:12.639> down<00:05:12.789> here<00:05:13.320> check<00:05:14.320> out<00:05:14.410> what's
