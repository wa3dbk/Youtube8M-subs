00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.840
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:14.990
 I came to a person from the s 6 edge . Self-introduction etc. also disclosed 8 Samsung 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:17.449
 My name is Saki Sakura and I am in charge of product planning for six types of electronic Japan . 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.560
 Yes I Am Thank you from here 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:25.010
 At the timing of raising the first video of the first shot 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:29.210
 Yeah from the readers on twitter 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:34.790
 We asked for questions because there was a chance to ask questions to people inside 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:45.000
 Early a precious opportunity'm here Canali frank no opinion who tipper 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:48.120
 Where it is possible to endure it hard to come by all means is red 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.680
 A guy from design related 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:58.110
 Is there anything other than the meaning design of the edge in the part of the meaning of the edge? 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:02.910
 I had a similar question but a simple design. 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:08.110
 Where Tteyuu I'm not the only design is actually its narrow the display 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:12.220
 Determine the bending angle as hard as possible considering the meaning in making it into a frame 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.610
 But what a lot of things by throwing 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:21.190
 Also has many thinking this time from it 's such or going to be from now on 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:24.850
 This s 6 edge of this time in is so that the shortcut It is there of that person is put 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.130
 Good name is put at Itema smartphone to a high Chu 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.960
 To say that people who a long e-mail you can call immediately from here 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:37.810
 A large hand while keeping this edge firmly on the edge 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:42.399
 To properly suppress the width by adding and subtracting to leave this, such as adapt to the hand 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:48.490
 Simply simply high thinking just design in the sense of seeking the late human body design 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:53.500
 The person in this is the most happiness as we are not gonna be just bend in the product out 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.400
 Where I say I am making once on that thought the place Tteyuu convenient to have used 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.570
 If you ask this question by all means 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:05.100
 You seem to have you touch product which will release product in the future 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:10.080
 You will probably understand the moment you have it, I think you can see it . 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:13.860
 Bent to the feeling had to say in you are taken it's not only design struck this feeling 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.390
 Say Oh I see network when touched without'm Rutte implications 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.440
 The mean what without this consent are feeling that would 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:25.030
 That's right You can get it if you understand 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:30.340
 I think that can only still easily I bend that simply 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.780
 From not you be told by everyone's really here is that way even as we 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.410
 More and more re-Vaiue 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.680
 I see at the time that has so bent in the rather was properly considered 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.700
 The Etteyuu have you know I think Fu that kana not you enjoy looking at 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:47.300
 Then the next question as well as design related 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.940
 Iphone like's home button on here shouldn't be changed 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.820
 Question like 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:59.320
 That's right I'm They are First different feeling is very very different wards I'd 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:02.680
 Something like my brother 's fingerprint sensor turned into a touch together 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:07.240
 Well, this time the fingerprint sensor is a touch, but this is ok 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.960
 It may be so if it is said that it was invited if it was said that it was imitation 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.770
 But I use it 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:18.620
 While I was doing that you do not have why this until we doing now when you thought the sound 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:21.860
 How does the smartphone touch more than throw it? 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:26.720
 I always do this because I do not know how to suppress the fingerprint sensor 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.950
 Properly with the technology it is more But throw in there also Tteyuu You're convenient to touch 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.980
 In consultation with the patient 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.660
 Why is this technology packed? 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:40.069
 Well, how about something like being said like on a journey 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:44.569
 I can not say anything but that 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:49.969
 When feeling your things yelling make things best to give 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:53.689
 Can not unless their You I am allowed to study and properly gluteal honest good thing about 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:54.950
 I think that this is a lot like this because it is packed like this 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:04:00.090
 In just this way 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:05.160
 Whether or not there is a button and comes with a display, square in design 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.360
 If there is only one difference between smartphones and one, there may be some parts 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:12.000
 I may not come 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:15.959
 I'm looking at the mobile obscurity moving and saying the data feats basically all good things imitating 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.650
 Iphone that it is this sense Tteyuu are saying and be many things I cum 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.079
 As I said, iphone has learned a lot of things, but the companies are good 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.129
 Implicit 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:28.360
 Ne I think that there may be various variations again, but ios 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:32.740
 Because water Well If you're in a good android is somewhat strong kana I android 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:36.969
 As there is a part or something like you are becoming like, there is a drawback e 3 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:40.070
 Because of the in thing do you may have competition and to those better 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:45.170
 It would be nice to have something better than we 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:48.800
 You can see it in the future, and we will try our best to pull it out again 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:53.150
 Such competition is thought to Fu that I wonder if firm toilet Bailly to say 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:59.180
 Yes there was after 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:00.320
 There is an opinion that why I push the task button and the back button backwards by all means 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.420
 But 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:08.120
 8 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:12.700
 The reverse is this put key button and task button through reverse 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.700
 As it happens, galaxy users can not do it 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:22.409
 Nasty hot and you are using is useless good stick ne I I know it anymore, but maybe other 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:28.139
 As there are many things that sell in Japan quite quickly if there is no maker 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:30.929
 In say this is a well wonder if not reversed and from us that are doing business in Japan 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:35.200
 I'm talking about it 

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:38.500
 This is the first thing I said 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:43.540
 It becomes like this when averaging the usability 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:46.870
 In this in it's a lot of people to operate the right hand also seen in the world 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:51.250
 Sometimes in thought I was saying to operate in the right hand 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:54.910
 If there is a back button here rather than pressing this history button 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.220
 The approach of the finger is easy and the number of button presses is better with the back button 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:01.130
 Hmm 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:07.040
 Well, but many of the previous are many and so convenient person to return not you is more convenient here went 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:10.820
 It is not a view on the stage that is thinking about the usability of our children 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:15.210
 Apart from the 1 mon and o is whether another course it or correct it is 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:19.620
 Depression mode thinking as we are said by all means 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.979
 There are girls of Tteyuu button I'm no country complement Nodeo wish here is the full reason 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.350
 I will 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:28.470
 As it is true that it is the sound standard of android 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:33.270
 I think that really there is it, but as we 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.930
 3 I think, such as the customer's ease of use is more of the split and here not it convenient honestly 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:41.210
 Become 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:47.270
 Okay, I understand, then, related to related products of products 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:51.440
 While we are stuck in memory and storage, usb stays at 2.0 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:57.770
 I 'm wondering if I'm back but I'm asked why 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:07:01.200
 8 First of all, when trying to put out this thinness this time , usb 3.0 is quite that that 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:06.060
 Music planning of the mouth is good, isn't it? 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:11.010
 I 'm honestly looking at the thickness of the minute so I just got into the hole and bought 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:15.990
 Though in it was also laden our previous Uezu b 30 things 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:19.770
 After all the hole is too big and it is so big in the field mobile device in the field 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:21.190
 Little wonder if was not very best regards from being opened is 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.540
 Because it is partially complete 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:26.580
 Hmm 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:32.220
 Well if this is a situation where 2.0 is coming next 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:38.160
 2.0 I think Well, the Fu that I wonder if not the best I Well this just is 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:41.529
 If there are any changes in the future , magic and comparison movements are also coming out, so new 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:46.969
 At that time, I think that the project will be on top 

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:50.959
 I think that there is no blur in the place of making it the most easy to use for customers 

00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:56.360
 Posture semi 3.0 say how much is 0 

00:07:50.959 --> 00:08:03.920
 Everyone used it, but I was satisfied with almost 2.0, but that's right 

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:05.310
 I was also able to see the cable for 3.0 once 

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.740
 also 

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.740
 It is an honest place that it is selling while being sold
