00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
stages got all the Chaos Emeralds and I

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.309 
stages got all the Chaos Emeralds and I
usually<00:03:55.359> did<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.510> fourth<00:03:55.720> one<00:03:55.900> too<00:03:56.169> up

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
usually did the fourth one too up

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.140

you<00:04:46.460> don't<00:04:46.610> get<00:04:46.700> inside<00:04:47.030> like<00:04:47.210> them<00:04:47.330> that<00:04:47.450> goes

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
you don't get inside like them that goes

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.840 
you don't get inside like them that goes
alone<00:04:47.900> it's<00:04:48.770> pretty<00:04:49.419> it's<00:04:50.419> pretty<00:04:50.480> intense<00:04:51.850> so

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
alone it's pretty it's pretty intense so

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.310 
alone it's pretty it's pretty intense so
I<00:04:53.150> don't<00:04:53.630> know<00:04:53.720> where<00:04:53.810> to<00:04:53.900> go<00:04:53.990> over<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.200> last

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
I don't know where to go over the last

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.590 
I don't know where to go over the last
13<00:04:54.770> so<00:04:55.040> figure<00:04:55.669> that<00:04:55.850> if<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.060> just<00:04:56.120> run<00:04:56.390> in<00:04:56.510> a

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
13 so figure that if I just run in a

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.820 
13 so figure that if I just run in a
straight<00:04:56.810> line<00:04:56.840> for<00:04:57.140> long<00:04:57.290> enough<00:04:57.560> I<00:04:57.650> guess

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
straight line for long enough I guess

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.030 
straight line for long enough I guess
I'll<00:04:57.979> get<00:04:58.100> there

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
I'll get there

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.170 
I'll get there

now<00:05:03.780> obviously<00:05:04.380> this<00:05:04.560> isn't<00:05:04.740> going<00:05:04.950> to<00:05:05.010> work

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
now obviously this isn't going to work

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.070 
now obviously this isn't going to work
and<00:05:05.340> that<00:05:05.430> was<00:05:05.970> really<00:05:06.120> dumb<00:05:06.330> because<00:05:06.750> it<00:05:06.930> just

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
and that was really dumb because it just

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.500 
and that was really dumb because it just
made<00:05:07.200> me<00:05:07.320> have<00:05:07.470> to<00:05:07.620> run<00:05:07.980> even<00:05:08.190> faster<00:05:08.280> now<00:05:08.820> I<00:05:09.060> I

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
made me have to run even faster now I I

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.660 
made me have to run even faster now I I
think<00:05:10.020> this<00:05:10.200> is<00:05:10.350> max<00:05:10.620> or<00:05:10.860> nearing<00:05:11.190> max<00:05:11.400> speed

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
think this is max or nearing max speed

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.310 
think this is max or nearing max speed
that<00:05:11.850> you<00:05:11.940> run<00:05:12.120> in<00:05:12.300> special<00:05:12.600> stages<00:05:12.780> I<00:05:12.990> don't<00:05:13.140> I

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
that you run in special stages I don't I

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.050 
that you run in special stages I don't I
don't<00:05:13.770> know<00:05:13.920> for<00:05:14.100> sure<00:05:14.130> I<00:05:14.520> don't<00:05:14.910> know<00:05:14.970> how

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
don't know for sure I don't know how

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.270 
don't know for sure I don't know how
long<00:05:15.210> it<00:05:15.360> takes<00:05:15.510> to<00:05:15.570> get<00:05:15.750> a<00:05:15.870> maximum<00:05:16.320> speed<00:05:16.950> but

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
long it takes to get a maximum speed but

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.630 
long it takes to get a maximum speed but
find<00:05:17.910> these<00:05:18.150> last<00:05:19.080> nine<00:05:19.680> year<00:05:19.980> no<00:05:20.130> perfect

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
find these last nine year no perfect

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.550 
find these last nine year no perfect
nice<00:05:21.080> good<00:05:22.080> so<00:05:23.720> absolutely<00:05:24.720> no<00:05:24.780> idea<00:05:25.140> where<00:05:25.440> to

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
nice good so absolutely no idea where to

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.650
