hey<00:00:04.799> guys<00:00:04.980> this<00:00:05.250> is<00:00:05.310> Mathias<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:05.970> I've<00:00:06.569> been

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
hey guys this is Mathias and I've been

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.089 
hey guys this is Mathias and I've been
playing<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.020> little<00:00:07.109> bit<00:00:07.259> on<00:00:07.440> off<00:00:07.649> with<00:00:07.919> the

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
playing a little bit on off with the

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.640 
playing a little bit on off with the
hornet<00:00:08.519> missiles<00:00:08.970> again<00:00:09.410> for<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.469> last

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
hornet missiles again for the last

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.830 
hornet missiles again for the last
couple<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.040> weeks<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.790> they're<00:00:12.389> actually

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
couple of weeks and they're actually

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.300 
couple of weeks and they're actually
quite<00:00:13.080> useful<00:00:13.849> since<00:00:14.849> they<00:00:15.030> were<00:00:15.089> buffed<00:00:15.540> and

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:16.310 
quite useful since they were buffed and

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.910 
quite useful since they were buffed and
yeah<00:00:17.310> there's<00:00:17.580> an<00:00:17.940> anti-vehicle<00:00:18.539> weapon<00:00:19.050> they

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
yeah there's an anti-vehicle weapon they

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.090 
yeah there's an anti-vehicle weapon they
are<00:00:20.210> laser-guided<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.810> what<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.680> means<00:00:22.920> is

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
are laser-guided so what that means is

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.980 
are laser-guided so what that means is
that<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.850> maintain<00:00:24.029> your<00:00:24.269> aim<00:00:24.689> on

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
that you have to maintain your aim on

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.800 
that you have to maintain your aim on
the<00:00:25.380> target<00:00:25.769> until<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.970> Rockets<00:00:27.480> actually

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
the target until the Rockets actually

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.019 
the target until the Rockets actually
hit<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.320> yeah<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.220> quite<00:00:29.429> similar<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
hit and yeah it's quite similar to the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.849 
hit and yeah it's quite similar to the
Aviators<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> engineer<00:00:31.199> class<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.710> some

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
Aviators of the engineer class and some

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.860 
Aviators of the engineer class and some
other<00:00:31.980> rockets<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:33.210> now<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.390> youthfulness

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
other rockets so now the youthfulness

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.930 
other rockets so now the youthfulness
against<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> infantry<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.980> basically<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
against the infantry is basically the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.900 
against the infantry is basically the
same<00:00:36.120> as<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.719> any<00:00:36.750> other<00:00:37.079> AV<00:00:37.710> weapon<00:00:38.219> as<00:00:38.700> long

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
same as with any other AV weapon as long

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.030 
same as with any other AV weapon as long
as<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.239> hit<00:00:39.329> your<00:00:39.480> targets<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.200> will<00:00:40.770> do

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
as you can hit your targets you will do

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.549 
as you can hit your targets you will do
well<00:00:41.340> with<00:00:41.550> them<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:43.050> cannot<00:00:43.260> really

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
well with them but you cannot really

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.500 
well with them but you cannot really
rely<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.280> splash<00:00:44.550> damage<00:00:44.760> unless<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.300> can

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
rely on the splash damage unless you can

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.380 
rely on the splash damage unless you can
shoot<00:00:46.110> several<00:00:46.739> rockets<00:00:47.550> at<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> same<00:00:48.030> target

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
shoot several rockets at the same target

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.020 
shoot several rockets at the same target
which<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> very<00:00:49.860> risky<00:00:50.190> because<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.760> takes<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
which is a very risky because it takes a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.209 
which is a very risky because it takes a
long<00:00:51.149> time<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.649> normally<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.190> are

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
long time and normally if you are

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.860 
long time and normally if you are
struggling<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.789> little<00:00:53.850> bit<00:00:54.030> with<00:00:54.120> your<00:00:54.539> aim

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
struggling a little bit with your aim

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.279 
struggling a little bit with your aim
you<00:00:55.199> also<00:00:56.090> probably<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.780> force<00:00:58.170> yourself

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
you also probably have to force yourself

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.099 
you also probably have to force yourself
to<00:00:58.500> hover<00:00:58.859> while<00:00:59.609> shooting<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.870> makes

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
to hover while shooting and that makes

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.560 
to hover while shooting and that makes
you<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.469> very<00:01:01.829> easy<00:01:01.980> target<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.120> feel<00:01:03.300> like

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
you a very easy target if you feel like

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.109 
you a very easy target if you feel like
you're<00:01:03.780> willing<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> take<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.920> few<00:01:05.129> risks<00:01:05.189> might

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
you're willing to take a few risks might

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.320 
you're willing to take a few risks might
use<00:01:06.299> them<00:01:06.510> as<00:01:06.630> well<00:01:06.810> against<00:01:07.409> anti<00:01:07.680> air<00:01:07.799> maxes

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
use them as well against anti air maxes

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.210 
use them as well against anti air maxes
otherwise<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.960> would<00:01:10.320> say<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.710> easiest<00:01:10.740> way<00:01:11.189> to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
otherwise I would say the easiest way to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.690 
otherwise I would say the easiest way to
kill<00:01:11.490> maxes<00:01:12.030> within<00:01:12.780> ESF<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:14.070> by

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
kill maxes within ESF is like this by

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.780 
kill maxes within ESF is like this by
Road<00:01:15.060> killing<00:01:15.479> now<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.250> course<00:01:17.460> there

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
Road killing now it is of course there

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.100 
Road killing now it is of course there
are<00:01:17.820> worse<00:01:18.119> many<00:01:18.330> situations<00:01:18.840> where<00:01:19.020> you

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
are worse many situations where you

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.679 
are worse many situations where you
can't<00:01:19.439> do<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:20.130> when<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.509> is

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
can't do that but when you can it is

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.800 
can't do that but when you can it is
quite<00:01:22.049> satisfying<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.490> let's<00:01:23.729> take<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> look<00:01:24.659> at

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
quite satisfying so let's take a look at

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.890 
quite satisfying so let's take a look at
what<00:01:25.140> these<00:01:25.290> babies<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:26.100> at<00:01:27.060> its<00:01:27.330> intended

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
what these babies can do at its intended

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.710 
what these babies can do at its intended
purpose<00:01:28.470> here<00:01:29.189> are<00:01:29.369> some<00:01:29.700> unexpected<00:01:29.970> mag

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
purpose here are some unexpected mag

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.319 
purpose here are some unexpected mag
riders<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.579> they<00:01:32.579> are<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.759> don't<00:01:33.090> know<00:01:33.150> for

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
riders and they are I don't know for

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.609 
riders and they are I don't know for
whatever<00:01:33.509> reason<00:01:33.960> they<00:01:34.140> are<00:01:34.259> making

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
whatever reason they are making

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.740 
whatever reason they are making
themselves<00:01:34.829> very<00:01:35.460> easy<00:01:35.790> targets<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.360> me<00:01:36.540> here

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
themselves very easy targets for me here

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.350 
themselves very easy targets for me here
very<00:01:37.439> unusual<00:01:38.070> but<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.400> serves<00:01:38.820> as<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> very

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
very unusual but it serves as a very

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.990 
very unusual but it serves as a very
good<00:01:39.600> example<00:01:39.720> for<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:41.040> usefulness<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.759> these

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
good example for the usefulness of these

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.230 
good example for the usefulness of these
weapons<00:01:42.210> against<00:01:43.200> tanks<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.040> don't<00:01:44.970> let<00:01:45.149> that

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
weapons against tanks and don't let that

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.090 
weapons against tanks and don't let that
needler<00:01:45.630> kill<00:01:45.840> fool<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.200> almost<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:46.979> the

needler kill fool you almost all the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.590 
needler kill fool you almost all the
damage<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.579> was<00:01:47.729> done<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> hornet

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
damage that was done with the hornet

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.679 
damage that was done with the hornet
missiles<00:01:48.990> by<00:01:49.860> killing<00:01:50.189> tanks<00:01:50.670> from<00:01:51.149> any<00:01:51.390> SF

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
missiles by killing tanks from any SF

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.210 
missiles by killing tanks from any SF
with<00:01:51.990> nothing<00:01:52.530> shooting<00:01:52.799> your<00:01:52.920> back<00:01:53.070> is

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
with nothing shooting your back is

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.249 
with nothing shooting your back is
something<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.549> almost<00:01:53.729> never<00:01:54.329> happens<00:01:54.810> if

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
something that almost never happens if

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.499 
something that almost never happens if
you<00:01:55.409> take<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:56.009> small<00:01:56.369> amount<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.240> fire

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
you take just a small amount of a fire

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.200 
you take just a small amount of a fire
while<00:01:58.229> you're<00:01:58.979> doing<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.850> might<00:02:00.030> wanna

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
while you're doing this you might wanna

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.420 
while you're doing this you might wanna
just<00:02:00.479> try<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.229> old<00:02:01.500> school<00:02:01.950> kind<00:02:02.340> of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
just try the old school kind of

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.280 
just try the old school kind of
air-to-ground<00:02:02.850> technique<00:02:03.450> that's<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:04.229> I

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
air-to-ground technique that's what I

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.740 
air-to-ground technique that's what I
used<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.530> call<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.920> because<00:02:05.040> yeah<00:02:05.549> it's<00:02:06.060> what

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
used to call it because yeah it's what

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.330 
used to call it because yeah it's what
most<00:02:07.020> people<00:02:07.380> used<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.590> do<00:02:07.770> back<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.190> days

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
most people used to do back in the days

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.059 
most people used to do back in the days
before<00:02:08.970> anti-air<00:02:09.660> Wars<00:02:09.929> as<00:02:10.259> as<00:02:10.440> strong<00:02:10.770> as<00:02:10.920> it

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
before anti-air Wars as as strong as it

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.010 
before anti-air Wars as as strong as it
is<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.489> basically<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.330> get<00:02:12.480> into<00:02:12.660> hover<00:02:12.810> mode

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
is and basically you get into hover mode

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.580 
is and basically you get into hover mode
such<00:02:13.290> as

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
such as

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.589 
such as
this<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.910> have<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.390> burn

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
this and you can have have to burn

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.320 
this and you can have have to burn
around<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.680> target<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.700> makes<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.180> little

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
around the target it makes it a little

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.390 
around the target it makes it a little
bit<00:02:18.540> harder<00:02:18.900> for<00:02:18.950> inexperienced<00:02:19.950> players<00:02:20.190> to

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
bit harder for inexperienced players to

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.400 
bit harder for inexperienced players to
hit<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.780> really<00:02:22.050> doesn't<00:02:22.379> work

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
hit you but it really doesn't work

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.770 
hit you but it really doesn't work
against<00:02:22.890> flack<00:02:23.129> what<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> fuck<00:02:24.300> these<00:02:24.510> things

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
against flack what the fuck these things

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.110 
against flack what the fuck these things
actually<00:02:24.930> killed<00:02:25.440> something<00:02:25.940> yeah<00:02:26.940> when<00:02:27.090> I

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
actually killed something yeah when I

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.479 
actually killed something yeah when I
recorded<00:02:27.599> these<00:02:27.750> first<00:02:28.379> tipsy<00:02:28.739> I<00:02:28.769> had<00:02:29.040> barely

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
recorded these first tipsy I had barely

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.240 
recorded these first tipsy I had barely
even<00:02:29.640> used<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.299> Hornets<00:02:30.629> at<00:02:30.840> all<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.319> I<00:02:32.099> was

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
even used the Hornets at all and I was

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.119 
even used the Hornets at all and I was
very<00:02:32.489> surprised<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.150> there<00:02:33.330> was<00:02:33.510> an<00:02:33.720> an

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
very surprised that there was an an

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.979 
very surprised that there was an an
actual<00:02:35.129> air-to-ground<00:02:35.670> weapon<00:02:36.330> for<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.690> usf

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
actual air-to-ground weapon for the usf

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.270 
actual air-to-ground weapon for the usf
that<00:02:37.200> was<00:02:37.379> useful

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
that was useful

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.699 
that was useful
of<00:02:38.580> course<00:02:38.940> any<00:02:39.180> sky<00:02:39.480> guard<00:02:39.750> or<00:02:39.989> burster<00:02:40.530> max

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
of course any sky guard or burster max

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.100 
of course any sky guard or burster max
will<00:02:40.950> kill<00:02:41.310> yourself<00:02:41.519> much<00:02:41.940> faster<00:02:42.360> than<00:02:42.510> the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
will kill yourself much faster than the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.380 
will kill yourself much faster than the
Hornets<00:02:43.440> missiles<00:02:43.830> will<00:02:44.040> kill<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> tank<00:02:44.640> but<00:02:45.299> if

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
Hornets missiles will kill a tank but if

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.089 
Hornets missiles will kill a tank but if
you<00:02:45.450> can<00:02:45.569> surprise<00:02:45.840> your<00:02:46.079> opponent<00:02:46.140> or<00:02:46.950> if<00:02:47.010> he

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
you can surprise your opponent or if he

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.460 
you can surprise your opponent or if he
coming<00:02:47.370> can<00:02:47.670> come<00:02:47.819> in<00:02:47.910> from<00:02:48.120> an<00:02:48.269> angle<00:02:49.170> where

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
coming can come in from an angle where

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.979 
coming can come in from an angle where
your<00:02:49.799> opponent's<00:02:50.190> don't<00:02:50.310> suspect<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.150> then

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
your opponent's don't suspect you then

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.229 
your opponent's don't suspect you then
they're<00:02:52.470> actually<00:02:52.590> quite<00:02:52.920> good<00:02:53.220> like<00:02:54.030> always

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
they're actually quite good like always

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.660 
they're actually quite good like always
within<00:02:55.110> yourself<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.980> either<00:02:56.130> want<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.459> fly

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
within yourself you either want to fly

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.390 
within yourself you either want to fly
really<00:02:56.910> high<00:02:57.060> or<00:02:57.420> very<00:02:58.079> low<00:02:58.319> applying<00:02:59.220> load

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
really high or very low applying load

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.800 
really high or very low applying load
like<00:02:59.430> this<00:02:59.579> is<00:02:59.849> of<00:02:59.970> course<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.329> break<00:03:00.510> line<00:03:00.690> of

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
like this is of course to break line of

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.069 
like this is of course to break line of
sight<00:03:00.959> from<00:03:01.200> flak<00:03:01.829> lock-ons<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.730> yes<00:03:03.690> more<00:03:03.930> on

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
sight from flak lock-ons and yes more on

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.319 
sight from flak lock-ons and yes more on
fire<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.950> when<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.519> fly<00:03:05.700> really<00:03:05.910> high<00:03:06.030> that's

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
fire and when you fly really high that's

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.940 
fire and when you fly really high that's
of<00:03:06.540> course<00:03:06.660> for<00:03:06.840> another<00:03:07.019> purpose<00:03:07.470> but<00:03:07.890> I

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
of course for another purpose but I

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.039 
of course for another purpose but I
found<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.549> if<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.180> fly<00:03:09.420> somewhere<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:09.930> the

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
found that if I fly somewhere in the

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.440 
found that if I fly somewhere in the
middle<00:03:10.379> that's<00:03:11.340> when<00:03:11.549> I<00:03:11.579> end<00:03:11.819> up<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.180> most

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
middle that's when I end up in most

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.900 
middle that's when I end up in most
trouble<00:03:13.410> now<00:03:13.950> here<00:03:14.160> are<00:03:14.310> some<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.670> players

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
trouble now here are some of the players

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.210 
trouble now here are some of the players
that<00:03:15.540> spawn<00:03:15.810> into<00:03:15.959> that's<00:03:16.200> under<00:03:16.440> there<00:03:16.620> they

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
that spawn into that's under there they

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.670 
that spawn into that's under there they
have<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.459> four<00:03:17.850> spotted<00:03:18.299> me<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.780> in<00:03:19.350> this<00:03:19.440> case

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
have a four spotted me and in this case

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.289 
have a four spotted me and in this case
they<00:03:19.950> are<00:03:19.980> shooting<00:03:20.340> me<00:03:20.519> with<00:03:20.700> lock-ons

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
they are shooting me with lock-ons

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.300 
they are shooting me with lock-ons
and<00:03:21.600> I'm<00:03:22.049> trying<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.440> use<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.889> little<00:03:23.190> hill

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
and I'm trying to use this little hill

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.309 
and I'm trying to use this little hill
to<00:03:23.700> break<00:03:23.880> line-of-sight<00:03:24.389> a<00:03:24.660> problem<00:03:25.260> of

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
to break line-of-sight a problem of

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.110 
to break line-of-sight a problem of
course<00:03:25.530> is<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.130> velocity<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.730> this

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
course is that the velocity of this

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.599 
course is that the velocity of this
phone<00:03:27.329> at<00:03:27.480> missile<00:03:27.840> saucers<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:28.950> slower<00:03:29.310> so

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
phone at missile saucers so slower so

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.599 
phone at missile saucers so slower so
low<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:30.230> in<00:03:31.230> many<00:03:31.410> cases<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:31.920> just<00:03:32.069> can't

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
low that in many cases you just can't

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.699 
low that in many cases you just can't
get<00:03:32.970> behind<00:03:33.450> cover<00:03:33.920> fuck<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.160> guys<00:03:36.680> yeah<00:03:37.680> a

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
get behind cover fuck you guys yeah a

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.089 
get behind cover fuck you guys yeah a
little<00:03:38.040> unintended<00:03:38.730> air<00:03:39.239> stunt<00:03:39.630> there<00:03:40.069> yeah<00:03:41.069> I

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
little unintended air stunt there yeah I

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.220 
little unintended air stunt there yeah I
thought<00:03:41.430> both<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:42.090> those<00:03:42.269> rockets<00:03:42.900> was<00:03:43.019> going

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
thought both of those rockets was going

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.920 
thought both of those rockets was going
to<00:03:43.319> hit<00:03:43.440> me<00:03:43.489> luckily<00:03:44.489> only<00:03:45.030> one<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.599> them<00:03:45.720> did

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
to hit me luckily only one of them did

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.140 
to hit me luckily only one of them did
so<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.319> can<00:03:46.620> continue<00:03:46.919> putting<00:03:47.849> some<00:03:48.000> pressure

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
so I can continue putting some pressure

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.229 
so I can continue putting some pressure
on<00:03:48.419> this<00:03:48.959> Thunderer<00:03:49.739> now<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.700> be<00:03:50.819> perfectly

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
on this Thunderer now to be perfectly

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.610 
on this Thunderer now to be perfectly
honest<00:03:51.569> I<00:03:51.690> have<00:03:51.840> very<00:03:52.049> little<00:03:52.200> experience

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
honest I have very little experience

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.400 
honest I have very little experience
with<00:03:52.950> this<00:03:53.130> one<00:03:53.340> at<00:03:53.489> missiles<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.180> if<00:03:55.169> I

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
with this one at missiles and if I

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.229 
with this one at missiles and if I
continue<00:03:55.799> working<00:03:56.190> with<00:03:56.459> them<00:03:56.609> and<00:03:56.849> figure

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
continue working with them and figure

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.490 
continue working with them and figure
out<00:03:57.389> how<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.780> use<00:03:58.049> them<00:03:58.260> more<00:03:58.440> effectively

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
out how to use them more effectively

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.129 
out how to use them more effectively
I'll<00:03:59.340> probably<00:04:00.030> come<00:04:00.269> up<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.569> tutorial

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
I'll probably come up to the tutorial

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.960 
I'll probably come up to the tutorial
however<00:04:01.620> this<00:04:01.919> video<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.370> just<00:04:02.609> going<00:04:02.819> to

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
however this video is just going to

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.210 
however this video is just going to
serve<00:04:03.180> as<00:04:03.389> a<00:04:03.599> gameplay<00:04:04.139> video<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:04.919> eventually

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
serve as a gameplay video so eventually

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.909 
serve as a gameplay video so eventually
I<00:04:05.430> got<00:04:05.579> a<00:04:05.639> little<00:04:05.730> bit<00:04:05.910> fed<00:04:06.090> up<00:04:06.150> with<00:04:06.389> this

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
I got a little bit fed up with this

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.319 
I got a little bit fed up with this
going<00:04:07.919> in<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.280> out<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.489> cover<00:04:08.700> from<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.120> seal

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
going in and out of cover from the seal

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.879 
going in and out of cover from the seal
and<00:04:09.720> decided<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.829> use<00:04:11.130> another<00:04:11.579> strategy<00:04:12.090> and

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
and decided to use another strategy and

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.159 
and decided to use another strategy and
this<00:04:13.889> is<00:04:14.010> another<00:04:14.160> way<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.400> do<00:04:14.609> it<00:04:14.790> again<00:04:15.780> this

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
this is another way to do it again this

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.870 
this is another way to do it again this
does<00:04:16.410> not<00:04:16.590> work<00:04:16.859> if<00:04:17.130> they<00:04:17.280> have<00:04:17.310> anti<00:04:17.760> air

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
does not work if they have anti air

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.120 
does not work if they have anti air
maxes<00:04:18.299> nearby<00:04:18.660> because<00:04:18.930> they<00:04:19.260> will<00:04:19.440> just<00:04:19.799> kill

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
maxes nearby because they will just kill

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.159 
maxes nearby because they will just kill
you<00:04:20.340> but<00:04:20.970> in<00:04:21.120> this<00:04:21.239> case<00:04:21.479> they<00:04:21.750> seem<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.019> be

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
you but in this case they seem to be

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.649 
you but in this case they seem to be
preoccupied<00:04:23.099> with<00:04:23.340> a<00:04:23.880> lot<00:04:24.090> of<00:04:24.180> other<00:04:24.330> stuff

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
preoccupied with a lot of other stuff

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.560 
preoccupied with a lot of other stuff
which<00:04:25.229> is<00:04:25.469> lucky<00:04:25.680> for<00:04:25.919> me<00:04:26.039> as<00:04:26.219> you<00:04:26.880> can<00:04:27.000> see

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
which is lucky for me as you can see

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.380 
which is lucky for me as you can see
quite<00:04:28.140> easy<00:04:28.350> for<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:28.620> few<00:04:28.680> engineers<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.790> out

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
quite easy for a few engineers to out

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.650 
quite easy for a few engineers to out
repairs<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.890> damage<00:04:32.220> from<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.640> Hornets<00:04:33.000> but

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
with the help of I think it's a couple

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.280 
with the help of I think it's a couple
of<00:04:35.580> harassers<00:04:36.000> maybe<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.570> lightning<00:04:36.900> or<00:04:37.140> two

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
of harassers maybe a lightning or two

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.650 
of harassers maybe a lightning or two
where<00:04:38.130> were<00:04:38.280> we<00:04:38.610> were<00:04:38.730> actually<00:04:39.090> able<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.450> take

where were we were actually able to take
it<00:04:39.780> out<00:04:39.900> now<00:04:40.260> in<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.190> situation<00:04:41.670> they
