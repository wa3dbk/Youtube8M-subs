believe this this is all the crap that
comes<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.910> zabbix<00:01:06.420> Golf<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.220> know<00:01:08.280> this

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
comes with zabbix Golf and you know this

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.730 
comes with zabbix Golf and you know this
thing<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.180> isn't<00:01:09.450> even<00:01:09.660> the<00:01:09.870> console<00:01:10.410> this

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
thing this isn't even the console this

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.200 
thing this isn't even the console this
is<00:01:10.920> some<00:01:11.130> kind<00:01:11.370> of<00:01:12.800> neurotransmitter

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
is some kind of neurotransmitter

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.290 
is some kind of neurotransmitter
infrared<00:01:15.410> saying<00:01:16.410> that<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.340> know<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.640> picks

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
infrared saying that you know it picks

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.499 
infrared saying that you know it picks
up<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.720> trajectory<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.560> your<00:01:19.770> swing<00:01:20.390> you<00:01:21.390> know

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
up the trajectory of your swing you know

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.160 
up the trajectory of your swing you know
I<00:01:21.540> assume<00:01:22.229> all<00:01:23.220> right<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.970> let's<00:01:24.720> give<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.110> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
I assume all right so let's give this a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:42.170 
I assume all right so let's give this a
shot

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.650 

all<00:01:42.960> right<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.410> so<00:01:43.650> many<00:01:43.830> zabbix<00:01:44.400> games<00:01:44.730> your

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
all right like so many zabbix games your

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.020 
all right like so many zabbix games your
actual<00:01:46.020> controller<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:47.040> does<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.640> any

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
actual controller here does not have any

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.060 
actual controller here does not have any
buttons<00:01:48.330> on<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.660> this<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.410> for<00:01:49.590> swinging

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
buttons on it this is just for swinging

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.390 
buttons on it this is just for swinging

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that you're going to use to control the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.510 
that you're going to use to control the
game<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.230> navigate<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:55.770> menu<00:01:56.100> around<00:01:56.310> this

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
game and navigate the menu around this

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.590 
game and navigate the menu around this
thing<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:57.960> we'll<00:01:58.170> hit<00:01:58.290> enter<00:02:00.830> nothing<00:02:01.830> happens

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.630 
use your skill to attempt a hole-in-one
well<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.540> see<00:02:06.750> zabbix<00:02:07.440> that<00:02:07.980> is<00:02:08.250> predicated

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
well you see zabbix that is predicated

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.360 
well you see zabbix that is predicated
on<00:02:09.000> me<00:02:09.210> having<00:02:09.540> any<00:02:09.750> skill<00:02:10.170> whatsoever<00:02:10.410> which

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
on me having any skill whatsoever which

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.340 
on me having any skill whatsoever which
I<00:02:11.520> would<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.000> would<00:02:12.210> I<00:02:12.420> would<00:02:12.750> somewhat<00:02:13.110> doubt

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
I would I would I would somewhat doubt

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.740 
I would I would I would somewhat doubt
to<00:02:13.650> be<00:02:13.740> perfectly<00:02:14.400> honest<00:02:14.790> with<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.000> I'm

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
to be perfectly honest with you I'm

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.580 
to be perfectly honest with you I'm
swinging<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.440> club<00:02:16.940> nothing's<00:02:17.940> happening

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
swinging the club nothing's happening

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.270 
swinging the club nothing's happening
I'm<00:02:19.590> swinging<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.340> club<00:02:20.690> over<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:22.410> sensor

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
I'm swinging the club over the sensor

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.840 
I'm swinging the club over the sensor
bar<00:02:23.540> nothing's<00:02:24.540> happening<00:02:25.080> oh<00:02:25.520> here<00:02:26.520> we<00:02:26.640> go

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
bar nothing's happening oh here we go

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.010 
bar nothing's happening oh here we go
if<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.630> golf<00:02:27.900> club<00:02:28.290> does<00:02:28.650> not<00:02:28.920> work<00:02:29.780> adjust<00:02:30.780> or

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
if the golf club does not work adjust or

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.380 
if the golf club does not work adjust or
turn<00:02:31.260> off<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.740> room<00:02:31.950> light<00:02:32.190> then<00:02:32.700> try<00:02:33.090> again

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
turn off the room light then try again

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.920 
turn off the room light then try again
so<00:02:33.900> basically<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:35.790> know<00:02:35.970> every<00:02:36.480> living<00:02:36.780> room

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
so basically you know every living room

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.730 
so basically you know every living room
ever<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:38.370> zabbix<00:02:38.730> will<00:02:38.940> not<00:02:39.090> work<00:02:39.300> in<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.740> now

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
ever the zabbix will not work in it now

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.530 
ever the zabbix will not work in it now
that<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.130> thing<00:02:41.340> has<00:02:41.550> finally<00:02:41.970> decided<00:02:42.150> to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
that the thing has finally decided to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.350 
that the thing has finally decided to
work<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.380> kind<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:43.890> works<00:02:44.100> I<00:02:44.550> don't<00:02:45.150> want<00:02:45.270> to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
work it kind of works I don't want to

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.979 
work it kind of works I don't want to
say<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.600> works<00:02:45.810> entirely<00:02:47.390> but<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.480> does<00:02:48.690> kind

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
say it works entirely but it does kind

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.590 
say it works entirely but it does kind
of<00:02:49.080> work<00:02:49.320> let's<00:02:50.250> put<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:50.730> way<00:02:51.000> there<00:02:51.450> are

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
of work let's put it this way there are

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.430 
of work let's put it this way there are
zabbix<00:02:52.019> games<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.620> work<00:02:52.830> worse<00:02:53.250> than<00:02:53.670> this

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
zabbix games that work worse than this

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.990 
zabbix games that work worse than this
all<00:02:55.440> right<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:55.769> here's<00:02:55.950> how<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.220> works<00:02:56.430> you've

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
all right so here's how it works you've

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.930 
all right so here's how it works you've
moved<00:02:57.239> your<00:02:57.480> canoe<00:02:58.290> here<00:02:58.709> golf<00:02:59.070> club<00:02:59.489> over<00:02:59.820> the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
moved your canoe here golf club over the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.449 
moved your canoe here golf club over the
sensor<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.780> then<00:03:01.080> your<00:03:01.320> golf<00:03:01.560> club<00:03:02.130> on<00:03:02.370> the

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
sensor and then your golf club on the

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.360 
sensor and then your golf club on the
screen<00:03:02.850> moves<00:03:03.150> around<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.690> course<00:03:03.959> plot

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
screen moves around to course plot

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.790 
screen moves around to course plot
here's<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.550> problem<00:03:06.019> this<00:03:07.019> is<00:03:07.080> like<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.680> know

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
here's the problem this is like you know
