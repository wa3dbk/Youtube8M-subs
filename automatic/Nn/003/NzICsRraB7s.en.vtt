00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 hi guys with you pavel sheker and me 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.809
 I record the game on the site d2r . no, there is 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.210
 I am very lucky now to you 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.890
 by your numerous requests by the way 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.170
 I write down without you, I would hardly have become 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.510
 write because hardly. but this 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.140
 at all such an ass to be honest here I am 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.960
 already 13 13 attempt to me probably records 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.219
 now goes and everything is really very 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.850
 bad really server log I'm there leaders 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.430
 a whole bunch of server just disconnects 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.379
 But if kuni happens in this game 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.230
 disconnect i just say well guys i 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.600
 spoke and that's all and don't need me 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.430
 blame the fact that there are such things 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.530
 occur 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.770
 we must blame those people who on 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.410
 d2l the whole thing muddied recipe from 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.620
 x3 gain goes on skill and on items 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.270
 here and this is an interesting mod because 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.699
 first is random.org 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.080
 here you are not a dead end 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.960
 skills did not pick and the whole thing is that you 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.150
 how would when you die periodically then 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.400
 there is some time passes if you 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.720
 die then you will be reborn as a new hero with 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.020
 new skills somehow so it is very 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.200
 cool really game design blog 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.750
 and so it is like the usual extreme of this battle 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.560
 skills for example just by speaking 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.420
 skills by the way the enemies are stronger she 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:40.979
 good too I 'll go somewhere in mid 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:44.040
 for example here's a good double d mouse i even 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.970
 from inviz not entered took wd match here 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:56.270

00:01:46.970 --> 00:02:02.390
 these rubik collect devices and this is still 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.390
 will I have enough time to pick up 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.599

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.860
