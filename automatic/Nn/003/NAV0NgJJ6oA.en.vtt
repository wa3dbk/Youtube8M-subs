a<00:00:28.140> bad<00:00:28.320> way<00:00:28.349> maybe<00:00:28.939> if<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.170> uh<00:00:31.380> this<00:00:31.679> app

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
a bad way maybe if I so this uh this app

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.410 
a bad way maybe if I so this uh this app
it<00:00:33.020> basically<00:00:34.020> lets<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.620> control<00:00:35.420> your

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
it basically lets you control your

it basically lets you control your
Android<00:00:36.840> phone<00:00:36.870> using<00:00:37.649> only<00:00:37.860> your<00:00:38.040> voice

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
Android phone using only your voice

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.690 
Android phone using only your voice
which<00:00:39.540> might<00:00:39.989> not<00:00:40.020> sound<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.739> novel<00:00:41.219> thing

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
which might not sound like a novel thing

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.299 
which might not sound like a novel thing
because<00:00:42.390> there's<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.660> bunch<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.079> other<00:00:43.309> voice

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
because there's a bunch of other voice

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.540 
because there's a bunch of other voice
control<00:00:44.789> apps<00:00:45.210> out<00:00:45.510> or<00:00:45.690> voice<00:00:45.840> texting<00:00:46.260> apps

control apps out or voice texting apps

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
getting used to my voice that's what

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.680 
getting used to my voice that's what
we'll<00:02:28.780> call<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:29.550> but<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:30.700> set<00:02:30.910> up<00:02:31.000> your<00:02:31.030> when

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
we'll call it but you set up your when

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.270 
we'll call it but you set up your when
you<00:02:31.780> when<00:02:31.990> you<00:02:32.020> first<00:02:32.350> start<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:32.770> app<00:02:32.980> you

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
you when you first start this app you

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.450 
you when you first start this app you
tell<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:33.880> what<00:02:34.120> context<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:34.990> want<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:36.160> be<00:02:36.310> able

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
tell it what context you want to be able

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.190 
tell it what context you want to be able
to<00:02:36.880> send<00:02:37.540> text<00:02:37.810> messages<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.930> that's<00:02:40.930> kind

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
to send text messages to and that's kind

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.090 
to send text messages to and that's kind
of<00:02:41.340> it's<00:02:42.340> less<00:02:42.760> impressive<00:02:43.420> than<00:02:43.660> if<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.620> would

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
of it's less impressive than if it would

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.210 
of it's less impressive than if it would
just<00:02:45.370> do<00:02:45.550> it<00:02:45.670> on<00:02:45.820> its<00:02:45.850> own<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.860> don't<00:02:48.130> know

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
just do it on its own but I don't know

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.370 
just do it on its own but I don't know
it<00:02:48.340> still<00:02:48.580> is<00:02:48.700> pretty<00:02:48.910> cool<00:02:49.380> because

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
it still is pretty cool because

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.290 
it still is pretty cool because
basically<00:02:50.830> then<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.340> has<00:02:51.490> just<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.820> short<00:02:52.090> list

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
basically then it has just a short list

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.690 
basically then it has just a short list
of<00:02:52.540> people<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:52.930> work<00:02:53.050> from<00:02:53.640> instead<00:02:54.640> of

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
of people to work from instead of

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.940 
of people to work from instead of
actually<00:02:55.120> trying<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.480> do<00:02:55.630> real<00:02:55.960> voice

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
actually trying to do real voice

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.880 
actually trying to do real voice

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890

recognition so once you select people
whatever<00:03:00.100> they<00:03:00.370> show<00:03:00.580> right<00:03:00.790> up<00:03:00.910> on<00:03:01.200> this

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
you can send them text messages and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.470 
you can send them text messages and

the other one is announced and listen of

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.910 
the other one is announced and listen of
course<00:03:16.660> is<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.410> listen<00:03:18.310> in<00:03:18.430> for<00:03:18.670> commands<00:03:19.480> and

course is to listen in for commands and

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.590 
course is to listen in for commands and
announces<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.160> option<00:03:21.550> to<00:03:21.580> read<00:03:22.150> text

announces the option to read text

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.570 
announces the option to read text

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.420 
messages etc back to you so it's it's
pretty<00:03:27.790> interesting<00:03:28.030> simple<00:03:28.720> interface<00:03:29.430> most

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
pretty interesting simple interface most

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.680 
pretty interesting simple interface most
of<00:03:30.580> your<00:03:30.700> interaction<00:03:31.180> with<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.390> app<00:03:31.510> is

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
of your interaction with the app is

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.290 
of your interaction with the app is
going<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.900> be<00:03:32.050> using<00:03:32.410> voice<00:03:32.709> right<00:03:33.550> so<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:33.970> mean

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
going to be using voice right so I mean

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.840 
going to be using voice right so I mean
a<00:03:34.810> Morse<00:03:35.380> part<00:03:35.620> in<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.920> interface<00:03:36.430> though

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
a Morse part in the interface though

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.100 
a Morse part in the interface though
probably<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.450> better<00:03:37.570> if<00:03:37.810> you're<00:03:37.930> driving

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
probably the better if you're driving

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.790 
probably the better if you're driving
you<00:03:38.650> know<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:40.540> again<00:03:41.050> you've<00:03:41.260> seen<00:03:41.470> some<00:03:41.709> of

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
you know so again you've seen some of

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.310 
you know so again you've seen some of
the<00:03:41.890> weird<00:03:42.160> stuff<00:03:42.340> it<00:03:43.239> does<00:03:43.540> kind<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:43.900> mess<00:03:44.080> up

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
the weird stuff it does kind of mess up

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.320 
the weird stuff it does kind of mess up
it's<00:03:44.560> not<00:03:44.680> quite<00:03:44.950> there<00:03:45.250> but<00:03:45.760> this<00:03:46.150> is

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
it's not quite there but this is

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.270 
it's not quite there but this is
honestly<00:03:46.900> they've<00:03:47.650> come<00:03:47.830> right<00:03:47.950> now<00:03:48.010> inside

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
honestly they've come right now inside

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.720 
honestly they've come right now inside
an<00:03:48.430> open<00:03:48.700> public<00:03:48.880> beta<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:50.500> it's<00:03:51.220> not<00:03:51.459> going<00:03:51.640> to

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
an open public beta so it's not going to

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.880 
an open public beta so it's not going to
be<00:03:51.880> perfect<00:03:52.150> for<00:03:52.900> what<00:03:53.140> they<00:03:53.260> wanted<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.739> do

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
be perfect for what they wanted to do

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.040 
be perfect for what they wanted to do
yet<00:03:54.160> but<00:03:55.000> it<00:03:55.120> is<00:03:55.150> getting<00:03:55.450> there<00:03:55.630> is<00:03:55.780> pretty

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
yet but it is getting there is pretty

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.900 
yet but it is getting there is pretty
it's<00:03:56.380> a<00:03:56.500> pretty<00:03:56.860> impressive<00:03:57.070> start<00:03:57.550> I'd<00:03:57.700> say

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
it's a pretty impressive start I'd say

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.630 
it's a pretty impressive start I'd say
what<00:03:58.690> do<00:03:58.780> you<00:03:58.840> think<00:03:59.050> one<00:03:59.560> of<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.769> coolest

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
what do you think one of the coolest

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.890 
what do you think one of the coolest
things<00:04:00.970> that<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.269> does<00:04:01.300> what's<00:04:01.660> one<00:04:01.780> of<00:04:01.810> the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
things that it does what's one of the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.710 
things that it does what's one of the
coolest<00:04:02.110> features<00:04:02.500> you<00:04:02.800> can<00:04:02.830> do<00:04:03.100> uh<00:04:04.060> well<00:04:04.480> I

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
coolest features you can do uh well I

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.600 
coolest features you can do uh well I
like<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.140> idea<00:04:05.260> that<00:04:05.470> it<00:04:05.769> that<00:04:06.040> it<00:04:06.070> reads<00:04:06.370> to

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
like the idea that it that it reads to

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.960
