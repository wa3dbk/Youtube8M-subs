00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.500
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new one 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.990
 video dedicated to minecraft today we will go 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:28.210
 to see the new snap shots 13 v 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:30.190
 42 a and 13 v 42 b as last week 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.529
 the novelties of these snap shots are not 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.080
 evident even though a lot has been done 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.330
 work behind the scenes on the part 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.610
 sound of the game but this one 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.650
 I'll talk the news soon 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.210
 important this week 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.079
 and the announcement of the imminent release 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.030
 of the pre release 1.7 has not yet been 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.180
 a precise date has been announced 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.340
 although hopes to see 1.7 1a 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.079
 of the main with what memory will be held i 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.530
 first days of November to orlando in 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.690
 florida are very high but let's go now to 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.750
 see the innovations introduced in these 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.460
 snap shot as I said a little ago all the 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.690
 the game's sound sector was 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.060
 rewritten 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.680
 now the kings on the pack can contain 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.539
 in addition to the textures also the effects 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.210
 sound that can therefore be 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.340
 added removed grouped or returned 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.069
 even this novelty is random 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.869
 will help the creators of custom map that now 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:25.770
 they will be able to insert real ones 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.209
 dialogues spoken in their creations 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.700
 one of the modifications of this snap shot 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:32.800
 regards the colored glass his 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.619
 transparency level has increased as 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.360
 you can also notice the texture was 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:42.340
 slightly modified small novelty of 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.039
 this snap shot and what time on the signs 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.610
 we can insert symbols and letters 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.610
 Special 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.440
 a novelty of this snap shot and what time 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.349
 witches can spread outside 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.300
 of their huts to be a small one 

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:01.929
 anticipation of the imminent night of 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.300
 halloween starting this snap shot 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.550
 the maps can display many more 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.250
 colors as you see here or wool 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.929
 colored that comes perfectly 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.120
 also represented on the map ho 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.790
 however had to use the version a of 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.590
 this snap shot since in version b 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.939
 there was a bug he didn't do and a 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.349
 display the various colors correctly 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:26.750
 unfortunately the novelties of this snap shot 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:29.840
 they are finished however I remind you that 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.600
