00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
did an amazing job on this map so we're

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.620 
did an amazing job on this map so we're
moving<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.610> through<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> Bulls<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
signs that are explaining this map so

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.459 
signs that are explaining this map so
this<00:00:36.270> version<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> walls<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.170> very

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.120 
and for a place on that side so we're
going<00:01:22.799> into<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.640> walls<00:01:24.030> are<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.299> at<00:01:24.479> right<00:01:24.659> now

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
going into the walls are we at right now

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.429 
going into the walls are we at right now
so<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.490> are<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.299> walls<00:01:27.840> method

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
so here we are this is the walls method

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.200 
so here we are this is the walls method
I've<00:01:28.619> been<00:01:28.920> talking<00:01:29.310> about<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:30.030> is
