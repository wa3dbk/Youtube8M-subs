00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
with Robin Williams I think that's the

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.130 
with Robin Williams I think that's the
right<00:00:51.130> movie<00:00:51.489> but<00:00:52.090> when<00:00:52.330> he's<00:00:52.629> in<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:52.900> dream

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
right movie but when he's in the dream

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.570 
right movie but when he's in the dream
world<00:00:53.290> there's<00:00:53.620> all<00:00:53.860> these<00:00:54.010> really<00:00:54.340> pretty
