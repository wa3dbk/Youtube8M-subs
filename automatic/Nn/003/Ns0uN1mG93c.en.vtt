 there until it 's nothing bad is over or 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.150
 any less 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.830
 It will be giving to send my masterpiece 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.110
 for the exhibition that my friends 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.200
 radio reporter we are riding 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.200
 to see 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.910
 neighbors and even in the world of 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.800
 you 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.300
 notice johnson wants to find out what the 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.830
 people think about aic 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.529
 What do you think is a work of art? 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.200
 works of art for me is an option that 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.599
 You know and you have to, I 'm not here. 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.900
 of something that will copy 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.210
 I think that the new turis garden 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.280
 creativity is the half- dozen artists who 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.840
 made this work share 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.910
 share what they were 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:47.110
 feeling when they did this work 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.300
 as a work in which the dyer is 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.160
 it seems cone also express your 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.060
 feeling if you can say what you 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.050
 want to 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:00.020
 just out of curiosity since the design of the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.900
 caves to the modern works of today 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.970
 art is part of our daily life because 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.689
 is the way we find to express 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.000
 our emotions history and culture art 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.130
 can be represented in various ways 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.120
 such as painting music and 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.880
 sculpture to photography and dance cinema 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.700
 with our creativity you 've already heard 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.770
 talking about modern classical art is like 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.190
 we classify the works according to 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.080
 your styles and characteristics to you 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.630

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.630
 other provisions 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.670

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.230
 state of são paulo 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.120

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.160
 that we do not even know how to look 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.290
 also that the station has fishing that 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.430
 It is also very cool because it will be the 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.430
 sale staff here

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.519
 and a very great demand work which 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.620
 I liked the most was the metamorphosis is a 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.900
 multi risk but I think behind 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.720
 these risks into something that 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.769
 The painter tried to convey the tone and I think 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.200
 What can I do? 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.130
