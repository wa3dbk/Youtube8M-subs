how to do the first step in running in

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.570 
how to do the first step in running in
spite<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:09.630> look<00:00:10.500> like<00:00:10.740> very

insignificant<00:00:12.000> for<00:00:12.719> long<00:00:13.049> distance<00:00:13.440> running

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
insignificant for long distance running

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.480 
insignificant for long distance running
or<00:00:14.370> any<00:00:14.820> running<00:00:15.240> at<00:00:15.360> all<00:00:15.980> as<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.039> matter<00:00:17.369> of

or any running at all as a matter of

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.820 
or any running at all as a matter of
fact<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.359> very<00:00:18.720> important<00:00:19.500> part<00:00:19.740> of

fact is this is a very important part of

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.740 
fact is this is a very important part of
running<00:00:20.070> because<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.240> said<00:00:21.619> it<00:00:22.619> sets<00:00:22.920> all

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
running because it said it sets all

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.009 
running because it said it sets all
following<00:00:25.039> pattern<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.189> movement<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.019> how

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
following pattern of movement and how

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.120 
following pattern of movement and how
you<00:00:28.949> properly<00:00:29.400> do<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.480> first<00:00:30.779> step<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.949> will

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
you properly do the first step it will

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.920 
you properly do the first step it will
depend<00:00:32.279> how<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.759> will<00:00:33.030> continue<00:00:33.390> with<00:00:33.829> so<00:00:35.930> we

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
properly we will start from a perception

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.500 
properly we will start from a perception
of<00:00:49.230> first<00:00:49.710> step<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.640> common<00:00:51.000> sense<00:00:51.239> how

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
of first step in a common sense how

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.920 
of first step in a common sense how
people<00:00:51.870> do<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:54.180> our<00:00:54.360> conscience

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
people do this and in our conscience

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.510 
people do this and in our conscience
first<00:00:55.860> step<00:00:56.100> related<00:00:57.090> with<00:00:57.270> very<00:00:57.660> simple

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
first step related with very simple

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.349 
first step related with very simple
thing<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.789> move<00:01:00.629> leg<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.680> foot<00:01:02.059> forward<00:01:03.059> in

this<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.630> how<00:01:06.810> people<00:01:07.290> perceive<00:01:07.740> running<00:01:08.430> but

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
this is how people perceive running but

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.010 
this is how people perceive running but

what from common-sense point of view
people<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:34.010> land<00:01:35.010> on<00:01:35.370> this<00:01:36.110> airborne<00:01:37.110> leg

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
people do is land on this airborne leg

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.570 
people do is land on this airborne leg
but<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.790> reality<00:01:39.060> again<00:01:39.690> before<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.980> happen

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
but in reality again before this happen

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.930 
but in reality again before this happen
and<00:01:42.050> your<00:01:43.050> foot<00:01:43.350> land<00:01:43.620> on<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:43.920> ground<00:01:44.070> rare

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
and your foot land on the ground rare

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.420 
and your foot land on the ground rare
foot<00:01:45.390> supposed<00:01:46.050> to<00:01:46.200> live<00:01:46.680> from<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.190> ground

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
foot supposed to live from the ground

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.560 
foot supposed to live from the ground
and<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.300> what<00:01:48.660> happening<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:50.220> reality<00:01:50.570> so

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and this is what happening in reality so

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.460 
and this is what happening in reality so
we<00:01:52.280> have<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.400> distinguish<00:01:53.840> these<00:01:54.840> things<00:01:55.200> for

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
we have to distinguish these things for

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.740 
we have to distinguish these things for
ourselves<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.670> our<00:01:56.820> perception<00:01:57.300> which<00:01:57.720> is

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
ourselves in in our perception which is

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.260 
ourselves in in our perception which is
very<00:01:58.200> very<00:01:58.440> difficult<00:01:58.740> thing<00:01:59.270> because

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
very very difficult thing because

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.130 
very very difficult thing because
perception<00:02:00.630> usually<00:02:01.260> underdeveloped<00:02:01.800> in

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
perception usually underdeveloped in

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.390 
perception usually underdeveloped in
particularly<00:02:04.140> when<00:02:04.530> we're<00:02:04.830> not<00:02:05.100> paying

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
particularly when we're not paying

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.450 
particularly when we're not paying
attention<00:02:05.580> for<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.210> kind<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.690> element

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
attention for this kind of element

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.300 
attention for this kind of element
because<00:02:08.460> they<00:02:08.640> think<00:02:08.700> it's<00:02:09.030> insignificant

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
because they think it's insignificant

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.370 
because they think it's insignificant

live from the ground together with
leaning<00:02:30.300> forward<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.440> what<00:02:31.650> first<00:02:32.220> step

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
leaning forward this is what first step

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.960 
leaning forward this is what first step
is<00:02:32.760> about<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.720> how<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.470> look<00:02:34.770> like<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:35.340> will<00:02:35.820> show

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
is about so how it look like I will show

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.949 
is about so how it look like I will show
you<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.600> as<00:02:36.990> example<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.370> here<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.959> then

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.360 
you this as example you here and then
leaning<00:02:40.530> start<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:42.120> couldn't<00:02:42.990> stop<00:02:43.800> myself

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
leaning start I I couldn't stop myself

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.390 
leaning start I I couldn't stop myself
and<00:02:44.490> fix<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.660> leaning<00:02:46.230> position<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:46.950> it

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
and fix it in the leaning position so it

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.240 
and fix it in the leaning position so it
will<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:47.790> only<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:48.989> video<00:02:49.500> which<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.070> will

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
will be only in the video which you will

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.290 
will be only in the video which you will
see<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.550> stop<00:02:51.480> frame<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.590> I'm<00:02:52.950> leaning<00:02:53.190> forward

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
see in stop frame so I'm leaning forward

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.090 
see in stop frame so I'm leaning forward
and<00:02:55.630> then<00:02:56.440> it's<00:02:57.400> happened<00:02:58.210> the<00:02:58.690> hop<00:02:58.990> what<00:02:59.860> look

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
and then it's happened the hop what look

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.030 
and then it's happened the hop what look
like<00:03:00.130> but<00:03:00.580> what<00:03:00.820> I<00:03:00.850> did<00:03:01.240> there<00:03:01.540> in<00:03:01.990> reality<00:03:02.500> it

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
like but what I did there in reality it

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.700 
like but what I did there in reality it
was<00:03:03.210> pulling<00:03:04.210> foot<00:03:04.420> from<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.780> ground<00:03:05.020> by<00:03:05.650> the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
was pulling foot from the ground by the

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.980 
was pulling foot from the ground by the
third<00:03:06.100> law<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.520> Newton<00:03:06.760> if<00:03:07.300> I<00:03:07.480> would<00:03:07.630> like<00:03:07.780> to

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
third law of Newton if I would like to

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.320 
third law of Newton if I would like to
pull<00:03:08.350> my<00:03:08.620> foot<00:03:08.800> from<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.160> ground<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:10.030> same

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
pull my foot from the ground the same

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.970 
pull my foot from the ground the same
amount<00:03:10.660> of<00:03:10.810> force<00:03:11.020> would<00:03:11.320> be<00:03:11.380> applied<00:03:11.740> to<00:03:11.860> the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
amount of force would be applied to the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.790 
amount of force would be applied to the
ground<00:03:12.190> as<00:03:12.460> well<00:03:12.820> so<00:03:13.480> what<00:03:14.080> we<00:03:14.200> call<00:03:14.380> push<00:03:14.560> off

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
ground as well so what we call push off

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.620 
ground as well so what we call push off
it<00:03:14.980> will<00:03:15.130> happen<00:03:15.460> without<00:03:15.820> any<00:03:16.180> conscious

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
it will happen without any conscious

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.650 
it will happen without any conscious
efforts<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.290> this<00:03:17.470> so<00:03:18.460> one<00:03:18.760> more<00:03:18.940> time<00:03:19.150> I'm

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
efforts to this so one more time I'm

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.810 
efforts to this so one more time I'm
standing<00:03:20.170> on<00:03:20.440> my<00:03:22.890> support<00:03:23.890> foot<00:03:24.160> in<00:03:24.460> the<00:03:24.580> leg

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
standing on my support foot in the leg

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.140 
standing on my support foot in the leg
in<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.510> pose<00:03:25.780> position<00:03:26.770> and<00:03:27.040> my<00:03:27.730> running

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
in the pose position and my running

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.510 
in the pose position and my running
start<00:03:28.420> from<00:03:28.660> this<00:03:29.170> exact<00:03:29.590> position<00:03:29.800> by

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
start from this exact position by

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.930 
start from this exact position by
falling<00:03:31.060> forward<00:03:31.360> in<00:03:31.630> my<00:03:31.960> body<00:03:32.890> moves<00:03:33.430> forward

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
falling forward in my body moves forward

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.690 
falling forward in my body moves forward
and<00:03:34.150> then<00:03:34.840> next<00:03:35.140> thing<00:03:35.800> what<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.100> do<00:03:36.250> I'm

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
and then next thing what I do I'm

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.260 
and then next thing what I do I'm
pulling<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.510> support<00:03:37.900> foot<00:03:38.140> from<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.560> ground

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
pulling the support foot from the ground

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.430 
pulling the support foot from the ground
and<00:03:40.270> this<00:03:40.630> is<00:03:40.690> what<00:03:41.400> we<00:03:42.400> see<00:03:42.760> in<00:03:43.000> post<00:03:43.990> method

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
and this is what we see in post method

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.840 
and this is what we see in post method
but<00:03:45.100> this<00:03:45.610> is<00:03:45.820> what<00:03:46.350> distinguished<00:03:47.850> pose

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
but this is what distinguished pose

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.560 
but this is what distinguished pose
method<00:03:49.150> from<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.380> other<00:03:50.530> running<00:03:51.570> whatever

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
method from the other running whatever

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.240 
method from the other running whatever
we<00:03:53.020> call<00:03:53.740> it<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:55.060> what<00:03:55.990> we<00:03:56.860> would<00:03:56.950> like<00:03:57.010> to

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
we call it so what we would like to

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.900 
we call it so what we would like to
emphasize<00:03:57.670> here<00:03:57.940> is<00:03:58.140> first<00:03:59.140> thing<00:03:59.550> you<00:04:00.550> start

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
emphasize here is first thing you start

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.620 
emphasize here is first thing you start
from<00:04:01.240> pose<00:04:01.890> number<00:04:02.890> one<00:04:03.100> second<00:04:04.030> you<00:04:04.480> are

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
from pose number one second you are

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.260 
from pose number one second you are
falling<00:04:05.080> from<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.500> pose<00:04:05.830> and<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.730> third<00:04:07.000> one

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
falling from the pose and the third one

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.970 
falling from the pose and the third one
you<00:04:07.450> are<00:04:07.570> pulling<00:04:07.960> foot<00:04:08.440> from<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.830> ground

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
you are pulling foot from the ground

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.450 
you are pulling foot from the ground
while<00:04:09.550> you're<00:04:09.790> falling<00:04:10.240> if<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.110> are<00:04:11.460> proceed

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
while you're falling if you are proceed

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.490 
while you're falling if you are proceed
in<00:04:12.790> this<00:04:13.210> manner<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:14.500> these<00:04:15.150> sequences<00:04:16.150> of

in this manner and these sequences of
elements<00:04:17.500> you're<00:04:18.040> running<00:04:18.400> is<00:04:18.549> perfect<00:04:19.030> and

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.210 
elements you're running is perfect and

elements you're running is perfect and
you<00:04:19.600> have<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:19.930> just<00:04:20.140> continue<00:04:20.950> this<00:04:21.160> again<00:04:21.970> and

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
you have to just continue this again and
