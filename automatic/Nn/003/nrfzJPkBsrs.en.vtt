00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:08.670
 But it's a symptom. 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.849
 This time, I will like it. 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.139
 It is a product that I really worried about whether or not to put this out. 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:20.489
 I was going to have it personally, but I got a lot of material. 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:25.470
 Well, because I take up too much and I get a lot of pesky characters 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:26.460
 Nyeoro Cleo cases, just try to do the drill again, I 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.070
 I saw it. 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:38.100
 Well, once you get the manual , it's really big. 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.620
 2 Video Bath towel It will be a little later in size . 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.789
 It's a bit too large. 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.449
 Once you see what the fairy is, try the thick manual 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.429
 I have been young for three months and its thickness is nowadays. Mom and I both have 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:56.640
 A lot of things. 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:01:00.839
 And here there is a box I'm Haeju footwork as boxes when you send something 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.120
 Overseas Overseas Oversea Wash But this is not 180 West 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:07.110
 It's 5 pieces, but it's huge. 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.950
 This character itguyo into a total of five characters 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.270
 That's what the Joker is also rattling good and Rove Oh and inside the Batman ride

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:21.450
 Batman, Robin, and the Batgirl these days . 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:25.979
 This is a total of five characters. This is a bulldozer. 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:31.799
 Bulldozer bulldozer, but this is how it works. 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:36.390
 We only did our exhibition, but Wonjin did a good job , 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.479
 When you make it big, there's nothing uncomfortable or uncomfortable. 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.369
 Anyway, here's a good trade mark. 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:48.899
 But what's not good until I traded this lipped technical name so fragrant fire 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:55.079
 Seems a little something before the Lord personally think it Iooks great, with a very 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.609
 And the requirements are like Batman that airplane . Yeah, Bing is the same. 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.030
 Characters are subtracted from when 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:02.820
 Note that the lobby is a small key, for example, the key point is smaller 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.860
 This is Robin E 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.090

 It's a character. 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:18.750
 If this is the case, then it looks like this. 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:20.610
 It's okay to have a little problem with the milk. 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.820
 There's no problem here . 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:29.310
 This looks a little too seedy. 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:33.480
 It's the same as you. This is what I'm about to do. 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.550
 Minutes saw the video came out, you know this is a defective product, so this keeps 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.560
 I do not feel a little smart . 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:45.870
 And the requirements are preliminary. It's folded. It's open. Yes. It's underneath.

 What this will do is push 2m anyway 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:59.160
 Anyway, it looks like something, but it is a bit hard to find. 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.160
 I do not think it would be a good thing to do well. 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.180
