00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
accents within the single stroke rolls I
wanted<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:48.490> go<00:00:48.640> over<00:00:48.670> something<00:00:49.180> with<00:00:49.300> you

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
skill set I love to do it and it employs

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.760 
skill set I love to do it and it employs
about<00:01:01.510> three<00:01:01.900> different<00:01:02.020> techniques<00:01:02.560> that<00:01:02.649> I

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
about three different techniques that I

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.049 
about three different techniques that I
want<00:01:02.950> to<00:01:03.010> talk<00:01:03.160> about<00:01:03.310> but<00:01:03.579> before<00:01:03.670> I<00:01:03.880> do<00:01:03.940> that

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
want to talk about but before I do that

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.249 
want to talk about but before I do that
let<00:01:04.390> me<00:01:04.420> show<00:01:04.540> you<00:01:04.689> what<00:01:04.839> I'm<00:01:04.930> talking<00:01:05.199> about

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
let me show you what I'm talking about

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:20.060 
let me show you what I'm talking about
here<00:01:05.860> you<00:01:05.979> have<00:01:06.130> singles<00:01:06.490> you<00:01:06.670> have<00:01:07.659> accents

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.740 

so<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.190> first<00:01:21.400> thing<00:01:21.610> I'm<00:01:21.729> doing<00:01:21.760> is<00:01:22.180> trying

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
so the first thing I'm doing is trying

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.719 
so the first thing I'm doing is trying
to<00:01:22.960> get<00:01:23.200> a<00:01:23.260> even<00:01:23.740> single<00:01:24.100> stroke<00:01:24.280> roll<00:01:24.310> in<00:01:24.640> the

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
to get a even single stroke roll in the

00:01:24.729 --> 00:02:03.309 
to get a even single stroke roll in the
low<00:01:24.850> end

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.539 

after<00:02:04.319> you're<00:02:04.439> able<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.770> achieve<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.280> even

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
after you're able to achieve and even

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.630 
after you're able to achieve and even
bounce<00:02:06.000> using<00:02:06.810> fingers<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:08.220> need<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.459> be<00:02:08.550> able

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
bounce using fingers you need to be able

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.400 
bounce using fingers you need to be able
to<00:02:08.759> incorporate<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.149> quick<00:02:09.390> accent<00:02:09.899> one

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
to incorporate a quick accent one

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.960 
to incorporate a quick accent one
technique<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.039> through<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.370> molar<00:02:11.580> stroke

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
technique is through the molar stroke

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.089 
technique is through the molar stroke
the<00:02:12.510> molar<00:02:12.750> stroke<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.260> like<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> whip<00:02:13.739> stroke

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
the molar stroke is like a whip stroke

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.559 
the molar stroke is like a whip stroke
you<00:02:14.610> lead<00:02:14.849> with<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.120> butt<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.480> stick

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
you lead with the butt of the stick

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.479 
you lead with the butt of the stick
unlike<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.379> lever<00:02:16.709> stroke<00:02:17.010> where<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.310> leave

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
unlike a lever stroke where you leave

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.550 
unlike a lever stroke where you leave
with<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> bead<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.660> lead<00:02:18.840> with<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.110> butt<00:02:19.319> and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
with the bead so lead with the butt and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.880 
with the bead so lead with the butt and
that<00:02:20.040> will<00:02:20.220> allow<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:21.620> would<00:02:22.620> be<00:02:22.739> in<00:02:22.799> an

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
that will allow you would be in an

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.530 
that will allow you would be in an
accent<00:02:23.340> while<00:02:23.970> you're<00:02:24.120> still<00:02:24.329> playing

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
accent while you're still playing

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:45.259 
accent while you're still playing
singles<00:02:43.640> so<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.730> can<00:02:44.880> develop<00:02:45.120> that

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
singles so you can develop that

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:52.670 
singles so you can develop that
looseness<00:02:50.569> throwing<00:02:51.569> in<00:02:51.720> accents<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.500> trying

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
looseness throwing in accents and trying

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.110 
looseness throwing in accents and trying
to<00:02:52.739> relax<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:53.220> between<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.700> you're<00:02:53.819> using<00:02:53.940> a

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
to relax in between so you're using a

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.420 
to relax in between so you're using a
squeeze<00:02:54.420> release<00:02:54.750> technique<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.950> stay<00:02:59.160> tight

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
squeeze release technique you stay tight

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.860 
squeeze release technique you stay tight
the<00:02:59.609> whole<00:02:59.760> time<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.209> won't<00:03:00.359> be<00:03:00.450> able<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.720> go

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
the whole time you won't be able to go

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.410 
the whole time you won't be able to go
very<00:03:00.900> long<00:03:01.290> or<00:03:01.530> very<00:03:01.560> fast<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:03.030> here's<00:03:03.269> the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
very long or very fast so here's the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:19.160 
very long or very fast so here's the
idea<00:03:16.670> I'm<00:03:17.670> primarily<00:03:18.030> using<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.600> finger<00:03:18.810> but<00:03:19.049> if

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
idea I'm primarily using a finger but if

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.629 
idea I'm primarily using a finger but if
you<00:03:19.260> get<00:03:19.410> on<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.650> different<00:03:19.769> drum<00:03:20.190> that's<00:03:20.400> not

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
you get on a different drum that's not

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.069 
you get on a different drum that's not
quite<00:03:20.880> as<00:03:21.030> bouncy<00:03:21.450> you'll<00:03:21.720> have<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.959> use<00:03:22.049> a

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
quite as bouncy you'll have to use a

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.840 
quite as bouncy you'll have to use a
little<00:03:22.290> bit<00:03:22.440> more<00:03:22.500> wrist<00:03:22.889> so<00:03:23.519> you<00:03:23.609> have<00:03:23.730> to

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
little bit more wrist so you have to

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.819 
little bit more wrist so you have to
understand<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.480> four<00:03:24.720> lever<00:03:25.019> points<00:03:25.470> for

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
understand the four lever points for

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:48.100 
understand the four lever points for
playing

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.470 

so<00:03:49.110> what<00:03:49.560> combination<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.430> use<00:03:50.640> will<00:03:51.030> help<00:03:51.240> you

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
so what combination to use will help you

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.390 
so what combination to use will help you
especially<00:03:51.930> when<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.350> get<00:03:52.530> into<00:03:52.710> drumming

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
especially when you get into drumming

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.100 
especially when you get into drumming
surfaces<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:54.060> aren't<00:03:54.390> quite<00:03:54.510> as<00:03:54.720> bouncy

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
surfaces that aren't quite as bouncy

like this rope from now the finger

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.640 
like this rope from now the finger
technique<00:03:59.160> is<00:03:59.550> great<00:03:59.760> on<00:04:00.120> Kevlar<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.110> any

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
technique is great on Kevlar and any

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.860 
technique is great on Kevlar and any
type<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:01.950> tight<00:04:02.340> drum<00:04:02.670> head<00:04:02.910> but<00:04:03.420> suppose<00:04:03.690> you

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
type of tight drum head but suppose you

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.690 
type of tight drum head but suppose you
need<00:04:03.990> to<00:04:04.110> go<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.500> floor<00:04:04.860> tom<00:04:05.130> on<00:04:05.370> your<00:04:05.490> drum

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
need to go to a floor tom on your drum

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.060 
need to go to a floor tom on your drum
set<00:04:05.940> or<00:04:06.150> in<00:04:06.660> this<00:04:06.780> case<00:04:07.050> this<00:04:07.350> rudimental<00:04:07.890> rope

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
set or in this case this rudimental rope

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.830 
set or in this case this rudimental rope
tension<00:04:08.460> snare<00:04:08.700> drum<00:04:08.910> which<00:04:09.060> is<00:04:09.210> not<00:04:09.360> as<00:04:09.630> tight

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
tension snare drum which is not as tight

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.420 
tension snare drum which is not as tight
as<00:04:09.990> the<00:04:10.110> Kevlar<00:04:10.440> you<00:04:11.040> will<00:04:11.190> have<00:04:11.340> to

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
as the Kevlar you will have to

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.700 
as the Kevlar you will have to
incorporate<00:04:11.700> different<00:04:12.150> muscle<00:04:12.630> groups<00:04:12.710> so

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
incorporate different muscle groups so

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.170 
incorporate different muscle groups so
for<00:04:13.950> example<00:04:14.370> I<00:04:14.460> will<00:04:14.520> use<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.790> little<00:04:14.940> bit<00:04:15.120> more

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
for example I will use a little bit more

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:39.620 
for example I will use a little bit more
wrist<00:04:15.630> instead<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:16.170> just<00:04:16.380> finger<00:04:38.480> see<00:04:39.480> how

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
wrist instead of just finger see how

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.080 
wrist instead of just finger see how
melding<00:04:40.380> morphine<00:04:41.070> from<00:04:41.250> fingers<00:04:41.700> to<00:04:41.880> wrist

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
melding morphine from fingers to wrist

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.270 
melding morphine from fingers to wrist
in<00:04:42.300> that<00:04:42.450> technique<00:04:42.870> so<00:04:43.590> that's<00:04:43.740> important<00:04:44.190> to

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
in that technique so that's important to

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.890 
in that technique so that's important to
realize<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:44.940> that<00:04:45.090> you<00:04:45.540> need<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.690> practice

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
realize is that you need to practice

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.320 
realize is that you need to practice
different<00:04:46.290> dynamic<00:04:47.010> levels<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:47.640> different

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
different dynamic levels and different

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.660 
different dynamic levels and different
tensions<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:49.140> playing<00:04:49.770> surfaces<00:04:50.430> to

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
tensions and playing surfaces to

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.550 
tensions and playing surfaces to
incorporate<00:04:51.180> all<00:04:51.630> the<00:04:51.930> different<00:04:52.200> techniques

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
incorporate all the different techniques

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.560 
incorporate all the different techniques
you<00:04:52.740> will<00:04:52.890> need<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.190> be<00:04:53.760> able<00:04:53.820> to<00:04:53.970> display<00:04:54.300> as<00:04:54.540> a

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
you will need to be able to display as a

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.450 
you will need to be able to display as a
versatile<00:04:55.050> drummer<00:04:55.320> but<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.680> have<00:04:55.860> one<00:04:56.160> more

little golden nugget developing the

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.089 
little golden nugget developing the
fingers<00:05:16.629> I've<00:05:16.930> found<00:05:17.379> that<00:05:17.530> if<00:05:17.650> you<00:05:17.680> take<00:05:17.770> some

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
fingers I've found that if you take some

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.430 
fingers I've found that if you take some
wooden<00:05:18.370> dowels<00:05:18.789> and<00:05:19.030> play<00:05:19.720> them<00:05:19.900> backwards<00:05:20.319> on

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
wooden dowels and play them backwards on

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:32.100 
wooden dowels and play them backwards on
your<00:05:20.560> forearms<00:05:30.389> it<00:05:31.389> gives<00:05:31.599> you<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.840> really

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
your forearms it gives you the really
