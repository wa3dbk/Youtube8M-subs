an environment with more distractions

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:30.160 
an environment with more distractions
like<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.780> busy<00:03:13.200> street<00:03:13.530> or<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.769> dog<00:03:14.370> park

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.690 

let's<00:03:31.170> take<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.380> quick<00:03:31.680> look<00:03:31.980> at<00:03:32.190> how<00:03:32.370> dogs

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
let's take a quick look at how dogs

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.140 
let's take a quick look at how dogs
learn<00:03:32.910> any<00:03:33.830> behavior<00:03:34.830> that<00:03:35.160> is<00:03:35.400> rewarding<00:03:36.030> to

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
learn any behavior that is rewarding to

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.390 
learn any behavior that is rewarding to
the<00:03:36.270> dog<00:03:36.510> becomes<00:03:37.230> more<00:03:37.590> likely<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.280> be

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
the dog becomes more likely to be

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.150 
the dog becomes more likely to be
repeated<00:03:38.790> in<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.270> future<00:03:39.350> this<00:03:40.350> is<00:03:40.590> exactly

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
repeated in the future this is exactly

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.850 
repeated in the future this is exactly
why<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.459> never<00:03:41.970> want<00:03:42.300> to<00:03:42.390> walk<00:03:42.690> while<00:03:43.530> there

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
why you never want to walk while there

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.070 
why you never want to walk while there
is<00:03:43.980> any<00:03:44.190> tension<00:03:44.670> on<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:44.820> leash<00:03:45.180> because<00:03:45.390> you

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
is any tension on that leash because you

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.140 
is any tension on that leash because you
may<00:03:46.290> be<00:03:46.350> teaching<00:03:46.800> your<00:03:47.160> dog<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.580> pull<00:03:47.940> you

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
may be teaching your dog to pull you

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.970 
may be teaching your dog to pull you
when<00:03:48.600> they<00:03:48.750> want<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.050> go<00:03:49.140> forwards<00:03:49.680> you're

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
when they want to go forwards you're

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.100 
when they want to go forwards you're
going<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.190> notice<00:03:50.490> here<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:51.060> second<00:03:51.660> the

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.580 

you<00:04:50.849> may<00:04:50.999> be<00:04:51.060> thinking<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.779> I'm<00:04:52.289> not<00:04:52.469> going

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
you may be thinking that I'm not going

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.260 
you may be thinking that I'm not going
to<00:04:52.710> be<00:04:52.800> able<00:04:52.860> to<00:04:53.009> get<00:04:53.249> more<00:04:53.460> than<00:04:53.610> three<00:04:53.879> steps

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
to be able to get more than three steps

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.149 
to be able to get more than three steps
before<00:04:54.539> I<00:04:54.719> need<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:54.990> change<00:04:55.259> directions<00:04:55.740> and

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
before I need to change directions and

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:59.360 
before I need to change directions and
that<00:04:56.789> is<00:04:56.969> true<00:04:57.300> most<00:04:57.659> often<00:04:58.289> in<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:58.740> initial

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
that is true most often in the initial

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.219 
that is true most often in the initial
stages<00:04:59.699> of<00:04:59.819> teaching<00:05:00.270> this<00:05:00.419> you<00:05:00.659> will<00:05:00.930> have<00:05:01.169> to

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
stages of teaching this you will have to

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.200 
stages of teaching this you will have to
change<00:05:01.680> directions<00:05:02.039> quite<00:05:02.580> frequently

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
change directions quite frequently

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.379 
change directions quite frequently
however<00:05:04.139> I<00:05:04.529> like<00:05:04.860> to<00:05:05.009> think<00:05:05.189> of<00:05:05.279> it<00:05:05.430> as<00:05:05.550> every

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
however I like to think of it as every

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.269 
however I like to think of it as every
time<00:05:06.659> that<00:05:06.990> they<00:05:07.199> pull<00:05:07.560> and<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:07.949> change

00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:08.279 
time that they pull and you change

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.550 
time that they pull and you change
directions<00:05:08.520> is<00:05:09.210> an<00:05:09.360> opportunity<00:05:10.020> for<00:05:10.319> them<00:05:10.529> to

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560
