00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
we're over xanthus and the light was

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.640 
we're over xanthus and the light was
fading<00:01:32.030> at<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.450> end<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.900> day<00:01:33.050> we<00:01:33.440> suddenly

fading at the end of the day we suddenly

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.250 
fading at the end of the day we suddenly
found<00:01:34.040> all<00:01:34.940> of<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.210> engine<00:01:35.570> instruments<00:01:35.810> were

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
found all of the engine instruments were

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.280 
found all of the engine instruments were
rapidly<00:01:36.590> going<00:01:36.920> into<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.340> red<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:38.290> and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
rapidly going into the red and and

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.580 
rapidly going into the red and and
obviously<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.990> power<00:01:41.990> of<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.200> engine

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
obviously the the power of the engine

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.790 
obviously the the power of the engine
was<00:01:42.800> was<00:01:43.490> fading<00:01:44.140> fortunately<00:01:45.140> we<00:01:45.290> had<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.500> fair

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
was was fading fortunately we had a fair

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.520 
was was fading fortunately we had a fair
amount<00:01:45.830> of<00:01:46.100> altitude<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:46.940> so<00:01:47.930> there<00:01:48.410> was

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
amount of altitude and so there was

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.920 
amount of altitude and so there was
nothing<00:01:48.650> advances<00:01:49.310> xanthus<00:01:50.210> it's<00:01:50.690> only<00:01:50.840> a

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
nothing advances xanthus it's only a

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.710 
nothing advances xanthus it's only a
sighting<00:01:51.350> so<00:01:52.070> we<00:01:52.790> just<00:01:53.000> carried<00:01:53.360> on<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.540> do<00:01:53.630> the

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
sighting so we just carried on to do the

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.660 
sighting so we just carried on to do the
very<00:01:53.900> slow<00:01:54.230> descent<00:01:54.710> even<00:01:55.370> Cal<00:01:55.760> Dooley

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
very slow descent even Cal Dooley

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.430 
very slow descent even Cal Dooley
unfortunately<00:01:58.670> made<00:01:58.910> it<00:01:59.060> and<00:02:00.020> then<00:02:00.230> found

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
unfortunately made it and then found

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.390 
unfortunately made it and then found
afterwards<00:02:01.280> with<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.890> interrupted

afterwards with the the interrupted

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.270 
afterwards with the the interrupted
plane<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:04.850> exhaust<00:02:05.210> gasket<00:02:05.870> and<00:02:06.440> this<00:02:06.800> really

plane and exhaust gasket and this really

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.620 
plane and exhaust gasket and this really
hot<00:02:08.890> exhaust<00:02:09.890> was<00:02:10.460> really<00:02:10.910> coming<00:02:11.240> over<00:02:11.480> the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
hot exhaust was really coming over the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.650 
hot exhaust was really coming over the
the<00:02:12.110> engine<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.190> making<00:02:13.910> everything<00:02:14.270> very

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
the engine and making everything very

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.710 
the engine and making everything very
overheated<00:02:15.440> we<00:02:15.860> had<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.190> fixed<00:02:16.490> up<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.880> got

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
overheated we had that fixed up and got

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.680 
overheated we had that fixed up and got
back<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.410> well<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.520> have<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.090> lot<00:02:20.270> of<00:02:20.300> trouble

up<00:04:46.420> and<00:04:46.750> I<00:04:47.110> said<00:04:47.320> have<00:04:48.160> a<00:04:48.220> look<00:04:48.460> at<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.670> DME<00:04:49.860> so

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
up and I said have a look at the DME so

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.860 
up and I said have a look at the DME so
we<00:04:51.100> couldn't<00:04:51.310> believe<00:04:51.550> this<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.300> we<00:04:52.600> got<00:04:52.750> up

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
we couldn't believe this and we got up

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.480 
we couldn't believe this and we got up
into<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.200> jet<00:04:53.380> stream<00:04:53.740> and<00:04:53.890> twenty<00:04:54.310> seven

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
into the jet stream and twenty seven

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.540 
into the jet stream and twenty seven
thousand<00:04:55.030> feet<00:04:55.330> I<00:04:55.890> could<00:04:56.890> have<00:04:57.070> gone<00:04:57.190> to<00:04:57.520> a

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
thousand feet I could have gone to a

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.870 
thousand feet I could have gone to a
twenty<00:04:58.000> nine<00:04:58.210> perhaps<00:04:58.720> but<00:04:59.490> if<00:05:00.490> you're<00:05:00.670> flying

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
twenty nine perhaps but if you're flying

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.600 
twenty nine perhaps but if you're flying
east<00:05:01.120> you<00:05:01.630> have<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:01.930> fly<00:05:02.140> it<00:05:02.200> odd<00:05:02.610> allergies

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
east you have to fly it odd allergies

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.630 
east you have to fly it odd allergies
like<00:05:04.240> West<00:05:04.510> you're<00:05:04.690> flying<00:05:04.930> good<00:05:05.050> evening<00:05:05.640> so

we got two twenty seven thousand feet
and<00:05:09.600> we<00:05:10.600> had<00:05:10.840> a<00:05:10.870> ground<00:05:11.169> speed<00:05:11.440> of<00:05:13.530> 350<00:05:14.530> knots

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
and we had a ground speed of 350 knots

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.080 
and we had a ground speed of 350 knots
which<00:05:17.140> is<00:05:17.320> it<00:05:17.470> which<00:05:18.070> is<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.490> equipment<00:05:19.000> of

further up saying what's that guy flying

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.240 
further up saying what's that guy flying
at<00:05:51.810> c70

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
at c70

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.360 
at c70
and<00:05:54.270> control<00:05:55.270> came<00:05:55.540> back<00:05:55.810> and<00:05:56.020> said<00:05:56.280> it's<00:05:57.280> a

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
and control came back and said it's a

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.540 
and control came back and said it's a
single-engine<00:05:57.970> learning<00:05:58.470> my<00:05:59.470> claim<00:05:59.800> I<00:06:00.040> don't

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
single-engine learning my claim I don't

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.720 
single-engine learning my claim I don't
believe<00:06:00.910> it<00:06:01.500> and<00:06:02.500> it<00:06:02.890> would<00:06:03.130> be<00:06:03.280> hard<00:06:03.550> to

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
believe it and it would be hard to

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.820 
believe it and it would be hard to
believe<00:06:04.540> that<00:06:04.900> a<00:06:05.050> single-engine<00:06:05.650> aircraft

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
believe that a single-engine aircraft

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.640 
believe that a single-engine aircraft
could<00:06:06.400> be<00:06:06.580> flying<00:06:06.820> at<00:06:07.560> 610<00:06:09.000> km/h<00:06:10.000> grounds<00:06:10.650> it

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
could be flying at 610 km/h grounds it

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.370 
could be flying at 610 km/h grounds it
was<00:06:11.770> a<00:06:11.800> fascinating<00:06:12.160> trip<00:06:12.850> and<00:06:13.120> I<00:06:14.020> will<00:06:14.230> never

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
was a fascinating trip and I will never

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.140 
was a fascinating trip and I will never
forget<00:06:14.770> the<00:06:17.550> what<00:06:18.550> what<00:06:18.850> we<00:06:19.000> did

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
forget the what what we did

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.050 
forget the what what we did
unfortunately<00:06:19.300> I<00:06:20.260> hadn't<00:06:21.330> filed<00:06:22.330> for<00:06:22.930> for<00:06:23.710> a

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
unfortunately I hadn't filed for for a

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.300 
unfortunately I hadn't filed for for a
speeding<00:06:25.060> speed<00:06:25.330> record<00:06:25.720> because<00:06:26.020> that<00:06:26.320> that

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
speeding speed record because that that

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.770 
speeding speed record because that that
takes<00:06:27.580> about<00:06:27.700> a<00:06:27.820> month<00:06:28.030> any<00:06:28.270> now<00:06:28.450> it<00:06:28.510> was<00:06:28.660> their

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
takes about a month any now it was their

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.810 
takes about a month any now it was their
first<00:06:28.960> flight<00:06:29.320> in<00:06:29.680> this<00:06:29.950> brand-new<00:06:30.460> were

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
first flight in this brand-new were

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.710 
first flight in this brand-new were
Burnie<00:06:31.060> and

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
Burnie and

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.280 
Burnie and
so<00:06:33.620> I<00:06:33.650> didn't<00:06:34.010> worry<00:06:34.160> about<00:06:34.250> it<00:06:34.550> but<00:06:35.450> I<00:06:35.750> think

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.290 
so I didn't worry about it but I think

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.250 
so I didn't worry about it but I think
in<00:06:36.590> my<00:06:36.740> logbook<00:06:37.010> I<00:06:37.700> have<00:06:38.390> the<00:06:38.600> unofficial

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
in my logbook I have the unofficial

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.510 
in my logbook I have the unofficial
record<00:06:39.800> of<00:06:40.510> six<00:06:41.510> and<00:06:41.870> a<00:06:42.110> half<00:06:42.140> hours<00:06:42.740> gender

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
record of six and a half hours gender

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.410 
record of six and a half hours gender
got<00:06:43.700> the<00:06:43.820> beats<00:06:44.030> there<00:06:44.410> Thanks
