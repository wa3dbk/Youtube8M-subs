00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 good evening to all guys good evening a 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.350
 all the denim before tokyo is today 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.839
 let's talk about you tube e 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.420
 details of a youtuber or beautiful 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.780
 cool swag I'll tell you why in an analysis 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.610
 In my opinion, serious is a talent in 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.560
 youtube ici terms and deserves success 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.570
 which has interior views and subscribers 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.710
 I will try to be objective despite 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.960
 is a video anyway enough 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.029
 staff where I still express my own 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.689
 taste here I personally follow him 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.269
 from the beginning and as you well know the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.610
 single we say it made known 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.410
 to the public it was I jerk off 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.660
 I make you a saw that was finished too 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.030
 in the say in the catalog the 10 po 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.980
 little more squalid pieces of the canal than 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.290
 jason reder even if the same jason 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.149
 reder was reluctant to want it 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.770
 insert in the list because precisely not 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.610
 it is clearly a true e 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.219
 own hip hop piece so let's say that 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.530
 the greatest merit in my opinion of beautiful 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.210
 nice figos web that at the time was 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.980
 he called gucci boy was right 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.050
 that of evolution there is a 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.190
 character that while maintaining certain 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.619
 features 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.450
 we say stable throughout his 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.900
 youtube career the cases is however 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.670
 renovated has been renewed for the better 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.380
 I tell you this because of singers 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.909
 so let's say genre trash if we want 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.040
 there have been many in the course of the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.740
 years remember I do n't know guests coming out 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.390
 baldazzi torches or black theme in fact 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.330
 let's remember legends with his 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.830
 summer that just a few years ago he did 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.890
 great success 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.189
 however none of these characters is 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.920
 lasted for a long time while nice cool 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.869
 let's say it's lasting on the scene from da 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.880
 a lot and if its success seems 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.310
 intended at least not to end soon and 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.590
 indeed it is in a growing phase 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.210
 this because in any case it has been renewed 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.509
 under certain themes here is passed by 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.600
 chairs to the figs and therefore already this one 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.540
 puts up a plan on the next level 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.770
 also one of the keys in my opinion 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.600
 the main ones of his success are i 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.780
 terms here are the terms you use in 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.780
 songs like the example I'm happy it 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.729
 I swear he is a fucking child and so on 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.629
 figure ambush all of this's things 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.620
 this type are all choices in my opinion 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.840
 very nice terminology 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.790
 well accurate therefore they are not 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.720
 absolutely fruit of the case 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.519
 I think it's a very smart person 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.580
 present of people who understood that to 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.989
 public likes a certain type of 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.030
 stuff on the songs and some kind of 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.450
 texts then seen success 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.069
 initial perfected and expanded 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.930
 the use of these particular terms 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.780
 let's say the beautiful fi that if so to speak 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.470
 which surely is a strong point of the 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.599
 his songs 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.790
 regarding the quality of the videos 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.160
 this certainly improved over the course 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.859
 of time and also from the point of view of 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.349
 flow has made some first steps into 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:53.379
 forward even if of course his own 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.329
 flow so particular and so far 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.909
 light years from any form of rap is 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.549
 certainly a particular thing that it 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.530
 makes it unique is also the 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.170
 made to choose known bases of 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.549
 famous songs modify them readjust them 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.840
 with these texts we say so 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.650
 details 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.420
 I think it's the winning recipe 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.630
 precisely in his style 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.560
 as for the style also 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.079
 in the look 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.750
 let's say it has evolved over time it has 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.940
 improved and the central fact that is 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.250
 slap we talk about the concept of its covers 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.379
 look at this hat at his ex ma 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.690
 also wanting this pen can be 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:35.560
 his and here is what swag is all about 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.989
 and nothing there are different opinions on 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.449
 meaning of its term ep in 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.400
 internet but despite there are precisely 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:44.440
 different acronyms 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.720
 in reality there is no univocal meaning 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.489
 of the term on the web that can be 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.349
 and anything about this will 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.209
 I recommend a video of the power rangers 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.410
 where they explain their concept of zune 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.760
 quite funny video then 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.980
 introducing this concept that in 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.419
 america has existed for a few years and it is 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.510
 tied to a certain type of style also 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:06.430
 in dress and in music in Italy it was 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.879
 practically unknown before 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.440
 of the arrival of nice cool v so it goes 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.389
 recognized to this character the 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.859
 great merit as he says neither 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.169
 some songs to have brought the suap 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:20.200
 in Italy it is certainly not his American e 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.740
 a very different swag under certain ones 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.370
 more humorous aspects if we want 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.960
 but the merit of nice cool buy in this 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.630
 meaning there is everything 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.880
 beyond this the collaborations he has 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.259
 had for example the interview with pre 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.919
 were from the point of view of 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:40.800
 marketing of the say of the choices 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.840
 ingenious that still did not arrive 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.130
 have come to say from the public 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.669
 and the public that wanted this 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.150
 meeting 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.849
 then the public over time 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.840
 the reasons have been increased 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.280
 I told you 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.000
 and in my opinion from the point of view of 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.409
 youtube talent ico nice cool deserves 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.110
 both views and subscribers 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:02.490
 which has the only one flaw in my opinion 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.720
 in his channel lately that he is 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.669
 putting gameplay on me 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.400
 personally do not like them but here is a 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:12.419
 my personal taste of course for the 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.099
 rest I can tell you that doing nice cool 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:18.030
 currently even of the evenings has 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:19.740
 surely we say enlarged what 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.810
 its his circle we say so of 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.280
 of fans following here I don't think so 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.870
 will never come to television but not 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.949
 think the interest for the rest for 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.830
 youtube which is exactly as I always say 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:33.659
 a platform where fun 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.570
 so let's say entertainment 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:39.449
 laughter is therefore a fundamental thing 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.310
 if a video amuses a video like it is 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.530
 just have visualizations 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.650
 executed and in my opinion real cool swipe 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.180
 amuses and therefore it is right that he has the 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.740
 success that it has even not being 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.699
 a good singer a good rapper 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.400
 etc 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.810
 this is my personal opinion 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.340
 you know what a critic we also say a little 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.250
 the world of youtube so I wanted to say 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.469
 mine on this character that does 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.060
 very split youtube jana opinion 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:05.520
 I must say I am on the side of those who have 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.360
 absolutely pro is in favor of beautiful 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.009
 his cool with this I greet you and you 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.969
 I wish a good evening and on agate 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:13.969
 always good
