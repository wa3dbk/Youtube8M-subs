00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.160
 usually at this time of the year already there 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.309
 July 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.790
 we would have the great part of Brazil 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.560
 under the most intense influence of a 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.920
 mass of dry air that would 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.150
 very much, do not you? 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.699
 cloudiness 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.490
 so what we usually have in 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.310
 July at this time is the predominance of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.640
 high pressure system on the interior 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.280
 of Brazil that causes the subsistence of 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.230
 air then hinders the formation 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.550
 development of clouds and clear 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.829
 rainfall 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.290
 Of course we have cold fronts in July. 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.390
 but usually the system of high 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.239
 pressure that predominates on the interior 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.670
 from brazil ends up hindering training 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.670
 of all this cloudiness that we see 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.280
 here we have at that moment and if 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.190
 dug here is centered over bolivia 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.559
 and then we look at the satellite images 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.600
 here in brazil we will see all this 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.450
 cloudiness that is over the region 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.369
 west of the country what will happen 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.659
 with this lock that will happen with 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.350
 this cloudiness 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.290
 the idea is that this cloudiness will 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.030
 shifting and if it is dug it will 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.890
 moving east 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:26.460
 it goes on over the region to center 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.729
 west of the country he crosses the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.119
 south center of the country to go to the ocean 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:38.130
 only that this here this movement is going 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:41.040
 take at least there for more than 24 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.729
 maybe 48 hours to complete 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.360
 so this one that is not here today 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.960
 still advancing on Bolivia should only 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.200
 really get to the ocean 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.360
 It's not during Thursday then we 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.750
 let's look at all this instability 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.140
 still for almost 48 hours on top of 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.140
 Brazil
