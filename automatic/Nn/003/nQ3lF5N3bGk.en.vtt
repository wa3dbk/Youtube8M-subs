00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.160
 a greeting to all the queue friends 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.080
 android puntonet we are with acer liquid 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.360
 75 100 the last smartphone of the range 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.710
 lower middle of the Taiwanese house yes 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.819
 it is an evolution of the model that 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.970
 we had already seen in barcelona lo z 2 

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:25.380
 you can 3 presented to tell a 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.369
 February for the mobile world 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.169
 congress 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.779
 this is always an evolution of the 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:33.320
 z series because it maintains the same lines 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.900
 so we have this guide 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.420
 top with the speaker below that 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.520
 it is then repeated also in the part 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.730
 lower we have this for note 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.640
 frame with the speaker between 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.950
 the glass of the plastic of the frame 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.460
 itself 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.380
 we therefore have a frontal stereo sound 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.480
 so as htc one though 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.980
 clearly the quality and power are 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.320
 a little different also because in these 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.040
 houses for themselves amounting to only 149 euros so 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.810
 definitely decidedly content 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.680
 then here on the front over the screen 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.960
 5-inch with HD resolution so 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.180
 1280 x 720 points we have 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.950
 notifications led to the camera 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.680
 2 megapixel front panel 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.080
 then talking instead of the sides 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.740
 we have the barbell on the right side 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.810
 of the volume on the upper side we have the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.200
 power off button and the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.369
 3.5mm headphone jack on the side 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.740
 lower we have the micro usb port 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.840
 while instead on the right side of the 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.610
 left forgive me we have nothing 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.090
 later we have one instead 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.009
 8 megapixel camera with LED flash 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.320
 here is the microphone for removal 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.509
 of the background noise and 15 we have a 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.800
 multifunction button that can be 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.860
 programmed within the system 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.780
 exactly as it was on 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.010
 acer liquid carrying 2 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.170
 let's go to the settings here 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.840
 how about jade liquids we can 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.599
 to have 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.060
 the quick settings above that 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.530
 then they expand through this little arrow 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.420
 and they show us all the others 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.780
 settings among other things is possible to 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.900
 example to move them 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.370
 ok in theory yes ok 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.760
 we can do it is up to the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.760
 second 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.730
 ok it doesn't work or better we can't 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.080
 make it work but then the problem and 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.600
 it will work too but we keep it anyway 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.310
 what counts is the fact that this is a version 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.600
 still demos for which there are still some 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.750
 of 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.140
 edges to smooth ok I'm sorry I have 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.240
 open google napoli has nothing to do 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.650
 as you can see the screen is very sensitive 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:53.630
 but apart from that we have android 4.4.2 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.630
 kitkat as you can see 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.790
 and therefore we have if we count the various 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.489
 functionality 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.210
 20 kat kit ie the screen of 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:07.060
 customization to customize 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.890
 own phone there are various widgets 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.250
 wallpaper and so on 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.050
 what to say then using as well as 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.120
 see the transition from an application 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.620
 at the other from one screen to another is 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.640
 a little slow put us inside the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.070
 same application for example 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.280
 within their light as a network 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.000
 that is a good speed and a good one 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.840
 reactivity 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.760
 even here in the drawer 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.280
 exhibit behaves quite well 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.620
 so the experiences all over everything 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.629
 added satisfactory this is allowed 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:42.450
 from a quad core processor is a 1300 mt 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:45.540
 1582 for which quad core 1.3 giger 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.980
 sportex to 7 so a processor of 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.930
 low end 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.849
 we'll be back together a gigabyte of ram e 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.000
 4gb of ram expandable with microsd 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.129
 presence was probably the need to open the back 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.960
 cover to be able to insert it for which to 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:01.790
 moment we can't do that 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.260
 otherwise we have if it contains 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.720
 classic additional functions spring the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.850
 fm radio the bluetooth wifi and so on 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.200
 in short, a device on the whole 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.790
 complete a price with a content 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.459
 for these few minutes we have 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.960
 I had the opportunity to prove it, I'd say yes 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:26.110
 it's a smartphone that you can 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.600
 meet the needs of many users 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.300
 who need to 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.270
 a device that performs operations 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.460
 quite basic but still not not 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.110
 we doubt he is able to give away 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.630
 satisfactions that active at some 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.970
 little thing and more for the moment I would say that 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.820
 we conclude our video here 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.240
 preview by riccardo because android with 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.240
 talent
