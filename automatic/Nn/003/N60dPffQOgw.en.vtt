00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 throughout this time that we have 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.370
 been planning the hand of the big day 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.649
 He has given me that one of the topics 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.510
 What generates the most doubts to brides is 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.969
 the one related to the wedding ladies 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.040
 Hi, I'm Mara Jose and if you're about to choose 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.289
 ladies wedding detente and better 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.289
 before you take note of these four mistakes 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.340
 um 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.110
 recapitulating the ranges are those 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.210
 women who chooses the bride so that 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.040
 they are part of the procession at the ceremony 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.650
 of the voice however you can be 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.470
 sure that if this choice is not made 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.780
 correctly you alone will generate you 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.210
 some headaches that will make more 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.550
 difficult and stressful organization of 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.530
 the wedding so the best way that 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.420
 flee from them is knowing the and 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.140
 taking them on the radar so that then 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.559
 do not say I did not warn you 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.589
 number 1 choose one or several ladies of the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.780
 wedding by engagement the wedding mom 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.479
 they have to be women nearby and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.700
 loved by the bride and especially in 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.979
 those that you trust is very normal that during 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.370
 the wedding organization the brides 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.350
 feel pressured by the typical look 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.360
 who made her also her wedding and with whom 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.549
 maybe there is not a relationship anymore 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.260
 significant the accompanied by work 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.930
 that is helping him in some things of 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.760
 the wedding the sister-in-law cousin who for believing 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.890
 that there is a family relationship is the 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.590
 ideal candidate to make the lady of the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.130
 wedding bride the decision and the choice is 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.289
 only yours 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.390
 and there I include your mother your mother-in-law and 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.850
 until the boyfriend the best advice you 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.920
 I can give is that if you are not born or 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.490
 you had not even thought about her or her 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.799
 the best thing is to say no in time that is 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.689
 suffering or regretting you because 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.110
 you had to leave an important friend 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.860
 out of courtship you do not believe error number 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.350
 two 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.170
 choose too many wedding ladies a 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.600
 huge wedding procession of very bad 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.520
 taste since you completely lose your 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.950
 meaning if not purpose and also 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.080
 eternal return the entrance of the 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.789
 ceremony the ladies of the wedding have a 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.799
 role that is to represent the 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.290
 elements of the mass ie the 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.450
 rings the claws the tie and the bouquet of 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.840
 the virgin there can choose 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.930
 four one for each element or maximum 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.239
 maximum eight two for each element to 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.700
 that enter in pairs in addition another reason 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.099
 to not abuse the number is that for 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.920
 it will be much easier to deal with or 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.110
 control a few that many over 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.420
 everything when they begin to emerge 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.110
 opinions or differences that always 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.370
 dan 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.320
 Think about it, mistake number 3 does not have a 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.270
 filter if you're from women who have 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.670
 many friends and you are in the 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.160
 crossroads of not knowing who to choose 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.890
 I recommend you make a list with the 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.930
 candidate and put their qualities and 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.120
 defects as I already presented it to you in the 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.700
 videoblog the 10 commandments to make 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.470
 the perfect wedding lady being chosen 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.570
 as a lady besides being an honor 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.570
 involves several tasks responsibilities 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.520
 and therefore commitment therefore you 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.470
 I advise that to choose the ladies of 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.380
 the wedding you do thinking about your 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.959
 capacities in their availability and in 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.209
 their personalities so that afterwards not 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.580
 you regret it and if you are already overwhelmed 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.440
 for leaving some outside the courtship for 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.290
 for example they can read readings in the 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.800
 Mass or if the requests number error 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.840
 4 insist I understand that you die of 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.030
 you want X woman to be part of the 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.270
 ladies of the wedding but if you feel that you 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.640
 elusive gives you long or indirect does not 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.460
 insist because it is accepted by feeling 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.430
 committed or no loophole 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.770
 everything will be counterproductive for you and 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.050
 that they will only be doing courage if 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.870
 he does not want because he did not want his reasons 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.150
 will have already as my dad says to force 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.190
 nor the center shoes as you can 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.800
 account for a good choice of 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.320
 Wedding ladies goes beyond the type or 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.150
 color of dress that will look good 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.400
 not without first remembering that if you 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.230
 I would like you to personally accompany you 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.630
