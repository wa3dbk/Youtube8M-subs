00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.299
 it seemed they never had to do it 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.120
 however this is one of the series cars 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.670
 more like a prototype you see here 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.610
 to play geneva mercedes cl a shooting 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.690
 brake there is a strange low station wagon 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:24.119
 small sport with you see a 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.939
 very small hatchback 495 liters like 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.039
 minimum capacity in the trunk is a 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.000
 very particular object does not have 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.920
 competitors 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.260
 if you want you can also have it with 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:41.690
 sports engine of the cna 45 ange 360 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:46.610
 horses or the various diesel 200 220 cdi 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.610
 and now I'll show you the line a little 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.559
 sideways you see is the part where you are 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.600
 understands more that this is a machine 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.350
 a little different than a usual station 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.260
 wagon coupÃ© people a bit glass coupe 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.940
 without frames don't make too much case ai 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.159
 orange details because this is one 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.200
 Special launch series let's see how there 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.880
 it is going up 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.939
 it's a little uncomfortable for me as well 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.390
 a 75- year-old pull the average is behind 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.409
 ok some sacrifices are made to have a 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.409
 aesthetic as well 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.770
 inside it does not change very rightly 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.510
 compared to the class ae to the cell to 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.100
 which derives glasses without frame also here 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.200
 obviously I share the same platform and 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.510
 so front-wheel drive also look 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.810
 like the look of the front 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.330
 just over 31.300 euro prices let me 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.670
 know if you would buy one 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.300
 car so a little special 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.300
 I'm curious
