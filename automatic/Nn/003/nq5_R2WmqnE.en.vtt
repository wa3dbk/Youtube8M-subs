00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
drone now it was difficult because these

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.400 
drone now it was difficult because these
guys<00:00:20.699> didn't<00:00:21.150> set<00:00:21.390> out<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.570> test<00:00:21.900> out<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> spy

guys didn't set out to test out the spy

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.659 
guys didn't set out to test out the spy
drone<00:00:22.679> which<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.009> what<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.339> would<00:00:23.550> have<00:00:23.609> done

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:23.669 
drone which is what we would have done

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.939 
drone which is what we would have done
if<00:00:23.820> we're<00:00:24.179> at<00:00:24.300> Gamescom<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.230> we<00:00:25.529> are<00:00:25.679> taking

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
if we're at Gamescom so we are taking

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.189 
if we're at Gamescom so we are taking
snippets<00:00:26.580> from<00:00:26.699> their<00:00:26.880> gameplay<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.599> were

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
snippets from their gameplay that were

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.900 
snippets from their gameplay that were
the<00:00:28.320> only<00:00:28.349> times<00:00:28.919> that<00:00:29.099> they<00:00:29.279> actually<00:00:29.609> used

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
the only times that they actually used

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.220 
the only times that they actually used
it<00:00:30.089> and<00:00:30.179> we're<00:00:30.329> trying<00:00:30.419> to<00:00:30.599> analyze<00:00:30.929> as<00:00:31.079> much

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
it and we're trying to analyze as much

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.960 
it and we're trying to analyze as much
as<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.499> can<00:00:31.650> from<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.919> clips<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.400> see<00:00:32.640> so

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
as we can from the clips that we see so

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.340 
as we can from the clips that we see so
what<00:00:33.210> we've<00:00:33.300> seen<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.540> far<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.050> we've

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
what we've seen so far is that we've

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.590 
what we've seen so far is that we've
done<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.980> lot<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.130> skewered<00:00:35.550> medals<00:00:35.880> it's

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
done a lot of skewered medals it's

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.330 
done a lot of skewered medals it's
scaring<00:00:36.960> us<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.170> bit<00:00:37.350> as<00:00:37.500> bankers<00:00:37.920> because<00:00:38.220> we

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
scaring us a bit as bankers because we

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.730 
scaring us a bit as bankers because we
know<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.490> skewered<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.060> a<00:00:39.090> ballistic<00:00:39.960> trait

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
know that skewered is a ballistic trait

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.530 
know that skewered is a ballistic trait
and<00:00:41.010> they<00:00:41.370> do<00:00:41.430> not<00:00:41.670> bank<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.120> as<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.390> see

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
and they do not bank so as you can see

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.820 
and they do not bank so as you can see
in<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.750> clip<00:00:42.990> there<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.320> we'll<00:00:43.440> slow<00:00:43.620> these

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
in that clip there and we'll slow these

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.920 
in that clip there and we'll slow these
down<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.250> second<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:45.330> it's<00:00:45.480> sticking<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
down in a second that it's sticking to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.110 
down in a second that it's sticking to
the<00:00:46.020> floor<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.980> fact<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.520> spiky

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
the floor and the fact that it's a spiky

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.970 
the floor and the fact that it's a spiky
ball<00:00:48.150> and<00:00:48.720> you<00:00:48.960> wouldn't<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:49.350> expect<00:00:49.440> it

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
ball and you wouldn't really expect it

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.100 
ball and you wouldn't really expect it
to<00:00:50.070> bank<00:00:50.280> shot<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.330> we're<00:00:51.540> actually<00:00:51.750> really

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
to bank shot so we're actually really

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.780 
to bank shot so we're actually really
worried<00:00:52.560> about<00:00:52.650> this<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.340> how<00:00:53.490> it's<00:00:53.640> going<00:00:53.760> to

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
worried about this and how it's going to

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.130 
worried about this and how it's going to
affect<00:00:53.880> our<00:00:54.150> Channel<00:00:54.540> and<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.720> banking

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
affect our Channel and the banking

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.720 
affect our Channel and the banking
community<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:56.130> other<00:00:56.250> thing<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.610> these

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
community the other thing with these

community the other thing with these
game<00:00:56.970> players<00:00:57.240> is<00:00:57.450> we<00:00:57.600> don't<00:00:57.840> actually<00:00:57.990> get<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
game players is we don't actually get to

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.810 
game players is we don't actually get to
see<00:00:58.500> their<00:00:58.650> class<00:00:58.890> setup<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.400> we<00:00:59.520> don't<00:00:59.700> know

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
see their class setup so we don't know

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.760 
see their class setup so we don't know
what<00:01:00.000> perks<00:01:00.270> are<00:01:00.510> using<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.260> know<00:01:01.380> that<00:01:01.560> fast

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
what perks are using we know that fast

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.740 
what perks are using we know that fast
hands<00:01:02.070> exists<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.700> game<00:01:02.880> and<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.570> that

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
hands exists in the game and that that

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.190 
hands exists in the game and that that
it<00:01:03.960> might<00:01:04.290> affect<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.640> speed<00:01:06.090> or<00:01:06.420> distance<00:01:06.750> of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
it might affect the speed or distance of

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.590 
it might affect the speed or distance of
the<00:01:07.560> throwing<00:01:08.430> weapon<00:01:08.910> which<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.390> spy

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the throwing weapon which is the spy

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.600 
the throwing weapon which is the spy
drone<00:01:09.870> so<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.980> just<00:01:11.190> aren't<00:01:11.340> sure

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
drone so we just we just aren't sure

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.010 
drone so we just we just aren't sure
though<00:01:11.820> because<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.120> we<00:01:12.480> didn't<00:01:12.690> get<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.900> see

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
though because we we didn't get to see

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.630 
though because we we didn't get to see
if<00:01:13.110> they've<00:01:13.260> actually<00:01:13.440> got<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.040> also<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
if they've actually got that on also the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.460 
if they've actually got that on also the
height<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.150> hitbox<00:01:15.480> of<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:15.990> spy<00:01:16.260> drone

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
height and the hitbox of the spy drone

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.100 
height and the hitbox of the spy drone
is<00:01:16.590> very<00:01:16.980> very<00:01:17.220> weird<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.300> basically<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:19.050> a

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
is very very weird so basically it's a

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.140 
is very very weird so basically it's a
very<00:01:19.320> powerful<00:01:19.560> boost<00:01:20.130> as<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.550> launcher

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
very powerful boost as it's a launcher

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.110 
very powerful boost as it's a launcher
so<00:01:21.659> we've<00:01:21.900> noticed<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:23.159> comes<00:01:23.790> out<00:01:23.909> sort

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
so we've noticed that it comes out sort

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.550 
so we've noticed that it comes out sort
of<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.240> head<00:01:24.450> height<00:01:24.659> with<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
of a head height with the with the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.990 
of a head height with the with the
enemies<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.190> weren't<00:01:26.310> actually<00:01:26.550> in<00:01:26.850> this

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
enemies so you weren't actually in this

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.640 
enemies so you weren't actually in this
clip<00:01:27.240> here<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.480> can<00:01:27.600> see<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.230> don't<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
gameplay I'm not sure if it's this one

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.890 
gameplay I'm not sure if it's this one
or<00:01:47.549> later<00:01:47.729> down<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.030> track<00:01:48.120> but<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.510> can<00:01:48.720> have

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
or later down the track but you can have

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.110 
or later down the track but you can have
to<00:01:49.229> spike<00:01:49.770> drones<00:01:50.070> on<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.580> at<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.729> same<00:01:50.790> time

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
to spike drones on you at the same time

another<00:01:51.780> thing<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.229> want<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:52.500> look<00:01:52.590> at<00:01:52.740> is

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
another thing that we want to look at is

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.260 
another thing that we want to look at is
the<00:01:53.190> distance<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.790> these<00:01:53.940> things<00:01:54.090> actually

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the distance that these things actually

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.350 
the distance that these things actually
travel<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:54.990> again<00:01:55.260> perks<00:01:56.130> may<00:01:56.880> affect<00:01:57.210> this

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
travel and again perks may affect this

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.090 
travel and again perks may affect this
like<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> did<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.020> ghosts<00:01:58.290> with<00:01:58.470> strong<00:01:58.740> arm<00:01:58.920> I

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
like it did in ghosts with strong arm I

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.560 
like it did in ghosts with strong arm I
haven't<00:01:59.430> seen<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> strong<00:02:00.030> arm<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.240> there<00:02:00.450> may

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
haven't seen a strong arm but there may

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.930 
haven't seen a strong arm but there may
be<00:02:00.600> an<00:02:00.750> equivalent<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.490> setups

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
be an equivalent in the in the setups

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.700 
be an equivalent in the in the setups
but<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.360> see<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.510> these<00:02:03.750> travel<00:02:04.500> quite

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
but you can see that these travel quite

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.260 
but you can see that these travel quite
a<00:02:04.770> fair<00:02:05.040> distance<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.580> they<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> really

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
a fair distance and they have a really

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.419 
a fair distance and they have a really
interesting<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.930> unique<00:02:07.080> loop<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:08.129> them<00:02:08.279> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
interesting and unique loop to them and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.399 
interesting and unique loop to them and
they<00:02:08.489> swivel<00:02:08.909> and<00:02:09.239> they<00:02:09.659> sort<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:09.959> turn<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.319> the

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:10.409 
they swivel and they sort of turn in the

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.780 
they swivel and they sort of turn in the
air<00:02:10.529> it's<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.799> bit<00:02:10.979> like<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.279> combat<00:02:11.579> axe<00:02:11.730> to

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
air it's a bit like the combat axe to

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.489 
air it's a bit like the combat axe to
the<00:02:11.849> tomahawk<00:02:12.239> but<00:02:12.389> a<00:02:12.420> very<00:02:13.049> different<00:02:13.409> at<00:02:13.469> the

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:13.499 
the tomahawk but a very different at the

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:13.880 
the tomahawk but a very different at the
same<00:02:13.680> time

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
same time

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.070 
same time
we're<00:02:14.370> being<00:02:14.550> very<00:02:14.910> opportunistic<00:02:15.569> when<00:02:15.960> we

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
we're being very opportunistic when we

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.520 
we're being very opportunistic when we
think<00:02:16.380> or<00:02:16.620> positive<00:02:17.280> when<00:02:17.520> we<00:02:17.640> think<00:02:17.880> that

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
think or positive when we think that

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.960 
think or positive when we think that
when<00:02:19.530> these<00:02:19.709> come<00:02:19.920> out<00:02:20.100> we're<00:02:20.310> hoping<00:02:20.790> that

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
when these come out we're hoping that

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.309 
when these come out we're hoping that
they're<00:02:21.120> possibly<00:02:21.330> going<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.840> be<00:02:21.959> like<00:02:22.110> a

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
they're possibly going to be like a

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.960 
they're possibly going to be like a
grenade<00:02:22.590> launcher<00:02:23.130> in<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.310> past<00:02:23.520> where<00:02:23.790> if

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
grenade launcher in the past where if

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.180 
grenade launcher in the past where if
you<00:02:24.180> bank<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.930> straight<00:02:25.230> into<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> wall<00:02:25.860> it's

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
you bank it straight into a wall it's

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.150 
you bank it straight into a wall it's
gonna<00:02:26.459> be<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:27.569> null<00:02:28.080> for<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.560> period<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.950> time

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
gonna be a null for a period of time

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.250 
gonna be a null for a period of time
where<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.459> can<00:02:29.580> actually<00:02:29.700> bank<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.480> before<00:02:31.140> it

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
where you can actually bank it before it

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.170 
where you can actually bank it before it
becomes<00:02:31.500> spiky<00:02:32.070> but<00:02:32.430> as<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.700> see<00:02:32.910> when<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
becomes spiky but as you see when the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.670 
becomes spiky but as you see when the
launcher<00:02:33.480> actually<00:02:33.750> shoots<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.170> out<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.410> comes

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
launcher actually shoots it out it comes

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.140 
launcher actually shoots it out it comes
out<00:02:34.860> directly<00:02:35.190> spikey<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.760> doesn't<00:02:36.000> come<00:02:36.120> out

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
out directly spikey it doesn't come out

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.180 
out directly spikey it doesn't come out
as<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> sphere<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:37.050> then<00:02:37.260> pop<00:02:37.560> out<00:02:37.740> with<00:02:37.860> spikes

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
as a sphere and then pop out with spikes

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.310 
as a sphere and then pop out with spikes
which<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.330> what<00:02:39.540> we<00:02:39.630> noticed<00:02:39.900> when<00:02:40.020> we<00:02:40.050> slowed

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
which is what we noticed when we slowed

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.780 
which is what we noticed when we slowed
some<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.590> these<00:02:40.650> clips<00:02:40.920> down<00:02:41.160> also<00:02:41.640> they've

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
some of these clips down also they've

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.250 
some of these clips down also they've
got<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> really<00:02:42.209> nice<00:02:42.390> stream<00:02:42.780> behind<00:02:42.959> them

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
got a really nice stream behind them

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.809 
got a really nice stream behind them
which<00:02:43.410> was<00:02:43.590> really<00:02:43.800> nice<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.250> see<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:44.610> they

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
which was really nice to see that they

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.100 
which was really nice to see that they
incorporated<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.360> ghosts<00:02:45.540> as<00:02:45.690> well<00:02:45.840> there's<00:02:46.050> a

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
incorporated in ghosts as well there's a

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.530 
incorporated in ghosts as well there's a
really<00:02:46.470> nice<00:02:46.620> stream<00:02:47.010> behind<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.700> object<00:02:48.120> so

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
really nice stream behind the object so

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.479 
really nice stream behind the object so
will<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.620> will<00:02:49.770> be<00:02:49.860> able<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.100> see<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.370> through

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
will you will be able to see it through
