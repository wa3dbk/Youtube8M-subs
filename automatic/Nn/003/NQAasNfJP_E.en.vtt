and since there are on the craft of
there<00:02:08.399> there<00:02:08.610> must<00:02:08.849> be<00:02:09.090> some<00:02:09.690> sort<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.080> factory

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
there there must be some sort of factory

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.729 
there there must be some sort of factory
and<00:02:10.860> an<00:02:11.849> entire<00:02:12.150> civilization<00:02:12.660> somewhere<00:02:13.290> and

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
and an entire civilization somewhere and

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.500 
and an entire civilization somewhere and
if<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.400> fact<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:15.000> true<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.420> it

if in fact that is true and it

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.309 
if in fact that is true and it
apparently<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:16.129> then<00:02:17.129> there<00:02:17.340> must<00:02:17.489> be<00:02:18.230> others

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.750 

actual<00:02:22.319> crafts<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:22.950> technology<00:02:23.519> from

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
actual crafts and technology from

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.619 
actual crafts and technology from
another<00:02:24.060> world<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:26.030> that's<00:02:27.030> probably<00:02:27.330> the

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
another world and that's probably the

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.470 
another world and that's probably the
most<00:02:27.780> important<00:02:28.290> event<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.590> history<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:30.239> kind

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
most important event in history it kind

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.020 
most important event in history it kind
of<00:02:30.569> moved<00:02:30.840> from<00:02:31.019> science<00:02:31.470> fiction<00:02:32.030> into

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
of moved from science fiction into

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.289 
of moved from science fiction into
reality<00:02:33.060> if<00:02:33.959> my<00:02:34.200> mind<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.769> I<00:02:35.310> really<00:02:35.910> just<00:02:35.940> I

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
reality if my mind and I really just I

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.020 
reality if my mind and I really just I
guess<00:02:36.599> opened<00:02:36.750> my<00:02:36.959> eyes<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:38.519> big<00:02:38.700> thing<00:02:38.730> is

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
guess opened my eyes the big thing is

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.920 
guess opened my eyes the big thing is
whether<00:02:39.450> or<00:02:39.690> not<00:02:39.920> we<00:02:40.920> can<00:02:41.130> duplicate<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.730> if<00:02:42.569> we

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
whether or not we can duplicate it if we

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.729 
whether or not we can duplicate it if we
can<00:02:43.079> understand<00:02:44.329> what<00:02:45.329> a<00:02:45.540> device<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.440> or<00:02:46.620> how

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
can understand what a device is or how

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.890 
can understand what a device is or how
something<00:02:47.130> operates<00:02:47.640> or<00:02:48.030> what<00:02:48.390> its<00:02:48.569> physical

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
something operates or what its physical

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.259 
something operates or what its physical
makeup<00:02:49.349> is<00:02:49.739> that's<00:02:50.099> great<00:02:50.459> but<00:02:50.819> if<00:02:50.910> we<00:02:51.030> can't

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
makeup is that's great but if we can't

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.370 
makeup is that's great but if we can't
duplicate<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.840> it's<00:02:52.380> useless<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:53.010> us<00:02:53.299> so

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
duplicate it it's useless to us so

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.559 
duplicate it it's useless to us so
there's<00:02:55.380> really<00:02:55.500> two<00:02:55.829> phases<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.150> project

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
there's really two phases to the project

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.030 
there's really two phases to the project
going<00:02:57.690> on<00:02:57.900> there<00:02:58.140> it's<00:02:58.230> understanding<00:02:58.890> what

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
going on there it's understanding what

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.289 
going on there it's understanding what
we're<00:02:59.160> looking<00:02:59.459> at<00:02:59.579> and<00:02:59.819> then<00:02:59.940> once<00:03:00.150> we

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
we're looking at and then once we

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.259 
we're looking at and then once we
understand<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.140> can<00:03:01.560> we<00:03:02.150> duplicate<00:03:03.150> it

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
understand it is can we duplicate it

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.580 
understand it is can we duplicate it
with<00:03:03.390> earthly<00:03:03.690> materials<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.349> earthly

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
with earthly materials and earthly

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.380 
with earthly materials and earthly
technology<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:05.700> know<00:03:05.819> unless<00:03:06.060> we've<00:03:06.239> got

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
technology and you know unless we've got

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.180 
technology and you know unless we've got
a<00:03:06.420> handle<00:03:06.780> on<00:03:06.900> both<00:03:07.079> of<00:03:07.110> them<00:03:07.440> all<00:03:07.950> that

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
a handle on both of them all that

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.809 
a handle on both of them all that
technology<00:03:08.549> is<00:03:08.819> useless<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.540> us<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.639> if<00:03:11.639> it

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
technology is useless to us and if it

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.460 
technology is useless to us and if it
turns<00:03:11.850> out<00:03:12.120> we<00:03:12.299> can't<00:03:12.510> do<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:12.840> all<00:03:13.049> we<00:03:13.290> have

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
turns out we can't do that all we have

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.759 
turns out we can't do that all we have
is<00:03:13.500> one<00:03:13.859> single<00:03:14.370> prized<00:03:14.880> possession<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:16.620> we

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
is one single prized possession that we

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.750 
is one single prized possession that we
have<00:03:16.889> to<00:03:17.010> take<00:03:17.190> care<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:18.290> that's<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.760> after

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
have to take care of and that's it after

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.879 
have to take care of and that's it after
all<00:03:20.970> that's<00:03:21.269> been<00:03:21.329> said<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.840> done<00:03:22.049> would<00:03:22.769> you

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
all that's been said and done would you

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.740 
all that's been said and done would you
do<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.190> over<00:03:23.459> again<00:03:23.670> what<00:03:24.389> would<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.600> do

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
do this over again what would you do

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.979 
do this over again what would you do
differently<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:25.440> would<00:03:26.030> probably<00:03:27.030> have<00:03:27.569> played

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
differently I would probably have played

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.830 
differently I would probably have played
along<00:03:28.910> for<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:29.940> longer<00:03:30.209> time<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:32.299> would<00:03:33.299> like<00:03:33.329> to

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
along for a longer time I would like to

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.750 
along for a longer time I would like to
have<00:03:33.989> known<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.560> little<00:03:35.130> bit<00:03:35.250> more<00:03:35.400> about<00:03:35.459> the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
have known a little bit more about the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
have known a little bit more about the
technology<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:37.250> probably<00:03:38.250> kept<00:03:38.549> quiet<00:03:38.849> if<00:03:39.599> I

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
technology and probably kept quiet if I

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.879 
technology and probably kept quiet if I
could<00:03:40.019> have<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:42.170> possibly<00:03:43.170> never<00:03:43.440> have<00:03:43.680> said

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
could have and possibly never have said

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:48.650 
could have and possibly never have said
anything<00:03:44.160> yeah<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:46.940> almost<00:03:47.940> wish<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.480> had<00:03:48.599> done

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
anything yeah I almost wish I had done

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.520 
anything yeah I almost wish I had done
that<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.200> know<00:03:49.290> it's<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:50.359> it's<00:03:51.410> really<00:03:52.410> only

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
that you know it's a it's really only

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.240 
that you know it's a it's really only
caused<00:03:52.889> headaches<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.700> problems<00:03:54.180> but<00:03:54.540> I

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
caused headaches and problems but I

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.440 
caused headaches and problems but I
believe<00:03:56.250> if<00:03:56.549> I<00:03:56.700> was<00:03:56.849> given<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.209> opportunity

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
believe if I was given the opportunity

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.569 
believe if I was given the opportunity
again<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.019> go<00:03:58.260> back<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.650> time<00:03:58.799> and<00:03:58.859> redo<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.459> I

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
again to go back in time and redo it I

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.580 
again to go back in time and redo it I
think<00:03:59.639> I<00:04:00.180> pretty<00:04:00.630> much<00:04:00.720> would<00:04:01.079> have<00:04:01.169> just<00:04:01.410> shut

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
think I pretty much would have just shut

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.650 
think I pretty much would have just shut
up<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:01.919> gone<00:04:02.549> along<00:04:02.819> with<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.030> program<00:04:03.150> I

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
up and gone along with the program I

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.740 
up and gone along with the program I
would<00:04:04.260> have<00:04:04.560> much<00:04:04.829> preferred<00:04:05.060> that<00:04:06.060> instead

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
would have much preferred that instead

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.909 
would have much preferred that instead
of<00:04:07.099> the<00:04:08.099> Navy<00:04:08.340> or<00:04:08.760> whoever<00:04:09.419> it<00:04:09.599> was<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:10.319> hand

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
of the Navy or whoever it was that hand

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.610 
of the Navy or whoever it was that hand
picked<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.370> few<00:04:11.579> renegade<00:04:12.480> scientists<00:04:13.470> here

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
picked a few renegade scientists here

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.509 
picked a few renegade scientists here
and<00:04:13.769> there<00:04:13.950> that<00:04:14.759> they<00:04:14.970> turn<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.389> over<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:16.519> some

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
and there that they turn it over to some

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.400 
and there that they turn it over to some

I mean you need a large group of people
in<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.300> large<00:04:40.570> lab<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.229> research<00:04:41.620> what's<00:04:41.949> going

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
in a large lab to research what's going

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.909 
in a large lab to research what's going
on<00:04:42.400> there<00:04:42.729> not<00:04:43.449> a<00:04:43.479> little<00:04:43.780> quiet<00:04:44.199> installation

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
on there not a little quiet installation

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.249 
on there not a little quiet installation
it's<00:04:45.039> the<00:04:45.250> it's<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.840> security<00:04:46.840> itself<00:04:48.060> that

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
it's the it's the security itself that

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.450 
it's the it's the security itself that
prevents<00:04:50.259> them<00:04:50.289> from<00:04:50.440> getting<00:04:50.740> anywhere<00:04:51.220> I

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
prevents them from getting anywhere I

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.640 
prevents them from getting anywhere I
mean<00:04:51.850> it<00:04:52.000> they<00:04:52.479> never<00:04:52.720> do<00:04:52.930> work<00:04:53.169> hand<00:04:53.440> in<00:04:53.590> hand

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
mean it they never do work hand in hand

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.379 
mean it they never do work hand in hand
you<00:04:54.100> can't<00:04:54.340> have<00:04:54.550> a<00:04:54.580> military<00:04:55.270> mind<00:04:57.389> science

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
you can't have a military mind science

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.189 
you can't have a military mind science

itself must communicate you have to have

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.920 
itself must communicate you have to have
a<00:05:02.490> free<00:05:03.490> exchange<00:05:03.729> of<00:05:04.030> ideas<00:05:04.210> that's<00:05:04.750> how

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
a free exchange of ideas that's how

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.110 
a free exchange of ideas that's how
things<00:05:05.169> progress<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:06.010> when<00:05:06.370> you<00:05:06.550> clamp<00:05:06.880> down

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
things progress and when you clamp down

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.800 
things progress and when you clamp down
on<00:05:07.800> a<00:05:08.800> security<00:05:09.639> system<00:05:09.850> like<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:10.479> where<00:05:10.720> you

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
on a security system like that where you

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.540 
on a security system like that where you
work<00:05:12.240> in<00:05:13.240> isolated<00:05:13.870> groups<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:14.440> ideas<00:05:15.310> cannot

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
work in isolated groups and ideas cannot

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.490 
work in isolated groups and ideas cannot
be<00:05:15.729> exchanged<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:16.570> don't<00:05:16.780> get<00:05:16.930> anywhere<00:05:17.169> and

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
be exchanged you don't get anywhere and

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.860 
be exchanged you don't get anywhere and
that's<00:05:17.590> that's<00:05:17.889> the<00:05:18.099> problem<00:05:18.310> they<00:05:18.550> have<00:05:18.870> what

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
that's that's the problem they have what

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.200 
that's that's the problem they have what
does<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.110> future<00:05:20.289> hold<00:05:20.470> for<00:05:20.800> Bob<00:05:21.099> Lazar<00:05:21.430> well

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
does the future hold for Bob Lazar well

does the future hold for Bob Lazar well
I'm<00:05:22.389> not<00:05:22.539> really<00:05:22.720> involved<00:05:23.050> in<00:05:23.349> any<00:05:23.500> of<00:05:23.650> that

things like that so really I just go

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.279 
things like that so really I just go
about<00:05:42.760> my<00:05:42.909> life<00:05:43.240> and<00:05:43.599> that's<00:05:43.750> you<00:05:44.199> know

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
about my life and that's you know

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:45.750 
about my life and that's you know
something<00:05:44.830> had<00:05:44.949> happened<00:05:45.370> it<00:05:45.430> was<00:05:45.550> fantastic

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
something had happened it was fantastic

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.810 
something had happened it was fantastic
and<00:05:46.510> it's<00:05:46.990> over<00:05:47.199> but<00:05:47.620> it's<00:05:48.310> kind<00:05:48.520> of<00:05:48.580> hard<00:05:48.760> to

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
and it's over but it's kind of hard to

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.839 
and it's over but it's kind of hard to
shake<00:05:49.030> it<00:05:49.090> loose<00:05:49.330> but<00:05:50.130> eventually<00:05:51.130> I<00:05:51.340> will<00:05:51.460> and

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
shake it loose but eventually I will and

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.450 
shake it loose but eventually I will and
that'll<00:05:52.419> be<00:05:52.510> that<00:05:52.539> I<00:05:53.159> think<00:05:54.159> all<00:05:54.310> the

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
that'll be that I think all the

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.640 
that'll be that I think all the
surveillance<00:05:54.849> and<00:05:55.389> everything<00:05:55.990> stopped<00:05:56.289> I

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
surveillance and everything stopped I

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.050 
surveillance and everything stopped I
don't<00:05:57.070> think<00:05:57.220> anyone's<00:05:57.490> bothering<00:05:57.940> to

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
don't think anyone's bothering to

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.790 
don't think anyone's bothering to
monitor<00:05:58.479> me<00:05:58.599> I've<00:05:58.750> said<00:05:59.260> everything<00:05:59.380> that<00:05:59.680> I

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
monitor me I've said everything that I

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.399 
monitor me I've said everything that I
know<00:05:59.919> it's<00:06:00.849> been<00:06:01.240> all<00:06:01.360> over<00:06:01.389> the<00:06:01.870> place<00:06:02.080> so

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
know it's been all over the place so

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:05.790 
know it's been all over the place so
it's<00:06:03.400> kind<00:06:03.669> of<00:06:03.789> a<00:06:04.210> done<00:06:04.599> deal<00:06:04.810> as<00:06:05.560> far<00:06:05.770> as

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
it's kind of a done deal as far as

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.800 
it's kind of a done deal as far as
whether<00:06:06.070> or<00:06:06.190> not<00:06:06.310> there<00:06:06.490> any<00:06:06.789> craft<00:06:07.120> out<00:06:07.449> there

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
whether or not there any craft out there

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.450 
whether or not there any craft out there
I<00:06:08.050> believe<00:06:08.669> they<00:06:09.669> were<00:06:09.699> out<00:06:10.150> and<00:06:10.510> gone<00:06:10.690> in

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
I believe they were out and gone in

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.390 
I believe they were out and gone in
probably<00:06:12.460> the<00:06:12.550> late<00:06:13.150> 89<00:06:13.630> early<00:06:14.080> 90<00:06:14.470> and<00:06:14.710> the

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
probably the late 89 early 90 and the

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.420 
probably the late 89 early 90 and the
only<00:06:15.520> thing<00:06:15.639> people<00:06:16.030> see<00:06:16.389> now<00:06:16.570> out<00:06:16.750> there

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
only thing people see now out there

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:37.570 
this earth together well I don't suppose

we<00:07:37.930> can<00:07:38.080> wait<00:07:38.320> for<00:07:38.590> some<00:07:39.250> alien<00:07:39.729> race<00:07:39.909> to<00:07:40.120> come

down<00:07:40.450> and<00:07:40.630> threaten<00:07:40.930> us<00:07:41.070> but<00:07:42.070> I<00:07:42.099> think<00:07:42.250> that

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 
down and threaten us but I think that

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:45.570 
down and threaten us but I think that
between<00:07:42.789> us<00:07:43.000> we<00:07:43.630> can<00:07:43.900> bring<00:07:44.349> about<00:07:44.580> that

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:45.580 
between us we can bring about that

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:50.849 
between us we can bring about that
realization<00:07:46.680> thank<00:07:47.680> you<00:07:47.830> all<00:07:48.010> god<00:07:48.460> bless<00:07:48.669> you
