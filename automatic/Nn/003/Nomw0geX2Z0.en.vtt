00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
quite quickly I mean this may change

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:30.910 
quite quickly I mean this may change
slightly<00:00:17.850> as<00:00:18.210> we<00:00:18.330> go<00:00:18.510> along

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.960 

look<00:00:31.490> we'll<00:00:32.239> just<00:00:34.000> of<00:00:36.190> sketch<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.489> thing<00:00:37.760> and

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.700 

we'll<00:01:15.740> just<00:01:15.920> place<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.580> middle<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:18.500> is

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
we'll just place the middle this is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.450 
we'll just place the middle this is
almost<00:01:18.950> like<00:01:19.070> a<00:01:19.190> diamond<00:01:20.020> shape<00:01:21.159> is<00:01:22.159> like<00:01:22.430> a

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
almost like a diamond shape is like a
