Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:13.892
Everyone loves Aam papad, be it kids or adults.

00:00:14.332 --> 00:00:16.911
Today let’s make Aam papad.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.527
The ingredients are:

00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:26.095
4 mangoes (1 kg)

00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.376
1 cup sugar

00:00:28.847 --> 00:00:30.411
4 Cardamoms (elaichi)

00:00:30.683 --> 00:00:35.874
1/2 tsp ghee (To coat the plate with)

00:00:38.596 --> 00:00:54.871
First we will peel the mangoes and cut the pulp into small pieces.

00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:09.257
Now we will make a paste of the pulp in the mixer.

00:01:21.896 --> 00:01:24.586
The mango paste is ready.

00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:33.681
We’ll put it in a pan, place it on the stove and add some sugar.

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:40.285
Cook this paste till it becomes thick in consistency.

00:01:40.877 --> 00:01:47.943
Till then let’s grind the cardamoms into a powder.

00:01:48.167 --> 00:01:51.048
Let’s check if it is sticky enough. Yes, it is pretty sticky now.

00:01:57.614 --> 00:02:00.860
Now add the cardamom powder.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:12.104
The thicker this pulp is, the sooner it will congeal into solid Aam papad.

00:02:12.497 --> 00:02:16.306
Coat the plate with a little ghee.

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:23.728
Put the pulp into the plate.

00:02:33.017 --> 00:02:34.232
Spread evenly.

00:02:39.986 --> 00:02:44.390
Now we will put it in the sun to dry.

00:02:44.586 --> 00:02:58.948
We’ve made the sweet-sour aam papad, if you want to make it spicy then add 1/2 tsp

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:13.484
salt, ¼ tsp black pepper powder and a little ginger powder while you are cooking it.

00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:26.469
We’ll need to keep the Aam papad in the sun for 2 days before it is ready.

00:03:26.608 --> 00:03:28.057
Now we will cut it into pieces.

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:31.982
If you want to remove it whole from the plate, that can be done too.

00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:41.793
We’ll keep them together and cut them.

00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:09.513
This aam papad is very tasty.

00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:18.483
We can keep it outside for a month, and if we put it in the fridge it will last for 2-3 months.

00:04:18.937 --> 00:04:25.695
