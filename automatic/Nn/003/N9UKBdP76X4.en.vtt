00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.020 
that's more like sporty that I like and
one<00:01:23.299> that<00:01:23.450> I<00:01:23.509> like<00:01:23.750> more<00:01:24.280> dressier<00:01:25.280> pair<00:01:25.729> I

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
one that I like more dressier pair I

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.319 
one that I like more dressier pair I
guess<00:01:26.210> you<00:01:26.390> would<00:01:26.509> say<00:01:26.920> so<00:01:27.920> that's<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.060> first

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
guess you would say so that's the first

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.060 
guess you would say so that's the first
thing<00:01:29.509> I<00:01:30.020> think<00:01:30.409> it's<00:01:30.500> really<00:01:30.680> important<00:01:31.039> to

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
thing I think it's really important to

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.770 
thing I think it's really important to
carry<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.430> cases<00:01:31.789> with<00:01:31.939> you<00:01:31.969> at<00:01:32.210> all<00:01:32.270> times<00:01:32.329> in

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
carry the cases with you at all times in

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.010 
carry the cases with you at all times in
your<00:01:32.929> bag<00:01:33.109> because<00:01:33.729> obviously<00:01:34.810> things<00:01:35.810> get

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
your bag because obviously things get

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.419 
your bag because obviously things get
thrown<00:01:36.229> around<00:01:36.350> in<00:01:36.590> there<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:37.130> really

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
thrown around in there so you really

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:38.770 
thrown around in there so you really
want<00:01:37.579> protective<00:01:38.000> casing<00:01:38.390> on<00:01:38.570> your

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
want protective casing on your

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.930 
want protective casing on your
sunglasses

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.570 

okay<00:01:46.940> so<00:01:47.330> although<00:01:47.720> I<00:01:47.900> have<00:01:48.230> my<00:01:48.380> wallet<00:01:48.770> which

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
okay so although I have my wallet which

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.610 
okay so although I have my wallet which
everyone<00:01:50.000> has<00:01:50.210> this<00:01:50.780> actually<00:01:51.200> doesn't<00:01:51.350> match

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
everyone has this actually doesn't match

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.140 
everyone has this actually doesn't match
my<00:01:51.860> purse<00:01:52.100> so<00:01:52.400> maybe<00:01:52.610> I'll<00:01:52.790> think<00:01:52.910> about

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
my purse so maybe I'll think about

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.210 
my purse so maybe I'll think about
getting<00:01:53.510> one<00:01:53.540> that<00:01:53.810> does<00:01:53.990> but<00:01:54.320> if<00:01:54.800> it<00:01:54.920> does<00:01:55.100> the

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
getting one that does but if it does the

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.410 
getting one that does but if it does the

something<00:03:02.989> up<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.860> feel<00:03:04.070> like<00:03:04.220> I<00:03:04.310> can't

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
something up and I feel like I can't

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.430 
something up and I feel like I can't
listen<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:04.910> because<00:03:05.330> you're<00:03:06.140> out

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
listen to it because you're out

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.979 
listen to it because you're out
somewhere<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.640> these<00:03:08.060> are<00:03:08.300> definitely<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.750> must

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
somewhere so these are definitely a must

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.050 
somewhere so these are definitely a must
because<00:03:09.920> it<00:03:10.070> seems<00:03:10.250> like<00:03:10.430> whenever<00:03:10.610> you<00:03:10.880> don't

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
because it seems like whenever you don't

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.520 
because it seems like whenever you don't
have<00:03:11.209> them<00:03:11.420> is<00:03:11.690> when<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:11.989> want<00:03:12.200> them

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
have them is when you want them

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.280 
have them is when you want them
so<00:03:13.459> those<00:03:14.120> definitely<00:03:14.540> go<00:03:14.750> with<00:03:14.870> me<00:03:15.019> even

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290
