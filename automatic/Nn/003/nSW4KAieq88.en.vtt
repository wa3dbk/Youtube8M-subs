a as a closed ball dual hydranoid is one
of<00:02:47.640> my<00:02:47.700> favorites<00:02:48.299> to<00:02:48.480> look<00:02:48.629> at<00:02:48.780> just<00:02:49.260> because

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
of my favorites to look at just because

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.900 
of my favorites to look at just because
it<00:02:49.590> looks<00:02:49.769> more<00:02:50.069> like<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.280> machine<00:02:50.519> than

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
it looks more like a machine than

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.849 
it looks more like a machine than
anything<00:02:51.239> else<00:02:51.420> with<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.849> actual<00:02:53.849> metal<00:02:54.269> here

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
anything else with the actual metal here

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:02.660 
anything else with the actual metal here
instead<00:02:55.859> of<00:02:55.920> plastic<00:02:57.109> it<00:02:58.310> is<00:02:59.310> very<00:02:59.819> nice<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:01.670> lot

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670

Bakugan<00:03:06.239> but<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.510> think<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.989> most<00:03:07.170> one

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
Bakugan but I think that the most one

back<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:26.840> dual<00:03:27.840> hydranoid<00:03:28.910> now<00:03:29.910> in<00:03:30.239> my

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
back to the dual hydranoid now in my

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.909 
back to the dual hydranoid now in my
opinion<00:03:30.810> if<00:03:31.079> they<00:03:31.260> released<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.769> dual

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
opinion if they released the dual

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.360 
opinion if they released the dual
hydranoid<00:03:32.129> with<00:03:32.609> three<00:03:32.940> heads<00:03:33.120> no<00:03:33.750> one<00:03:33.989> heads

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
hydranoid with three heads no one heads

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.240 
hydranoid with three heads no one heads
then<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.639> head<00:03:36.530> then<00:03:37.530> released<00:03:37.919> the

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
then to head then released the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.409 
then to head then released the
two-headed<00:03:38.760> one<00:03:38.940> with<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:41.090> metal<00:03:42.090> strip

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
two-headed one with the metal strip

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.180 
two-headed one with the metal strip
instead<00:03:42.989> of<00:03:43.079> a<00:03:43.169> plastic<00:03:43.379> one<00:03:43.709> like<00:03:43.889> they<00:03:44.010> have

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
instead of a plastic one like they have

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.300 
instead of a plastic one like they have
and<00:03:44.569> still<00:03:45.569> do<00:03:45.810> have<00:03:45.989> and<00:03:46.290> then<00:03:46.889> released<00:03:47.220> it

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
and still do have and then released it

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.830 
and still do have and then released it
as<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.459> pro<00:03:47.699> cooper<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.389> then<00:03:48.510> went<00:03:48.720> straight

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
as a pro cooper and then went straight

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.539 
as a pro cooper and then went straight
to<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.079> three<00:03:49.260> heads<00:03:49.470> with<00:03:49.680> heavy<00:03:49.980> metal<00:03:50.370> and

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
to the three heads with heavy metal and

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.170 
to the three heads with heavy metal and
it<00:03:51.239> was<00:03:51.329> always<00:03:51.510> balcon<00:03:52.019> pearl<00:03:52.199> i<00:03:52.940> would<00:03:53.940> think

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
it was always balcon pearl i would think

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.610 
it was always balcon pearl i would think
that<00:03:54.299> would<00:03:54.510> be<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.599> best<00:03:54.930> thing<00:03:55.109> to<00:03:55.169> do<00:03:55.590> a

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
that would be the best thing to do a

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.740 
that would be the best thing to do a
hydranoid<00:03:56.040> any<00:03:56.819> of<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.060> Hydra<00:03:57.299> noids<00:03:57.540> those

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
hydranoid any of the Hydra noids those

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.150 
hydranoid any of the Hydra noids those
are<00:03:57.959> like<00:03:58.049> my<00:03:58.230> favorite<00:03:58.379> backe<00:03:58.709> on

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.750 

and<00:04:03.190> yeah<00:04:04.190> that's<00:04:04.370> about<00:04:04.490> it<00:04:05.560> now<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:07.460> increase

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
and yeah that's about it now to increase

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.970 
and yeah that's about it now to increase
the<00:04:08.090> way<00:04:08.210> that<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:08.510> looks<00:04:08.540> like<00:04:08.720> a<00:04:09.110> actual

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
the way that it looks like a actual

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.630 
the way that it looks like a actual
machine<00:04:10.310> if<00:04:11.270> you<00:04:11.780> look<00:04:12.230> at<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.440> new<00:04:12.770> doctor<00:04:13.520> on

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
machine if you look at the new doctor on

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.020 
machine if you look at the new doctor on
you<00:04:13.820> destroyed<00:04:14.180> episode<00:04:14.600> episode<00:04:14.840> 7<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:16.760> ball

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
you destroyed episode episode 7 the ball

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.600 
you destroyed episode episode 7 the ball
form<00:04:17.390> for<00:04:18.170> some<00:04:18.320> odd<00:04:18.470> reason<00:04:18.500> to<00:04:19.160> me<00:04:19.310> looks

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
form for some odd reason to me looks

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.070 
form for some odd reason to me looks
like<00:04:19.820> dual<00:04:20.030> hydranoid<00:04:20.980> and<00:04:22.690> when<00:04:23.690> you<00:04:23.810> look<00:04:23.840> at

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
like dual hydranoid and when you look at

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.070 
like dual hydranoid and when you look at
do<00:04:24.200> hydranoid<00:04:24.620> closed<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:26.240> can<00:04:26.390> see<00:04:26.570> this<00:04:26.780> it

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
do hydranoid closed you can see this it

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.690 
do hydranoid closed you can see this it
looks<00:04:27.650> like<00:04:27.770> it's<00:04:28.040> steel<00:04:28.370> but<00:04:28.580> that's

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
looks like it's steel but that's

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.060 
looks like it's steel but that's
actually<00:04:28.850> just<00:04:29.150> painted<00:04:29.510> on<00:04:29.830> adding<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:30.980> the

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
actually just painted on adding to the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.100 
actually just painted on adding to the
Machine<00:04:31.400> look<00:04:31.700> this<00:04:32.570> is<00:04:32.720> opened<00:04:35.110> there's

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
Machine look this is opened there's

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.300 
Machine look this is opened there's
holes<00:04:37.690> which<00:04:38.690> they<00:04:38.900> started<00:04:39.230> to<00:04:39.290> do<00:04:39.440> later<00:04:40.220> on

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
holes which they started to do later on

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.690 
holes which they started to do later on
in<00:04:40.640> the<00:04:40.700> series<00:04:40.940> um<00:04:42.100> some<00:04:43.100> odd<00:04:43.280> reason<00:04:45.490> you<00:04:46.490> can

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
in the series um some odd reason you can

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.240 
in the series um some odd reason you can
the<00:04:47.270> metal<00:04:47.570> just<00:04:47.690> add<00:04:47.840> two<00:04:48.050> really<00:04:48.890> good<00:04:49.010> touch

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
the metal just add two really good touch

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.970 
the metal just add two really good touch
to<00:04:49.460> it<00:04:49.490> looking<00:04:50.090> like<00:04:50.120> a<00:04:50.300> machine<00:04:50.510> to<00:04:50.840> me<00:04:50.990> and

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
to it looking like a machine to me and

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.290 
to it looking like a machine to me and
that's<00:04:52.970> about<00:04:53.120> it<00:04:54.040> so<00:04:55.040> dual<00:04:55.340> hydranoid<00:04:55.550> gets<00:04:56.150> a

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
that's about it so dual hydranoid gets a

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.120 
that's about it so dual hydranoid gets a
10<00:04:56.540> out<00:04:56.690> of<00:04:56.720> 10<00:04:58.000> thanks<00:04:59.000> for
