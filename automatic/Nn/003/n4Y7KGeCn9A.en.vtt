00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.090
 Hmm 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.750
 me 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.050
 me 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:17.979
 That girl was born in Osaka, and it is a typical city in Japan called Tokyo and Osaka and Kyoto 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.760
 Each 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.760
 I'm spending 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:31.290
 So Well that was embedded in the various experience or memory about the world chillin 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:37.020
 Say 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:46.010
 I think that only those things come alive when you make something 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:46.010
 I think that it is important to put out in objective fair and clear form as much as possible 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.630
 This light can certainly be calculated 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:01.140
 But I intend that not open the window to the building 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:04.850
 If there is a place where more than at the time of the human imagination is because the inside of the drama that occurs in that say 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.850
 I'm telling you that 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.859
 Kun 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.400
 One of the motifs of the picture is 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:42.040
 It did not two typical forms Aborubu 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:50.350
 It is not completely inside but there is a purposely deformed aim and a hole is opened in it 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:53.890
 It does in this is whether not a prototype in the form of all of the creatures I'd think to go and write the 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:03:01.780
 Mouth out as it were the entrance of the building 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:02.680
 Or window becomes what if there are a variety of tube passes through a person or pass wind or passing light door 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.730
 Or 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:14.409
 For example, if I look like that minute lie even if I was hey it comes to breathing 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.290
 There but get leads to be called or make a building of luxury student doing 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:20.459
 Yeah it's why I thought 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:24.030
 Walls, anchors, pillars, floors, etc. 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:29.069
 I have that element but they all 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:32.870
 I'm free all are not long for things to open the hole for a certain breathing 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.870
 Even dream things and are talking about a while ago 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.950
 Hmm 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.270
 car 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.270
 goo 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.400
 Four 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.400
 Hmm 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.770
 Cormorants Uu 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.770
 goo 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.950
 goo 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.950
 Four days 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.950
 Hmm 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.970
 Nanzenji A Kyoto is 1200 years 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.920
 There is a history of 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:41.160
 Port has a long history of capturing the static relationship between the city and the architecture 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:41.160
 Construction also was while remaining buildings that have also long history while being updated in there 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.880
 new 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.880
 It is as there is in the other so that the living environment is completed 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.960
 Old 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.289
 Traditional culture and the newly born town East 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:09.539
 This love both 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:09.539
 Besides, I would like you to cut down such a lifestyle that you can enjoy it 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.670
 me 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:49.460
 Well , even in this project 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:54.979
 I want to put in the distance and movement 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:56.610
 It had reached an agreement came to be called by the wind name the so-called Amida lottery 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:01.280
 It is a project 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.960
 No way 9:00 is that that 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:09.290
 Finally to 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:13.270
 Thing or toward the things of surprise overlooking the ones that seek Well 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.270
 I'm going to the way to follow 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.550
 Say so 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:21.500
 to elevation 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:24.460
 I want to make a distance, I want to make a move, a day that leaks from the inside , I warm him 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.520
 I do not watch from the outside 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:32.129
 You can make it move 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:37.169
 Attracted, something moves with flickering or changing expression 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:39.740
 It also moves about how the sun's light actually enters, and then something about that whole 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:42.919
 Create a rhythm 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.980
 Make a form that I did not get tired of in total 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:51.230
 Many eyes 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:56.600
 I will make something that seems like a random number 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:59.620
 Then there is a facade that climbs towards the 10 yearnings as it goes through it 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.620
 It is born 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:11.410
 I think it would be nice if love is given 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:11.410
 A new joy is say or make a kind of architecture, such as Kumitoreru 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.449
 me 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:46.449
 Hmm
