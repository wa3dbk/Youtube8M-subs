00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.610 
you some ideas of how you can change
your<00:00:34.350> setup<00:00:34.620> if<00:00:35.220> you're<00:00:35.430> inclined<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:36.060> so

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
your setup if you're inclined to do so

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.080

before I show you anything else let's

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.090 
before I show you anything else let's
look<00:00:39.239> at<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.420> cables<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.110> how<00:00:40.380> everything<00:00:40.830> is

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
look at the cables and how everything is

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.729 
look at the cables and how everything is
connected<00:00:43.760> over<00:00:44.760> here<00:00:45.590> we've<00:00:46.590> got<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
connected over here we've got the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.250 
connected over here we've got the
connection<00:00:47.190> from<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.430> iPad<00:00:47.820> air<00:00:48.140> point<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
connection from the iPad air point to a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.000 
connection from the iPad air point to a
USB<00:00:49.940> alright<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.629> one<00:00:51.870> goes<00:00:52.260> into<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
USB alright so this one goes into the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.979 
USB alright so this one goes into the
iPad<00:00:56.449> like<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:58.970> alright<00:00:59.970> so<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> cable<00:01:00.750> runs

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
iPad like so alright so the cable runs

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.530 
iPad like so alright so the cable runs
from<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.739> iPad<00:01:02.190> into<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.300> powered<00:01:03.960> USB<00:01:04.680> hub

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
from the iPad into this powered USB hub

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.950 
from the iPad into this powered USB hub
now<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.900> required<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:08.010> able<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.400> use

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
now this is required to be able to use

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.660 
now this is required to be able to use
the<00:01:09.960> media<00:01:10.440> fighter<00:01:10.680> or<00:01:10.950> any<00:01:11.100> other<00:01:11.340> media

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the media fighter or any other media

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.399 
the media fighter or any other media
controller<00:01:12.409> with<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> iPad<00:01:14.330> so<00:01:15.330> from<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
controller with the iPad so from the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.280 
controller with the iPad so from the
iPad<00:01:16.800> we<00:01:17.430> go<00:01:17.610> straight<00:01:17.850> into<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> USB<00:01:18.690> hub<00:01:18.900> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
iPad we go straight into the USB hub and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.399 
iPad we go straight into the USB hub and
this<00:01:20.190> blue<00:01:20.460> cable<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.060> connected<00:01:21.540> from<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
this blue cable is connected from the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.430 
this blue cable is connected from the
MIDI<00:01:22.680> controller<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.510> right<00:01:24.510> into<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.870> to

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
MIDI controller and right into the to

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.950 
MIDI controller and right into the to
the<00:01:25.470> hub<00:01:25.740> over<00:01:25.920> here<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.000> second<00:01:27.420> port<00:01:27.690> I

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the hub over here on the second port I

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.050

I'm<00:01:33.600> really<00:01:34.140> happy<00:01:34.470> with<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.860> tiny<00:01:35.190> little

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
I'm really happy with this tiny little

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.840 
I'm really happy with this tiny little
thing<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.910> mean<00:01:36.350> look<00:01:37.350> at<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.520> really

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
thing I mean look at it it is really

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.970 
thing I mean look at it it is really
small<00:01:39.120> as<00:01:39.360> lightweight<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:40.440> really<00:01:40.710> low

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
small as lightweight but it's really low

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.460 
small as lightweight but it's really low
latency<00:01:41.190> high<00:01:42.180> output<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:42.930> everything<00:01:43.290> that

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
latency high output it's everything that

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.190 
latency high output it's everything that
you<00:01:43.710> would<00:01:43.830> require<00:01:44.010> as<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:44.640> DJ<00:01:45.510> I<00:01:45.780> can't

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you would require as a DJ I can't

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.750 
you would require as a DJ I can't
imagine<00:01:46.320> anyone<00:01:46.800> using<00:01:47.220> anything<00:01:47.430> else

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
imagine anyone using anything else

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.550 
imagine anyone using anything else
unless<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.330> have<00:01:48.510> more<00:01:48.720> things<00:01:48.900> to<00:01:49.050> connect

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
unless you have more things to connect

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.520 
unless you have more things to connect
but<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> regular<00:01:50.430> DJ<00:01:50.760> setup<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.570> having<00:01:51.990> the

course I have the the electricity cable

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.270 
course I have the the electricity cable
for<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.220> USB<00:02:02.550> hub<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.440> from<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.560> main<00:02:04.770> out<00:02:05.010> on

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
for the USB hub and from the main out on

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.820 
for the USB hub and from the main out on
the<00:02:05.430> sound<00:02:05.640> card<00:02:05.910> connected<00:02:06.870> to<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.440 
speakers and ok so what's really cool is
that<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.099> can<00:02:11.160> actually<00:02:11.550> connect<00:02:11.819> any<00:02:12.030> type

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
that you can actually connect any type

of class compliant to the MIDI
controller<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.739> use<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:18.140> with<00:02:19.140> this

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
controller and use it with this

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.380 
controller and use it with this
application<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:20.190> it's<00:02:20.760> really<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.209> simple

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390
