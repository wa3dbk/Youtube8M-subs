is<00:03:38.640> kind<00:03:39.640> of<00:03:39.790> this<00:03:40.269> code<00:03:40.690> it's<00:03:41.230> very<00:03:41.530> hard<00:03:41.830> to

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
is kind of this code it's very hard to

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.789 
is kind of this code it's very hard to
understand<00:03:42.580> some<00:03:43.570> people<00:03:43.600> know<00:03:44.019> very<00:03:44.320> good

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
but I'm not that it so you can use these

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:58.650 
but I'm not that it so you can use these
to<00:03:50.350> make<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:52.480> just<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:57.420> here's<00:03:58.420> you<00:03:58.570> have
