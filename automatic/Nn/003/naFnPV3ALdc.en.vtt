cover

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.580 
cover
I<00:02:35.090> believe<00:02:36.090> this<00:02:36.239> this<00:02:36.630> might<00:02:36.900> not<00:02:36.930> be<00:02:37.110> good<00:02:37.410> at

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
I believe this this might not be good at

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.229 
I believe this this might not be good at
but<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.799> feels<00:02:37.980> like<00:02:38.190> leather<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.940> could<00:02:39.209> be

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
but it feels like leather so it could be

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.870 
but it feels like leather so it could be
leather<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:40.830> they<00:02:41.010> tried<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.310> see<00:02:41.640> that's

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
leather that they tried to see that's

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.229 
leather that they tried to see that's
leather<00:02:42.299> or<00:02:42.540> not<00:02:43.370> as<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.580> can<00:02:44.730> see<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:48.060> such

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
leather or not as you can see and such

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.170 
leather or not as you can see and such
now<00:02:48.540> that's<00:02:48.750> out<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.110> package<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:50.180> very

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
now that's out of the package is very

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.330 
now that's out of the package is very
thin<00:02:51.570> which<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.200> what<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.530> wanted<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.160> only

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
thin which is what I wanted the only

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.570 
thin which is what I wanted the only
thing<00:02:53.519> that<00:02:54.030> might<00:02:54.269> make<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> little<00:02:54.870> bulky<00:02:55.580> is

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
thing that might make a little bulky is

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.979 
thing that might make a little bulky is
this<00:02:56.940> but<00:02:57.360> we'll<00:02:57.600> have<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.080> see<00:02:59.690> how<00:03:00.690> that

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
this but we'll have to see how that

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:08.810 
this but we'll have to see how that
would<00:03:01.140> fit<00:03:01.410> in<00:03:01.590> there<00:03:04.850> okay<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.980> just<00:03:07.980> go<00:03:08.160> slip

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
would fit in there okay so just go slip

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:17.970 
would fit in there okay so just go slip
in<00:03:09.030> here

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
pretty nice I don't know how this might

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.890 
pretty nice I don't know how this might
hopefully<00:04:02.239> that<00:04:02.390> doesn't<00:04:02.600> come<00:04:02.989> unglued<00:04:03.200> from

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
hopefully that doesn't come unglued from

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.800 
hopefully that doesn't come unglued from
here<00:04:06.610> as<00:04:07.610> you<00:04:07.760> can<00:04:07.790> see<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.300> then<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:08.630> have

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
here as you can see and then you have

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.880 
here as you can see and then you have
your<00:04:08.900> power<00:04:09.140> button<00:04:09.440> there<00:04:09.739> access<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:11.600> top

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
your power button there access the top

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.699 
your power button there access the top
it's<00:04:12.890> pretty<00:04:13.160> much<00:04:13.450> open<00:04:14.450> there's<00:04:14.989> a<00:04:15.080> plastic

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
it's pretty much open there's a plastic

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.250 
it's pretty much open there's a plastic
where<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:15.980> sits<00:04:16.220> in<00:04:16.810> these<00:04:17.829> access<00:04:18.829> to<00:04:18.980> your

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
where it sits in these access to your

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.370 
where it sits in these access to your
pin<00:04:21.260> as<00:04:21.470> well<00:04:23.800> will<00:04:24.800> close<00:04:25.040> it<00:04:25.220> up<00:04:26.380> actually

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
pin as well will close it up actually

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.190 
pin as well will close it up actually
it's<00:04:27.470> pretty<00:04:27.590> thin<00:04:28.450> it<00:04:29.450> looks<00:04:29.690> like<00:04:29.930> it<00:04:30.080> would

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
it's pretty thin it looks like it would

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.940 
it's pretty thin it looks like it would
be<00:04:30.229> bulkier<00:04:30.919> but<00:04:31.160> that's<00:04:31.370> because<00:04:32.950> this

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
be bulkier but that's because this

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.210 
be bulkier but that's because this
plastic<00:04:34.520> insert<00:04:35.290> kind<00:04:36.290> of<00:04:36.410> lifts<00:04:36.650> up<00:04:36.770> to<00:04:36.950> think

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
plastic insert kind of lifts up to think

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.330 
plastic insert kind of lifts up to think
that<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:37.430> little<00:04:37.729> bit<00:04:37.880> higher<00:04:38.830> so<00:04:39.830> it<00:04:39.979> makes<00:04:40.190> it

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
that a little bit higher so it makes it

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.360 
that a little bit higher so it makes it
look<00:04:40.460> like<00:04:40.490> it's<00:04:40.820> a<00:04:40.910> little<00:04:41.030> bit<00:04:41.150> thicker<00:04:42.370> than

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
look like it's a little bit thicker than

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.180 
look like it's a little bit thicker than
what<00:04:43.520> it<00:04:43.669> is<00:04:44.380> here<00:04:45.380> here's<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.890> back<00:04:46.100> side<00:04:46.130> you

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
what it is here here's the back side you

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.940 
what it is here here's the back side you
can<00:04:49.190> see<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:50.500> easy<00:04:51.500> access<00:04:51.890> for<00:04:52.070> your<00:04:52.190> pin

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
can see the easy access for your pin

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.620 
can see the easy access for your pin
camera<00:04:56.140> and<00:04:57.140> I<00:04:57.260> believe<00:04:57.620> this<00:04:58.070> fact<00:04:58.520> part<00:04:59.000> is

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
camera and I believe this fact part is

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.100 
camera and I believe this fact part is
for

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:13.170 

just<00:05:05.590> and<00:05:08.520> standing<00:05:09.520> like<00:05:10.199> like<00:05:11.199> this<00:05:12.120> so<00:05:13.120> you

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
just and standing like like this so you

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:23.850 
just and standing like like this so you
can<00:05:13.419> have<00:05:13.629> a<00:05:14.849> quick<00:05:15.849> access<00:05:15.909> to<00:05:16.539> it<00:05:21.419> so<00:05:22.860> we'll

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
can have a quick access to it so we'll

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.059 
can have a quick access to it so we'll
give<00:05:24.069> it<00:05:24.099> a<00:05:24.250> try<00:05:24.490> see<00:05:24.819> how<00:05:24.849> nice<00:05:25.770> this<00:05:26.770> case

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
give it a try see how nice this case

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:38.430 
give it a try see how nice this case
might<00:05:27.310> be<00:05:29.610> here's<00:05:30.610> the<00:05:30.759> instructions<00:05:37.349> as<00:05:38.349> you

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
might be here's the instructions as you

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.529 
might be here's the instructions as you
can<00:05:38.590> see<00:05:38.770> that<00:05:38.979> slide<00:05:39.969> it<00:05:40.090> in<00:05:40.210> that<00:05:40.330> I'll

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
can see that slide it in that I'll

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.820 
can see that slide it in that I'll
either<00:05:41.050> have<00:05:41.319> in<00:05:41.500> this<00:05:41.710> position<00:05:42.389> or

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
either have in this position or

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:50.670 
either have in this position or
proposition<00:05:47.250> so<00:05:48.250> we'll<00:05:48.400> see<00:05:48.580> how<00:05:49.469> I'll<00:05:50.469> get

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
proposition so we'll see how I'll get

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.839 
proposition so we'll see how I'll get
this<00:05:50.830> case<00:05:51.099> might<00:05:51.400> be<00:05:51.430> you<00:05:52.419> can<00:05:52.449> fold<00:05:52.870> it<00:05:53.849> as

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
this case might be you can fold it as

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:01.490 
this case might be you can fold it as
well<00:05:55.210> like<00:05:55.240> this<00:05:55.750> and<00:05:56.280> kind<00:05:57.280> of<00:05:57.370> use<00:05:57.550> it<00:05:57.699> as<00:05:57.879> a

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:10.339 

like<00:06:02.500> a<00:06:02.530> little<00:06:02.860> notepad<00:06:03.479> take<00:06:04.479> your<00:06:04.629> notes<00:06:05.849> or

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:16.549 

slide<00:06:11.349> that<00:06:11.650> in

00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:16.559 

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:18.769 

I'll<00:06:17.129> show<00:06:17.609> you<00:06:17.669> how<00:06:17.879> that<00:06:17.909> looks<00:06:18.119> from<00:06:18.629> the

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:18.779 
I'll show you how that looks from the

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:24.739 
I'll show you how that looks from the
side<00:06:20.149> as<00:06:21.149> you<00:06:21.389> can<00:06:21.449> see<00:06:23.359> it's<00:06:24.359> got<00:06:24.509> a<00:06:24.539> nice

00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:24.749 
side as you can see it's got a nice

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:31.389 
side as you can see it's got a nice
angle<00:06:25.229> to<00:06:25.409> it<00:06:28.489> you<00:06:29.489> can<00:06:29.669> get<00:06:29.909> all<00:06:30.059> the<00:06:30.179> angles

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:31.399 
angle to it you can get all the angles

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:33.679 
angle to it you can get all the angles
on<00:06:32.399> there<00:06:32.669> so<00:06:32.879> you<00:06:32.909> can<00:06:33.119> put<00:06:33.329> the<00:06:33.449> keyboard

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:33.689 
on there so you can put the keyboard

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:41.989 
on there so you can put the keyboard
let's<00:06:34.319> see<00:06:34.529> let's<00:06:35.149> flip<00:06:36.149> it<00:06:36.179> over<00:06:36.449> and<00:06:40.999> let's

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:41.999 
let's see let's flip it over and let's

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:50.109 
let's see let's flip it over and let's
see<00:06:42.209> how<00:06:42.419> well<00:06:42.689> it<00:06:42.809> does<00:06:42.839> and<00:06:45.769> that<00:06:46.769> would<00:06:47.309> be

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:50.119 

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:55.279 

standing<00:06:51.119> at<00:06:51.329> this<00:06:51.599> position<00:06:53.899> so<00:06:54.899> there<00:06:55.109> you

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289 
standing at this position so there you

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.999 
standing at this position so there you
have<00:06:55.319> it<00:06:55.819> just<00:06:56.819> a<00:06:56.939> quick<00:06:57.119> look<00:06:57.329> at<00:06:57.509> the

00:06:57.999 --> 00:06:58.009 
have it just a quick look at the

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:01.549
