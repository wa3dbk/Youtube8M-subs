things the technique i plan on using
it's<00:04:09.530> called<00:04:09.800> the<00:04:10.220> s<00:04:10.370> technique<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:11.120> can<00:04:11.690> climb

it's called the s technique I can climb
grow<00:04:12.110> easily<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:12.890> quickly<00:04:13.010> this<00:04:13.370> way<00:04:13.430> but<00:04:14.180> I

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
grow easily and quickly this way but I

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.750 
grow easily and quickly this way but I
do<00:04:14.270> make<00:04:14.600> it<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.930> last<00:04:15.080> stage<00:04:15.380> I<00:04:15.680> know<00:04:15.770> I

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
do make it to the last stage I know I

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.349 
do make it to the last stage I know I
