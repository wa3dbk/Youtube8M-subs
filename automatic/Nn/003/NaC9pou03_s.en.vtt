 It ve has been argued that gonna be even vaguely 100,000 l What better discrimination 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.570
 It would be good for you to have tomatoes. 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.570
 You can think of it in the same way as the Mad Rock anticancer drug.

 If you look to find the nutrients had been hit in the sponge once the old language 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.050
 About one-third of the tomato ticket is sugar. 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.370

 In the case of fish oil products, I would say that about a quarter of the sugar is sugar. 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.110
 So

 This is a sugar bowl . Tomatoes are dangerous. 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.590
 For example, did a limitless went daljjakjigeun sugar 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.650
 There are good reasons for everything 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.650

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.230
 Anyway

 Two letting the three-quarters of that line out somewhat on sugar 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:33.390
