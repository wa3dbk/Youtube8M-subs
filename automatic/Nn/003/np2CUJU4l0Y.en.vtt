00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.860
 computer use 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.270
 become commonplace for 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.949
 mass consumer 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.849
 from little to great hard to imagine 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.509
 a person without a computer 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:17.769
 and generally 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:19.380
 like 40 years ago 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.860
 we did without him 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.900
 just getting creepy 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.279
 now don't feed bread like that 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.230
 sit for an hour 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.659
 children leader already taken not needed 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.390
 consequences a person becomes plodding 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.350
 workaholics 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.560
 and generally speaking 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.050
 computer genius 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.240
 still would 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.760
 most free time 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.460
 goes to the declaration of love computer 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.050
 but he is not a tenant 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.600
 peace and rest is extremely necessary for him 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.540
 but still 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.190
 we neglect it 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.999
 and tries to exploit 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:52.290
 system unit 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.330
 It revealed 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.730
 heating components of the unit 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.270
 happens instantly 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.290
 if not for his chief assistants 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.579
 fan in that go all out 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:07.280
 try to facilitate the workflow 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.230
 main elements of the system unit 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.000
 such as processes 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.670
 motherboard power supply 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.500
 yes and the general condition inside 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.900
 sisters 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.590
 space 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.950
 in dollar blowing out precious air 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.560
 freshness which is considered gradually 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.119
 together with the free time spent 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.010
 at computer 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.650
 computer fan 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.100
 designed for long-term work 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.900
 without them, the system unit will not work 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.430
 absence of minutes 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.830
 so leading manufacturer 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.840
 try to give maximum 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.620
 Attention 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.570
 for their technical excellence 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.360
 cooling fans for 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.340
 computer equipment 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.740
 use exclusively without 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.820
 bangs ranks egypt dc 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.950
 According to 5 and 12 volts 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.439
 which produce much less 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.430
 electromagnetic interference run-in 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.530
 motor driven fans 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.190
 AC usually use 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.939
 voltage retro networks 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.619
 they use a synchronous and type 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.819
 engine 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.589
 cooling fan is not always 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:21.870
 has a forced mode 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.499
 constant rotation therefore 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:26.979
 in most modern models 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.159
 is used 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.209
 built-in processor assembly 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.189
 for this speed phenomenon 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.499
 rotation engines due to change 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:40.180
 temperature conditions especially 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.540
 maximum heating 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.709
 components system unit 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.540
 those construction intermediaries 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.780
 Fan can be placed ie 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.810
 use the word rolling bearings and 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.700
 slip 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.260
 and I started one at a time differently 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.539
 slip and swing options 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:59.249
 which is better 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:00.849
 here is a moot point 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.709
 it all depends on constructive 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.019
 build moisture in the environment 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.480
 uses block system and of course 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.650
 temperature conditions 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.029
 special 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:14.029
 101 air injection into the system unit 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:16.979
 even extra preventative 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.549
 lubrication of the bearings we can 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.069
 increase fan life chapter 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.879
 time 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.010
 to survive production 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.870
 similar construction 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.729
 ball bearings 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:30.429
 prophylaxis 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:32.679
 always useful for any technique 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.589
 as a teenager fan 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.899
 and sometimes can survive having worked 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.209
 abilities the system unit itself in 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:39.439
