00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
school lot in this movie so you have

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.790 
school lot in this movie so you have
that<00:01:26.970> aspect<00:01:27.510> for<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.810> gamers<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.770> a

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
that aspect for the gamers but it is a

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.530 
that aspect for the gamers but it is a
good<00:01:29.100> movie<00:01:29.370> in<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.730> itself<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.240> thought<00:01:30.450> he

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
good movie in and of itself I thought he

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.180 
good movie in and of itself I thought he
was<00:01:30.660> gonna<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:31.020> game<00:01:31.260> hopping<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.830> bunch<00:01:32.100> of

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
was gonna go game hopping to a bunch of

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.710 
was gonna go game hopping to a bunch of
different<00:01:32.280> worlds<00:01:32.730> he<00:01:32.850> actually<00:01:33.180> goes<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.540> two

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
different worlds he actually goes to two

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.270 
different worlds he actually goes to two
so<00:01:33.990> when<00:01:34.110> he<00:01:34.170> ends<00:01:34.440> up<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.830> one<00:01:35.040> world

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
so when he ends up in this one world

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.160 
so when he ends up in this one world
which<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.940> only<00:01:36.060> describe<00:01:36.240> as<00:01:36.720> candy

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
which is I can only describe as candy

off<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.540> was<00:02:17.930> enjoying<00:02:18.349> this<00:02:18.500> movie<00:02:18.769> even

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
off so I was enjoying this movie even

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.320 
off so I was enjoying this movie even
though<00:02:19.099> there's<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.459> section<00:02:19.879> about<00:02:20.000> in<00:02:20.239> the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
though there's a section about in the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.640 
though there's a section about in the
middle<00:02:20.599> where<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.810> movie<00:02:21.110> kind<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.349> slows

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
middle where the movie kind of slows

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.110 
middle where the movie kind of slows
down<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.890> bit<00:02:22.040> but<00:02:22.340> then<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.640> movie<00:02:22.910> does

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
down a bit but then the movie does

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.449 
down a bit but then the movie does
something<00:02:23.599> it<00:02:23.750> hits<00:02:24.260> an<00:02:24.440> emotional<00:02:25.040> tone<00:02:25.280> that

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
something it hits an emotional tone that

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.070 
something it hits an emotional tone that
I<00:02:25.489> didn't<00:02:25.819> expect<00:02:26.209> there<00:02:26.540> are<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.750> couple

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
I didn't expect there are a couple

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.420 
I didn't expect there are a couple
moments<00:02:27.530> in<00:02:27.590> this<00:02:27.680> movie<00:02:27.980> where<00:02:28.160> it<00:02:28.250> gets

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
moments in this movie where it gets

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.309 
moments in this movie where it gets
quite<00:02:28.879> a<00:02:28.910> few<00:02:29.239> points<00:02:29.660> for<00:02:29.780> being<00:02:30.019> just<00:02:30.170> a

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
quite a few points for being just a

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.619 
quite a few points for being just a
little<00:02:31.099> more<00:02:31.250> emotional<00:02:31.730> than<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.030> had<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.480> be

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
little more emotional than it had to be

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.330 
little more emotional than it had to be
so<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:32.989> expected<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.560> see<00:02:33.709> some<00:02:33.739> videogame

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
so I expected to see some videogame

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.100 
so I expected to see some videogame
throw<00:02:34.610> back<00:02:34.790> some<00:02:35.030> video<00:02:35.269> game<00:02:35.450> references<00:02:35.959> I

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
throw back some video game references I

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.839 
throw back some video game references I
did<00:02:36.379> get<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.799> not<00:02:37.010> as<00:02:37.129> much<00:02:37.280> as<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.489> wanted

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
did get that not as much as I wanted

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.460 
did get that not as much as I wanted
however<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.239> got<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> deeper<00:02:38.930> movie<00:02:39.140> that<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.319> was

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
however I got a deeper movie that I was
