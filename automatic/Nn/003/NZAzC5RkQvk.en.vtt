room in there these aren't particularly
thick<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.440> they<00:00:40.590> will<00:00:40.980> fit<00:00:41.219> comfortably

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
thick but so they will fit comfortably

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.440

are already snug it's just going to be

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.490 
are already snug it's just going to be
too<00:00:47.070> tight<00:00:47.420> having<00:00:48.420> said<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.660> these<00:00:49.260> are<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
too tight having said that these are a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.200 
too tight having said that these are a
great<00:00:49.829> inexpensive<00:00:50.250> option<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:51.180> getting

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
great inexpensive option for getting

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.270 
great inexpensive option for getting
some<00:00:51.719> heat<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> your<00:00:52.200> hands<00:00:52.530> rather<00:00:53.070> than

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
some heat to your hands rather than

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.190 
some heat to your hands rather than
paying<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> full<00:00:54.120> glove<00:00:54.480> construction

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
paying for a full glove construction

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.049 
paying for a full glove construction
you're<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.829> paying<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.730> heating

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
thing about these is it'll work

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.240 
thing about these is it'll work
perfectly<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.930> conjunction<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.920> jacket

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
perfectly in conjunction with a jacket

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.190 
perfectly in conjunction with a jacket
liner<00:01:05.520> so<00:01:05.759> if<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.940> already<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.630> venture

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
liner so if you already have a venture

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.800 
liner so if you already have a venture
heat<00:01:07.440> fully<00:01:08.009> sleeve<00:01:08.399> jacket<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.570> plug

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
heat fully sleeve jacket you can plug

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.929 
heat fully sleeve jacket you can plug

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
the power leads for these gloves right

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.690 
the power leads for these gloves right
into<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> sleeves<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.229> jacket<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.799> that

into the sleeves of the jacket and that

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.460 
into the sleeves of the jacket and that
way<00:01:14.880> you'll<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.150> control<00:01:15.930> over<00:01:16.170> this

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
way you'll have control over this

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.620 
way you'll have control over this
directly<00:01:17.220> from<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.610> jacket<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.119> you'll<00:01:18.510> have

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
directly from the jacket and you'll have

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.719 
directly from the jacket and you'll have
heat<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.320> your<00:01:19.439> hands<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.250> that's<00:01:20.430> definitely

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
heat to your hands so that's definitely

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.429 
heat to your hands so that's definitely
a<00:01:21.000> great<00:01:21.180> option<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:21.720> you're<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.320> run

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
a great option if you're going to run

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.100 
a great option if you're going to run
these<00:01:22.590> by<00:01:22.799> themselves<00:01:23.009> they<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:24.000> come<00:01:24.540> with<00:01:24.869> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
these by themselves they do come with a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.679 
these by themselves they do come with a
power<00:01:25.710> lead<00:01:26.009> wiring<00:01:26.909> harness<00:01:27.270> now<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.630> is

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
power lead wiring harness now this is

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.359 
power lead wiring harness now this is
going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.110> connect<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.650> your<00:01:28.740> bikes<00:01:28.950> battery

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
going to connect to your bikes battery

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.130 
going to connect to your bikes battery
it's<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.970> simple<00:01:30.299> installation<00:01:30.659> there's

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
it's a simple installation there's

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.539 
it's a simple installation there's
basically<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.740> two<00:01:31.890> eyelets<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.460> are

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
basically just two eyelets that are

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.310 
basically just two eyelets that are
going<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.729> go<00:01:32.850> onto<00:01:33.150> your<00:01:33.689> battery's<00:01:34.079> positive

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
going to go onto your battery's positive

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.050 
going to go onto your battery's positive
and<00:01:34.770> negative<00:01:35.040> terminals<00:01:35.070> there's<00:01:35.939> a

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and negative terminals there's a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.640 
and negative terminals there's a
built-in<00:01:36.270> fuse<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.960> then<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.619> your

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
built-in fuse and then you have your

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.679 
built-in fuse and then you have your
power<00:01:37.950> outlet<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.729> you'll<00:01:38.850> typically<00:01:39.420> run

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
power outlet that you'll typically run

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.149 
power outlet that you'll typically run
out<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> left<00:01:40.320> side<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.530> your<00:01:40.710> bike<00:01:40.860> since

out to the left side of your bike since

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.249

harness<00:01:48.420> now<00:01:48.570> what<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.049> how<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.619> will<00:01:49.740> work

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
harness now what this how this will work

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.770 
harness now what this how this will work
is<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.579> will<00:01:50.759> plug<00:01:50.880> into<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.240> power<00:01:51.540> lead

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
is this will plug into the power lead

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.990 
is this will plug into the power lead
and<00:01:51.990> then<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.680> got<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> wide<00:01:53.220> connector<00:01:53.729> here

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and then it's got a wide connector here

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.999 
and then it's got a wide connector here
