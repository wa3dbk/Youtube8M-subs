balance<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:50.980> like<00:01:51.580> in<00:01:51.760> Madden<00:01:52.120> 12<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.720> curl

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
balance and like in Madden 12 the curl

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:05.820 
balance and like in Madden 12 the curl
route<00:01:53.200> does<00:01:53.560> beat<00:01:53.890> man<00:01:54.160> 1<00:01:54.490> times<00:01:54.850> correctly

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.499 

you're<00:02:06.830> probably<00:02:07.130> thinking<00:02:07.549> so<00:02:08.000> how<00:02:08.209> do<00:02:08.270> I

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
you're probably thinking so how do I

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.320 
you're probably thinking so how do I
stop<00:02:08.990> it<00:02:09.050> if<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.649> beats<00:02:09.950> everything<00:02:10.580> don't

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
stop it if it beats everything don't

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.660 
stop it if it beats everything don't
worry<00:02:11.600> I<00:02:11.750> got<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.319> you<00:02:12.860> can<00:02:13.069> either<00:02:13.160> take<00:02:13.459> two

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
worry I got you you can either take two

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.070 
worry I got you you can either take two
approaches<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.780> can<00:02:14.900> play<00:02:15.050> a

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
approaches to this you can play a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.410 
approaches to this you can play a
maximum<00:02:15.650> coverage<00:02:15.980> defense<00:02:16.489> or<00:02:16.670> blitz<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.270> I

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
maximum coverage defense or blitz it I

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.140 
maximum coverage defense or blitz it I
prefer<00:02:17.959> blitzing<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.620> but<00:02:19.430> i'm<00:02:19.640> going<00:02:19.819> to<00:02:20.000> show

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
prefer blitzing it but i'm going to show

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.930 
prefer blitzing it but i'm going to show
you<00:02:20.180> both<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.569> my<00:02:20.930> methods<00:02:21.459> for<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.520> purpose

of<00:02:23.060> this<00:02:23.180> video<00:02:23.420> i<00:02:23.600> chose<00:02:23.989> to<00:02:24.140> six<00:02:24.380> men<00:02:24.560> sugar

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
of this video i chose to six men sugar

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.130 
of this video i chose to six men sugar
blitz<00:02:25.220> but<00:02:25.550> feel<00:02:25.790> free<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:26.270> use<00:02:26.330> whatever<00:02:26.569> man

blitz<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:27.650> like<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.190> bump<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.730> run<00:02:28.910> the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
blitz you like and bump and run the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.900 
blitz you like and bump and run the
receivers<00:02:29.540> on<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.810> outside<00:02:30.370> by<00:02:31.370> bumping<00:02:31.760> and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
receivers on the outside by bumping and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.430 
receivers on the outside by bumping and
running<00:02:32.270> you<00:02:32.390> mess<00:02:32.630> up<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.930> timing<00:02:33.319> between

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
running you mess up the timing between

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.260 
running you mess up the timing between
the<00:02:33.709> receiver<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.400> quarterback<00:02:34.940> so

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
the receiver and the quarterback so

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.670 
the receiver and the quarterback so
hopefully<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:35.810> get<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.050> quarterback<00:02:36.380> to

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
hopefully you get the quarterback to

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.590 
hopefully you get the quarterback to
throw<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:37.160> ball<00:02:37.340> sooner<00:02:37.880> than<00:02:38.030> he's<00:02:38.209> supposed

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
throw the ball sooner than he's supposed

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.160 
throw the ball sooner than he's supposed
to<00:02:38.690> for<00:02:39.019> an<00:02:39.110> easy<00:02:39.440> interception<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.930> can

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
to for an easy interception you can

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.900 
to for an easy interception you can

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
listen to the sermon fine but the earth

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
got gas once it burns is fine some

got gas once it burns is fine some
around<00:02:46.250> me<00:02:46.489> they<00:02:46.670> talk<00:02:46.880> about<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:47.810> is

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
around me they talk about and this is

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.990 
around me they talk about and this is
why<00:02:48.200> i<00:02:48.230> use<00:02:48.590> two<00:02:48.890> methods<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.459> stopping<00:02:49.730> it

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
why i use two methods to stopping it

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.550 
why i use two methods to stopping it
eventually<00:02:50.420> your<00:02:50.750> opponent<00:02:51.080> will<00:02:51.170> be<00:02:51.200> able<00:02:51.470> to

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
eventually your opponent will be able to

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.020 
eventually your opponent will be able to
learn<00:02:51.680> how<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.920> pick<00:02:52.130> up<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.430> Blitz<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:52.819> then

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
learn how to pick up the Blitz and then

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.390 
learn how to pick up the Blitz and then
beat<00:02:53.269> you<00:02:53.450> for<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.780> game<00:02:54.050> so<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:54.890> have<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.220> mix

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
beat you for a game so you have to mix

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.210 
beat you for a game so you have to mix
up<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.730> coverages<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.360> keep<00:02:56.569> him<00:02:56.810> honest<00:02:57.230> my

up the coverages to keep him honest my
other<00:02:58.370> method<00:02:58.910> is<00:02:59.060> out<00:02:59.239> of<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.450> cover<00:02:59.720> for<00:03:00.080> a

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
other method is out of the cover for a

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.590 
other method is out of the cover for a
defense<00:03:00.680> any<00:03:01.010> cover<00:03:01.700> for<00:03:02.000> defense<00:03:02.450> and

whatever<00:03:02.989> formation<00:03:03.620> you're<00:03:03.739> in<00:03:03.890> will<00:03:04.340> do

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
whatever formation you're in will do

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.750 
whatever formation you're in will do
however<00:03:05.269> it's<00:03:06.260> not<00:03:06.500> just<00:03:06.950> cover<00:03:07.250> for<00:03:07.370> that

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
however it's not just cover for that

however it's not just cover for that
gets<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:08.090> done<00:03:08.269> there<00:03:08.630> are<00:03:08.780> some<00:03:08.930> adjustments
