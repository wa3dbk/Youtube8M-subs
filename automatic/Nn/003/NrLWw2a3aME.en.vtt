00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
in all the little gaps and then use a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.529 
in all the little gaps and then use a
brush<00:00:35.929> at<00:00:36.289> the<00:00:36.350> end<00:00:36.559> and<00:00:36.920> blend<00:00:37.519> in<00:00:37.760> and<00:00:38.030> I'm

blending<00:00:41.659> it<00:00:41.719> all<00:00:41.839> together<00:00:42.050> so<00:00:42.350> it<00:00:42.620> has<00:00:42.800> more

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039

of<00:00:43.159> a<00:00:43.249> natural<00:00:43.460> fill<00:00:43.940> because<00:00:44.120> if<00:00:44.390> you<00:00:44.479> use

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
of a natural fill because if you use

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.430 
of a natural fill because if you use
just<00:00:45.229> black<00:00:45.649> it<00:00:46.129> can<00:00:46.429> be<00:00:46.550> quite<00:00:46.819> harsh<00:00:47.170> so<00:00:48.170> I'm

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
just black it can be quite harsh so I'm

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.989
