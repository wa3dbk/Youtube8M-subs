 do you think today of the america the truth 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.560
 that America has improved a lot with 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.930
 Miguel Herrera is a team that always 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.060
 is designed to qualify and to 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.550
 win the title 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.430
 unfortunately good today are better 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.940
 defensively 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.620
 difficult to the characteristics 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.810
 different characteristics that 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.760
 normally the america manages that is 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.970
 a team that usually always 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.030
 attacks that they put 4 but five or 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.560
 six with soy miguel has got a 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.010
 balance is one of the best 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.560
 defenses but do not have the attack people 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.640
 who has done things as they used to 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.400
 not one more question 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.140
 in previous tournaments this team the 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.510
 america these same players only 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.690

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.100
 this is team these players today 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.780
 I have said many times that they are not 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
 players that are games first 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.660
 vision but not players for the america 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.120
 and with plays of many years and knows what 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.370
 what am I telling you these players the 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.260
 80% of those in the template are 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.640
 to play in america with all 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:15.100
 honesty no no no because really 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.650
 well really before you took a 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.880
 follow up and the players more 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.650
 important in Mexican soccer 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.890
 they arrived in america 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.480
 Today, no, no, it has not been like that, it gives me a lot 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.180
 I like someone like Juan Hernández 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.890
 you will seriously 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.090
 not because it matches the thought 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.640
 because I have always said that they are 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.709
 great soccer players players 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.790
 of the first division but not to carry 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:43.069
 a team like america we are 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:46.430
