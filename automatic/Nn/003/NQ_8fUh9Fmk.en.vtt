 if silly presents sant blai der weyden 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.980
 waititi are the most stable for fishing 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:37.170
 and recreation laguneros and silly boats 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.170
 marplatense product for nothing 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.820
 and we continue with all the fishing kayak 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.489
 from our city of Mar del Plata 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.710
 we go to the lighthouse restinga 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.100
 previously we heard Miguel 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.100
 vinciguerra 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.560
 it can get complicated 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.830
 more or less 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.720
 80 meters 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.780
 that we had inside, it looks pretty 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.510
 good 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.190
 we go with heavy equipment glens of 80 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.840
 pounds big wheels 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.800
 of bait 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.240
 we will put a balloon 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.790
 both in a depth of one meter 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.640
 eighty approximately we will locate 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.640
 in the sector of the side of this destination 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.640
 to see if the boys are by 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.120
 area 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.950
 thank you very much Miguel when he mentions 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.380
 the boys he's talking about anymore 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.500
 nor less than the sharks at the back 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.650
 or are you going in search of them in other 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.470
 of the many departures that year after year 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.990
 dare to perform in this case with a 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.990
 strong wave with a succession of 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.679
 breakers important but they are already in 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.950
 the chosen place anchoring their kayaks 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.430
 here between the first and the second 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.220
 restinga heavy equipment images of the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.370
 January 6 and in the report or the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.590
 gift title of kings so I think that 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.400
 we are on the eve of enjoying 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.160
 images of these great sharks that 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.190
 As we always say, they are not offensive 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.260
 for bathers so close to the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.840
 coast but in a strip that exceeds 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.780
 usually the 400 or 500 meters and 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.680
 there has never been any attack 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.410
 here in these latitudes to bathers 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.330
 first capture greetings to the companions 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.390
 of miguel 'vinciguerra 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.970
 leonardo ávalos who made that capture 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.370
 and now an immediate release and 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.800
 also to césar pereyra that we will see 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.890
 in the next block in action by 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.680
 supposed fishing with immediate return 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.630
 we make a new cut we celebrate clear 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.870
 also with these friends then I follow 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.870
 counting 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.450
 with his first note 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.040
 he lost a second Caesar pit and pulled out 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:39.560
 50 meters or so that it came off 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.560
 and it detached him devotes more than hot 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.300
 never better said Miguel that leaves you 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.600
 with some intrigue to know that we were stung 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.890
 that took our line so many meters 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.110
 and we could not nail in this case they were 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.850
 nine spikes in four hours 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.310
 I think he talks clearly about a 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.900
 very important presence of baco you are 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.680
 there in the area of ​​the restinga with 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.260
 conditions that began to deteriorate 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.720
 minute by minute a northwest wind of 40 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.520
 kilometers per hour that generates a large 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.549
 difficulty we are here with men of 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.739
 experience but you know they had 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.450
 to fight usually anchored them 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.730
 they let go with the boat but this 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.670
 wind could have made them run a 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.340
 risk with the boat drifting 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:33.220
 because these drumsticks always take you 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.250
 they do it on the area of ​​stones with the 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.460
 great risk that it generates for what they are 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.680
 doing this fight here in this case I 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.990
 Miguel commented that his fight lasted something 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.930
 more than 30 minutes a boat is already 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.370
 we're going to see it oscillate in the 60's 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.620
 kilograms 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.620
 here we saw in the previous block in cane 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.360
 from leonardo approximately 35 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.360
 kilograms in both cases we are 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.960

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.180
