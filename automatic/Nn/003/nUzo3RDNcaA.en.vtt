00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.230
 Congratulations on moving into the 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.870
 finals 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.250
 You won two to zero yesterday 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.889
 you're in the second half you are 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.830
 get done template made gate 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.790
 how did you love player yes it was not 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.859
 easy game 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.810
 we knew that the Ukrainians after the 3rd 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.720
 9-defeat now do not drive to us 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.800
 and then give it easier and have so 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.269
 he also started the goods again very much 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.730
 very aggressive in the first we have 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.170
 barely had any chances Ukraine too little 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.080
 chances but we stood very well in the back 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.669
 but the game was so slow and yes 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.770
 the second one was a long way off 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.910
 played offensively and then pleased 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.010
 me, of course, that every year 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.960
 was significantly involved in both goals 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.239
 eight teams were now in the finals 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.850
 to the Czech Republic 2015 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.070
 what do you expect the German eleven 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.899
 chances are yes very big 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.550
 the team spirit is just right when we are 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.840
 We all understand each other very well and we 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.610
 just go back to the title too 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.260
 win as we say openly 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.149
 because it's just our goal 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.350
 also be our goal 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.690
 and then what happens there will be 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.730
 I think that is still a lot 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.080
 time to go and then will be 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.790
 A preparation will take place after the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.409
 bundesliga season and that's why we are 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.670
 first of all we satisfied it 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.689
 have made it there and if so 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.640
 so far then have us so 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.320
 and then I am myself 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.909
 sure that we also have the goal 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.100
 to get the title there 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.840
 and if it should work with the title 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.479
 or you at least among the top three 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.040
 would be synonymous olympia 2016 would be in it 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.080
 that for you as german brazilian 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.460
 also an additional dream so clear and 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.190
 then in Rio so in 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.470
 my city is the complete family 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.540
 Of course it's a dream but we know 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.010
 also that it will be back to normal by then 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.330
 is longer and therefore 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.440
 concentrate and then on the first 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.820
 em and then look what we like 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.210
 Do you know your training today? 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.920
 that already 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.500
 yes I will get out with the team 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.430
 go part and then go 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.170
 will the coach decide when i will 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.940
 then it is allowed in and was not for me 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.950
 rather good physically only have one 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.750
 halftime played by therefore I feel 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.979
 luckily, none came back well 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.560
 and then I'm looking forward to it 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.369
 Saturday is the Saturday 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.140

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.950

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.989

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.979

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.850
