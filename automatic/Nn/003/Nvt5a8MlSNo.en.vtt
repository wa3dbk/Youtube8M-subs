00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.040
 teams with android there are many in the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.230
 market but not all have the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.450
 possibility of including a projector 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.700
 Among some of its characteristics I 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.380
 I was just listening to the galaxy here 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.119
 link is a team that was developed 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.189
 by samsung that team has a small 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.290
 projector there we will see it and that 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.419
 belongs to this whole family of 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.300
 the teams galaxy this in particular 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.669
 could be a cousin brother of the galaxy 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.380
 s2 it 's time to tell you a little 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.180
 the external characteristics before 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.710
 go to see how this works 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.019
 projector as well told me of a 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.359
 4 inch screen let's see what 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:42.420
 could do or could many imagine 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.980
 which is robust the equipment measures just 12 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.109
 millimeters thick that we can 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.140
 compare with another phone to make them 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:51.600
 an idea without a amoled screen of 4 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.719
 inches is all along in the part 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.870
 on the right we will find here the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.600
 input for the sd memory we have 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.179
 also the button to block we have 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.470
 another to activate the projector from the side 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:06.630
 left we will have control of 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.909
 input volume to 3.5 for hearing aids 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.819
 and the entrance 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.990
 the card without getting there the phone 

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:14.929
 at the bottom is the entrance 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.060
 microusb and above is where you stay here 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.890
 we can see the projector that is 15 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.719
 elements in the back we're going to 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.280
 find here the camera that is 5 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:23.929
 megapixels is accompanied by a 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.000
 small flash in the front 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:29.509
 we have another camera the front camera 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.609
 which is 1.3 megapixels but low we're going 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.770
 here to unlock it to know the 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:35.450
 operation this equipment uses the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.789
 2.3 Android operating system 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.579
 gingerbread has a processor that 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.379
 runs a giga hertz dual core and already 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.969
 we are seeing a little bit what you want from 

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:45.920
 this operation we have the buttons 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.030
 traditional here the start button 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.280
 that's why he said this day is presented as 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.349
 the galaxy s3 we have a button to return 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.899
 and button also for options like to 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:59.359
 make different editions and we're going to 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.819
 the different pages we can move 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.039
 some of the widgets and we already have pre 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.769
 installed this equipment so that it could 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.390
 serving gives you a choice of can 

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:10.310
 use the camera so you can 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.959
 project when you have some 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.860
 presentation and has a mode too 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.860
 to use 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.600
 is the touch part of the screen 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.400
 as if you were using a mouse over 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.500
 everything can serve you for some 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.620
 Eye presentations should consider 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.150
 that the power of the projector is not 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.730
 enough for a place with a lot 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.680
 lighting here we already saw a bit a 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.300
 example of how a team would be like 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.980
 this one is still not available in 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.870
 Mexico we have it exclusively in the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.820
 universal was an opportunity to 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.010
 review it and when you 're in Mexico 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.840
 we have then we will be realizing 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.490
 that's what has come from a section 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.230
 remember that we see you another Tuesday and 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.730
 Thursday here on the universal tele for 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.730
