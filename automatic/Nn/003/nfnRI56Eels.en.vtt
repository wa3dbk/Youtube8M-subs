you<00:00:06.270> see<00:00:06.480> last<00:00:06.960> time<00:00:07.049> I<00:00:07.170> made<00:00:07.700> these<00:00:08.700> conveyor

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
you see last time I made these conveyor

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.060 
you see last time I made these conveyor
belts<00:00:09.420> which<00:00:09.570> are<00:00:09.690> powered<00:00:09.809> from<00:00:10.080> my<00:00:10.290> battery

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
belts which are powered from my battery

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.150 
belts which are powered from my battery
box<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.460> generator<00:00:11.820> but<00:00:12.599> very<00:00:13.590> nice<00:00:13.830> conveyor

box and generator but very nice conveyor
belts<00:00:14.460> but<00:00:15.299> um<00:00:15.420> it's<00:00:16.080> not<00:00:16.199> much<00:00:16.320> use<00:00:16.619> using

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
belts but um it's not much use using

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.460 
belts but um it's not much use using
them<00:00:17.699> unless<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.029> can<00:00:18.180> put<00:00:18.359> things<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.380> out

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
them unless we can put things in and out

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.099 
them unless we can put things in and out
of<00:00:19.650> chests<00:00:20.220> from<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.210> conveyor<00:00:21.480> belt<00:00:21.539> onto

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
of chests from the conveyor belt onto

of chests from the conveyor belt onto
the<00:00:22.260> conveyor<00:00:22.560> belt<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:23.580> today<00:00:24.090> I'm<00:00:24.240> going<00:00:24.330> to

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the conveyor belt so today I'm going to

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.769 
the conveyor belt so today I'm going to
show<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.539> how<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.810> use<00:00:25.609> manipulators<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
show you how to use manipulators so the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.390 
show you how to use manipulators so the
first<00:00:27.990> thing<00:00:28.199> I'm<00:00:28.260> gonna<00:00:28.380> need<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.740> start

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
first thing I'm gonna need to start

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.910 
first thing I'm gonna need to start
making<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.970> manipulator<00:00:30.619> I'm<00:00:31.619> going<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.800> make

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
making a manipulator I'm going to make

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.639 
making a manipulator I'm going to make
two<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.460> these<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.180> demonstration<00:00:34.079> I

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
two in these in this demonstration I

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.560 
two in these in this demonstration I
only<00:00:35.579> need<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.880> make<00:00:36.440> some<00:00:38.329> dispensers<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
only need to make some dispensers and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.830 
only need to make some dispensers and
that's<00:00:40.410> going<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.860> basis<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.840> let's

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
that's going to be the basis of it let's

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.100 
that's going to be the basis of it let's
make<00:00:42.989> another<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.649> I've<00:00:44.160> got<00:00:44.340> two<00:00:45.110> there

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
make another one so I've got two there

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.500 
make another one so I've got two there
we<00:00:46.200> go<00:00:46.350> two<00:00:46.680> dispensers<00:00:47.219> I'm<00:00:47.910> gonna<00:00:48.239> move<00:00:48.420> over

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
we go two dispensers I'm gonna move over

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.150 
we go two dispensers I'm gonna move over
here<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:49.050> got<00:00:49.140> some<00:00:49.320> bronze<00:00:49.590> I'm<00:00:49.920> not<00:00:50.070> really

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
here we got some bronze I'm not really

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.260 
here we got some bronze I'm not really
sure<00:00:50.309> how<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.489> make<00:00:50.700> bronze<00:00:50.940> because<00:00:51.180> I've

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
sure how to make bronze because I've

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.889 
sure how to make bronze because I've
shown<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.600> already<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.680> previous<00:00:53.129> videos

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
shown that already in previous videos

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.750 
shown that already in previous videos
and<00:00:54.899> also<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.800> look<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.100> yourself<00:00:56.520> I'm

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
and also you can look it up yourself I'm

and also you can look it up yourself I'm
sure<00:00:56.960> you've<00:00:57.960> got<00:00:58.079> two<00:00:58.199> bronze<00:00:58.500> plates<00:00:58.829> like

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
sure you've got two bronze plates like

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.840 
sure you've got two bronze plates like
that<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.640> 2x2<00:01:00.570> square<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.670> next

thing we're going to do is we're going
to<00:01:04.290> make<00:01:04.379> some<00:01:04.710> insulated<00:01:05.580> copper<00:01:05.760> wire<00:01:05.909> so

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
to make some insulated copper wire so

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.760 
to make some insulated copper wire so
we're<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.540> take<00:01:06.659> some<00:01:06.869> copper<00:01:07.380> ingots

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
we're going to take some copper ingots

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:18.480 
we're going to take some copper ingots
and<00:01:07.920> some<00:01:08.220> leather<00:01:11.720> like<00:01:12.720> so

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.890 

I<00:01:18.520> don't<00:01:19.180> know<00:01:19.240> I<00:01:19.270> had<00:01:19.420> so<00:01:19.540> much<00:01:19.659> leather

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
I don't know I had so much leather

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.539 
I don't know I had so much leather
actually<00:01:20.110> to<00:01:20.350> be<00:01:20.440> honest<00:01:20.650> I<00:01:20.860> didn't<00:01:21.250> need<00:01:21.340> that

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
actually to be honest I didn't need that

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.260 
actually to be honest I didn't need that
didn't<00:01:22.240> need<00:01:22.299> that<00:01:22.479> much<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.670> here<00:01:24.820> we<00:01:24.970> go<00:01:25.060> and

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
I'm also going to convert them from this

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.740 
I'm also going to convert them from this
kind<00:01:26.619> of<00:01:26.770> copper<00:01:27.159> wire<00:01:27.430> to<00:01:27.729> this<00:01:28.390> kind<00:01:28.630> of

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
kind of copper wire to this kind of

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.260 
kind of copper wire to this kind of
copper<00:01:29.050> wire<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.610> next<00:01:30.760> I'm<00:01:30.970> going<00:01:31.030> to<00:01:31.150> make

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
copper wire so next I'm going to make

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.810 
copper wire so next I'm going to make
some<00:01:31.780> advanced<00:01:32.170> circuits<00:01:32.770> so<00:01:33.220> in<00:01:33.460> addition<00:01:33.640> to

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820

some advanced circuits so in addition to
the<00:01:34.030> wire<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.810> bronze<00:01:35.020> plates<00:01:35.350> I've<00:01:35.500> got

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
the wire and the bronze plates I've got

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.290 
the wire and the bronze plates I've got
a<00:01:35.680> need<00:01:36.040> eight<00:01:36.280> redstone<00:01:36.850> for<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.150> two

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
a need eight redstone for the two

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.260 
a need eight redstone for the two
circuits<00:01:37.750> I'm<00:01:37.869> gonna<00:01:37.990> make<00:01:38.200> I<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.970> gonna<00:01:40.119> put

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
circuits I'm gonna make I so gonna put

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.109 
circuits I'm gonna make I so gonna put

the<00:01:43.210> two<00:01:43.360> sides<00:01:44.520> oh<00:01:45.810> I'm<00:01:46.810> good<00:01:46.990> enough<00:01:47.050> wire

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
the two sides oh I'm good enough wire

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.740 
the two sides oh I'm good enough wire
actually<00:01:47.530> I<00:01:47.890> notice<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.850> can<00:01:49.390> go<00:01:49.450> back<00:01:49.600> in<00:01:49.690> a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
actually I notice I can go back in a

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.900 
actually I notice I can go back in a
minute<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.409> I've<00:01:50.710> got<00:01:50.890> one<00:01:51.100> basic<00:01:51.490> circuit

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
minute and I've got one basic circuit

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.870 
minute and I've got one basic circuit
I'm<00:01:52.539> just<00:01:52.750> gonna<00:01:53.490> drop<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.520> there<00:01:54.640> for<00:01:54.850> a

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
I'm just gonna drop that there for a

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.160 
I'm just gonna drop that there for a
second<00:01:55.149> I<00:01:55.179> know<00:01:55.240> for<00:01:55.509> a<00:01:55.539> fact<00:01:55.660> I've<00:01:55.840> got<00:01:55.990> some

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
second I know for a fact I've got some

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.950 
second I know for a fact I've got some
more<00:01:56.729> wire<00:01:57.729> here<00:01:58.179> just<00:01:58.810> need<00:01:58.929> a<00:01:58.990> couple<00:01:59.170> more

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
more wire here just need a couple more

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.830 
more wire here just need a couple more
so<00:02:01.960> there<00:02:02.080> we<00:02:02.140> go<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:03.420> put<00:02:04.420> them<00:02:04.539> in<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.690> right

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
so there we go I put them in the right

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.919 
so there we go I put them in the right
place<00:02:05.080> bronze<00:02:05.530> in<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.770> middle<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.720> full

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
place bronze in the middle and the full

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.960 
place bronze in the middle and the full
redstone<00:02:08.380> in<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.100> remaining<00:02:09.459> spaces<00:02:09.700> we've

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
redstone in the remaining spaces we've

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.479 
redstone in the remaining spaces we've
got<00:02:10.090> two<00:02:10.239> basic<00:02:10.690> circuits<00:02:11.140> it's<00:02:12.040> very<00:02:12.190> simple

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
got two basic circuits it's very simple

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.650 
got two basic circuits it's very simple
to<00:02:12.790> convert<00:02:13.540> dispensers<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.790> manipulators<00:02:15.790> we

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
to convert dispensers to manipulators we

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.410 
to convert dispensers to manipulators we
put<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.900> dispensers<00:02:17.410> there<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:19.000> basic

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
put the dispensers there and the basic

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.210 
put the dispensers there and the basic
circuits<00:02:19.780> there<00:02:19.959> in<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.170> middle<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.590> we've

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
circuits there in the middle and we've

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.280 
circuits there in the middle and we've
got<00:02:21.340> manipulators<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.690> there<00:02:22.840> we<00:02:22.930> go

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
got manipulators so there we go

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.100 
got manipulators so there we go
we've<00:02:23.530> got<00:02:23.650> two<00:02:23.799> of<00:02:23.829> those<00:02:24.720> levers<00:02:25.720> don't<00:02:25.989> want

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
we've got two of those levers don't want

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.830 
we've got two of those levers don't want
that<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:28.260> they<00:02:29.260> look<00:02:29.380> kind<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:29.590> interesting<00:02:29.680> Oh

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
that so they look kind of interesting Oh

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.600 
that so they look kind of interesting Oh
quite<00:02:31.840> cool<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:33.130> matching<00:02:33.430> where<00:02:33.549> the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
quite cool and matching where the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.470 
quite cool and matching where the
conveyor<00:02:33.850> belt<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.120> I'm<00:02:34.180> just<00:02:34.299> going<00:02:34.450> to

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
conveyor belt so I'm just going to

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.150 
conveyor belt so I'm just going to
actually<00:02:34.570> get<00:02:35.200> this<00:02:35.380> stuff<00:02:35.650> out<00:02:35.769> here<00:02:35.950> cuz<00:02:36.100> I'm

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
actually get this stuff out here cuz I'm

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.250 
actually get this stuff out here cuz I'm
going<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.340> need<00:02:36.430> this<00:02:36.579> in<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.820> minute<00:02:37.110> break<00:02:38.110> it

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
going to need this in a minute break it

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.090 
going to need this in a minute break it
with<00:02:38.380> my<00:02:38.500> paxil<00:02:38.950> there<00:02:39.880> we<00:02:39.940> go

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
with my paxil there we go

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.100 
with my paxil there we go
so<00:02:42.100> as<00:02:42.430> with<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.030> conveyor<00:02:43.450> belts<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.930> see

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
so as with the conveyor belts you see

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.860 
so as with the conveyor belts you see
we've<00:02:44.500> got<00:02:44.620> these<00:02:44.739> powered<00:02:45.100> from<00:02:45.190> below<00:02:45.870> now

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
we've got these powered from below now

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.210 
we've got these powered from below now
we're<00:02:47.019> going<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.170> do<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.410> same<00:02:47.650> with<00:02:48.070> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
we're going to do the same with the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.289 
we're going to do the same with the
manipulators<00:02:49.079> so<00:02:50.079> I'm<00:02:50.230> going<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:51.090> put<00:02:52.090> some

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
manipulators so I'm going to put some

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.550 
manipulators so I'm going to put some
wire<00:02:52.510> there<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:55.570> put<00:02:55.780> my<00:02:55.900> manipulator<00:02:56.410> on

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
wire there and I put my manipulator on

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.050 
wire there and I put my manipulator on
top<00:02:56.739> now<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:57.459> can<00:02:57.579> see<00:02:57.670> it's<00:02:57.790> facing<00:02:57.940> the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
top now you can see it's facing the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.840 
top now you can see it's facing the
wrong<00:02:58.209> way<00:02:58.269> so<00:02:58.480> we<00:02:58.720> get<00:02:58.840> our<00:02:58.959> wrench<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.850> we

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
wrong way so we get our wrench and we

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.610 
wrong way so we get our wrench and we
right-click<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:01.720> now<00:03:02.260> it's<00:03:02.410> going<00:03:02.560> the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
right-click it and now it's going the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.060 
right-click it and now it's going the
other<00:03:02.650> way

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
other way

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.759 
other way
you'll<00:03:03.489> notice<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.760> arrow<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.359> facing<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:05.440> as

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
you'll notice that arrow is facing in as

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.360 
you'll notice that arrow is facing in as
if<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.489> can<00:03:06.700> absorb<00:03:07.030> items<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.980> if<00:03:09.100> we're<00:03:09.280> gonna

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
if it can absorb items so if we're gonna

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.640 
if it can absorb items so if we're gonna
we're<00:03:09.640> going<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.850> hold<00:03:10.000> shift<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.810> right

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
we're going to hold shift and right

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.289 
we're going to hold shift and right
click<00:03:11.709> while<00:03:12.070> holding<00:03:12.100> shift<00:03:12.459> we<00:03:13.030> have<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.209> do

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
click while holding shift we have to do

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.210 
click while holding shift we have to do
it<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.420> couple<00:03:13.570> of<00:03:13.660> times<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.799> can<00:03:14.980> see<00:03:15.100> it's

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
it a couple of times and I can see it's

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.810 
it a couple of times and I can see it's
facing<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.519> same<00:03:15.730> ways<00:03:15.940> these<00:03:16.150> other<00:03:16.359> arrows

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
facing the same ways these other arrows

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.720 
facing the same ways these other arrows
and<00:03:18.820> that<00:03:19.299> is<00:03:19.480> um<00:03:20.010> that's<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.160> setup<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.579> need

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
and that is um that's the setup I need

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.490 
and that is um that's the setup I need
to<00:03:21.820> do<00:03:21.910> for<00:03:22.120> that<00:03:22.180> now<00:03:22.600> I'm<00:03:22.690> going<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.870> put<00:03:23.019> an

block<00:03:50.940> here<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.770> put<00:03:52.770> another<00:03:52.920> bit<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.160> cable<00:03:53.550> so

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
block here I put another bit of cable so

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.630 
block here I put another bit of cable so
that<00:03:54.209> we<00:03:54.420> can<00:03:54.569> get<00:03:54.720> more<00:03:55.040> power<00:03:56.040> up<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.370> end

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
that we can get more power up this end

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.080 
that we can get more power up this end
and<00:03:57.209> I<00:03:57.390> put<00:03:57.420> my<00:03:57.690> other<00:03:57.810> manipulator<00:03:58.410> there

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
and I put my other manipulator there

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.820 
and I put my other manipulator there
again<00:04:00.090> face<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.569> around<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.780> right<00:04:00.900> way<00:04:00.959> they

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
again face it around the right way they

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.160 
again face it around the right way they
notice<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.310> default<00:04:02.670> way<00:04:02.910> is<00:04:03.269> right<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:03.989> put

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
notice the default way is right to put

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.140 
notice the default way is right to put
stuff<00:04:04.319> in<00:04:04.530> two<00:04:04.680> chests<00:04:05.130> so<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:05.670> don't<00:04:05.880> need<00:04:06.000> to

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
stuff in two chests so I don't need to

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.790 
stuff in two chests so I don't need to
change<00:04:06.600> what<00:04:06.810> direction<00:04:07.110> that's<00:04:07.440> that's

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
change what direction that's that's

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.180 
change what direction that's that's
working<00:04:08.370> in<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.810> I'm<00:04:09.930> gonna<00:04:10.080> put<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.500> chest

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
working in and I'm gonna put a chest

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.789 
working in and I'm gonna put a chest
there<00:04:12.230> so<00:04:13.230> that<00:04:13.380> means<00:04:14.840> if<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:16.079> activate<00:04:16.680> this

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
there so that means if I activate this

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.190 
there so that means if I activate this
with<00:04:16.979> some<00:04:17.100> redstone<00:04:17.329> it's<00:04:18.329> gonna<00:04:18.570> go<00:04:18.959> a

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
with some redstone it's gonna go a

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.979 
with some redstone it's gonna go a
longer<00:04:19.500> conveyor<00:04:19.859> belt<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.340> into<00:04:20.489> there<00:04:20.989> so

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
longer conveyor belt and into there so

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.930 
longer conveyor belt and into there so
it's<00:04:22.290> very<00:04:22.410> convenient<00:04:22.800> if<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.190> there's<00:04:23.820> no

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
it's very convenient if I there's no

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.000 
it's very convenient if I there's no
chest<00:04:24.210> there<00:04:24.479> then<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.780> will<00:04:24.900> I'll<00:04:25.740> show<00:04:25.919> you

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
chest there then it will I'll show you

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.920 
chest there then it will I'll show you
what<00:04:26.160> it<00:04:26.250> will<00:04:26.340> do<00:04:29.419> now<00:04:30.419> you<00:04:30.479> can<00:04:30.630> make<00:04:30.780> an

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
what it will do now you can make an

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.020 
what it will do now you can make an
automated<00:04:31.229> system<00:04:31.530> just<00:04:32.040> to<00:04:32.130> press<00:04:32.610> the

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
automated system just to press the

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.670 
automated system just to press the
redstone<00:04:33.389> all<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.630> time<00:04:33.810> on<00:04:33.990> on<00:04:34.229> its<00:04:34.380> own<00:04:34.500> but

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
redstone all the time on on its own but

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.340 
redstone all the time on on its own but
you<00:04:34.740> see<00:04:34.890> it<00:04:34.950> just<00:04:35.070> drops<00:04:35.280> it<00:04:35.430> on<00:04:35.520> behind<00:04:35.880> there

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
you see it just drops it on behind there

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.520 
you see it just drops it on behind there
and<00:04:37.350> it<00:04:37.470> should<00:04:37.800> if<00:04:38.340> I'm<00:04:38.550> correct<00:04:39.169> if<00:04:40.169> I<00:04:40.289> drop<00:04:40.500> a

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
and it should if I'm correct if I drop a

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.830 
and it should if I'm correct if I drop a
couple<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.830> items<00:04:40.979> down<00:04:41.340> there<00:04:41.630> you<00:04:42.630> should<00:04:42.690> be

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
couple of items down there you should be

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.690 
couple of items down there you should be
able<00:04:42.930> to<00:04:43.080> suck<00:04:43.350> them<00:04:44.720> no<00:04:45.720> maybe<00:04:46.050> not<00:04:46.430> okay<00:04:47.430> well
