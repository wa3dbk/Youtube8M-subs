00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100 
all right first of all a little bit of

introduction<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:12.420> rc6

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
introduction the rc6

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.240 
introduction the rc6
n42<00:00:13.820> was<00:00:14.179> a<00:00:14.210> model<00:00:14.630> made<00:00:14.840> in<00:00:14.960> 1995<00:00:15.740> they<00:00:15.980> came

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
n42 was a model made in 1995 they came

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.570 
n42 was a model made in 1995 they came
off<00:00:16.430> that<00:00:16.700> they<00:00:16.910> are<00:00:17.360> RB<00:00:18.080> 67<00:00:18.950> which<00:00:19.189> stands<00:00:19.520> for

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
off that they are RB 67 which stands for

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.100 
off that they are RB 67 which stands for
revolving<00:00:20.119> back<00:00:20.300> because<00:00:20.630> the<00:00:20.750> back<00:00:20.900> actually

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
revolving back because the back actually

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.200 
revolving back because the back actually
terms<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:22.009> you<00:00:22.189> can<00:00:22.340> shoot<00:00:22.490> in<00:00:22.640> landscape<00:00:23.060> or

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
terms and you can shoot in landscape or

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.060 
terms and you can shoot in landscape or
portrait<00:00:23.240> mode<00:00:23.720> without<00:00:24.169> turning<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:24.619> camera

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
portrait mode without turning the camera

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.099 
portrait mode without turning the camera
so<00:00:26.060> our<00:00:26.570> C<00:00:27.169> 67<00:00:27.830> came<00:00:27.980> in<00:00:28.510> 1970<00:00:29.510> and<00:00:29.660> then<00:00:29.779> after

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
so our C 67 came in 1970 and then after

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.810 
so our C 67 came in 1970 and then after
that<00:00:30.289> they<00:00:30.470> came<00:00:30.619> out<00:00:30.830> the<00:00:31.010> pro<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:31.580> then

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
that they came out the pro and then

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.090 
that they came out the pro and then
later<00:00:32.059> on<00:00:32.150> the<00:00:32.390> pro<00:00:32.599> to<00:00:32.980> 1995<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.280> then<00:00:34.940> until

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
later on the pro to 1995 and then until

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.390 
later on the pro to 1995 and then until
2004<00:00:37.100> 2005<00:00:37.820> they<00:00:38.860> are<00:00:40.420> 67<00:00:41.420> pro<00:00:41.600> 2d<00:00:42.080> came<00:00:42.650> for

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
2004 2005 they are 67 pro 2d came for

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.049 
2004 2005 they are 67 pro 2d came for
the<00:00:43.610> for<00:00:44.269> the<00:00:45.159> application<00:00:46.159> of<00:00:46.250> digital<00:00:46.549> packs

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
the for the application of digital packs

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.610 
the for the application of digital packs
but<00:00:47.299> these<00:00:47.479> digital<00:00:47.839> box<00:00:48.049> are<00:00:48.260> only<00:00:48.409> the

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
but these digital box are only the

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.460 
but these digital box are only the
Mamiya<00:00:48.920> one<00:00:49.280> so<00:00:49.870> if<00:00:50.870> you<00:00:51.049> want<00:00:51.260> to<00:00:51.350> use<00:00:51.440> a

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
Mamiya one so if you want to use a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.090 
Mamiya one so if you want to use a
digital<00:00:51.769> bag<00:00:52.159> that<00:00:52.460> is<00:00:52.580> let's<00:00:52.940> say<00:00:53.000> purely<00:00:53.570> for

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
digital bag that is let's say purely for

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.500 
digital bag that is let's say purely for
phase<00:00:55.100> one<00:00:55.369> then<00:00:55.670> you<00:00:55.850> don't<00:00:56.030> need<00:00:56.180> to<00:00:56.299> get<00:00:56.449> the

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
phase one then you don't need to get the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.049 
phase one then you don't need to get the
the<00:00:57.049> pro<00:00:57.229> 2d<00:00:57.680> that's<00:00:58.010> a<00:00:58.190> very<00:00:58.400> important<00:00:58.909> thing

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
the pro 2d that's a very important thing

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.759 
the pro 2d that's a very important thing
and<00:00:59.390> that's<00:00:59.839> what<00:00:59.989> made<00:01:00.140> me<00:01:00.260> choose<00:01:00.440> on<00:01:00.619> this

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
and that's what made me choose on this

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.859 
and that's what made me choose on this
camera<00:01:01.040> because<00:01:01.190> between<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.299> pro<00:01:02.449> 2<00:01:02.659> and<00:01:02.809> the

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:02.869 
camera because between the pro 2 and the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:04.780 
camera because between the pro 2 and the
pro<00:01:03.049> 2d<00:01:03.350> there<00:01:03.530> is<00:01:03.650> really<00:01:03.890> not<00:01:04.010> much<00:01:04.220> big<00:01:04.519> of<00:01:04.670> a

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
pro 2d there is really not much big of a

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.539 
pro 2d there is really not much big of a
difference<00:01:05.110> between<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.799> mechanics<00:01:07.340> and

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
difference between the the mechanics and

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.460 
difference between the the mechanics and
the<00:01:07.729> electronics<00:01:08.360> it<00:01:08.630> is<00:01:08.840> there<00:01:09.049> only<00:01:09.200> has

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
the electronics it is there only has

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.010 
the electronics it is there only has
several<00:01:09.920> adapters<00:01:10.909> over<00:01:11.150> here<00:01:11.390> to<00:01:11.570> put<00:01:11.720> and

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
several adapters over here to put and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.420 
several adapters over here to put and
I'll<00:01:12.229> show<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:12.439> how<00:01:12.650> to<00:01:12.710> connect<00:01:13.070> that<00:01:13.130> later

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
I'll show you how to connect that later

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.140 
I'll show you how to connect that later
on<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:15.560> basic<00:01:15.860> difference<00:01:16.220> between<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.549> RB

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
on the basic difference between the RB

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.279 
on the basic difference between the RB
and<00:01:17.450> RC<00:01:17.509> 67<00:01:18.409> is<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.429> r67<00:01:20.240> has<00:01:20.539> all<00:01:21.109> the

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
and RC 67 is that the r67 has all the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.099 
and RC 67 is that the r67 has all the
mechanical<00:01:21.829> parts<00:01:21.859> that<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.340> RB<00:01:22.700> has<00:01:22.969> but<00:01:23.840> it

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:24.109 
mechanical parts that the RB has but it

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.480 
mechanical parts that the RB has but it
has<00:01:24.350> an<00:01:24.500> electronic<00:01:25.070> shooter<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:26.359> transmits

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
has an electronic shooter that transmits

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.130 
has an electronic shooter that transmits
exposure<00:01:28.490> data<00:01:28.880> like<00:01:29.299> all<00:01:29.509> the<00:01:29.630> elements<00:01:29.990> can

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
exposure data like all the elements can

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.069 
exposure data like all the elements can
transmit<00:01:30.499> exposure<00:01:30.890> data<00:01:31.159> so<00:01:31.429> when<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.840> lens

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
transmit exposure data so when the lens

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.010 
transmit exposure data so when the lens
can<00:01:33.289> source<00:01:33.530> be<00:01:33.649> disclosure<00:01:34.039> to<00:01:34.520> the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
can source be disclosure to the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.510 
can source be disclosure to the
viewfinder<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.530> stuff<00:01:36.950> like<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:37.310> so<00:01:37.460> you

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
viewfinder and stuff like that so you

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.389 
viewfinder and stuff like that so you
can<00:01:37.609> shoot<00:01:37.969> in<00:01:38.119> like<00:01:38.359> automatic<00:01:38.960> mode<00:01:39.170> also<00:01:39.920> if

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
can shoot in like automatic mode also if

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.440 
can shoot in like automatic mode also if
you<00:01:40.880> want<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:41.179> get<00:01:41.359> the<00:01:41.859> ARB<00:01:43.030> consider<00:01:44.030> that<00:01:44.299> is

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
you want to get the ARB consider that is

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.539 
you want to get the ARB consider that is
all<00:01:44.960> made<00:01:45.200> of<00:01:45.350> metal<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:45.920> this<00:01:46.100> one<00:01:46.340> has

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
all made of metal and this one has

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.609 
all made of metal and this one has
plastic<00:01:46.850> outside<00:01:47.479> it's<00:01:48.109> pretty<00:01:48.380> rigid

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
plastic outside it's pretty rigid

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.880 
plastic outside it's pretty rigid
plastic<00:01:49.249> and<00:01:49.429> it<00:01:49.670> stands<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.999> lot<00:01:50.179> but<00:01:50.590> in<00:01:51.590> its

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
plastic and it stands a lot but in its

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.940 
plastic and it stands a lot but in its
light<00:01:52.069> way<00:01:52.310> this<00:01:52.939> will<00:01:53.149> be<00:01:53.359> just<00:01:53.929> just<00:01:54.409> over<00:01:54.679> 5

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
light way this will be just just over 5

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.690 
light way this will be just just over 5
pounds<00:01:55.840> where<00:01:56.840> they<00:01:57.049> were<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.530> RB<00:01:58.039> is<00:01:58.249> way

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
pounds where they were the RB is way

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.239 
pounds where they were the RB is way
more<00:01:58.909> heavier<00:01:59.509> and<00:01:59.689> it's<00:02:00.289> completely<00:02:00.710> manual

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249 
more heavier and it's completely manual

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:04.090 
more heavier and it's completely manual
and<00:02:01.999> this<00:02:02.539> one<00:02:02.929> would<00:02:03.319> be<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.679> only<00:02:03.799> one<00:02:04.069> that

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
and this one would be the only one that

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.639 
and this one would be the only one that
you<00:02:04.280> can<00:02:04.340> put<00:02:04.609> digital<00:02:04.969> backs<00:02:05.179> on<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:06.109> I<00:02:06.530> don't

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
you can put digital backs on so I don't

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.969 
you can put digital backs on so I don't
know<00:02:07.009> why<00:02:07.420> some<00:02:08.420> may<00:02:08.929> like<00:02:09.140> to<00:02:09.170> have<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.649> RB

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
know why some may like to have the RB

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.080 
know why some may like to have the RB
but<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:12.010> really<00:02:13.010> like<00:02:13.160> this<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.490> mean<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.760> is<00:02:13.880> big

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
but I really like this I mean it is big

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.330 
but I really like this I mean it is big
enough<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.690> it's<00:02:14.900> heavy<00:02:15.140> enough<00:02:15.410> that<00:02:15.470> that

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
enough and it's heavy enough that that

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.280 
enough and it's heavy enough that that
doesn't<00:02:16.850> make<00:02:16.970> me<00:02:17.180> want<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:17.510> get<00:02:17.900> something

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
doesn't make me want to get something

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.570 
doesn't make me want to get something
else<00:02:18.440> that<00:02:18.680> is<00:02:18.850> more<00:02:19.850> difficult<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.930> shoot

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
else that is more difficult to shoot

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.930 
else that is more difficult to shoot
besides<00:02:22.580> there<00:02:23.330> are<00:02:23.450> C<00:02:23.600> 67<00:02:24.170> Pro<00:02:24.470> -<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:25.490> came<00:02:25.760> out

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
besides there are C 67 Pro - it came out

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.160 
besides there are C 67 Pro - it came out
with<00:02:26.120> this

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
with this

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.690 
with this
the<00:02:27.710> fine-tuned<00:02:29.770> knob<00:02:30.770> over<00:02:31.070> here

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
the fine-tuned knob over here

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.480 
the fine-tuned knob over here
and<00:02:32.180> we'll<00:02:32.960> go<00:02:33.110> into<00:02:33.140> details<00:02:33.770> of<00:02:34.070> all<00:02:34.280> that

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
and we'll go into details of all that

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.210 
and we'll go into details of all that
stuff<00:02:34.580> later<00:02:34.880> on<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:36.170> basically<00:02:36.740> that<00:02:36.950> that's

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
stuff later on so basically that that's

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.840 
stuff later on so basically that that's
it

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
it

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.710 
it
then<00:02:38.390> this<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:41.090> is<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.330> way<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.570> it

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
then this is this is the way that it

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.770 
then this is this is the way that it
focus<00:02:42.080> with<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.530> with<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.860> bellows<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:44.600> the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
focus with the with the bellows so the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.660 
focus with the with the bellows so the
lensman<00:02:45.080> moves<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:45.680> because<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.520> lens

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
lensman moves in because the lens

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.490 
lensman moves in because the lens
separates<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.180> lot<00:02:47.330> from<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.660> back<00:02:47.840> you're

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
separates a lot from the back you're

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.740 
separates a lot from the back you're
gonna<00:02:48.620> get<00:02:48.890> them<00:02:49.130> some<00:02:49.550> loosing<00:02:50.150> of<00:02:50.480> light

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
gonna get them some loosing of light

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.650 
gonna get them some loosing of light
here<00:02:51.290> all<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.400> way<00:02:52.550> up<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.940> one<00:02:53.270> stop

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
here all the way up to one stop

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.050 
here all the way up to one stop
according<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.710> this<00:02:54.800> graph<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.880> can<00:02:55.910> see

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
according to this graph and you can see

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.330 
according to this graph and you can see
the<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.900> lenses<00:02:57.260> over<00:02:57.380> here<00:02:57.650> in<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:57.860> graph<00:02:58.070> so

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
the the lenses over here in the graph so

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.890 
the the lenses over here in the graph so
well<00:02:58.490> but<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:58.760> will<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:59.030> will<00:02:59.150> tell<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.570> how

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
well but it will it will tell you how

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.600 
well but it will it will tell you how
much<00:03:00.050> you're<00:03:00.200> losing<00:03:00.470> but<00:03:00.830> also<00:03:00.980> because<00:03:01.490> of

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
much you're losing but also because of

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.970 
much you're losing but also because of
that<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:01.940> can<00:03:02.120> focus<00:03:02.330> really<00:03:02.780> close<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.860> the

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
that you can focus really close to the

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.740 
that you can focus really close to the
lens<00:03:04.840> all<00:03:05.840> this<00:03:06.110> is<00:03:06.260> some<00:03:07.180> adapters<00:03:08.180> like<00:03:08.240> the

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
lens all this is some adapters like the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.280 
lens all this is some adapters like the
bellows<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:10.060> winder<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.450> I'll

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
bellows and the winder and I'll

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.790 
bellows and the winder and I'll
disassemble<00:03:12.620> it<00:03:12.980> later<00:03:13.160> on<00:03:13.990> also<00:03:14.990> this<00:03:15.590> one

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
disassemble it later on also this one

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.020 
disassemble it later on also this one
will<00:03:16.010> be<00:03:16.160> able<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.640> shoot<00:03:18.100> from<00:03:19.100> four<00:03:19.459> seconds

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
will be able to shoot from four seconds

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.380 
will be able to shoot from four seconds
or<00:03:20.480> eight<00:03:20.720> seconds<00:03:21.200> all<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.740> way<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.520> one<00:03:23.030> four

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
or eight seconds all the way to one four

what that means

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.540 
what that means
that<00:03:37.580> it<00:03:37.820> will<00:03:38.000> be<00:03:38.209> on<00:03:38.480> our<00:03:38.980> strobe<00:03:39.980> mode<00:03:40.250> where

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
that it will be on our strobe mode where

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.600 
that it will be on our strobe mode where
you<00:03:40.670> can<00:03:40.850> just<00:03:41.120> like<00:03:41.300> hold<00:03:41.600> it<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.370> as<00:03:43.370> long<00:03:43.430> as

has<00:04:25.850> eight<00:04:26.090> telephoto<00:04:26.660> lenses<00:04:27.110> 150<00:04:27.740> 180<00:04:28.010> 210

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
has eight telephoto lenses 150 180 210

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.420 
has eight telephoto lenses 150 180 210
250<00:04:29.600> 350<00:04:30.020> 360<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:31.040> 500<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:33.040> that<00:04:34.040> will<00:04:34.160> be<00:04:34.280> the

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
250 350 360 and 500 and that will be the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.909 
250 350 360 and 500 and that will be the
longest<00:04:34.760> one<00:04:35.030> so<00:04:35.900> it<00:04:36.410> will<00:04:36.620> be<00:04:36.770> like

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
longest one so it will be like

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.469 
longest one so it will be like
equivalent<00:04:37.310> to<00:04:37.990> 238

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
equivalent to 238

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.469 
equivalent to 238
in<00:04:40.229> the<00:04:40.469> under<00:04:40.919> 35<00:04:41.309> millimeter<00:04:41.729> cameras<00:04:42.210> and

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
in the under 35 millimeter cameras and

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.110 
in the under 35 millimeter cameras and
it<00:04:42.870> has<00:04:42.990> seven<00:04:43.349> speciality<00:04:43.919> lens<00:04:44.129> but<00:04:44.789> only

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
it has seven speciality lens but only

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.749 
it has seven speciality lens but only
one<00:04:45.360> lens<00:04:45.599> has<00:04:45.809> actually<00:04:46.199> assume<00:04:46.529> lens<00:04:46.860> so<00:04:47.460> all

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
one lens has actually assume lens so all

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.850 
one lens has actually assume lens so all
of<00:04:47.969> the<00:04:48.120> lens<00:04:48.330> that<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.659> dis<00:04:48.839> have<00:04:49.050> 20<00:04:49.469> lenses

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
of the lens that the dis have 20 lenses

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.480 
of the lens that the dis have 20 lenses
are<00:04:49.979> fixed<00:04:50.370> and<00:04:50.490> they're<00:04:50.639> just<00:04:50.789> one<00:04:51.029> lens<00:04:51.330> is

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
are fixed and they're just one lens is

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.879 
are fixed and they're just one lens is
assume<00:04:53.490> lens<00:04:53.759> to<00:04:53.909> go<00:04:54.029> from<00:04:54.360> 100<00:04:54.569> to<00:04:54.930> 200<00:04:55.680> and

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
assume lens to go from 100 to 200 and

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.559 
assume lens to go from 100 to 200 and
that's<00:04:56.580> like<00:04:57.029> a<00:04:57.469> shotgun<00:04:58.469> kind<00:04:58.979> of<00:04:59.569> zooming

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
that's like a shotgun kind of zooming

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:10.549 
that's like a shotgun kind of zooming
lens<00:05:04.099> so<00:05:05.099> I<00:05:05.129> guess<00:05:06.559> we<00:05:07.559> can<00:05:07.710> go<00:05:07.830> ahead<00:05:08.129> and<00:05:09.559> and

00:05:10.549 --> 00:05:10.559 
lens so I guess we can go ahead and and

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:14.029 
lens so I guess we can go ahead and and
go<00:05:10.770> for<00:05:10.979> a<00:05:11.009> more<00:05:11.279> in<00:05:11.610> detail
