00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
happened of course not in that epic form

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.730 
happened of course not in that epic form
where<00:02:59.940> you're<00:03:00.060> cutting<00:03:00.720> down<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.170> Nazi<00:03:01.530> flag

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
where you're cutting down the Nazi flag

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.420

that<00:03:11.070> would<00:03:11.190> be<00:03:11.310> great<00:03:11.670> game<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.180> have<00:03:12.360> with

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
that would be great game to have with

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.510 
that would be great game to have with
all<00:03:12.780> those<00:03:12.930> weapons<00:03:13.200> world<00:03:13.770> war<00:03:13.950> two<00:03:14.130> weapons

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
all those weapons world war two weapons

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.060 
all those weapons world war two weapons
the<00:03:14.850> campaign<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.660> then<00:03:16.140> zombies<00:03:16.710> as<00:03:16.860> well

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
the campaign and then zombies as well

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.310 
the campaign and then zombies as well
having<00:03:17.760> those<00:03:18.030> old<00:03:18.300> characters<00:03:18.870> back<00:03:19.110> would

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
having those old characters back would

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.580 
having those old characters back would
fit<00:03:19.560> in<00:03:19.710> perfectly<00:03:19.940> but<00:03:20.940> say<00:03:21.480> we<00:03:21.690> don't<00:03:22.020> get<00:03:22.320> a

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
fit in perfectly but say we don't get a

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.550 
fit in perfectly but say we don't get a
world<00:03:23.070> at<00:03:23.310> war<00:03:23.340> two<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:23.820> we<00:03:24.300> get<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.570> black<00:03:25.200> ops

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
world at war two and we get a black ops

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.880 
world at war two and we get a black ops
3<00:03:26.130> now<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.670> black<00:03:27.240> ops<00:03:27.480> 3<00:03:27.840> would<00:03:27.990> probably<00:03:28.020> have

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
3 now a black ops 3 would probably have

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.490 
3 now a black ops 3 would probably have
to<00:03:28.920> be<00:03:29.130> even<00:03:30.000> further<00:03:30.270> into<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.870> future<00:03:31.050> from

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
to be even further into the future from

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.000 
to be even further into the future from
black<00:03:31.860> ops<00:03:32.130> 2<00:03:32.520> now<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.300> did<00:03:33.780> not<00:03:34.140> beat<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.620> black

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
black ops 2 now I did not beat the black

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.860 
black ops 2 now I did not beat the black
ops<00:03:35.220> 2<00:03:35.430> campaign<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:36.090> beat<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.420> black<00:03:36.600> ops<00:03:36.810> 1

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
ops 2 campaign I beat the black ops 1

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.010 
ops 2 campaign I beat the black ops 1
campaign<00:03:37.590> but<00:03:38.250> not<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.640> black<00:03:38.880> ops<00:03:39.150> 2<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:39.990> I

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
campaign but not the black ops 2 so I

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.890 
campaign but not the black ops 2 so I
don't<00:03:40.170> know<00:03:40.740> where<00:03:41.730> they<00:03:41.940> could<00:03:42.180> go<00:03:42.480> from

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900

now<00:04:39.080> here's<00:04:39.919> an<00:04:40.250> idea<00:04:40.400> that<00:04:41.270> I<00:04:41.300> had<00:04:41.479> okay<00:04:42.349> I

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
now here's an idea that I had okay I

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.189 
now here's an idea that I had okay I
heard<00:04:43.370> a<00:04:43.400> lot<00:04:43.610> of<00:04:43.639> people<00:04:43.879> saying<00:04:44.300> well<00:04:44.449> they

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
heard a lot of people saying well they

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.830 
heard a lot of people saying well they
can't<00:04:45.620> have<00:04:45.919> a<00:04:45.949> role<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.310> roll<00:04:47.090> out<00:04:47.270> war<00:04:47.479> too

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
can't have a role to roll out war too

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.570 
can't have a role to roll out war too
because<00:04:48.409> where<00:04:48.680> would<00:04:48.710> they<00:04:49.009> go<00:04:49.219> with<00:04:49.430> the

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
because where would they go with the

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.879 
because where would they go with the
story<00:04:49.879> because<00:04:50.659> the<00:04:50.780> way<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.080> story<00:04:51.319> ended<00:04:51.770> in

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
story because the way the story ended in

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.800 
story because the way the story ended in
World<00:04:52.129> War<00:04:52.250> II<00:04:52.490> you<00:04:52.580> know<00:04:52.699> you<00:04:52.849> can't<00:04:53.389> really

some type of time travel is available

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.269 
some type of time travel is available
and<00:05:13.099> you<00:05:13.340> actually<00:05:13.580> go<00:05:14.180> back<00:05:14.449> how<00:05:15.289> cool<00:05:15.979> would

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:16.279 
and you actually go back how cool would

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:18.850 
and you actually go back how cool would
that<00:05:16.370> be<00:05:16.580> to<00:05:17.090> like<00:05:17.719> have<00:05:17.990> this<00:05:18.199> time-travel

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
that be to like have this time-travel

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.879 
that be to like have this time-travel
stuff<00:05:19.129> and<00:05:19.669> you<00:05:19.759> go<00:05:19.909> back<00:05:19.940> into<00:05:20.569> time<00:05:20.930> go<00:05:21.650> back

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
stuff and you go back into time go back

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.670 
stuff and you go back into time go back
to<00:05:22.189> World<00:05:22.430> War<00:05:22.610> two<00:05:22.939> and<00:05:22.969> say<00:05:23.389> you're<00:05:24.139> helping

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
to World War two and say you're helping

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.080 
to World War two and say you're helping
resin<00:05:25.069> off<00:05:25.189> again<00:05:25.580> or<00:05:25.759> you're<00:05:25.849> doing

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
resin off again or you're doing

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.019 
resin off again or you're doing
something<00:05:26.270> like<00:05:26.840> this<00:05:26.900> I<00:05:27.349> think<00:05:28.250> that<00:05:28.669> right

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:29.029 
something like this I think that right

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:32.529 
something like this I think that right
there<00:05:29.419> would<00:05:30.139> be<00:05:30.199> really<00:05:31.009> really<00:05:31.669> cool<00:05:32.150> and

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
there would be really really cool and

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.689 
there would be really really cool and
it's<00:05:33.379> interesting<00:05:33.919> because<00:05:34.190> it's<00:05:34.430> a<00:05:34.490> black

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
it's interesting because it's a black

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.869 
it's interesting because it's a black
ops<00:05:34.969> 3<00:05:35.360> but<00:05:36.349> there's<00:05:36.620> an<00:05:36.830> element<00:05:37.219> in<00:05:37.520> it<00:05:37.639> that

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:37.879 
ops 3 but there's an element in it that

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.329 
ops 3 but there's an element in it that
goes<00:05:38.120> back<00:05:38.389> to<00:05:38.719> World<00:05:38.930> War<00:05:39.050> two<00:05:39.440> and<00:05:39.740> I<00:05:40.250> think

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:40.339 
goes back to World War two and I think

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.059 
goes back to World War two and I think
that<00:05:40.699> would<00:05:41.060> be<00:05:41.120> absolutely<00:05:41.839> badass<00:05:42.379> so<00:05:42.889> then

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 
that would be absolutely badass so then

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:46.209 
that would be absolutely badass so then
in<00:05:44.060> the<00:05:44.240> campaign<00:05:44.900> you<00:05:45.169> have<00:05:45.440> like<00:05:45.680> futuristic

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:46.219 
in the campaign you have like futuristic

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:48.129 
in the campaign you have like futuristic
weapons<00:05:46.729> we<00:05:46.759> have<00:05:46.940> World<00:05:47.210> War<00:05:47.389> two<00:05:47.599> weapons<00:05:47.990> in

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
weapons we have World War two weapons in

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.170 
weapons we have World War two weapons in
there<00:05:48.289> too<00:05:48.469> because<00:05:48.650> there's<00:05:49.400> a<00:05:49.819> bit<00:05:50.150> of

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
there too because there's a bit of

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.730 
there too because there's a bit of
futuristic<00:05:50.839> mission<00:05:51.199> there's<00:05:51.500> a<00:05:51.560> bit<00:05:51.710> of

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
futuristic mission there's a bit of

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.850 
futuristic mission there's a bit of
World<00:05:52.310> War<00:05:52.400> two<00:05:52.490> missions<00:05:53.180> and<00:05:53.589> that<00:05:54.589> would<00:05:54.830> be

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
World War two missions and that would be

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.249 
World War two missions and that would be
I<00:05:55.069> think<00:05:55.250> that<00:05:55.610> would<00:05:55.729> be<00:05:55.789> really<00:05:55.909> really<00:05:56.719> cool

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259 
I think that would be really really cool

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:58.990 
I think that would be really really cool

change something in World War two or

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.019 
change something in World War two or
somewhere<00:06:20.960> in<00:06:20.990> reno<00:06:21.740> the<00:06:21.889> vietnam<00:06:22.370> war<00:06:22.639> a<00:06:22.669> Cold

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:23.029 
somewhere in reno the vietnam war a Cold

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:25.629 
somewhere in reno the vietnam war a Cold
War<00:06:23.389> I<00:06:23.629> think<00:06:24.229> something<00:06:24.889> like<00:06:25.039> that<00:06:25.099> would<00:06:25.339> be

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
War I think something like that would be

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.249 
War I think something like that would be
really<00:06:26.089> interesting<00:06:26.810> because<00:06:26.839> that's

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:27.259 
really interesting because that's

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:28.839 
really interesting because that's
something<00:06:27.500> we<00:06:27.770> haven't<00:06:27.949> really<00:06:28.159> seen<00:06:28.580> in<00:06:28.759> a

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849 
something we haven't really seen in a

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:31.420 
something we haven't really seen in a
call<00:06:29.089> of<00:06:29.210> duty<00:06:29.240> and<00:06:29.750> I<00:06:30.680> would<00:06:31.069> definitely

my dog was going

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.320 
my dog was going
easy<00:06:36.740> to<00:06:36.860> decide<00:06:37.190> to<00:06:37.430> enter<00:06:37.580> a<00:06:37.729> few<00:06:38.060> months

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
easy to decide to enter a few months

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.390 
easy to decide to enter a few months
again<00:06:38.570> but<00:06:39.080> anyways<00:06:39.500> I<00:06:39.530> want<00:06:39.979> to<00:06:40.130> talk<00:06:40.370> a

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
again but anyways I want to talk a

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.000 
again but anyways I want to talk a
little<00:06:40.699> bit<00:06:40.970> about<00:06:41.180> zombies<00:06:42.020> now<00:06:42.050> I<00:06:42.440> feel<00:06:42.860> that

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
little bit about zombies now I feel that

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.000 
little bit about zombies now I feel that
zombies<00:06:43.580> would<00:06:43.760> work<00:06:44.090> a<00:06:44.270> lot<00:06:44.300> better<00:06:44.600> in<00:06:45.290> a

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.010 
zombies would work a lot better in a

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.219 
zombies would work a lot better in a
world<00:06:46.639> at<00:06:46.850> war<00:06:46.910> too<00:06:47.240> because<00:06:47.900> we're<00:06:48.020> zombies

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:48.229 
world at war too because we're zombies

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:50.890 
world at war too because we're zombies
left<00:06:48.590> off<00:06:48.889> we<00:06:49.190> were<00:06:49.220> just<00:06:49.699> it<00:06:50.030> was<00:06:50.449> it<00:06:50.660> World

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
left off we were just it was it World

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.590 
left off we were just it was it World
War<00:06:51.139> one<00:06:51.410> or<00:06:51.650> just<00:06:51.680> towards<00:06:52.550> the<00:06:52.669> end<00:06:52.880> of<00:06:53.240> World

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600 
War one or just towards the end of World

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.950 
War one or just towards the end of World
War<00:06:53.750> one<00:06:54.199> and<00:06:54.760> when<00:06:55.760> you<00:06:55.880> find<00:06:56.210> out<00:06:56.449> you<00:06:56.900> know

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
War one and when you find out you know

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.110 
War one and when you find out you know
what's<00:06:57.229> going<00:06:57.440> on<00:06:57.770> really<00:06:57.979> in<00:06:58.370> the<00:06:58.910> zombie

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
what's going on really in the zombie

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.560 
what's going on really in the zombie
world<00:06:59.600> I<00:06:59.840> think<00:07:00.199> it<00:07:00.380> would<00:07:00.560> just<00:07:00.680> work<00:07:01.070> out

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.570 
world I think it would just work out

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.950 
world I think it would just work out
perfectly<00:07:02.570> because<00:07:03.669> you<00:07:04.669> know<00:07:04.760> this<00:07:05.270> we<00:07:05.750> saw

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
perfectly because you know this we saw

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.260 
perfectly because you know this we saw
the<00:07:06.020> very<00:07:06.350> beginning<00:07:06.590> of<00:07:07.070> zombies<00:07:07.520> in<00:07:07.820> a<00:07:08.060> way

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 
the very beginning of zombies in a way

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.550 
the very beginning of zombies in a way
and<00:07:08.540> then<00:07:09.410> from<00:07:09.620> there<00:07:09.710> you<00:07:09.919> progress<00:07:10.910> to<00:07:11.330> a

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 
and then from there you progress to a

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.930 
and then from there you progress to a
the<00:07:12.560> beginning<00:07:12.919> of<00:07:13.130> World<00:07:13.400> War<00:07:13.520> two<00:07:13.669> and

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
the beginning of World War two and

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.300 
the beginning of World War two and
Richthofen<00:07:14.780> and<00:07:14.900> Maxis<00:07:15.320> or<00:07:15.470> experimenting

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.310 
Richthofen and Maxis or experimenting

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.760 
Richthofen and Maxis or experimenting
and<00:07:16.490> doing<00:07:16.550> all<00:07:17.330> those<00:07:17.479> things<00:07:17.650> but<00:07:18.650> the<00:07:18.740> one

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770 
and doing all those things but the one

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.159 
and doing all those things but the one
thing<00:07:19.130> you<00:07:19.280> do<00:07:19.580> have<00:07:19.880> to<00:07:20.300> remember<00:07:20.780> is<00:07:21.139> that

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:21.169 
thing you do have to remember is that

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:24.100 
thing you do have to remember is that
zombies<00:07:21.889> has<00:07:22.220> its<00:07:22.550> own<00:07:22.789> storyline<00:07:23.330> so<00:07:23.780> it

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.110 
zombies has its own storyline so it

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.939 
zombies has its own storyline so it
doesn't<00:07:24.889> really<00:07:25.400> matter<00:07:25.820> on<00:07:26.780> what<00:07:27.350> call<00:07:27.770> of

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:27.949 
doesn't really matter on what call of

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:29.650 
doesn't really matter on what call of
duty<00:07:28.250> it's<00:07:28.400> in<00:07:28.610> because<00:07:29.000> they<00:07:29.180> have<00:07:29.449> their<00:07:29.630> own

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:29.660
