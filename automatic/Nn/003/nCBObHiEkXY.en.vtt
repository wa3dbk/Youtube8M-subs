00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
kind of shimmery because instead of

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.900 
kind of shimmery because instead of
using<00:00:43.090> chalk<00:00:43.420> pastels<00:00:44.020> I<00:00:44.380> like<00:00:44.770> to<00:00:45.040> use<00:00:45.430> eye

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
using chalk pastels I like to use eye

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.630 
using chalk pastels I like to use eye
shadow<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.620> I<00:00:47.650> got<00:00:47.860> some<00:00:48.010> eye<00:00:48.130> shadow<00:00:48.160> at<00:00:48.610> the

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
shadow so I got some eye shadow at the

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.210 
shadow so I got some eye shadow at the
dollar<00:00:48.850> store<00:00:48.970> so<00:00:49.450> I<00:00:49.480> use<00:00:49.720> that<00:00:50.020> to<00:00:51.010> give<00:00:51.190> it

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
dollar store so I use that to give it

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.750 
dollar store so I use that to give it
some<00:00:51.520> shine<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:53.340> some<00:00:56.340> texture<00:00:57.340> I<00:00:57.430> guess<00:00:57.640> you

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
some shine and some texture I guess you

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.590 
some shine and some texture I guess you
could<00:00:57.879> say<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:59.020> there's<00:00:59.199> that<00:00:59.410> one<00:01:00.570> then<00:01:01.570> I
