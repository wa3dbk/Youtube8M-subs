00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.750 
through here however if I turned it and
carried<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.840> know<00:01:06.930> up<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.200> down<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:08.549> belt

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
carried it you know up and down the belt

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.030

it goes through here like no tomorrow so

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.590 
it goes through here like no tomorrow so
it's<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.670> depends<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.000> how<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.150> carry<00:01:12.450> it

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
it's it just depends on how you carry it

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.560 
it's it just depends on how you carry it
um<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.640> that's<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.229> this<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.409> knife<00:01:16.560> um

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
um so that's that this is the knife um

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.749 
um so that's that this is the knife um
it's<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.630> real<00:01:18.990> nice<00:01:19.470> knife<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.189> particular

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
it's a real nice knife this particular

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.060 
it's a real nice knife this particular
version<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.240> i<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.930> made<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.560> d2

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
version that i have is made with d2

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.789 
version that i have is made with d2
steel<00:01:23.310> i<00:01:23.810> had<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> special<00:01:24.930> order<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.560> one

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
steel i had a special order this one

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.679 
steel i had a special order this one
primarily<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:27.030> they<00:01:27.270> don't<00:01:27.450> typically

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
primarily because they don't typically

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.999 
primarily because they don't typically
have<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.140> Tonto<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:29.250> stock<00:01:30.799> Inosanto<00:01:31.799> tip

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
have the Tonto in stock Inosanto tip

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.460 
have the Tonto in stock Inosanto tip
also<00:01:32.490> because<00:01:32.790> if<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.840> go<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.170> find<00:01:34.380> this

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
also because if you go and you find this

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.350 
also because if you go and you find this
at<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.680> store<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:34.950> probably<00:01:35.670> going<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> be<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
at the store it's probably going to be a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.560 
at the store it's probably going to be a
154cm<00:01:37.079> steel<00:01:37.590> oops<00:01:37.920> which<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.790> absolutely

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
154cm steel oops which is absolutely

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.370 
154cm steel oops which is absolutely
nothing<00:01:39.990> wrong<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.530> 154cm<00:01:42.079> except<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.170> wanted

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
nothing wrong with 154cm except I wanted

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.770 
nothing wrong with 154cm except I wanted
d2<00:01:43.649> because<00:01:44.430> i'm<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.360> chip<00:01:45.540> this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
d2 because i'm going to chip this

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.840 
d2 because i'm going to chip this
eventually<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.530> i'd<00:01:47.340> rather<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
eventually and i'd rather have the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.910 
eventually and i'd rather have the
tougher<00:01:48.119> steel<00:01:48.360> um<00:01:49.070> so<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.100> chipped<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.520> later
