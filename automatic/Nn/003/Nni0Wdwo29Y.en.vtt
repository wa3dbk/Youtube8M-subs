identified<00:01:40.500> at<00:01:40.619> least<00:01:40.650> one<00:01:41.189> possible<00:01:41.759> cause

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
identified at least one possible cause

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.639 
identified at least one possible cause
for<00:01:42.000> activity<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.049> kind<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> region

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
for activity of this kind in the region

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.130 
for activity of this kind in the region
back<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.399> 1945<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.329> region<00:01:45.630> was<00:01:45.750> hit<00:01:45.899> by<00:01:46.049> an

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
back in 1945 the region was hit by an

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.620 
back in 1945 the region was hit by an
8.1<00:01:46.950> quake<00:01:47.340> which<00:01:47.640> sometimes<00:01:48.210> hissed<00:01:48.479> now

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
8.1 quake which sometimes hissed now

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.060 
8.1 quake which sometimes hissed now
believed<00:01:48.960> triggered<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> release<00:01:49.829> of

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
believed triggered the release of

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.819 
believed triggered the release of
methane<00:01:50.520> gas<00:01:50.579> into<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> surrounding<00:01:51.659> ocean

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
methane gas into the surrounding ocean

methane gas into the surrounding ocean

of<00:01:54.180> Bremen<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.720> Germany<00:01:55.200> there's<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.470> link

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
of Bremen in Germany there's a link

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.080 
of Bremen in Germany there's a link
between<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.100> seismic<00:01:56.460> event<00:01:56.939> and

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
perhaps but experts say the island is

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.630 
perhaps but experts say the island is
