00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.370
 today I will show you how to lengthen 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.719
 or a skirt or some other 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.509
 product when necessary 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:19.230
 especially when children are growing up and 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:21.359
 trousers lengthen the sleeves here on the sample I 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.240
 shows you there was us here let's say 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.349
 it was turned up in skirts like this and us 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.930
 you need an extension cord and here we are 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.200
 take a strip or both of the same color 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.350
 which we have 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.969
 if you have this fabric and if u 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.260
 you don't have this fabric you take any 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:51.739
 other similar in color 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:51.739
 we fold the face with the face and mallet it to them 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.799
 comments and now beg on 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.799
 paving 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:44.450
 sewn on the seam as much as a car kit 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.450
 five tenths of a cut 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:06.479
 I was stitching the product now policy 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:12.979
 chasing a boat and seam now 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.979
 iron out 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.239
 here's the return seam to iron out but when 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.549
 start anyway rises and therefore 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.430
 so that they do not rise and the fabric is thick 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:29.480
 even on just about any fabric we 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:33.590
 Now at start-up we will sew up the line 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.709
 lay the street across the face on 0 2 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.840
 centimeter from the seam 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.840
 which we have gone before 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.939
 and second line 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.980

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:17.610

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.480

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.230
 and a hollow allowance product in to the product and 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.880
 here we have two lines on your face 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.890

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:18.759
