gameplay it's pretty special because I'm

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.439

in<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.440> gameplay<00:00:49.620> I'm<00:00:49.950> practically<00:00:50.550> kind<00:00:50.730> of

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
in this gameplay I'm practically kind of

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.139 
in this gameplay I'm practically kind of
staying<00:00:51.149> around<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:52.199> center<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> map<00:00:53.149> you

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
staying around the center of the map you

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.639 
staying around the center of the map you
have<00:00:54.180> most<00:00:54.539> control<00:00:54.989> because<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.500> see

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
have most control because you can see

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.720 
have most control because you can see
what<00:00:55.770> enemies<00:00:56.070> are<00:00:56.160> coming<00:00:56.430> from<00:00:56.520> all

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
what enemies are coming from all

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.610 
what enemies are coming from all
different<00:00:56.879> angles<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.260> probably<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
different angles and it's probably the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.959 
different angles and it's probably the
best<00:00:58.710> spot<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.520> also<00:00:59.609> pretty

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
best spot to be but it's also pretty

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.029 
best spot to be but it's also pretty
risky<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.140> got<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> play<00:01:01.500> kind<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.859> safe

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
risky so you got to play kind of safe

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.560 
risky so you got to play kind of safe
you<00:01:02.430> don't<00:01:02.579> see<00:01:02.730> me<00:01:02.789> rushing<00:01:03.120> out<00:01:03.210> there<00:01:03.390> too

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
you don't see me rushing out there too

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.609 
you don't see me rushing out there too
much<00:01:03.719> I'm<00:01:03.870> kind<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.110> playing<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.379> little<00:01:04.500> safe

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
much I'm kind of playing a little safe

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.800

and<00:01:05.070> if<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.970> feel<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.330> enemies<00:01:06.659> are

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
and if I feel like enemies are

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.300 
and if I feel like enemies are
overrunning<00:01:07.260> me<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.500> kind<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> Bank<00:01:08.100> up<00:01:08.220> a
