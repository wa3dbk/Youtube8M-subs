00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
the design it is mixed with cobble

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.000 
the design it is mixed with cobble
wooden<00:00:26.490> planks<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.180> dirt<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.109> don't<00:00:28.710> think<00:00:28.920> you

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
wooden planks and dirt I don't think you

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.189 
wooden planks and dirt I don't think you
could<00:00:29.160> do<00:00:29.279> better<00:00:29.310> than<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.119> mean<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
could do better than this I mean the the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.229 
could do better than this I mean the the
roof<00:00:31.470> looks<00:00:31.800> nice<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> design<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
roof looks nice I like the design of the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.970 
roof looks nice I like the design of the
roof<00:00:33.480> there's<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.930> lot<00:00:34.110> more<00:00:34.260> cobble<00:00:34.860> and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
roof there's a lot more cobble and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.500 
roof there's a lot more cobble and
wooden<00:00:35.250> planks<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.640> think<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.940> looks<00:00:36.120> really

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
wooden planks I think it looks really

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.840 
wooden planks I think it looks really
good<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.469> had<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.399> creative<00:00:38.640> mode

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
good and I had to do it in creative mode

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.150 
good and I had to do it in creative mode
because<00:00:39.600> building<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.140> masterpiece<00:00:40.710> like<00:00:40.950> this

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
because building a masterpiece like this

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.180 
because building a masterpiece like this
would<00:00:41.610> take<00:00:41.820> way<00:00:42.329> too<00:00:42.960> much<00:00:43.110> time<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.500> survival

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
would take way too much time in survival

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.490 
would take way too much time in survival
so<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.370> decided<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.969> go<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.960> creative<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.469> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
so I decided to go and to creative on a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.860 
so I decided to go and to creative on a
super<00:00:46.800> flat<00:00:47.070> world<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:48.239> nothing<00:00:48.570> would<00:00:48.660> mess

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
super flat world so nothing would mess

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.170 
super flat world so nothing would mess
me<00:00:49.079> up<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.469> actually<00:00:49.820> maintained<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.969> build

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
me up and I actually maintained to build

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.720

there just to be up there and this is
the<00:01:44.939> mine<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.079> probably<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> best<00:01:46.710> part

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the mine this is probably the best part

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.190 
the mine this is probably the best part
the<00:01:47.070> mine<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.759> mean<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> doesn't<00:01:48.540> go<00:01:48.659> too<00:01:48.720> low

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the mine I mean it doesn't go too low

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.230 
the mine I mean it doesn't go too low
but<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.939> mine<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.570> mean

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
but it's the mine I mean

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.690 
but it's the mine I mean
I<00:01:52.299> have<00:01:52.960> actually<00:01:53.409> only<00:01:53.650> gotten<00:01:53.890> one<00:01:54.130> piece<00:01:54.520> of

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
I have actually only gotten one piece of

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
I have actually only gotten one piece of
coal<00:01:54.909> down<00:01:55.240> here<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.520> yeah<00:01:57.729> so<00:01:58.119> far<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.509> mine

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
coal down here so yeah so far the mine

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.410 
coal down here so yeah so far the mine
seems<00:01:59.079> to<00:01:59.290> be<00:01:59.460> working<00:02:00.460> pretty<00:02:00.670> well<00:02:00.970> which<00:02:01.240> is

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
seems to be working pretty well which is

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.899 
seems to be working pretty well which is
good<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.649> yeah<00:02:03.009> this<00:02:03.310> is<00:02:03.369> pretty<00:02:03.670> much<00:02:03.759> the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
good and yeah this is pretty much the

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.120 
good and yeah this is pretty much the
house<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.540> I<00:02:04.600> decided<00:02:05.080> to<00:02:05.229> keep<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.680> floor<00:02:05.950> as

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
house and I decided to keep the floor as

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.630 
house and I decided to keep the floor as
grass<00:02:06.539> just<00:02:07.539> so<00:02:08.229> whatever<00:02:08.739> I<00:02:08.860> mean<00:02:09.160> I<00:02:09.550> don't

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
grass just so whatever I mean I don't

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.550 
grass just so whatever I mean I don't
want<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:09.910> waste<00:02:10.149> my<00:02:10.330> wooden<00:02:10.750> planks<00:02:11.319> in<00:02:11.440> my

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
want to waste my wooden planks in my

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.430 
want to waste my wooden planks in my
cobble<00:02:12.310> or<00:02:12.519> dirt<00:02:12.849> on<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.269> I<00:02:13.510> mean<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:14.080> think<00:02:14.140> the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
cobble or dirt on it I mean I think the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.100 
cobble or dirt on it I mean I think the
rest<00:02:14.650> suits<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.280> better<00:02:15.459> theme<00:02:15.819> for<00:02:16.660> this<00:02:16.840> house

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
see a better house than this on YouTube

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.370 
see a better house than this on YouTube
um<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.549> only<00:03:18.790> thing<00:03:18.970> is<00:03:19.299> that<00:03:19.930> there's

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
um the only thing is that there's

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.349 
um the only thing is that there's
torches<00:03:20.890> in<00:03:21.040> this<00:03:21.160> chest<00:03:21.579> and<00:03:21.819> I<00:03:21.910> think<00:03:21.940> the

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
torches in this chest and I think the

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.120 
torches in this chest and I think the
game<00:03:22.840> is<00:03:22.870> glitched<00:03:23.319> because<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:23.859> won't<00:03:23.980> let<00:03:24.069> me

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
game is glitched because it won't let me

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.130 
game is glitched because it won't let me
open<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.519> chest<00:03:24.819> so<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.510> can't<00:03:25.810> put<00:03:25.959> torches

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
open the chest so I can't put torches

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.440 
open the chest so I can't put torches
down<00:03:26.440> so<00:03:26.650> mobs<00:03:26.890> will<00:03:27.069> unfortunately<00:03:27.549> spawn<00:03:28.269> in

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450
