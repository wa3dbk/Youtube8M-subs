00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello and welcome the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.319
 Today, we'll show you one 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:40.230
 klitsche dosen july hatch without 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:42.149
 what to do and make music there 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:49.590
 Barns for him and fast 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:51.090
 yet and I want to have a look 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.460
 Challenges can be achieved quickly 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:01.620
 so you can see that and best of all 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:04.160
 that recently you can only do something 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.160
 to adjust 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.299
 I hope you have my points 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.380
 see dots display and after the game 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.570
 I will still turn to you 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.280
 show and then you will see if that 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:27.180
 points also counted online or 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:31.700
 not so online now against bots 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.700
 I hope that alfred ruth is hired 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:51.270
 Volker Busse make a new cafÃ© very high 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:56.399
 and the clothes in the online mode not so 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.010
 This one is good 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.530
 something like this glacier 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.260
 no idea it's good if we have something 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.240
 could do a lot to improve that 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.760
 and the problems would be you too 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.660
 win watch say hey your can 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.860
 this really good 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.180
 the turn maybe so if 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.000
 If you are just a loop then I would 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.020
 recommend you to do that 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.600
 I am doing this for the first time without 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.430
 lance showed me and i thought so 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.810
 there is probably no such thing 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.060
 in youtube so i do not have it either 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.910
 seen and thought hey so what 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.920
 maybe bring more too 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.880
 interesting so I think that would 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:45.950
 you are interested in how to do that and 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.170
 yes a proof that it goes online 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.700
 Of course you will see at the end 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:56.650
 Here I will put it in my peter 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:59.900
 judge and to disguise we have and 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.530
 the game to the end argue the points 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.540
 He has 30 at his disposal 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.270
 If it is, every game is possible 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.090
 then yes you can also score the 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.120
 with attitude and live when 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.680
 do this you can stop everything 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.150
 that's pretty cool right now 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.220
 Let's look at my points again 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.220
 if something has changed or not 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.590
 again on best list so we at the 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.030
 score points so I have now exactly 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.430
 not looking but I hope you 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.470
 can you exactly in the head and you see it 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.800
 more points display 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:04:03.800
 yes and I would say'll go now to 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:03.800
 he has something else to do 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.330
 So in case something did not snow 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.709
 if it does not want to rule 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.840
 just comes in the comments 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.329
 and of course we will continue to do it for you 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.669
 we help you stand behind you 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.860
 if they make it too 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.169
 can and yes I say goodbye 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.979
 he said actively 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.979
