with a orange PPC 1 by 12 cab this thing

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.970 
with a orange PPC 1 by 12 cab this thing
is<00:00:31.009> pretty<00:00:32.009> small<00:00:32.550> when<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.270> look<00:00:33.480> at<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.630> from

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
is pretty small when you look at it from

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.260 
is pretty small when you look at it from
if<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.280> were<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.460> see<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> stage<00:00:36.059> you're

if you were to see it on a stage you're
probably<00:00:36.420> laugh<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.960> think<00:00:37.250> well<00:00:38.250> that's<00:00:38.520> not

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
probably laugh and think well that's not

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.160 
probably laugh and think well that's not
much<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.910> an<00:00:39.090> amp<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.660> no<00:00:39.809> better<00:00:39.899> than<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
much of an amp it's no better than a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.900 
much of an amp it's no better than a
combo<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:41.250> thing<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.570> loud<00:00:43.460> I've<00:00:44.460> had<00:00:44.760> it

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
combo this thing is so loud I've had it

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.660 
combo this thing is so loud I've had it
on<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.300> seven<00:00:45.809> wat<00:00:46.050> mode<00:00:46.350> which<00:00:46.649> halfs<00:00:47.100> which

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
on the seven wat mode which halfs which

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.090 
on the seven wat mode which halfs which
more<00:00:47.910> than<00:00:47.940> half<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.450> power<00:00:48.680> that<00:00:49.680> comes<00:00:49.890> out

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
more than half the power that comes out

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.459 
more than half the power that comes out
of<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.520> i've<00:00:51.360> only<00:00:51.449> been<00:00:51.600> able<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.960> turn<00:00:52.199> up

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
of it and i've only been able to turn up

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.270 
of it and i've only been able to turn up
the<00:00:52.649> volume<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.730> about<00:00:53.940> there<00:00:54.680> before<00:00:55.680> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the volume to about there before it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.860 
the volume to about there before it
getting<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.910> loud<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.510> worried<00:00:57.809> about

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
getting so loud that I'm worried about

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.830 
getting so loud that I'm worried about
neighbors<00:00:58.500> banging<00:00:59.129> down<00:00:59.280> my<00:00:59.340> door<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.879> even

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
neighbors banging down my door and even

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.869 
neighbors banging down my door and even
so<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.289> close<00:01:01.559> three<00:01:01.980> doors<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.730> lead

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
so I have to close three doors that lead

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.910 
so I have to close three doors that lead
to<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.149> wall<00:01:03.600> those<00:01:04.290> beside<00:01:04.589> their<00:01:04.769> house

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
to the wall those beside their house

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.870 
to the wall those beside their house
basically<00:01:06.560> it's<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> very<00:01:07.860> loud<00:01:08.070> x<00:01:08.340> hunter<00:01:08.640> very

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
basically it's a very loud x hunter very

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.380 
basically it's a very loud x hunter very
nice<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:09.900> very<00:01:10.020> cheap<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.530> well<00:01:11.390> these

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
nice and it's very cheap as well these

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.570 
nice and it's very cheap as well these
two<00:01:12.689> together<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.740> cost<00:01:13.979> slightly<00:01:14.369> less

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
two together this cost slightly less

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.690 
two together this cost slightly less
than<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.880> combo<00:01:15.570> version<00:01:16.280> but<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.430> could<00:01:17.580> only

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
than the combo version but I could only

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.609 
than the combo version but I could only
find<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.030> 10<00:01:18.270> inch<00:01:18.390> speaker<00:01:18.810> version<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.409> I

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
find the 10 inch speaker version so I

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.760 
find the 10 inch speaker version so I
decided<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.549> might<00:01:20.850> worth<00:01:21.330> getting<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.080> cab

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
decided it might worth getting the cab

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.550 
decided it might worth getting the cab
along<00:01:23.369> with<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.549> head<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.759> its<00:01:23.880> own<00:01:24.560> this

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
along with the head on its own this

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.080 
along with the head on its own this
means<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.189> port<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.640> around<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:27.000> I

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
means that I can port it around if I

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.880 
means that I can port it around if I
need<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:30.170> actually<00:01:31.170> i'll<00:01:31.409> put<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.770> to

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
need to and actually i'll put it on to

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.140 
need to and actually i'll put it on to
standby<00:01:32.310> mode<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:32.939> see<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> valves<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
standby mode so you can see the valves a

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.490 
standby mode so you can see the valves a
little<00:01:36.150> bit<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> homicide<00:01:36.600> come<00:01:37.200> through

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
little bit of a homicide come through

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.359 
little bit of a homicide come through
but<00:01:38.310> only<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> very<00:01:38.640> slight<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:40.369> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
but only a very slight one and the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.530 
but only a very slight one and the
settings<00:01:41.670> I've<00:01:41.790> been<00:01:41.909> using<00:01:42.150> I've<00:01:42.360> been

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
settings I've been using I've been

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.719 
settings I've been using I've been
recording<00:01:43.049> our<00:01:43.610> volume<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.880> about<00:01:45.119> here<00:01:46.729> both

it's<00:02:03.479> got<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.840> elac<00:02:04.350> falls<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.659> they

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
it's got to elac falls in and they

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.830 
it's got to elac falls in and they
really<00:02:07.320> pump<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> lot<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.670> juice<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.509> could

need is to get when i bought these two

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.030 
need is to get when i bought these two
was<00:02:31.579> speaker<00:02:32.060> cable<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:35.530> see<00:02:36.530> here<00:02:36.769> bought

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
was speaker cable and see here bought

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.539 
was speaker cable and see here bought
one<00:02:37.280> just<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:38.540> little<00:02:38.590> basic<00:02:39.590> one<00:02:39.920> me<00:02:40.340> trim

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
one just a little basic one me trim

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.979 
one just a little basic one me trim
maybe<00:02:40.909> meter<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.329> a<00:02:41.359> half<00:02:41.390> three<00:02:41.750> quid<00:02:42.700> yeah

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
maybe meter and a half three quid yeah

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:51.479 
maybe meter and a half three quid yeah
so<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.260> can<00:02:45.470> see<00:02:45.590> those<00:02:45.709> valves<00:02:49.329> there<00:02:50.329> we<00:02:50.450> go

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
so you can see those valves there we go

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.879 
so you can see those valves there we go
s<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:53.230> bit<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.319> valve<00:02:54.560> power<00:02:56.349> heat<00:02:57.349> wise<00:02:57.620> this

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
s a bit of valve power heat wise this

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.680 
s a bit of valve power heat wise this
thing<00:02:58.040> doesn't<00:02:58.310> get<00:02:58.430> too<00:02:58.730> hot<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:59.180> gets<00:02:59.299> warm

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
thing doesn't get too hot it gets warm

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.960 
thing doesn't get too hot it gets warm
to<00:03:00.109> the<00:03:00.139> touch<00:03:00.260> it's<00:03:01.220> not<00:03:01.400> warm<00:03:01.579> now<00:03:01.730> because

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
to the touch it's not warm now because

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.000 
to the touch it's not warm now because
it's<00:03:02.060> been<00:03:02.150> off<00:03:02.299> for<00:03:02.329> a<00:03:02.569> while<00:03:02.739> ever<00:03:03.739> since<00:03:03.829> I

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
it's been off for a while ever since I

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.990 
it's been off for a while ever since I
stopped<00:03:04.220> recording<00:03:05.200> but<00:03:06.200> I've<00:03:06.700> been<00:03:07.700> playing

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
stopped recording but I've been playing

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.319 
stopped recording but I've been playing
at<00:03:08.150> full<00:03:08.389> blast<00:03:09.370> well<00:03:10.370> almost<00:03:10.639> full<00:03:10.970> blast<00:03:11.150> as

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
at full blast well almost full blast as

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.390 
at full blast well almost full blast as
you<00:03:11.420> can<00:03:11.510> see<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.650> sounds<00:03:12.859> really<00:03:12.920> nice

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
you can see and it sounds really nice

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.939 
you can see and it sounds really nice
but<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:14.629> doesn't<00:03:14.900> get<00:03:15.019> that<00:03:15.170> hot<00:03:15.409> it<00:03:15.620> only<00:03:15.739> like

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:15.949 
but it doesn't get that hot it only like

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.009 
but it doesn't get that hot it only like
warms<00:03:16.310> up<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.549> little<00:03:16.579> which<00:03:17.239> is<00:03:17.359> quite<00:03:17.540> good<00:03:17.720> so

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
warms up a little which is quite good so

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.409 
warms up a little which is quite good so
there<00:03:18.109> must<00:03:18.169> have<00:03:18.260> vented<00:03:18.680> it<00:03:18.799> well<00:03:18.980> or<00:03:19.419> it's

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
there must have vented it well or it's

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.000 
there must have vented it well or it's
more<00:03:20.599> efficient<00:03:20.989> than<00:03:21.049> they<00:03:21.169> say<00:03:21.410> is<00:03:21.470> even

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
more efficient than they say is even

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.030 
more efficient than they say is even
though<00:03:22.280> it's<00:03:22.669> apparently<00:03:23.209> Class<00:03:23.599> A<00:03:23.829> which<00:03:24.829> is

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
though it's apparently Class A which is

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.930 
though it's apparently Class A which is
not<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:26.150> efficient<00:03:27.129> I've<00:03:28.129> been<00:03:28.280> recording<00:03:28.430> it

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
not so efficient I've been recording it

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.390 
not so efficient I've been recording it
with<00:03:29.359> two<00:03:30.349> microphones<00:03:31.299> ignis<00:03:32.299> Lee<00:03:32.419> there<00:03:33.400> I'm

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
with two microphones ignis Lee there I'm

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.650 
with two microphones ignis Lee there I'm
not<00:03:34.609> sure<00:03:34.669> if<00:03:34.910> I'm<00:03:35.000> going<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.209> have<00:03:35.329> to<00:03:35.359> do

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
not sure if I'm going to have to do

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.729 
not sure if I'm going to have to do
anything<00:03:35.870> about<00:03:36.109> phase<00:03:36.410> cancellation

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
anything about phase cancellation

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.039 
anything about phase cancellation
because<00:03:37.340> they're<00:03:37.609> different<00:03:37.699> distances<00:03:38.359> but

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
because they're different distances but

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.240 
because they're different distances but
I've<00:03:39.199> put<00:03:39.500> them<00:03:39.620> together<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:39.919> it<00:03:40.040> sounds

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
I've put them together and it sounds

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.089 
I've put them together and it sounds
quite<00:03:40.400> nice<00:03:41.349> Micron's<00:03:42.349> have<00:03:42.470> been<00:03:42.590> using<00:03:42.769> our

the speaker so moved it a little bit it
was<00:03:53.989> about<00:03:54.109> there<00:03:54.470> it's<00:03:55.010> just<00:03:55.250> on<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.430> edge

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
was about there it's just on the edge

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.349 
was about there it's just on the edge
and<00:03:56.319> the<00:03:57.319> red<00:03:57.530> 5<00:03:57.829> are<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.459> 10<00:03:58.790> set<00:03:59.180> into

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
and the red 5 are the 10 set into

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.890 
and the red 5 are the 10 set into
cardioid<00:03:59.840> mode<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:01.239> they<00:04:02.239> both<00:04:02.389> capture<00:04:02.780> up

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
cardioid mode and they both capture up

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.409 
cardioid mode and they both capture up
very<00:04:03.169> nice<00:04:03.319> sounds<00:04:03.680> coming<00:04:03.829> out<00:04:03.980> of<00:04:04.040> it<00:04:04.419> but

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
very nice sounds coming out of it but

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:07.659 
very nice sounds coming out of it but
yeah<00:04:05.569> as<00:04:05.720> I<00:04:05.840> said<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:06.139> had<00:04:06.440> to<00:04:06.560> have<00:04:06.739> it<00:04:06.769> with

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
yeah as I said I had to have it with

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.699 
yeah as I said I had to have it with
doors<00:04:07.940> closed<00:04:08.389> between<00:04:08.690> it<00:04:09.019> and<00:04:09.169> replaying

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
doors closed between it and replaying

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.309 
doors closed between it and replaying
the<00:04:09.799> guitar<00:04:10.069> because<00:04:10.250> it's<00:04:10.430> so<00:04:10.729> loud<00:04:10.970> and<00:04:11.359> I

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
the guitar because it's so loud and I

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.349 
the guitar because it's so loud and I
hate<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.590> think<00:04:12.919> what<00:04:13.129> 15<00:04:13.579> watt<00:04:13.760> modal<00:04:14.120> sound

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
hate to think what 15 watt modal sound

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.089 
hate to think what 15 watt modal sound
like<00:04:16.780> it<00:04:17.780> has<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.049> ability<00:04:18.349> to<00:04:18.380> power<00:04:18.709> a<00:04:18.829> full

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
like it has the ability to power a full

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.699 
like it has the ability to power a full
stack<00:04:19.519> i'm<00:04:20.359> using<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:20.719> 69<00:04:21.139> output<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:21.650> can

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
stack i'm using the 69 output you can

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.459 
stack i'm using the 69 output you can
use<00:04:21.889> to<00:04:22.130> a<00:04:22.159> tomar<00:04:22.700> puts<00:04:22.969> for<00:04:23.150> like<00:04:23.270> 24<00:04:23.780> x<00:04:23.930> 12<00:04:24.200> if
