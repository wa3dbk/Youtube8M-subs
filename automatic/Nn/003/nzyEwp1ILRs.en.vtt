to take into account how the market is
today<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.760> today<00:03:27.150> it's<00:03:27.720> important<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.470> you

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
today and today it's important that you

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.340 
today and today it's important that you
try<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:28.860> be<00:03:29.370> where<00:03:30.180> people<00:03:30.630> are<00:03:30.810> when<00:03:31.200> they

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
try to be where people are when they

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.990 
try to be where people are when they
relax<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:32.130> where<00:03:32.489> they<00:03:32.670> feel<00:03:32.970> comfortable

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.860 
I think it's important not only to
invite<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.730> same<00:03:38.910> people<00:03:38.970> every<00:03:39.450> time<00:03:39.480> we
