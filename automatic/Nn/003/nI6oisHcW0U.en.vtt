00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
this as you can see adjust and reverse

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.720 
this as you can see adjust and reverse
are<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.570> read<00:02:57.840> mode<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.860> forward<00:02:59.280> those<00:02:59.520> words

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
are in read mode and forward those words

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.450 
are in read mode and forward those words
right<00:02:59.970> here<00:03:00.120> are<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.450> blue<00:03:01.280> protections<00:03:02.280> in

right here are in blue protections in
blue<00:03:02.670> G<00:03:03.300> Shock<00:03:03.540> up<00:03:03.720> here<00:03:03.960> is<00:03:04.020> in<00:03:04.170> red<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.220> then

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
blue G Shock up here is in red and then

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.030 
blue G Shock up here is in red and then
we<00:03:06.030> got<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.480> lot<00:03:06.660> going<00:03:06.930> on<00:03:07.020> with<00:03:07.080> dial<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:07.950> we

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
we got a lot going on with dial so we

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.260 
we got a lot going on with dial so we
can<00:03:08.160> see<00:03:08.280> at<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.430> bottom<00:03:08.790> when<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.000> says<00:03:09.150> the

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
can see at the bottom when it says the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.200 
can see at the bottom when it says the
time<00:03:09.540> it's<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.470> blue<00:03:10.770> negative<00:03:11.220> display<00:03:11.640> and

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
time it's a blue negative display and

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.030 
time it's a blue negative display and
then<00:03:12.540> at<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.720> top<00:03:12.930> we<00:03:12.990> have<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.290> red<00:03:13.590> negative

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
then at the top we have a red negative

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.750 
then at the top we have a red negative
display<00:03:14.490> it's<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.450> nice<00:03:15.630> touch<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.350> then<00:03:16.760> you

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
display it's a nice touch and then you

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.850 
display it's a nice touch and then you
have<00:03:18.060> for<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.780> minute<00:03:19.050> hand<00:03:19.230> it's<00:03:19.530> blue<00:03:19.830> and

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
have for the minute hand it's blue and

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.530 
have for the minute hand it's blue and
then<00:03:20.100> it's<00:03:20.220> got<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.370> white<00:03:20.610> tip<00:03:20.880> for<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.390> hour

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
a white tip and then we got crisscross

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.840 
a white tip and then we got crisscross
patterns<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:31.020> blue<00:03:31.800> around<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.190> very<00:03:32.400> outside

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
patterns of blue around the very outside

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.020 
patterns of blue around the very outside
then<00:03:33.360> red<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.170> these<00:03:34.860> blue<00:03:35.130> patches<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:35.790> here

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
then red and these blue patches in here

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.120 
then red and these blue patches in here
kind<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.480> at<00:03:36.600> each<00:03:36.720> our<00:03:36.960> marker<00:03:37.500> actually<00:03:37.890> in

on this kind of like the haze this is
this<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:45.959> nice<00:03:46.200> watch<00:03:48.680> they<00:03:49.880> pretty<00:03:50.880> much

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
this is a nice watch they pretty much

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.900 
this is a nice watch they pretty much
instantly<00:03:51.720> from<00:03:52.230> when<00:03:52.830> they<00:03:53.010> first<00:03:53.400> came<00:03:53.670> out

releasing way too many watches recently

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.270 
releasing way too many watches recently
and<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:05.660> lot<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.690> them<00:04:06.870> just<00:04:07.050> kind<00:04:07.200> of<00:04:07.320> stink<00:04:07.650> to

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
and a lot of them just kind of stink to

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.160 
and a lot of them just kind of stink to
be<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.820> be<00:04:08.940> quite<00:04:09.150> honest<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.720> lot<00:04:09.840> of<00:04:09.959> them<00:04:10.080> are

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
be to be quite honest a lot of them are

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.140 
be to be quite honest a lot of them are
just<00:04:10.320> going<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.590> below<00:04:11.280> standards<00:04:11.820> that<00:04:12.030> they

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
just going to below standards that they

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.260 
just going to below standards that they
set<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.660> think<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.950> they<00:04:14.160> just<00:04:14.400> kind<00:04:15.150> of

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
set I think that they just kind of

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.820 
set I think that they just kind of
jumped<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.660> shark<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:16.109> little<00:04:16.140> bit<00:04:16.380> where

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
jumped the shark a little bit where

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.710 
jumped the shark a little bit where
they've<00:04:17.310> become<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:17.880> popular<00:04:18.120> in<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.630> last

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
they've become so popular in the last

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.120 
they've become so popular in the last
couple<00:04:19.020> years<00:04:19.170> if<00:04:19.530> they're<00:04:19.680> just<00:04:19.770> trying<00:04:19.890> to

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
couple years if they're just trying to

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.280 
couple years if they're just trying to
take<00:04:20.280> full<00:04:20.520> advantage<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.359> release<00:04:22.109> as

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
take full advantage of it and release as

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.050 
take full advantage of it and release as
many<00:04:22.500> different<00:04:22.919> watches<00:04:23.220> as<00:04:23.310> possible<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.000> I

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
many different watches as possible and I

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.540 
many different watches as possible and I
think<00:04:24.090> they're<00:04:24.330> not

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
think they're not

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.369 
think they're not
paying<00:04:24.699> attention<00:04:24.759> to<00:04:25.240> detail<00:04:25.629> as<00:04:25.840> much<00:04:26.020> and

00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:26.379 
paying attention to detail as much and

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.529 
paying attention to detail as much and
that<00:04:27.370> reflects<00:04:27.699> in<00:04:27.849> the<00:04:27.909> price<00:04:28.150> because

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
that reflects in the price because

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.200 
that reflects in the price because
pretty<00:04:28.810> much<00:04:28.900> around<00:04:29.440> 60<00:04:30.039> to<00:04:30.129> 70%<00:04:30.490> of<00:04:30.789> G<00:04:30.940> shocks

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
pretty much around 60 to 70% of G shocks

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.510 
pretty much around 60 to 70% of G shocks
that<00:04:31.419> come<00:04:31.479> out<00:04:31.810> you<00:04:32.500> can<00:04:32.680> find<00:04:32.949> for<00:04:33.280> under

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
that come out you can find for under

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.510 
that come out you can find for under
retail<00:04:33.729> so<00:04:34.449> the<00:04:35.349> price<00:04:35.889> place<00:04:36.159> that<00:04:36.370> they're

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
retail so the price place that they're

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.670
