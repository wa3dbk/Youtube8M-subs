00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
was rather interesting I think it could

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.850

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the novelty wears off then I think it'd

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.350 
the novelty wears off then I think it'd

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.530 
has a bit of solidly consistent
connections<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.700> we've<00:01:54.180> had<00:01:54.270> lots<00:01:54.420> of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
connections so we've had lots of

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.150 
connections so we've had lots of
hang-ups<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.080> ringing<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.890> hang-ups

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
hang-ups and ringing and hang-ups

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.500 
hang-ups and ringing and hang-ups
bringing<00:01:56.550> and<00:01:56.670> trying<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.970> get<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.210> again<00:01:57.360> me

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
bringing and trying to get it again me

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.990 
bringing and trying to get it again me
again<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.080> our<00:01:58.920> neighbours<00:01:59.220> very<00:01:59.400> patient<00:01:59.820> I

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
again so our neighbours very patient I

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.910 
again so our neighbours very patient I
don't<00:02:00.360> know<00:02:00.480> that<00:02:00.660> all<00:02:00.780> neighbors<00:02:01.680> would<00:02:01.830> be

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
don't know that all neighbors would be

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.140 
don't know that all neighbors would be
so<00:02:02.070> patient<00:02:02.460> however<00:02:02.580> one<00:02:02.970> of<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
so patient however one of the

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.460 
so patient however one of the
interesting<00:02:03.660> things<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.200> said<00:02:04.440> earlier

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
interesting things that you said earlier

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.340 
interesting things that you said earlier
is<00:02:04.980> that<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.280> ambient<00:02:05.820> noise<00:02:05.880> keeps<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.960> lot<00:02:07.290> of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
is that the ambient noise keeps a lot of

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.120 
is that the ambient noise keeps a lot of
the<00:02:07.560> chatter<00:02:08.490> down

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
the chatter down

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.580 
the chatter down
it<00:02:10.670> does<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:11.060> think<00:02:11.090> it<00:02:11.420> prevents<00:02:11.960> others<00:02:12.560> from

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
it does I think it prevents others from

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.290 
it does I think it prevents others from
knowing<00:02:13.040> exactly<00:02:13.190> what<00:02:13.700> we've<00:02:13.910> been<00:02:13.940> trying

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
knowing exactly what we've been trying

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.480 
knowing exactly what we've been trying
except<00:02:14.870> for<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.050> neighbor<00:02:15.350> it<00:02:16.160> makes<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.370> little

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
except for a neighbor it makes a little

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.460 
except for a neighbor it makes a little
bit<00:02:16.670> harder<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.000> hear<00:02:17.180> on<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.510> device<00:02:17.720> yeah

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
bit harder to hear on the device yeah

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.580 
bit harder to hear on the device yeah
yeah<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.190> overall<00:02:19.550> what<00:02:20.090> do<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.600> think<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.410> the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
yeah so overall what do you think of the

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.690 
yeah so overall what do you think of the
row<00:02:22.010> 44

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
row 44

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.070 
row 44
it's<00:02:23.000> like<00:02:23.210> connectivity<00:02:23.780> on<00:02:23.900> South

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
it's like connectivity on South

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.930 
it's like connectivity on South
necessarily<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.770> think<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.070> fantastic<00:02:25.760> it's

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
necessarily I think is fantastic it's

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.460 
necessarily I think is fantastic it's
made<00:02:26.150> this<00:02:26.300> five<00:02:26.570> ever<00:02:26.750> played<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.050> lot<00:02:27.290> more

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
made this five ever played a lot more

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.850 
made this five ever played a lot more
energy

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.760 

we're<00:02:30.860> still<00:02:31.040> working<00:02:31.340> like<00:02:31.370> projects<00:02:32.120> here

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
we're still working like projects here

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.200 
we're still working like projects here
we've<00:02:33.770> got<00:02:33.920> some<00:02:34.100> video<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.460> we<00:02:34.760> took<00:02:34.910> on<00:02:35.090> my

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
we've got some video that we took on my

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.180 
we've got some video that we took on my
phone<00:02:35.480> which<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:36.020> cannot<00:02:36.440> connect<00:02:36.860> for<00:02:37.040> some

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
phone which I cannot connect for some

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.490 
phone which I cannot connect for some
reason<00:02:37.550> I<00:02:37.730> blame<00:02:38.090> my<00:02:38.240> phone<00:02:38.480> not<00:02:38.930> Southwest

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
reason I blame my phone not Southwest

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.190 
reason I blame my phone not Southwest
but<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.370> am<00:02:40.520> connected<00:02:40.940> with<00:02:41.090> my<00:02:41.210> Galaxy<00:02:41.630> Tab<00:02:41.840> so

a mass storage device to put into my

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.089 
a mass storage device to put into my
laptop<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.140> we<00:02:49.200> can<00:02:49.349> upload<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.769> before<00:02:50.010> we
