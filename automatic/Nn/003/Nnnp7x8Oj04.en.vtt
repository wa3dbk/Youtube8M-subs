the vendor so escaping working around
this<00:02:53.370> problem<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:54.180> was<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> very<00:02:54.510> small

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
this problem it was a very small

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.720 
this problem it was a very small
percentage<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:55.470> people<00:02:55.620> who<00:02:55.950> were<00:02:56.340> doing<00:02:56.610> this

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
percentage of people who were doing this

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.340 
percentage of people who were doing this
but<00:02:57.000> it's<00:02:57.240> game-breaking<00:02:57.750> enough<00:02:58.110> especially

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
but it's game-breaking enough especially

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.040 
but it's game-breaking enough especially
since<00:02:58.770> they<00:02:58.860> want<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.400> be<00:02:59.760> able<00:02:59.790> to<00:03:00.270> all

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
since they want you to be able to all

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.620 
since they want you to be able to all
start<00:03:01.560> on<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.770> same<00:03:01.980> base<00:03:02.640> level<00:03:03.150> with<00:03:03.600> uh

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
with valor points that that's just how

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.120 
with valor points that that's just how
it's<00:03:06.930> gonna<00:03:06.990> be<00:03:07.110> this<00:03:07.530> really<00:03:07.770> didn't<00:03:08.010> seem

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
it's gonna be this really didn't seem

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.260 
it's gonna be this really didn't seem

it<00:03:15.720> if<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.170> didn't<00:03:16.620> exploit<00:03:17.130> before<00:03:17.760> you're

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
it if you didn't exploit before you're

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.510 
it if you didn't exploit before you're
probably<00:03:18.660> not<00:03:19.020> gonna<00:03:19.110> exploit<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.709> now<00:03:20.070> so

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
probably not gonna exploit it now so

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
it's just a better format it works we

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.130 
it's just a better format it works we
get<00:03:45.870> more<00:03:46.050> information<00:03:46.110> we<00:03:46.680> get<00:03:47.459> just<00:03:48.239> quicker

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
get more information we get just quicker

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.050 
get more information we get just quicker
information<00:03:49.860> right<00:03:50.070> though<00:03:50.280> they<00:03:50.820> kinda<00:03:51.030> have

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
information right though they kinda have

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.300 
information right though they kinda have
to<00:03:51.150> think<00:03:51.450> on<00:03:51.540> their<00:03:51.600> toes<00:03:51.989> it's<00:03:52.410> faster<00:03:53.070> it's

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
to think on their toes it's faster it's

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.900 
to think on their toes it's faster it's
this<00:03:53.880> back<00:03:54.570> and<00:03:54.810> forth<00:03:54.900> it's<00:03:55.380> it's<00:03:55.800> better<00:03:56.160> we

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
this back and forth it's it's better we

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.060 
this back and forth it's it's better we
like<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.510> do<00:03:58.080> more<00:03:58.350> of<00:03:58.530> this<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:58.950> I<00:03:59.010> think

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
like this do more of this and I think

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.560 
like this do more of this and I think
that<00:03:59.370> Blizzard<00:03:59.700> knows<00:03:59.910> that<00:04:00.150> we<00:04:00.239> like<00:04:00.420> this

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
that Blizzard knows that we like this

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.759 
that Blizzard knows that we like this
because<00:04:00.750> this<00:04:00.959> is<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.170> second<00:04:01.440> one<00:04:01.530> already

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
because this is the second one already

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.440 
because this is the second one already
the<00:04:02.130> next<00:04:02.459> one<00:04:02.610> was<00:04:02.760> hinted<00:04:03.000> at<00:04:03.120> actually

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
the next one was hinted at actually

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.449 
the next one was hinted at actually
being<00:04:03.630> about<00:04:03.780> blizzard<00:04:04.170> DOTA<00:04:04.380> do<00:04:05.130> that

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
being about blizzard DOTA do that

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.060
