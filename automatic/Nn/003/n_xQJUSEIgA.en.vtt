Hello and welcome! Today we're going to answer some of your questions posted in the comments. Stay with us.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.990
Hi RafaÅ‚, where can I get a good quality tea?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.990
Well, you can certainly get it in our teashop in Zabrze, but of course that's not the only place.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.990
Every good teashop should have something good to choose from, you should also find it in network teashops 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.990
and also in a supermarket you can sometimes catch some loose leaf tea

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.990
but remember it's essential to choose a bit more expensive teas.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.990
We know from the experience that cheap tea is usually value for money.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.990
Do tight plastic containers have a bad impact on tea?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.990
Tea should be stored in tight containers, but well, personally I don't like to keep it in plastic ones

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.990
but if it's high quality plastic that doesn't have its own smell then I think it should work, too.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.990
The key is to store tea in a dark and dry place, and to keep it away from the source of other smells.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.990
I recommend jars or cans but plastic should work fine as well.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.990
What is that music? Did you steal it from 'Lekko Stronniczy'? [name of a popular Polish Youtube channel]

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.990
The music that we use in our show comes from the iLife library. It can be used by anyone who uses this programme.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.990
[noisy slurp] Why do you slurp so much?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
As I said in the first episodes and first season of our shows, slurping helps to distribute tea in your mouth better. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.990
We just make a kind of mist inside the mouth sucking both tea and air at the same time.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.990
It might not sound cool but it's the way it should be done in order to taste the tea bouquet of flavours more clearly.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.990
How many times can I brew tea?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.990
You can actually brew tea as many times as you want. It all depends on the quality and kind of tea.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.990
You must check it out and work it out yourself which brew you enjoy best and when you stop enjoying it.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.990
I usually brew my tea two or three times but there are teas worth brewng even five or six times.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.990
Test it yourselves, there are no limits or restrictions here.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.990
Which teas do you recommend for a calm sleep?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.990
For a calm sleep it's worth drinking Rooibos or Honeybush which aren't teas but they help to unwind

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.990
and don't contain caffeine so it's not going to wake us up before bedtime. You could also drink Kukicha

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
which contains a small amount of caffeine. If you brew Pu-erh long enough it will also be very light

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.990
and as they say, it's sweeping away sadness. Worth checking out something like that.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.990
What books about tea do you recommend?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Books about tea well, there are many of them. First of all, I recommend books written by Asians.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
These are people who know the topic very well. I certainly don't recommend books translated from English

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.990
where we can find such expressions that Rooibos is red tea while yerba mate is green tea.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.990
Especially Asian names should be sufficient recommendation for a certain book. 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.990
It's certainly worth looking for 'The Classic of Tea' by Lu Yu

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.990
because it's the first book about tea worldwide so it's kind of interesting.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.990
I prepare my Masala with Earl Grey. I don't know whether it's a profanation but I really enjoy the taste.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.990
And that's the key. Tea should be enjoyable for us. Prepare it in the way that you enjoy it.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.990
I always think there's no sense in sticking to any strict rules or frames that the rituals tell us

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.990
or certain rules. It's us who are going to enjoy it.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.990
What a great show!

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.990
Thanks a lot! I'm trying to reply to your comments, we don't always have time to do that 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
The best idea is to write to us in the comments on our Youtube channel or at our website Czajnikowy.pl

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.990
I think we're going to make this kind of videos to reply to your most frequently asked and most interesting questions.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So write to us, ask questions, like and share. See you soon!
