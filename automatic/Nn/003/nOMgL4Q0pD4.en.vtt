scientific effort and expertise we have
here<00:00:06.930> microfluidics<00:00:07.680> which<00:00:08.340> now<00:00:08.580> we're

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
here microfluidics which now we're

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.640 
here microfluidics which now we're
finding<00:00:09.150> has<00:00:09.360> great<00:00:09.870> commercial<00:00:10.320> potential

we<00:00:14.849> probably<00:00:15.059> haven't<00:00:15.360> even<00:00:15.509> thought<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.780> yet

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
we probably haven't even thought of yet

now<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.660> big<00:00:18.869> project<00:00:19.260> i'll<00:00:19.350> talk<00:00:19.529> about<00:00:19.830> and

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
now the big project i'll talk about and

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.679 
now the big project i'll talk about and
this<00:00:20.130> will<00:00:20.310> relate<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> little<00:00:21.270> bit<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
this will relate a little bit to the

amazon kindle they have little buckets
of<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.579> fluid<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.620> in<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.800> fluid<00:00:38.219> there<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.520> a

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
of a fluid and in that fluid there is a

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.729 
of a fluid and in that fluid there is a
white<00:00:38.850> pigment<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.420> black<00:00:39.629> pigment<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.140> if

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
white pigment and a black pigment and if

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.619 
white pigment and a black pigment and if
they're<00:00:40.890> totally<00:00:41.309> mixed<00:00:41.550> you'll<00:00:42.180> see<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> gray

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
they're totally mixed you'll see a gray

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.319 
they're totally mixed you'll see a gray
color<00:00:43.399> so<00:00:44.399> what<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.760> developed<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.300> an

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
color so what we developed is an

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.910 
color so what we developed is an
altogether<00:00:45.719> different<00:00:45.930> approach<00:00:46.469> instead<00:00:46.770> of

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
altogether different approach instead of

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.130 
altogether different approach instead of
moving<00:00:47.039> particles<00:00:48.030> inside<00:00:48.180> pigment<00:00:48.870> we

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
moving particles inside pigment we

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.939 
moving particles inside pigment we
actually<00:00:50.070> move<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:52.050> fluid<00:00:52.379> itself<00:00:52.500> and

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
actually move a the fluid itself and

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.680 
actually move a the fluid itself and
this<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.550> partnership<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.120> sun<00:00:54.449> chemical

here<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.350> cincinnati<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:56.460> make<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.500> pigment

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
here in cincinnati they make the pigment

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.279 
here in cincinnati they make the pigment
dispersions<00:00:59.100> or<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.550> inks<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.149> go<00:01:01.020> in

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
dispersions or the inks that go in

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.100 
dispersions or the inks that go in
inkjet<00:01:01.710> printers<00:01:02.100> pain<00:01:02.609> etc<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.359> they<00:01:04.019> have

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
inkjet printers pain etc and they have

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.380 
inkjet printers pain etc and they have
world-class<00:01:04.409> expertise<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.880> what

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
world-class expertise in that and what

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.030 
world-class expertise in that and what
we've<00:01:06.510> done<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.780> collaboration<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.470> them<00:01:07.740> is

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
we've done in collaboration with them is

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.149 
we've done in collaboration with them is
develop<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.670> sort<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.090> an<00:01:09.240> inkjet<00:01:09.570> fluid<00:01:10.170> which

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
develop a sort of an inkjet fluid which

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.039 
develop a sort of an inkjet fluid which
we<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.549> move<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.210> whole<00:01:12.450> fluid<00:01:12.780> with

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
we can move the whole fluid with

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.960 
we can move the whole fluid with
electricity<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:14.790> our

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
electricity and what we do with our

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.969 
electricity and what we do with our
technology<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.869> will<00:01:16.229> make<00:01:16.380> tiny<00:01:16.740> little

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
technology is will make tiny little

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.210 
technology is will make tiny little
buckets<00:01:17.490> at<00:01:17.930> each<00:01:18.930> pixel<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.710> an<00:01:19.890> e-paper

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
buckets at each pixel in an e-paper

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.700 
buckets at each pixel in an e-paper
display<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.090> we'll<00:01:21.720> put<00:01:21.930> different<00:01:22.409> colored

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
display and we'll put different colored

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.310 
display and we'll put different colored
ink<00:01:22.920> jet<00:01:23.159> fluids<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.790> each<00:01:24.090> bucket<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.689> when

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
ink jet fluids in each bucket and when

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.800 
ink jet fluids in each bucket and when
we<00:01:25.439> apply<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> voltage<00:01:26.119> we<00:01:27.119> will<00:01:27.299> actually<00:01:27.450> pull

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
we apply a voltage we will actually pull

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.569 
we apply a voltage we will actually pull
the<00:01:27.930> entire<00:01:28.049> fluid<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.040> bucket<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the entire fluid out of that bucket and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.609 
the entire fluid out of that bucket and
spread<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.090> out<00:01:30.180> onto<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> reflective<00:01:31.200> surface

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
spread it out onto a reflective surface

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.319 
spread it out onto a reflective surface
so<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:31.890> almost<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.340> spreading<00:01:32.970> pigment

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
so it's almost like spreading pigment

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.640 
so it's almost like spreading pigment
out<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> paper<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.140> that's<00:01:34.409> how<00:01:34.590> we

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
out on the paper and that's how we

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.569 
out on the paper and that's how we
create<00:01:35.250> color<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.939> print<00:01:36.270> today<00:01:37.220> we<00:01:38.220> started

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
create color in print today we started

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.510 
create color in print today we started
this<00:01:38.700> work<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.890> 2007<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.100> started<00:01:41.400> a

we'll<00:02:54.820> be<00:02:54.940> successful<00:02:55.150> but<00:02:55.690> just<00:02:55.900> being<00:02:56.080> able

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
we'll be successful but just being able

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.590 
we'll be successful but just being able
to<00:02:56.500> stand<00:02:57.160> up<00:02:57.370> amongst<00:02:57.790> with<00:02:58.060> everybody<00:02:58.420> else

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600

and<00:02:58.810> be<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.410> competitor<00:02:59.950> that's<00:03:00.490> one<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.730> the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
and be a competitor that's one of the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.600 
and be a competitor that's one of the
