match<00:05:01.100> so<00:05:02.100> I<00:05:02.160> think<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.970> real<00:05:03.180> play<00:05:03.450> is<00:05:03.750> a<00:05:04.200> tick

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
match so I think the real play is a tick

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.640 
match so I think the real play is a tick
I<00:05:05.330> can<00:05:06.330> also<00:05:06.419> move<00:05:06.720> this<00:05:06.990> but<00:05:07.350> there<00:05:07.500> isn't

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
I can also move this but there isn't

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.750 
I can also move this but there isn't
really<00:05:07.680> accomplished<00:05:08.160> anything<00:05:08.220> he's

really accomplished anything he's

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.830 
really accomplished anything he's
probably<00:05:08.970> going<00:05:09.210> to<00:05:09.270> chocolate<00:05:09.630> over<00:05:09.750> the

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
probably going to chocolate over the

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.040 
probably going to chocolate over the
Civic<00:05:10.110> staples<00:05:10.410> on<00:05:10.500> anyway<00:05:10.890> I<00:05:11.630> mean<00:05:12.630> I<00:05:12.810> don't

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
think there really any instance that I'm

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.430 
think there really any instance that I'm
super<00:05:14.760> scared<00:05:14.970> of<00:05:15.270> in<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.450> spot<00:05:15.720> so<00:05:16.320> I<00:05:16.350> think

super scared of in the spot so I think

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.960 
super scared of in the spot so I think
the<00:05:16.620> play<00:05:16.770> is<00:05:16.800> just<00:05:17.070> play<00:05:17.190> tenement<00:05:17.610> crasher

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
I guess I'm a little too eager to just

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.630 
I guess I'm a little too eager to just
have<00:05:58.680> a<00:05:58.770> little<00:05:58.890> too<00:05:59.070> eager<00:05:59.280> to<00:05:59.580> not<00:06:01.610> lose<00:06:02.610> my

dad actually put on the maximum amount
of<00:06:04.800> pressure<00:06:05.570> but<00:06:06.570> it<00:06:06.840> feels<00:06:07.020> like<00:06:07.169> if<00:06:07.470> I<00:06:07.620> untap

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
of pressure but it feels like if I untap

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.380 
of pressure but it feels like if I untap
with<00:06:08.130> this<00:06:08.220> guy<00:06:08.370> like<00:06:08.610> I<00:06:08.760> definitely<00:06:09.090> can't

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390

he can supreme break me I guess I kind
of<00:06:13.560> played<00:06:13.680> into<00:06:13.770> supreme<00:06:14.280> right<00:06:14.430> there<00:06:15.140> but

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
of played into supreme right there but

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.630 
of played into supreme right there but
oh<00:06:16.350> no<00:06:16.500> no<00:06:16.620> he<00:06:16.770> doesn't<00:06:16.979> have<00:06:17.070> the<00:06:17.100> white<00:06:17.400> yeah

oh no no he doesn't have the white yeah
I<00:06:18.140> knew<00:06:19.140> I<00:06:19.169> thought<00:06:19.410> about<00:06:19.560> that<00:06:19.680> sometimes<00:06:20.100> I

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
I knew I thought about that sometimes I

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.480 
I knew I thought about that sometimes I
think

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
think

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.680 
think
bad<00:06:20.610> stuff<00:06:20.819> and<00:06:21.060> then<00:06:21.180> I<00:06:21.240> just<00:06:21.449> forget<00:06:21.630> about

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
bad stuff and then I just forget about

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.080 
bad stuff and then I just forget about
it<00:06:21.919> so<00:06:22.919> I<00:06:22.949> mean<00:06:23.130> we<00:06:23.250> have<00:06:23.370> the<00:06:23.490> spell<00:06:23.729> to<00:06:23.759> deal

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
it so I mean we have the spell to deal

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.460 
it so I mean we have the spell to deal
with<00:06:24.210> whatever<00:06:24.389> I<00:06:24.780> could<00:06:24.930> have<00:06:25.110> played<00:06:25.259> sauce

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
with whatever I could have played sauce

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.200 
with whatever I could have played sauce
more<00:06:25.650> square<00:06:25.889> than<00:06:25.919> this<00:06:26.099> guy<00:06:26.310> but<00:06:26.550> the<00:06:27.000> kids

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
more square than this guy but the kids

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.379 
more square than this guy but the kids
on<00:06:27.360> the<00:06:27.419> ants<00:06:27.569> at<00:06:27.720> this<00:06:27.840> point<00:06:28.310> all<00:06:29.310> right<00:06:29.550> so

his<00:06:30.539> Buster<00:06:30.870> school<00:06:31.110> play<00:06:31.319> probably<00:06:31.680> cost<00:06:31.830> him

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
his Buster school play probably cost him
