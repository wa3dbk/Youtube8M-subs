00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.330
 gentlemen and welcome to point g and this 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.600
 Thursday I have the first part of the 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.209
 new details of fifa 13 the week 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.460
 last and today broadcast a webcast with 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.280
 the producers of fifa 13 nick cannon and 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.800
 ironman garden showing exclusively 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.870
 the most significant changes that 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.880
 will have fifa 3 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.070
 the transmission lasted just over 90 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.430
 minutes focusing on five points very 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.800
 Interesting 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.630
 the first is based on the intelligence of 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.000
 attac in some of the points that 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.680
 they emphasized that now the players at 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.930
 deploy a backlash or attack 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.060
 dangerous the player who does not have the 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.910
 The ball will always seek to remain in a 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.129
 site in a natural way without running 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.470
 straight line either decreasing the 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.150
 speed or opening to the band or 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.980
 finding the best position for 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.100
 finish the play without falling off of 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.410
 place also the forwards will create and 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.570
 will move to spaces either to pull 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.300
 the brand and allow the partner to have 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.630
 best shot opportunity or open 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.160
 the space to receive the ball 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.080
 another of the changes is that now the 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.240
 front and middle can move 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.550
 behind the defenses to give you better 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.590
 opportunity to the past 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.960
 also naturally the players 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.030
 will move including the play either 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.530
 opening to a better position or 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.120
 running without bad 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.770
 an example is that in an attack the 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.170
 lateral rise following the move that 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.900
 flows on the other side knowing that your 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.400
 band is free and thus be able to receive the 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.290
 ball 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.480
 It is important to mention that not all 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.030
 players will be able to do all this since 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.860
 depends on the attributes that have another of 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.020
 the things that you are thinking is that 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.310
 when the player is tired he can not 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.340
 execute some of the changes 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.720
 mentioned on the other hand although it seems 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.550
 that the intelligence of the strikers 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.920
 be superior does not mean that the 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.750
 defense was left without change to the contrary 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.670
 the defenses will think in a way that 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.830
 must cover your area or any 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.810
 movement that applies the front the 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.060
 developers claim that the key to 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.670
 game is the balance between the defensive and 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.130
 the offensive the second point is 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.020
 completely bling now when facing 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.230
 the defenses the dribbles on fifa street 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.720
 will be more intuitive with 360 degrees of 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.150
 mobility and 360 degrees to face 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.790
 giving better control to the player and 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.550
 avoiding so much combination of buttons 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.930
 on the other hand thanks to this movement 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.970
 we can protect the ball with better 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.860
 posture and in turn depending on the 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.670
 circumstances come out with better control 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.350
 of the balloon finally is the precision 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.240
 thanks to the street ball control a fitur 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.940
 end of street that allows you to have a 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.190
 better control of the ball in fifa 13 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.290
 so that it feels like an improvement 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.510
 of ball control offering more 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.700
 freedom and creativity to double the 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.250
 opponent with this we finished the first 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.980
 part tomorrow I'll talk about the prestige 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.990
 control player impact and tactics at free 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.460
 kicks I'm mario lush and the super 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.460
 tomorrow here in general point
