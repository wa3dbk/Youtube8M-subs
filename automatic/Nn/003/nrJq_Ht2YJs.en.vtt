00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.950

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.240
 potsdamer place i will enter today 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.190
 turning small logo video 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.719
 Mike of the TV cameras on his channel 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.730
 will you see the video then 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.109
 I test doing a new shoes 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.279
 I have 23 times at the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.630
 Training on had that one sees the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.880
 in any case already to the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.760
 Action america bought about for 30 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.380
 euro in the outlet with even discount codes and 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.720
 so on here in germany gets 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.539
 I have below in the video description 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.920
 linked there is then synonymous for the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.390
 exactly that I do not know at all 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.280
 But I also write my head here 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.840
 Look again, yes, let's see how the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.910
 So make yourself shoes while shooting today 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.540
 and I will report later how 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.219
 shoes are 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.219
 if I can recommend you or not 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.270
 The shoes are really well made 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.680
 actually only those thought 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.750
 really bad because I worked 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.860
 here a white edges threaded 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.270
 wear after the first time 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.830
 I thought it was already small cracks 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.230
 somehow here on the plastic 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.540
 surface that is just like that 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.560
 Attractive that sweat countries 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.410
 I had formed that now 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.000
 got away again otherwise the seams 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.830
 and everything is pretty stable 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.990
 the sun has also kept the 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.820
 sole is consistently in the flat that is 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.960
 you can also well over flagged and 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.960
 had flowers trip around a good one 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.820
 control at crysis and so are 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.750
 So the shoes are pretty thin 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.970
 little steaming 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.700
 the vapors in itself is quite good the 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.710
 that you have a better feeling 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.869
 so a little softer you can 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.780
 to make better rods more precise and than 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.440
 maybe with shoes with thick soles 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.300
 but wearing are more likely to 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.430
 I would be suitable for advanced 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.620
 say because you also hard edges 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.060
 lands on her and so crass 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.350
 if he somehow also medium mean plan 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.240
 is on a pole that much more 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.130
 through as with so thick shoes 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.770
 like for example in mike leighs me 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.870
 otherwise also had ever imagined 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.000
 So rather for advanced or for 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.860
 people are not so blatant jumps 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.250
 want to do and prefer more control 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.910
 Otherwise , you definitely want to have something 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.980
 to recommend 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.960
 as I said in the description again 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.720
 Everything else about the shoes is great 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.090
 sole is really awesome not only 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.950
 stifle cramp 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.290
 so the shoe is relatively wide front so 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.210
 I have wide feet , the front of me it is 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.390
 quite comfortable to wear do not push 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.840
 so and make a good impression 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.010
 every case 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.840
 I hope we liked it a lot 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.450
 if so are upward to more 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.040
 want to see videos writes that the 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.990
 Comments though other wishes new 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.490
 videos from that also under purely otherwise 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.380
