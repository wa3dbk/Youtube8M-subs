00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
getting cut off when it stretches around

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.640 
getting cut off when it stretches around
the<00:01:02.940> corner<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.930> often<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.320> problem

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the corner that can often be a problem

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.929 
the corner that can often be a problem
because<00:01:04.769> you'll<00:01:05.040> either<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.580> cut<00:01:05.820> off

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
because you'll either have to cut off

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.179 
because you'll either have to cut off
part<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.390> your<00:01:06.450> image<00:01:06.900> or<00:01:07.229> you'll<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:08.010> to

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
part of your image or you'll have to

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.710 
part of your image or you'll have to
figure<00:01:08.430> out<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.610> way<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.820> kind<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.270> bleed<00:01:09.600> it

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
figure out a way to kind of bleed it

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.600 
figure out a way to kind of bleed it
over<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> edge<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.189> looks<00:01:11.369> kind<00:01:11.580> of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
over the edge because it looks kind of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.490 
over the edge because it looks kind of
weird<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> blank<00:01:12.689> edge<00:01:12.960> where

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
weird just to have a blank edge where

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.679 
weird just to have a blank edge where
the<00:01:13.650> image<00:01:13.950> cuts<00:01:14.189> off<00:01:14.400> another<00:01:14.970> way<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.570> to

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689

the image cuts off another way I like to
print<00:01:15.810> my<00:01:15.960> artwork<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.680> do<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> series<00:01:17.220> of
