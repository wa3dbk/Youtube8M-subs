00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.200
 hello welcome we were waiting for you 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.000
 I got to the greca hong because I have 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.180
 a house that is an old style and with 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.270
 water wind leak problems 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.510
 when we came to live here we started 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.910
 see that it came out that when wide see 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.070
 filtered water and reaches up to 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.340
 socket in this window we have the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.450
 problem that is prepared with putty 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.540
 but the iron below is all wrong 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.540
 state 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.730
 we have the cold issue that does not 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.180
 Winter does not keep the heat because 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:05.299
 in the air permanently enters color 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.610
 for these advantages another problem that 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.140
 we have is with the flags above 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.000
 when we open them we can not later 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.369
 close again and we have to come up with 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.190
 a ladder and make them with wire what 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.310
 what I was trying to do is look a little 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.770
 also renew the style of the house with 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.020
 something more modern and at the same time solve 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.929
 those problems the issue is the lack of 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.000
 time and masonry work what 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.780
 I found it very difficult to be able to 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.770
 solve it then google earth 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.190
 I found the greca home I found 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.030
 testimonies videos that 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.030
 they framed in what I was already looking for 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.000
 on the other hand also the issue of double 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.820
 glass with which we solve 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.020
 noise problems and since we are very 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.020
 near an avenue 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.530
 the noises that we could also generate 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.100
 us for the activities that 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.100
 we develop 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.989
 and 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.300
 i 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.310
 Well I'm happy because now 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.120
 I can play the guitar 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.670
 in an intimate and without so much interior 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.550
 external sound the truth never had 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.520
 known a double glass window 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.250
 I 'm getting to know that now and I give myself 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.830
 account that the sound is more in the 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.200
 environment and it does not feel like it's a 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.180
 test room with the insulation of the 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.070
 excellent sound very fast 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.310
 nothing to do with what I had before 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.690
 before you had to open a fan and 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.550
 bizarre is now a thing re 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.330
 modern 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.330
 and ref like that 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.950
 and how is the room is important the 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:55.220
 frosting theme that they suggested so 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.220
 to achieve more privacy the mosquito net 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.530
 and what I really expected what 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.330
 that if not what I did not expect is that 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.310
 out so fast so simple on time and 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.520
 very well interpreted what what 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.860
 wanted to 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.860
 and the problem is solved 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.360
 I find it incredible happy thank you
