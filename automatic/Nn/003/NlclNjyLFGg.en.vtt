if experience hopefully come back and be
that<00:02:07.399> much<00:02:07.549> better<00:02:07.700> off<00:02:07.820> this<00:02:08.209> year<00:02:08.390> than<00:02:08.509> I

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
that much better off this year than I

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.559 
that much better off this year than I
was<00:02:08.630> last<00:02:08.810> year<00:02:09.259> with<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.440> team<00:02:09.649> and

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
was last year with the team and

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.970 
was last year with the team and
defensively<00:02:11.569> even<00:02:11.870> Allstate<00:02:12.260> sounds<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:12.830> that

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
defensively even Allstate sounds so that

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.440 
defensively even Allstate sounds so that
they<00:02:13.130> could<00:02:13.310> put<00:02:13.459> me<00:02:13.580> out<00:02:13.670> there<00:02:13.880> in<00:02:13.910> important

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
they could put me out there in important

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.120 
they could put me out there in important
situations<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:15.200> not<00:02:15.319> have<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.620> sacrifice

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
situations and not have to sacrifice

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.040 
situations and not have to sacrifice
anything<00:02:16.730> there<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.150> keep<00:02:17.300> me<00:02:17.420> out<00:02:17.510> there<00:02:17.780> so

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
anything there to keep me out there so

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.350 
anything there to keep me out there so
just<00:02:18.290> basically<00:02:19.220> gain<00:02:19.670> strength<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.180> just

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
just basically gain strength to just

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.820 
just basically gain strength to just
kind<00:02:20.569> of<00:02:20.660> come<00:02:20.900> back<00:02:20.930> in<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.260> camp<00:02:21.470> in<00:02:21.620> really

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
position you can afford to take more

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.810 
position you can afford to take more
risks<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.739> way<00:03:30.890> because<00:03:31.220> you<00:03:31.370> can<00:03:31.519> get<00:03:31.640> back

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
risks that way because you can get back

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.789 
risks that way because you can get back
in<00:03:32.000> position<00:03:32.150> click<00:03:32.510> with<00:03:32.660> another<00:03:32.870> guy<00:03:33.049> so

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
in position click with another guy so

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.170 
in position click with another guy so
that's<00:03:33.859> one<00:03:34.160> thing<00:03:34.370> that<00:03:34.400> I'm<00:03:34.609> small<00:03:34.970> maybe

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
that's one thing that I'm small maybe

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.699 
that's one thing that I'm small maybe
brings<00:03:35.540> me<00:03:35.690> an<00:03:35.750> advantage<00:03:36.140> to<00:03:36.260> me<00:03:36.290> but<00:03:36.560> at<00:03:36.650> the

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
brings me an advantage to me but at the

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.830 
brings me an advantage to me but at the
same<00:03:36.890> time<00:03:37.100> like<00:03:37.340> in<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:37.880> type<00:03:38.209> close<00:03:38.569> battle

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
same time like in a type close battle

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.509 
same time like in a type close battle
you're<00:03:39.049> gonna<00:03:39.200> be<00:03:39.530> at<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.680> disadvantage<00:03:39.920> unless

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
you're gonna be at a disadvantage unless

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.759 
you're gonna be at a disadvantage unless
you<00:03:40.670> really<00:03:40.940> be<00:03:41.540> smart<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:42.109> I<00:03:42.350> think<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.739> I
