00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.090 

if<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:56.930> can't<00:02:57.170> do<00:02:57.290> this<00:02:57.440> on<00:02:57.590> camera<00:02:57.620> or

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
if I can't do this on camera or

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:06.970 
if I can't do this on camera or

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
something well anyway you'll get it to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.730 
something well anyway you'll get it to
work<00:03:07.130> eventually<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.330> just<00:03:08.600> do<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.110> method<00:03:09.470> I

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
work eventually and just do the method I

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.760 
work eventually and just do the method I
did<00:03:10.150> with<00:03:11.150> paper<00:03:11.930> clips<00:03:14.170> it's<00:03:15.170> kind<00:03:15.410> of<00:03:15.530> bent

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
did with paper clips it's kind of bent

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.510 
did with paper clips it's kind of bent
where<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.130> put<00:03:16.430> my<00:03:16.580> finger<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.720> lift<00:03:18.020> it<00:03:18.170> up<00:03:18.520> if

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
where I put my finger and lift it up if

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.620 
where I put my finger and lift it up if
you're<00:03:19.670> going<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.850> move<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.000> back<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.390> forth

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
you're going to move it back and forth

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.010 
you're going to move it back and forth
like<00:03:20.750> twisting<00:03:21.410> this<00:03:21.530> one<00:03:22.360> this<00:03:23.360> way<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:23.930> I

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
like twisting this one this way and I

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.860 
like twisting this one this way and I
wait<00:03:24.290> it's<00:03:24.500> backwards<00:03:24.740> on<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.220> camera<00:03:25.610> so<00:03:25.870> it

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
wait it's backwards on the camera so it

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.860 
wait it's backwards on the camera so it
would<00:03:27.020> be<00:03:27.140> this<00:03:27.320> way<00:03:27.560> for<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.520> but<00:03:28.940> it's

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
would be this way for you but it's

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.630 
would be this way for you but it's
really<00:03:30.080> this<00:03:30.350> way<00:03:30.590> because<00:03:30.920> my<00:03:31.070> camera's<00:03:31.459> like

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
really this way because my camera's like

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.900 
really this way because my camera's like
backwards<00:03:31.880> in<00:03:32.360> my<00:03:32.650> computer<00:03:33.650> because<00:03:34.490> it<00:03:34.670> says

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
backwards in my computer because it says

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.220 
backwards in my computer because it says
century<00:03:35.690> say<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:37.340> want<00:03:37.550> a<00:03:37.630> census<00:03:38.630> let's<00:03:39.080> just

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
century say you want a census let's just

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.340 
century say you want a census let's just
lets<00:03:40.070> us<00:03:40.190> backwards<00:03:40.670> I<00:03:40.940> understand<00:03:41.330> okay<00:03:41.900> and

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
lets us backwards I understand okay and

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.100 
lets us backwards I understand okay and
then<00:03:42.590> that's<00:03:42.830> my<00:03:43.209> walk<00:03:44.209> pickin<00:03:44.570> video<00:03:44.840> hope

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
then that's my walk pickin video hope

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.030 
then that's my walk pickin video hope
