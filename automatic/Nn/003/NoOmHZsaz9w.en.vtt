 the county recipe the milk treats two

 over the seasons alone has evolved and

 allows accounts and have aromas 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.680
 different that will allow him 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.809
 to easily accompany others

 regional products such as wines from 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:01.309
 swore where the mortise sausage 24 hours 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.290
 maximum must flow between the 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.309
 treats and the end of the manufacture of the 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.619
 county 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.479
 now place to cheese and master of 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.479
 time and quality of his product 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.290
 once in the vats of the fruit

 the wine of the day before allow this 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.920
 transformation 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.539
 so once the quails and we go 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.810
 notebooks with so-called 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.550
 slices notebooks we cumulate the 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.990
 manufacturing and a lot of things this 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.430
 meaning in relation to the hand after having 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.530
 been heated 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.070
 the mixture of curd and small 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.090
 milk will be stripping them the principle 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.580
 is to pump the mixture notebook small 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.850
 milk in the molds of mussels is in 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.210
 micro perforated y it s evacuate the serum 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.420
 and we will see that the notebook in the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.420
 molds 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:04.159
 on each county and put a green plate 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:07.610
 tells us the date of manufacture 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.520
 the number of the cub the place of 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.569
 making that it's a tale and the 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.850
 month of application 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.709
 and if ever there is a problem 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.100
 above we can refer to our 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.100
 register 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.900
 unmoulding is removing the containers from 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.330
 cheese is the past in case of meadow 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.220
 refining where it will be salty is 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.800
 returned every two days on departure 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.260
 and after we're going to say all three to 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.650
 four days to take all his 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.620
 flavor 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.739
 the count and takes his time he is then 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:55.819
 kept for 4 to 18 months in cellars 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:58.599
 refining the region the best of it 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.599
 would be a little pretentious 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.160
 they are better possible
