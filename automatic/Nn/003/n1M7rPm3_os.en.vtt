that we make an arrangement together
what's<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.650> basis<00:01:47.010> here<00:01:47.370> this<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.240> basically

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
what's the basis here this so basically

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.050 
what's the basis here this so basically
we<00:01:48.990> take<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> container<00:01:49.620> each<00:01:50.370> arrangement<00:01:50.910> has

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
we take a container each arrangement has

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.210 
we take a container each arrangement has
a<00:01:51.090> specific<00:01:51.660> container<00:01:52.050> in<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.680> case<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
a specific container in this case is the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.200 
a specific container in this case is the
sweetheart<00:01:53.460> okay

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
sweetheart okay

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.600 
sweetheart okay
we<00:01:54.420> put<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> lettuce<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.230> base<00:01:55.410> okay<00:01:55.980> we<00:01:56.490> let

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
we put a lettuce in the base okay we let

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.580 
we put a lettuce in the base okay we let
this<00:01:56.790> sit<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.510> top<00:01:57.690> of<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> lettuce<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.380> use

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
this sit on top of the lettuce we use

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.400 
this sit on top of the lettuce we use
kale<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.910> reason<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.900> to<00:02:01.140> give<00:02:01.260> this

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
kale the reason for that is to give this

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.880 
kale the reason for that is to give this
beautiful<00:02:01.650> green<00:02:02.600> texture<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.930> shape<00:02:04.230> under

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
beautiful green texture and shape under

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.820 
beautiful green texture and shape under
it<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.870> rich<00:02:07.380> looking

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
it so that it's it's a rich looking

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.040 
it so that it's it's a rich looking
arrangement<00:02:08.430> I<00:02:08.610> do<00:02:08.790> think<00:02:09.390> that's<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.780> first

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
arrangement I do think that's the first

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.380 
arrangement I do think that's the first
