and now it's time to learn the Indiana
Jones<00:00:02.730> theme<00:00:03.030> tune<00:00:03.510> which<00:00:03.720> goes<00:00:03.929> like<00:00:03.959> this

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.250 

okay<00:00:23.359> that<00:00:24.359> wasn't<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.630> best<00:00:24.810> I've<00:00:24.930> played<00:00:25.109> it

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
okay that wasn't the best I've played it

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.359 
okay that wasn't the best I've played it
but<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.560> get<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.859> idea

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
but you get the idea

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.730 
but you get the idea
let's<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> look<00:00:27.779> at<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> first<00:00:28.230> phrase<00:00:28.529> it

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
let's have a look at the first phrase it

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.950 
let's have a look at the first phrase it
goes<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.609> three<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.619> D<00:00:32.219> string<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.700> open<00:00:33.420> G

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
goes to three on the D string and open G

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:44.479 
goes to three on the D string and open G
and<00:00:34.559> one<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:41.030> followed<00:00:42.030> by<00:00:43.040> zero<00:00:44.040> to

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
and one on the be followed by zero to

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.479 
and one on the be followed by zero to
three<00:00:45.480> that's<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.739> D<00:00:46.950> string<00:00:49.489> and

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
three that's all on the D string and

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.139 
three that's all on the D string and
then<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.149> g<00:00:51.780> string<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.680> open<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:54.260> open<00:00:55.260> B

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
then on the g string so open to open B

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:05.469 
then on the g string so open to open B
one<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.360> E<00:00:59.059> and<00:01:02.120> then<00:01:03.120> two<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.260> G<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
one on the E and then two on the G and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:14.240 
one on the E and then two on the G and
then<00:01:09.140> b13<00:01:10.580> open<00:01:11.580> e<00:01:11.960> it<00:01:12.960> was<00:01:13.080> two<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.530> d2<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
then b13 open e it was two in the d2 and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.940 
then b13 open e it was two in the d2 and
the<00:01:14.310> G<00:01:14.520> sorry

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
the G sorry

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.289 
the G sorry
and<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.100> there's<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.490> run<00:01:17.820> which<00:01:18.000> goes

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and then there's this run which goes

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.420 
and then there's this run which goes
which<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.960> ascending<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> B<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:23.250> then

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
which is ascending on the B so and then

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.520 
which is ascending on the B so and then
zero<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:24.840> high<00:01:25.200> E<00:01:25.229> string<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.020> we've

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
zero the high E string and then we've

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.170 
zero the high E string and then we've
done<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.799> one<00:01:28.979> before<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.820> same<00:01:30.030> as

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
done this one before so it's the same as

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.690 
done this one before so it's the same as
the<00:01:30.299> first<00:01:30.600> phrase<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.860> goes<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.340> three<00:01:32.670> on

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the first phrase so it goes to three on

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.120 
the first phrase so it goes to three on
the<00:01:32.970> D<00:01:33.210> string<00:01:33.240> open<00:01:35.060> G<00:01:36.439> and<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.979> B

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the D string open G and the one on the B

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.569 
the D string open G and the one on the B
string<00:01:38.990> those<00:01:39.990> two<00:01:40.470> three<00:01:41.280> open<00:01:42.270> be<00:01:42.750> open<00:01:43.579> G

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
string those two three open be open G

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.360 
string those two three open be open G
and<00:01:44.880> then<00:01:45.060> one

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
and then one

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.970 
and then one
the<00:01:45.520> B<00:01:46.210> string<00:01:46.510> and<00:01:46.540> then<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:47.500> next<00:01:47.740> phrase<00:01:47.950> is

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
the B string and then the next phrase is

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:54.600 
the B string and then the next phrase is
this<00:01:49.620> it's<00:01:50.620> three<00:01:50.920> on<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.130> B<00:01:52.050> open<00:01:53.050> E<00:01:53.310> then<00:01:54.310> one

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
this it's three on the B open E then one

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.720 
this it's three on the B open E then one
on<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:54.880> E<00:01:55.210> string<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.950> last<00:01:57.100> few<00:01:57.250> bars<00:01:57.460> go

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
on the E string and the last few bars go

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.410 
on the E string and the last few bars go
like<00:01:57.910> this

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
like this

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.080
