00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:40.820 

you

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.960 

and<00:05:41.370> then<00:05:41.580> this<00:05:41.819> time<00:05:42.660> I'm<00:05:42.840> using<00:05:42.870> gel

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
and then this time I'm using gel

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.279 
and then this time I'm using gel
water-based<00:05:44.970> -<00:05:45.150> but<00:05:45.300> it's<00:05:45.449> a<00:05:45.569> lot<00:05:45.690> thicker<00:05:45.990> so

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
water-based - but it's a lot thicker so

00:05:46.289 --> 00:06:02.659 
water-based - but it's a lot thicker so
it<00:05:46.379> doesn't<00:05:46.970> run

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.700 

yeah<00:06:03.389> that's<00:06:03.569> it

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.590 

and<00:06:07.250> you<00:06:07.370> can<00:06:07.520> put<00:06:07.729> more<00:06:07.880> cards<00:06:08.330> you<00:06:08.389> can<00:06:08.479> put

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
and you can put more cards you can put

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.260 
and you can put more cards you can put
it<00:06:08.720> like<00:06:08.840> yellow<00:06:09.199> a<00:06:09.229> little<00:06:09.500> blue<00:06:09.940> but<00:06:10.940> I<00:06:11.000> think

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
it like yellow a little blue but I think

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.879 
it like yellow a little blue but I think
that<00:06:11.710> gives<00:06:12.710> you<00:06:12.830> the<00:06:12.979> idea<00:06:13.009> on<00:06:13.460> how<00:06:13.639> you<00:06:13.699> can
