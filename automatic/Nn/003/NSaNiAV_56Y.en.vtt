00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.940
 is the idea of ​​doing this exhibition was precisely is seeking is 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.880

 from November to hereafter the resumption of urban spaces dating from the 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.170
 The violence was overthrown the way it was 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.440
 the pride of being a carioca and we wanted to take this special moment 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.880
 in the middle of summer 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.680
 being in the fort of copacabana 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.020
 we created this motif the river in summer is strong 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.150
 then we did wrong all this exposure based on Rio de Janeiro and 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.999
 in being very strong 

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:49.289

 icons that make carioca 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.170
 in the other three gold but this one is missing a little bit 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.270
 of the fortifications as a whole so we have one of 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.319
