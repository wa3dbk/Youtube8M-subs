00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.550 
beginning unless something stupid
happens<00:06:18.770> and<00:06:19.100> we<00:06:19.160> just<00:06:19.340> blow<00:06:19.670> out<00:06:19.700> every<00:06:20.150> game

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
happens and we just blow out every game

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.020 
happens and we just blow out every game
the<00:06:21.560> remainder<00:06:22.040> of<00:06:22.100> the<00:06:22.250> season<00:06:22.460> we<00:06:22.700> will<00:06:22.880> be

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
the remainder of the season we will be

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.430 
the remainder of the season we will be
reaching<00:06:23.210> the<00:06:23.420> playoffs<00:06:23.570> so<00:06:24.230> hopefully

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
reaching the playoffs so hopefully

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.350 
reaching the playoffs so hopefully
hopefully<00:06:25.190> we<00:06:25.520> just<00:06:25.550> make<00:06:25.820> some<00:06:25.970> noise<00:06:26.120> in<00:06:26.300> the

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
hopefully we just make some noise in the

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.880 
hopefully we just make some noise in the
playoff<00:06:26.690> that's<00:06:26.900> all<00:06:27.020> I'm<00:06:27.140> hoping<00:06:27.260> for<00:06:27.470> I

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:27.890 
playoff that's all I'm hoping for I

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.999 
playoff that's all I'm hoping for I
don't<00:06:28.760> plan<00:06:28.880> on<00:06:29.030> what<00:06:29.120> a<00:06:29.150> championship

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
don't plan on what a championship

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:33.459 
don't plan on what a championship
uh<00:06:31.400> nobody<00:06:32.270> expects<00:06:32.749> is<00:06:32.869> the<00:06:32.990> 1a<00:06:33.139> championship

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:33.469 
uh nobody expects is the 1a championship

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:35.469 
uh nobody expects is the 1a championship
so<00:06:33.949> if<00:06:34.009> we<00:06:34.129> win<00:06:34.309> a<00:06:34.339> championship<00:06:34.610> is<00:06:35.150> gonna<00:06:35.330> be

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 
so if we win a championship is gonna be

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.249 
so if we win a championship is gonna be
big<00:06:35.779> our<00:06:36.080> first<00:06:36.379> seasons<00:06:37.039> though<00:06:37.279> I<00:06:38.050> doubt<00:06:39.050> it

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
big our first seasons though I doubt it

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:40.899 
big our first seasons though I doubt it
though<00:06:39.469> considering<00:06:40.219> we're<00:06:40.339> losing<00:06:40.699> to<00:06:40.819> the

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:40.909

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:50.629 
that I lead the way but it just it blows

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:54.429

in third quarter and fourth quarter the
third<00:06:56.509> quarter<00:06:56.839> is<00:06:57.110> when<00:06:57.999> the<00:06:58.999> opponent<00:06:59.300> just

00:06:59.649 --> 00:06:59.659
