00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
that and all microfighters series sets

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:29.170 
that and all microfighters series sets
have<00:01:20.360> like<00:01:20.810> fire<00:01:21.050> missiles<00:01:22.720> so<00:01:23.830> yeah<00:01:27.820> so<00:01:28.820> I

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
have like fire missiles so yeah so I

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.060 
have like fire missiles so yeah so I
would<00:01:29.330> think<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.810> only<00:01:30.020> reason<00:01:30.350> because<00:01:30.950> the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
would think the only reason because the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.250 
would think the only reason because the
figure<00:01:31.340> isn't<00:01:31.549> that<00:01:32.000> great<00:01:32.330> for<00:01:32.750> this<00:01:32.840> set<00:01:33.110> the

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
figure isn't that great for this set the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.539 
figure isn't that great for this set the
only<00:01:33.350> reason<00:01:33.680> you're<00:01:33.799> probably<00:01:33.979> gonna<00:01:34.340> get

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
only reason you're probably gonna get

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.090 
only reason you're probably gonna get
this<00:01:34.670> set<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:35.090> for<00:01:35.120> the<00:01:35.479> parts<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:36.650> get<00:01:36.770> ninety

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
this set is for the parts you get ninety

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.410 
this set is for the parts you get ninety
five<00:01:37.250> parts<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:37.909> know<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.150> doesn't<00:01:38.180> look

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
five parts and I know it doesn't look

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.600 
five parts and I know it doesn't look
like<00:01:38.659> much<00:01:39.049> when<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.500> set<00:01:39.740> is<00:01:39.920> built<00:01:40.190> but<00:01:40.460> it's

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
like much when the set is built but it's

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.859 
like much when the set is built but it's
actually<00:01:40.909> a<00:01:40.940> lot<00:01:41.090> more<00:01:41.119> parts<00:01:41.510> than<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:41.720> might

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
actually a lot more parts than you might

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.830 
actually a lot more parts than you might
think

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
think

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.260 
think
there<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:45.470> isn't<00:01:45.770> okay<00:01:45.890> set<00:01:46.310> Duffing<00:01:47.150> out

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
there this isn't okay set Duffing out

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.760 
there this isn't okay set Duffing out
the<00:01:47.360> best<00:01:47.540> microfiber<00:01:47.990> series<00:01:48.409> set<00:01:48.590> because

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
the best microfiber series set because

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.460 
the best microfiber series set because
it<00:01:48.920> even<00:01:49.850> though<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.450> box<00:01:50.810> here<00:01:51.110> is<00:01:51.200> claiming

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
it even though the box here is claiming

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.050 
it even though the box here is claiming
that<00:01:51.619> this<00:01:51.770> is<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:51.920> brand<00:01:52.280> new<00:01:52.369> figure<00:01:52.790> we<00:01:52.909> all

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
that this is a brand new figure we all

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.609 
that this is a brand new figure we all
know<00:01:53.450> that<00:01:53.810> it's<00:01:53.990> not<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.530> brand<00:01:54.740> new<00:01:54.860> figure

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
know that it's not a brand new figure

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.700 
know that it's not a brand new figure
anywho<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:58.310> set<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:58.900> pretty<00:01:59.900> okay<00:02:00.140> but<00:02:00.590> you're

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
anywho the set is pretty okay but you're

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.690 
anywho the set is pretty okay but you're
probably<00:02:00.799> just<00:02:01.010> gonna<00:02:01.130> buy<00:02:01.340> this<00:02:01.400> for<00:02:01.640> the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
probably just gonna buy this for the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.429 
probably just gonna buy this for the
carts<00:02:01.939> because<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:02.299> droid<00:02:02.510> it's<00:02:03.020> not<00:02:03.140> even<00:02:03.380> a

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
carts because the droid it's not even a

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.690 
carts because the droid it's not even a
regular<00:02:03.619> battle<00:02:04.040> droid<00:02:04.220> so<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:04.430> can't<00:02:04.610> really

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
regular battle droid so you can't really

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.780 
regular battle droid so you can't really
use<00:02:04.820> it<00:02:04.939> for<00:02:05.090> army<00:02:05.510> building<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:06.890> would<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.430> much

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
use it for army building I would a much

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.020 
use it for army building I would a much

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.100 
recommendation for the number 1
microfiber<00:03:52.940> sets<00:03:53.270> to<00:03:53.420> get<00:03:53.570> it's<00:03:53.780> definitely

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
microfiber sets to get it's definitely

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.150 
microfiber sets to get it's definitely
the<00:03:54.200> quality<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.709> tank<00:03:54.890> I<00:03:54.980> have<00:03:55.070> the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
the quality of the tank I have the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.240 
the quality of the tank I have the
entire<00:03:55.400> 6<00:03:56.110> but<00:03:57.110> there's<00:03:57.290> other<00:03:57.500> ones<00:03:57.680> like<00:03:58.040> the

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
entire 6 but there's other ones like the

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.790 
entire 6 but there's other ones like the
I<00:03:58.280> think<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:59.290> imperial<00:04:00.290> star<00:04:00.440> destroyer

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
I think the imperial star destroyer

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.140 
I think the imperial star destroyer
microfiber<00:04:01.370> set<00:04:01.580> is<00:04:01.670> really<00:04:01.880> cool<00:04:02.030> because

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
microfiber set is really cool because

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.080 
microfiber set is really cool because
you<00:04:02.300> get<00:04:02.420> a<00:04:02.450> special<00:04:02.840> imperial<00:04:03.350> officer<00:04:04.090> so

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
you get a special imperial officer so

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.520 
you get a special imperial officer so
compared<00:04:05.540> to<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.660> other<00:04:05.840> microfiber<00:04:06.230> sets

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
compared to the other microfiber sets

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.930 
compared to the other microfiber sets
that<00:04:06.650> actually<00:04:06.920> have<00:04:07.070> exclusive<00:04:07.640> figures

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
that actually have exclusive figures
