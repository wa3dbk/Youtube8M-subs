so<00:00:37.170> you've<00:00:37.410> got<00:00:38.600> reinforced<00:00:39.600> grip<00:00:39.840> at<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
so you've got reinforced grip at the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.180 
so you've got reinforced grip at the
bottom<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.219> if<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.570> drop<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.739> also<00:00:43.950> have

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
bottom so if you drop it you also have

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.860 
bottom so if you drop it you also have
padding<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> bottom<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.420> all<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.780> your

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
padding on the bottom so all of your

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.040 
padding on the bottom so all of your
equipment<00:00:46.110> inside<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.829> fairly<00:00:47.100> safe

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
equipment inside is fairly safe

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.229 
equipment inside is fairly safe
you've<00:00:49.050> got<00:00:49.289> grip<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.250> inner<00:00:50.579> sin<00:00:50.969> sides

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
you've got grip on the inner sin sides

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.569 
you've got grip on the inner sin sides
of<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> shoulder<00:00:51.899> pads<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.829> also<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:55.579> these

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
of the shoulder pads you also have these

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.860 
of the shoulder pads you also have these
front<00:00:57.030> clips<00:00:58.190> so<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.760> their<00:01:00.300> backpack<00:01:00.719> is

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
front clips so if their backpack is

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.779 
front clips so if their backpack is
actually<00:01:01.199> heavier<00:01:01.620> than<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.070> expect<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.609> as

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
actually heavier than you expect it as

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.580 
but that's not my 15 inch MacBook Pro I
have<00:04:41.380> a<00:04:41.410> 15<00:04:42.100> inch<00:04:42.340> HP<00:04:43.270> and<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.170> reason<00:04:44.470> why<00:04:44.560> I

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
have a 15 inch HP and the reason why I

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.260 
have a 15 inch HP and the reason why I
bring<00:04:44.800> this<00:04:44.860> up<00:04:45.160> is<00:04:45.370> because<00:04:45.670> I<00:04:48.120> believe<00:04:49.120> the

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
bring this up is because I believe the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.360 
bring this up is because I believe the
measurements<00:04:49.750> are<00:04:49.840> very<00:04:49.870> specific<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:51.340> a

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
measurements are very specific to a

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.180 
measurements are very specific to a
15-inch<00:04:51.970> MacBook<00:04:52.060> Pro<00:04:52.630> because<00:04:53.530> when<00:04:53.830> I

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
15-inch MacBook Pro because when I

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.250 
15-inch MacBook Pro because when I
attempt<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.210> put<00:04:55.420> my<00:04:55.600> 15<00:04:55.990> inch<00:04:56.170> HP<00:04:57.840> it<00:04:58.840> slides

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
attempt to put my 15 inch HP it slides

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.140 
attempt to put my 15 inch HP it slides
in<00:04:59.470> fairly<00:04:59.860> well<00:05:00.040> which<00:05:00.520> is<00:05:00.640> not<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:00.850> problem

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
in fairly well which is not a problem

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.280 
in fairly well which is not a problem
but<00:05:01.380> zipping<00:05:02.380> I<00:05:03.210> can't<00:05:04.210> zipper<00:05:04.510> up<00:05:04.630> so<00:05:04.870> easily

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
but zipping I can't zipper up so easily

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.130 
but zipping I can't zipper up so easily
in<00:05:05.470> fact<00:05:05.950> I'm<00:05:06.580> pushing<00:05:07.210> down<00:05:07.450> on<00:05:07.480> the<00:05:07.720> computer

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
in fact I'm pushing down on the computer

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.710

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
so much and stretching the zipper that I

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.590 
so much and stretching the zipper that I
might<00:05:11.230> break<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.620> zipper<00:05:11.890> so<00:05:12.450> just<00:05:13.450> be<00:05:13.570> aware

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600
