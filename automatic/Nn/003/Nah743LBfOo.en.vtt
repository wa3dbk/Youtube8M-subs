00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
so after an initial ride of a boat

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.730 
so after an initial ride of a boat
roughly<00:00:08.500> 60<00:00:08.889> miles<00:00:09.100> six<00:00:09.520> hours<00:00:09.850> on<00:00:10.030> it<00:00:10.150> we<00:00:10.270> have

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
roughly 60 miles six hours on it we have

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.459 
roughly 60 miles six hours on it we have
gone<00:00:11.740> ahead<00:00:11.950> and<00:00:12.690> installed<00:00:13.690> the<00:00:13.809> 3/4<00:00:14.440> inch

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
gone ahead and installed the 3/4 inch

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.980 
gone ahead and installed the 3/4 inch
spring<00:00:15.190> spacer<00:00:15.580> on<00:00:15.730> the<00:00:15.849> shock<00:00:16.090> cranked<00:00:16.930> up

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
spring spacer on the shock cranked up

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.109 
spring spacer on the shock cranked up
the<00:00:17.050> preload<00:00:17.500> all<00:00:17.680> the<00:00:17.800> way<00:00:17.950> the<00:00:18.910> discussion

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
the preload all the way the discussion

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.850 
the preload all the way the discussion
was<00:00:19.599> that<00:00:19.630> you<00:00:20.020> know<00:00:20.110> there<00:00:20.290> was<00:00:20.380> some<00:00:20.529> concern

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
was that you know there was some concern

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.269 
was that you know there was some concern
there<00:00:21.070> maybe<00:00:21.279> with<00:00:21.520> some<00:00:21.790> aggressive<00:00:22.300> riding

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
there maybe with some aggressive riding

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.139 
there maybe with some aggressive riding
wheelies<00:00:24.279> that<00:00:24.489> type<00:00:24.700> of<00:00:24.730> thing<00:00:25.000> that<00:00:25.029> we

00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:25.149 
wheelies that type of thing that we

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:27.030 
wheelies that type of thing that we
there<00:00:25.810> was<00:00:25.960> a<00:00:26.020> chance<00:00:26.380> that<00:00:26.529> we<00:00:26.619> could<00:00:26.800> take

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
there was a chance that we could take

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.159 
there was a chance that we could take
those<00:00:27.250> headlights<00:00:27.640> up<00:00:27.849> top<00:00:28.090> so<00:00:28.779> we<00:00:28.899> went<00:00:29.079> in

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
those headlights up top so we went in

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.220 
those headlights up top so we went in
ahead<00:00:29.259> and<00:00:29.649> installed<00:00:30.189> that<00:00:31.079> installed<00:00:32.079> the

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
ahead and installed that installed the

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.220 
ahead and installed that installed the
spacer<00:00:32.649> on<00:00:32.829> the<00:00:33.010> front<00:00:33.540> left<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.750> rear<00:00:34.930> alone

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
spacer on the front left the rear alone

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.350 
spacer on the front left the rear alone
so<00:00:35.500> we'll<00:00:35.620> try<00:00:35.829> that<00:00:35.860> on<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.370> next<00:00:36.550> ride<00:00:37.120> out

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
so we'll try that on the next ride out

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.080 
so we'll try that on the next ride out
the<00:00:38.080> other<00:00:38.230> thing<00:00:38.500> we<00:00:38.650> noticed<00:00:39.070> which<00:00:39.940> was

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
the other thing we noticed which was

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.810 
the other thing we noticed which was
quite<00:00:40.270> surprising<00:00:40.330> on<00:00:41.050> it<00:00:41.370> with<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.520> Looney

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
quite surprising on it with the Looney

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.160 
quite surprising on it with the Looney
tune<00:00:43.030> slip-on<00:00:43.540> exhaust<00:00:44.220> and<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:46.390> 800<00:00:46.540> engine

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
tune slip-on exhaust and the 800 engine

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.930 
tune slip-on exhaust and the 800 engine
it<00:00:47.260> was<00:00:47.350> actually<00:00:47.710> running<00:00:47.950> quite<00:00:48.250> lean<00:00:48.610> and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
it was actually running quite lean and

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.990 
it was actually running quite lean and
it<00:00:49.180> it<00:00:49.570> got<00:00:49.750> worse<00:00:49.960> as<00:00:50.200> the<00:00:50.350> hours<00:00:50.700> were<00:00:51.700> piled

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
it it got worse as the hours were piled

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.440 
it it got worse as the hours were piled
on<00:00:52.210> to<00:00:52.450> it<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:54.190> I<00:00:54.250> said<00:00:54.310> this<00:00:54.579> was<00:00:54.880> a<00:00:54.910> surprise

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
on to it like I said this was a surprise

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.330 
on to it like I said this was a surprise
because<00:00:56.340> usually<00:00:57.340> with<00:00:57.700> the<00:00:57.820> 800<00:00:58.239> engine<00:00:59.340> we

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
because usually with the 800 engine we

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.819 
because usually with the 800 engine we
can<00:01:00.370> install<00:01:00.760> an<00:01:00.910> HM<00:01:01.180> F<00:01:01.300> slip<00:01:01.570> on<00:01:01.750> or<00:01:01.989> different

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
can install an HM F slip on or different

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.730 
can install an HM F slip on or different
styles<00:01:03.160> of<00:01:03.310> slip-on<00:01:03.910> exhaust<00:01:04.379> exhausts<00:01:05.379> on<00:01:05.500> to

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
styles of slip-on exhaust exhausts on to

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.249 
styles of slip-on exhaust exhausts on to
them<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:06.040> not<00:01:06.670> really<00:01:06.939> have<00:01:07.090> an<00:01:07.210> issue<00:01:07.360> with

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
them and not really have an issue with

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.620 
them and not really have an issue with
the<00:01:08.380> fuel<00:01:08.620> controller<00:01:09.040> on<00:01:09.220> it<00:01:09.340> but<00:01:09.430> this<00:01:09.930> LT<00:01:10.930> e

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the fuel controller on it but this LT e

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.330 
the fuel controller on it but this LT e
glued<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.810> pipe<00:01:14.020> really<00:01:14.470> quickly<00:01:14.890> on<00:01:15.070> it<00:01:16.050> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
glued the pipe really quickly on it and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.200 
glued the pipe really quickly on it and
you<00:01:18.340> could<00:01:18.490> just<00:01:18.580> hear<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:18.909> when<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.060> was

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
you could just hear it when it was

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.080 
you could just hear it when it was
running<00:01:19.420> it<00:01:19.600> was<00:01:19.720> running<00:01:19.990> really<00:01:20.260> lean<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.740> it

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
running it was running really lean to it

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.860 
running it was running really lean to it
so<00:01:22.090> I<00:01:22.120> went<00:01:22.299> ahead<00:01:22.450> and<00:01:22.780> installed<00:01:23.020> our<00:01:24.870> Dobek

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
so I went ahead and installed our Dobek

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.219 
so I went ahead and installed our Dobek
safer<00:01:26.409> tool<00:01:26.620> which<00:01:27.280> is<00:01:27.400> basically<00:01:27.729> a<00:01:28.229> tuning

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
safer tool which is basically a tuning

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.140 
safer tool which is basically a tuning
tool<00:01:29.409> that<00:01:29.650> consists<00:01:30.250> of<00:01:30.400> an<00:01:30.580> air<00:01:30.820> fuel<00:01:31.090> ratio

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
tool that consists of an air fuel ratio

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.789 
tool that consists of an air fuel ratio
gauge<00:01:32.460> along<00:01:33.460> with<00:01:33.700> an<00:01:33.850> o2<00:01:34.000> sensor<00:01:34.720> that<00:01:35.650> we

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
gauge along with an o2 sensor that we

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.270 
gauge along with an o2 sensor that we
can<00:01:36.010> quickly<00:01:36.190> tap<00:01:36.580> into<00:01:36.940> a<00:01:36.970> stock<00:01:37.420> exhaust

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
can quickly tap into a stock exhaust

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.920 
can quickly tap into a stock exhaust
take<00:01:39.280> some<00:01:39.490> readings<00:01:39.820> off<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.360> sure

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
take some readings off it and sure

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.600 
take some readings off it and sure
enough<00:01:40.960> I<00:01:41.290> went<00:01:41.409> for<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:41.680> quick<00:01:41.799> test<00:01:42.130> ride<00:01:42.400> and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
enough I went for a quick test ride and

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.330 
enough I went for a quick test ride and
confirmed<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.119> I<00:01:43.210> was<00:01:43.240> running<00:01:43.479> really<00:01:43.840> lean

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
confirmed that I was running really lean

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.969 
confirmed that I was running really lean
well<00:01:45.340> over<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:45.790> 15<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:48.159> 16<00:01:48.610> mark<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:50.500> idle

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
well over that 15 to 16 mark that idle

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.289 
well over that 15 to 16 mark that idle
at<00:01:51.540> acceleration<00:01:52.540> and<00:01:52.960> at<00:01:53.500> cruise<00:01:53.799> speeds<00:01:54.299> so

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
at acceleration and at cruise speeds so

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.370 
at acceleration and at cruise speeds so
the<00:01:55.659> next<00:01:55.840> step<00:01:56.110> what<00:01:56.560> we<00:01:56.650> did<00:01:56.830> is<00:01:56.979> install<00:01:57.670> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the next step what we did is install the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.280 
the next step what we did is install the
ejk<00:01:59.380> tuner<00:02:00.360> got<00:02:01.360> it<00:02:01.450> located<00:02:01.840> in<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.140> rear

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
ejk tuner got it located in the rear

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.609 
ejk tuner got it located in the rear
storage<00:02:02.409> box<00:02:02.950> here<00:02:03.340> in<00:02:03.549> a<00:02:03.729> moose<00:02:04.619> waterproof

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
storage box here in a moose waterproof

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.320 
storage box here in a moose waterproof
container<00:02:06.009> but<00:02:06.250> it's<00:02:06.400> an<00:02:06.490> e<00:02:06.580> JK<00:02:07.000> fuel

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
container but it's an e JK fuel

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.160 
container but it's an e JK fuel
controller<00:02:08.369> basically<00:02:09.369> adds<00:02:09.549> fuel<00:02:09.989> they<00:02:10.989> are

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
controller basically adds fuel they are

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.929 
controller basically adds fuel they are
at<00:02:11.290> water<00:02:11.500> they<00:02:11.709> are<00:02:11.739> not<00:02:12.040> waterproof<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:12.819> we

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:12.939 
at water they are not waterproof so we

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.509 
at water they are not waterproof so we
seal<00:02:13.150> them<00:02:13.299> up<00:02:13.419> in<00:02:13.599> a<00:02:13.650> bed<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.769> moose<00:02:14.950> OtterBox

the throttle back to that 12 and a half

13<00:03:13.030> get<00:03:13.570> some<00:03:13.810> fuel<00:03:13.989> flowing<00:03:14.440> through<00:03:14.590> the

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
13 get some fuel flowing through the

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.380 
13 get some fuel flowing through the
cylinders<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.370> that's<00:03:16.000> how<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.209> create

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
cylinders and that's how you create

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.229 
cylinders and that's how you create
power<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.310> think<00:03:18.400> we<00:03:18.610> have<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:18.880> all<00:03:18.970> dialed

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
power so I think we have it all dialed

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:27.360 
power so I think we have it all dialed
in<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.459> few<00:03:24.700> more<00:03:24.880> starts<00:03:25.360> with<00:03:25.570> it<00:03:26.370> feels

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
in so a few more starts with it feels

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.640 
in so a few more starts with it feels
a--<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:27.880> runs<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.299> lot<00:03:28.480> nicer<00:03:28.750> runs<00:03:29.380> a<00:03:29.470> lot

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
a-- it runs a lot nicer runs a lot

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.270 
a-- it runs a lot nicer runs a lot
smoother

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.220
