hi<00:00:02.310> today<00:00:02.760> we're<00:00:02.970> having<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.240> quick<00:00:03.419> look<00:00:03.480> at

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
hi today we're having a quick look at

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.179 
hi today we're having a quick look at
the<00:00:04.290> M<00:00:04.620> 70<00:00:05.190> mixer<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.350> we're<00:00:07.350> using<00:00:07.560> it<00:00:07.770> with

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
the M 70 mixer and we're using it with

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.350 
the M 70 mixer and we're using it with
Traktor<00:00:08.700> scratch<00:00:08.730> or<00:00:09.240> tractor<00:00:09.960> Pro<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:11.360> we

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
Traktor scratch or tractor Pro and we

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.480 
Traktor scratch or tractor Pro and we
want<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.960> use<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.620> as<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> standalone

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
want to use it as a standalone

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.240 
want to use it as a standalone
controller<00:00:16.279> so<00:00:17.630> we've<00:00:18.630> modified<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.770> tractor

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
controller so we've modified the tractor

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.950 
controller so we've modified the tractor
making<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.609> wee<00:00:20.760> bit<00:00:20.820> essentially<00:00:21.810> we've

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
making a wee bit essentially we've

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.849 
making a wee bit essentially we've
turned<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:23.039> two<00:00:23.670> job<00:00:23.910> wheels<00:00:24.199> the<00:00:25.199> -<00:00:25.470> Gregory

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
turned the two job wheels the - Gregory

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.450 
turned the two job wheels the - Gregory
encoders<00:00:26.340> rather<00:00:26.550> into<00:00:26.939> jog<00:00:27.390> wheels<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
encoders rather into jog wheels and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.880 
encoders rather into jog wheels and
we've<00:00:29.460> improved<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.210> fastest<00:00:30.960> search<00:00:31.199> and

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
we've improved the fastest search and

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.510 
we've improved the fastest search and
we've<00:00:32.009> also<00:00:32.160> added<00:00:32.520> some<00:00:34.100> master<00:00:35.100> tempo

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
we've also added some master tempo

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.610 
we've also added some master tempo
control<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:36.270> pitch<00:00:36.540> bends<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.230> we<00:00:37.350> can

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
control in pitch bends so that we can

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.709 
control in pitch bends so that we can
synchronize<00:00:38.550> things<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> master<00:00:39.530> so

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
synchronize things to the master so

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.930 
synchronize things to the master so
let's<00:00:42.719> load<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.050> track<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.440> there<00:00:43.670> now<00:00:44.670> first

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
let's load of track in there now first

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.299 
let's load of track in there now first
of<00:00:45.059> all<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:46.050> queuing<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.440> track<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:47.160> was<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
of all for queuing a track it was a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
of all for queuing a track it was a
little<00:00:47.520> bit<00:00:47.640> fiddly<00:00:48.420> before<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.410> now<00:00:49.500> we

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
little bit fiddly before but now we

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.010 
little bit fiddly before but now we
simply<00:00:49.920> push<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.340> shift<00:00:50.550> key<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.030> turn<00:00:51.840> our

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
simply push the shift key and turn our

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:02.279 
simply push the shift key and turn our
rotary<00:00:52.350> encoder

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.850 

we<00:01:02.829> can<00:01:03.039> sit<00:01:03.219> up<00:01:03.309> keep<00:01:03.519> going

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.690 

and<00:01:08.860> we're<00:01:09.070> away<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.950> can<00:01:12.100> also<00:01:12.250> use<00:01:12.549> the

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
and we're away we can also use the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:22.050 
and we're away we can also use the
rotary<00:01:13.030> encoder<00:01:13.119> with<00:01:13.689> the<00:01:13.840> of<00:01:20.880> course<00:01:21.880> we've

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
rotary encoder with the of course we've

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:33.960 
rotary encoder with the of course we've
also<00:01:22.240> got<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.950> spend<00:01:24.030> lever<00:01:25.030> here<00:01:31.830> now<00:01:32.970> back

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
also got the spend lever here now back

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.899 
also got the spend lever here now back
to<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.180> jog<00:01:34.390> wheel<00:01:34.600> here<00:01:34.840> we've<00:01:35.190> also<00:01:36.190> headed

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
to the jog wheel here we've also headed

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.690 
to the jog wheel here we've also headed
in<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.330> script<00:01:38.200> ooh<00:01:38.470> touchy<00:01:38.830> job<00:01:39.280> we<00:01:39.670> all

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
in the script ooh touchy job we all

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.270 
in the script ooh touchy job we all
touched<00:01:40.030> function<00:01:40.630> so<00:01:41.500> we<00:01:41.619> can<00:01:41.649> actually<00:01:42.069> grab

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
touched function so we can actually grab

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.350 
touched function so we can actually grab
a<00:01:42.310> bit<00:01:42.580> costly<00:01:47.550> can<00:01:48.550> hold<00:01:48.759> on<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:49.000> their<00:01:49.149> feet

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
a bit costly can hold on to their feet

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.010 
a bit costly can hold on to their feet
and<00:01:49.810> release<00:01:50.319> it<00:01:50.470> when<00:01:50.560> we<00:01:50.740> want<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.100> play

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.240 

they<00:01:56.020> might<00:01:56.200> make<00:01:56.350> things<00:01:56.530> a<00:01:56.679> bit<00:01:56.800> easier<00:01:56.830> if

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
they might make things a bit easier if

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.480 
they might make things a bit easier if
you're<00:01:57.399> in<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.549> hurry<00:01:57.700> too<00:01:59.039> cute<00:02:00.039> do<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.369> don't

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
you're in a hurry too cute do you don't

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.080 
you're in a hurry too cute do you don't
have<00:02:00.670> time<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.090> second<00:02:01.360> key<00:02:01.479> point

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.959 

now<00:02:05.090> with<00:02:05.689> also<00:02:06.049> fixed<00:02:06.530> up<00:02:06.679> the<00:02:06.950> pitch<00:02:07.520> bender

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
now with also fixed up the pitch bender

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.779 
now with also fixed up the pitch bender
was<00:02:08.119> a<00:02:08.149> little<00:02:08.479> out<00:02:09.289> of<00:02:09.349> hand<00:02:09.500> before<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:10.190> fast

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
was a little out of hand before the fast

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.729 
was a little out of hand before the fast
search<00:02:11.120> rather<00:02:12.430> so<00:02:13.430> we<00:02:14.390> hope<00:02:14.569> shift<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.230> fast

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
search rather so we hope shift and fast

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.320 
search rather so we hope shift and fast
search<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:19.220> put<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.400> lot<00:02:19.610> smoother<00:02:20.000> than<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.150> was

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
search to put a lot smoother than it was

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:29.770 
search to put a lot smoother than it was
before<00:02:28.209> missed<00:02:29.209> my<00:02:29.390> cue

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
before missed my cue

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:43.780 
before missed my cue
so<00:02:32.680> Riku<00:02:41.860> okay<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.069> third<00:02:43.220> function<00:02:43.519> we

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
so Riku okay the third function we

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.059 
so Riku okay the third function we
entered<00:02:44.060> was<00:02:44.239> master<00:02:45.079> tempo<00:02:45.440> control<00:02:48.069> using

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
entered was master tempo control using

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.830 
entered was master tempo control using
the<00:02:49.099> shift<00:02:49.400> key<00:02:51.819> is<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:53.030> central<00:02:53.510> rotary

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
the shift key is the central rotary

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:03.170 
the shift key is the central rotary
encoder

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:16.530 

it<00:03:04.180> also<00:03:04.300> puts<00:03:04.690> baby<00:03:05.019> using<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.739> ticks<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:15.540> so

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
it also puts baby using the ticks and so

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.089 
it also puts baby using the ticks and so
there's<00:03:16.750> just<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:17.200> couple<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.830> really<00:03:18.010> simple

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
there's just a couple of really simple

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.460 
there's just a couple of really simple
and<00:03:18.640> basic<00:03:19.000> mods<00:03:19.209> we've<00:03:19.450> done<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.140> MIDI

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
and basic mods we've done to the MIDI

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.309 
and basic mods we've done to the MIDI
file<00:03:20.819> so<00:03:21.819> that<00:03:21.849> you<00:03:22.000> can<00:03:22.209> use<00:03:22.360> your<00:03:22.540> m7e<00:03:23.200> as<00:03:23.290> a

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
file so that you can use your m7e as a

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.700 
file so that you can use your m7e as a
completely<00:03:23.739> standalone<00:03:24.069> controller
