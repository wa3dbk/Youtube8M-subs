00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 this the film represents the bag Grant was and suddenly were the methods 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.280
 The riding pedagogue Perry is facing criticism - already started as 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.429
 Teen riding lessons suddenly give their meanwhile 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.940
 decades of experience with horses and riders with great idealism 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.050
 she learned with Szabics meets the method of profound in German 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.310
 from the body center that on the bodywork of the Alexander Technique and 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.360
 Martial arts building also eases Ellington Films heavily influenced Perry 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.810
 and inspired her own bodywork sections 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.060
 to develop for horses and riders 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.590
 The first step is this analysis 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.610
 how can i check my seat firstly put down start 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.640
 the one hand stuck in the mane and exciting the one with reins contact 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.109
 on who is not in balance 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.549
 In doing so, a tension will feel the muscles and attractive 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.940
 Second, how stable when I discover 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.000
 Peggy slightly different in the loins against the riders 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.550
 is 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.550
 the rider is not sitting enough trader position 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.370
 third, how stable am I in the upper body 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.450
 the pressure against the upper chest creates tension without a neutral pelvis 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.400
 in the lower back and in the hips 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.180
 and criticisms are both wars up like a coupe through this attitude 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.550
 the back gets loose 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.720
 a hollow cross is no longer possible 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.530
 so you can feel his back very well 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.890
 the solar plexus below the ribs will be ranked second in the future 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.480
 takes helpful 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.440
 this exercise with visible cold chain 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.770
 a dressage device is moved horizontally between both hands 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.730
 both honored ducks describing tiny circling movements 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.240
 Beqiri turns her upper body very slowly first to the left and then 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.880
 Going to the right legs continue with tiny wobbling 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.080
 movements 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.590
 those who pull in balance can easily keep the whip upright 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.050
 you can imagine a searchlight in the stomach face with 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.340
 the body turn with moves 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.250
 PEGI works with Kohl called Hanks and his posture and his 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.030
 Body feeling improved with the help of Connected Gram Gold exercises 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.210
 this exercise namely Wacken pressure No ultimately the left hand lay on the 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.899
 Nose with the fist of the right the bridge I gently on the cheek 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:26.289
 I want to make Paul move his nose in my direction 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.430
 Peggy turns slogan around her own axis by stepping backwards sideways 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.069
 she knows the leash she is aiming for a contact to the comic 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.069
 Vaccines helps to balance 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.629
 Once again, the skua gulls along the neck which contributes to Paul's ALK 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.489
 Although it lowers on the head forward downlink Euro 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.599
 next to Bayer at Bari 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.879
 again the preparation to enter 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.250
 Peggy rotates her upper body covenant demands Paul's left hind leg more 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:08.469
 Actions on 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:12.659
 Raul's reactions he becomes slower from his behavior it becomes clear that 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.879
 Paul still can not provide enough in the third area I have to deal with it 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.599
 continue to offer them 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.610
 but I realize that he responds to my help and that is positive 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.279
 ca 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:31.659
 This film gives an introduction to the criticism Grambow falls ill with the methods 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.230
 he should show them that it is possible easily and with an effective 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:38.439
 To keep communication 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.859
 Criticism - and invites you to learn how the movements of the

 the floor work supports the training in the saddle you are a good one 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:54.189
 Entry to the balloons and natural stability of horse and rider too 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:55.389
 schools 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.609
 The dry exercises are also very helpful 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.569
 and can offer anywhere 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.569
 For example, in the office when a break is announced 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.899
 a soft and harmonious part with her horse had to stay his dream
