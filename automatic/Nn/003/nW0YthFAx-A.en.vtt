00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.900 
kind of suggesting that maybe if he is
thinking<00:01:50.710> about<00:01:51.010> taking<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.550> money<00:01:51.700> because

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
of course he'll be tempted but he just

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.860 
of course he'll be tempted but he just
runs<00:01:54.400> out<00:01:54.610> there<00:01:54.850> saying<00:01:55.120> that<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.720> doesn't

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
runs out there saying that it doesn't

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.140 
runs out there saying that it doesn't
match<00:01:56.110> anything<00:01:56.410> in<00:01:56.590> his<00:01:56.740> wardrobe<00:01:57.220> and<00:01:57.460> the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
match anything in his wardrobe and the

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.060 
match anything in his wardrobe and the
approach<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.660> spider-man<00:01:59.350> has<00:01:59.650> to<00:01:59.860> stuff
