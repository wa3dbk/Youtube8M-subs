00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.910
 making each is very simple they just 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.340
 take a little more need a little 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.480
 more time but then I swear that 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.130
 it's very worth it 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.080
 here I have four kilos of bones 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.809
 I picked up our larger ones because there are more 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.640
 resulting marrow leaves the car 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.180
 a little thicker with a very bright 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.189
 good 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.380
 puts the matter one way and I go 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.400
 to give them tomato paste here 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.510
 I'm using roughly about three 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.220
 spoons of sound 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.080
 this extract is more to give a color 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.199
 more beautiful is changed but if you do not want 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.360
 use no need to take it to the oven at 250 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.890
 degrees and letting them like it is good 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.520
 take care of this part because they have to 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.739
 to gild 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.510
 they can not take is also good and 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.629
 caring and turning our characters 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.430
 all sides when you have so come 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.370
 golden I put two carrots 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.250
 peeled and sliced ​​and 4 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.949
 chopped onions in 4 leading back 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.780
 to the oven and leave the next ten 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.660
 only minutes to release later 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.309
 I shot the oven on a beach that I 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.640
 I have a pan with five liters of 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.710
 water is important antonela very large 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.380
 puts the bones inside the pan and into the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.720
 so some were glued waste 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.970
 so I 'll throw it with some water 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.619
 and I'm shaving with a spoon can also 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.570
 use red wine if you want 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.880
 I take the whole link from 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.759
 wonderful that I am all together 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.720
 vegetables and add 2 celery stalk 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.530
 with leaf a packet of parsley and a branch 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.869
 thyme 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.640
 there is also good to put black pepper 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.770
 that I'm going to use a teaspoon 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.829
 it gives a super good aroma because of 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.439
 Now face slowly cook slowly. 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.970
 on a very low fire without a cap for 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.670
 minimum three hours 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.170
 the longer it gets darker and 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.570
 the more tasty your car will be 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.970
 after that time I body for a 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.830
 sieve and take to the refrigerator 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.050
 It is important to take the refrigerator because the 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.850
 beef broth he has more fat 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.280
 so when it takes more modern fat 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.780
 hardens and separates from the liquid 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.360
 so it is much easier to take 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.390
 fat in the next episode itself in a 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.910
 soup that the base of it is the broth of meat 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.229
 so do it because the recipe is great and 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.229
 You will not regret
