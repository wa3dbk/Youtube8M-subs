00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
nd three laser to this gun just so that

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.550 
nd three laser to this gun just so that
I<00:03:44.580> could<00:03:44.670> test<00:03:45.000> both<00:03:45.300> day<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:45.630> night<00:03:45.930> shooting

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
I could test both day and night shooting

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.400 
I could test both day and night shooting
what<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.280> found<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:48.420> regardless<00:03:48.660> of<00:03:49.230> day<00:03:49.380> or

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
what I found that regardless of day or

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.070 
what I found that regardless of day or
night<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.950> was<00:03:50.220> getting<00:03:50.370> 10<00:03:50.820> for<00:03:51.060> 10<00:03:51.269> on<00:03:51.480> my

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
night I was getting 10 for 10 on my

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.890 
night I was getting 10 for 10 on my
shots<00:03:52.380> out<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.890> 30<00:03:53.160> yards<00:03:53.550> it<00:03:54.390> did<00:03:54.660> make<00:03:54.870> a

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
shots out to 30 yards it did make a

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.690 
shots out to 30 yards it did make a
difference<00:03:55.170> whether<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.860> was<00:03:55.980> daytime<00:03:56.430> or

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
difference whether it was daytime or

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.540 
difference whether it was daytime or
nighttime<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.930> could<00:03:58.590> still<00:03:58.830> put<00:03:59.040> LED<00:03:59.220> right

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
nighttime I could still put LED right

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.380 
nighttime I could still put LED right
where<00:03:59.730> I<00:03:59.760> needed<00:04:00.030> to

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.000 

so<00:04:06.390> now<00:04:06.540> I've<00:04:06.750> got<00:04:06.959> some<00:04:07.200> really<00:04:07.440> cool<00:04:07.620> footage

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
so now I've got some really cool footage

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.880 
so now I've got some really cool footage

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.219 
yard so go ahead and take a look at this
video<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.150> can<00:04:27.330> see<00:04:27.479> exactly<00:04:27.600> how<00:04:28.169> the

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
video and you can see exactly how the

00:04:28.229 --> 00:05:19.680 
video and you can see exactly how the
end<00:04:28.620> e3<00:04:29.010> looks<00:04:29.250> through<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.610> scope

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.600 

so<00:05:20.690> we<00:05:20.810> know<00:05:20.960> that<00:05:20.990> it's<00:05:21.320> cool<00:05:21.560> and<00:05:22.100> we<00:05:22.250> can<00:05:22.280> see

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
so we know that it's cool and we can see

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.970 
so we know that it's cool and we can see
that<00:05:22.760> it<00:05:22.880> works<00:05:23.350> what's<00:05:24.350> it<00:05:24.470> cost

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
that it works what's it cost

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.480 
that it works what's it cost
well<00:05:25.940> frankly<00:05:26.300> it's<00:05:26.330> not<00:05:26.630> cheap<00:05:27.230> this<00:05:28.040> model

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
well frankly it's not cheap this model

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.230 
well frankly it's not cheap this model
runs<00:05:28.700> about<00:05:29.470> $260<00:05:30.470> at<00:05:30.620> pyramid<00:05:31.010> Ericom<00:05:31.550> so

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
runs about $260 at pyramid Ericom so

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.460 
runs about $260 at pyramid Ericom so
it's<00:05:32.390> certainly<00:05:32.570> not<00:05:32.750> going<00:05:33.140> to<00:05:33.230> be<00:05:33.350> on

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
it's certainly not going to be on

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.340 
it's certainly not going to be on
everybody<00:05:33.980> shopping<00:05:34.310> list<00:05:34.720> it<00:05:35.720> does<00:05:36.050> fill

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
some other needs however because the

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.200 
some other needs however because the
