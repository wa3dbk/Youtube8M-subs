00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.130
 ladsous and compass and welcome another 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.280
 new video and how they saw it in the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.580
 big title fauto 5 heist mission 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.559
 of marmot ok this is something in which 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.599
 they wanted to speak today because 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.000
 have recently emerged in things 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.869
 quite strange and the user ba dinh 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.689
 m 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.510
 he has posted a video in which he sees 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.420
 listen to the dialogues of a mission that 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.400
 he was never in the game or he never was 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.890
 pretend not to be the truth that is 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.219
 quite strange and it seems to be a 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.260
 exaggeratedly humorous emission the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.250
 true that it looks pretty good and more or 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.800
 least I think it was done or more than 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.510
 nothing had appearance during the beta of 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.940
 big point 5 not when they are testing 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.219
 the game and a few small changes 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.590
 example in this audio that may 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.420
 listen if they click on the description 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.090
 in the audio that I'm going to leave 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.430
 realize that michael in the beta or in 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.809
 testing or creating the game does not 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.210
 had the name of michael in this 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.400
 character had the name of albert already 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.750
 that Trevor refers to him as Albert and 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.570
 not like michael 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.890
 rockstar games changed the name of 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.390
 albert to michael because the truth that a 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.490
 I would not like that name at all 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.979
 I do not like each character his identity 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.450
 It is very well placed and positioned and 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.580
 I think you have one left 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.860
 quite well his name not so much to 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.690
 trevor fits him and we place his 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.390
 name as michael as well as 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.310
 franklin not and more or less the mission if 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.050
 they want to see a little bit like what 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.990
 or who are there a little bit of what 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.479
 it is treated like I think I was going to 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.430
 have a house to buy it or 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.619
 something like that and they saw the possibility for 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.229
 steal this house to future people who 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.420
 I went to live there and later I would have 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.880
 to be a big robbery in which I think that 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.770
 they would have to steal a purebred horse 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.690
 it's quite strange indeed if 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.670
 they listen to the mission or more than anything 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.280
 lost audio are going to realize that 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.560
 well basically it's something pretty 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.930
 weird I do not know that the mission is pretty 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.090
 funny because the dialogues listen 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.680
 which is a very good mission and more than 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.039
 nothing in this mission seems that michael and 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.010
 trevor you have to see a house and 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.959
 acting as a team is not something that is 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.890
 quite strange in fact there are many 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.230
 things here that are 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.300
 as hidden from the game that simply 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.830
 they were never taken in I do not know why what 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.930
 will have taken out this mission if perhaps the 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.940
 have planned for some of that future 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.350
 or any little thing if you are not 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.510
 fun missions that we can 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.670
 find to suit all of you 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.890
 you have because everything that has included you a 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.690
 funny mission or something strange not like 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.700
 we could say of san andreas the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.370
 Imagine jetpack mission 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.989
 rockstar games would have removed it and it 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.940
 I would have found after it can not be 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.130
 something so strange it may be that it's a 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.959
 hint something new such is a possible 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.750
 future of lc and the truth that is 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.989
 quite strange the mission if they want him 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.390
 put a name would be charmont to job and 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.010
 it's like a type of theft I do not know very 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.590
 well what is it about but the truth is that 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.900
 it's pretty strange I think it's a 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.100
 he robbed a house or something quite strange 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.780
 so guys but you liked it

 we started a mission and the truth that 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.440
