00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello youtube I hope you are very 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.930
 well in this video I will show you how it is 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.519
 the process of configuring the new 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.650
 motorcycle x 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.080
 before starting to set up a new 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.449
 moto x I want to thank the company 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.610
 haiti in you because thanks to them is that 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.730
 sticky tech can count on this 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:25.239
 device having said that now yes 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.950
 let's start creating a new motorcycle x this 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.960
 is the page on which we will select 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.509
 all the features we want 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.460
 on our phone once 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.680
 we start the first thing we should choose 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.899
 is the color of the back of the 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.300
 phone as you can see there's a big 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.860
 number of colors and shades 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.810
 available so it does not matter which 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.050
 are your tastes any of these options 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.850
 I'm sure you'll love it I selected this 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.030
 in black color because it has a 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.829
 Very unique finish that I loved afterwards 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.350
 we went to select the color of the 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.450
 front of the phone this only 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.250
 it can be black or white and so 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.520
 will match well with the back that 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.530
 select I chose the color black and for 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.780
 finish with the aesthetic configuration 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.600
 of the motorcycle x you have to select the color 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.340
 of the buttons and edges as they can 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.590
 observe here we also have 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.020
 enough options but the one I chose 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.179
 it was the silver color 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.850
 afterwards we are also given the option of 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.859
 buy some case for the device 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.840
 but I chose not acquire any because 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:28.659
 I want to show off the design that 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.880
 I just created and to end with 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.100
 phone personalization we must 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.090
 choose the capacity of it which 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.380
 it can be 16 or 32 gigabytes later 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.780
 we are also given the option of 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.159
 select a personalized message that 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.289
 will appear when we learn the 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.600
 device just like the background of 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.399
 screen and you can even make it 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.709
 send the phone with all the 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.810
 your google account information 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:55.780
 pre-installed without a doubt this is something unique 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.030
 and that I think is a great idea and for 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.159
 conclude we can also choose between a 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.200
 charger in black color or one in color 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.360
 white and in case we want it 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.149
 we can buy some headphones too 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.190
 in some specific color 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.079
 honestly this program to create the 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.540
 phone to our taste it seems a 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:15.670
 excellent idea and how they could observe 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.459
 using it is extremely simple and 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.950
 intuitive for when you see this 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.260
 video the moto x that I just set 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.890
 will already be on the way and be sure 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.900

 I came to my hands I will bring you my 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.520

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.410
