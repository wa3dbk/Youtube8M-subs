00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
will always believe that if you give

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.580 
will always believe that if you give
people<00:02:57.450> an<00:02:57.780> inch<00:02:58.290> they<00:02:59.160> will<00:02:59.430> take<00:02:59.790> a<00:03:00.090> mile<00:03:00.599> so

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
people an inch they will take a mile so

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.690 
people an inch they will take a mile so
I<00:03:01.950> don't<00:03:02.430> even<00:03:02.849> give<00:03:03.569> them<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.700> millimeter

where<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:58.470> would<00:03:58.709> have<00:03:58.950> leverage

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
where you would have leverage

where you would have leverage
dealing<00:04:00.389> with<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.540> personality

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
the leverage was in really learning the

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.320 
the leverage was in really learning the
techniques<00:04:09.350> to<00:04:11.410> communicate<00:04:12.410> with<00:04:13.400> this

techniques to communicate with this

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.780 
techniques to communicate with this
woman<00:04:15.820> differently<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.120> that's<00:04:17.989> really<00:04:18.799> one

woman differently and that's really one
of<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:20.000> core<00:04:20.440> principles<00:04:21.440> we<00:04:22.040> need<00:04:22.310> to

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
of the core principles we need to

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.610 
of the core principles we need to
understand<00:04:23.150> when<00:04:23.870> we're<00:04:24.080> working<00:04:24.260> with

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
understand when we're working with

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.040 
understand when we're working with
challenging<00:04:25.160> personalities<00:04:25.940> if<00:04:26.240> you<00:04:26.690> think

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
challenging personalities if you think

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.300 
challenging personalities if you think
about<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.740> inordinate<00:04:28.460> amount<00:04:29.060> of<00:04:29.240> time<00:04:29.300> that

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
about the inordinate amount of time that

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.860 
about the inordinate amount of time that
is<00:04:31.310> required<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:33.110> actually<00:04:34.150> change<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.540> way

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
is required to actually change the way

is required to actually change the way
someone<00:04:36.470> sees<00:04:36.830> people<00:04:37.550> in<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:37.970> world<00:04:38.320> none<00:04:39.320> of

us have the time to undertake a task
like<00:04:42.950> that<00:04:43.220> so<00:04:43.820> it<00:04:44.060> becomes<00:04:44.510> much<00:04:45.080> more

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
like that so it becomes much more

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.920 
like that so it becomes much more
