it<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.560> dream<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.520> mankind<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.420> fly<00:00:18.690> like<00:00:19.199> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
it is a dream of mankind to fly like a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.689 
it is a dream of mankind to fly like a
bird<00:00:19.590> birds<00:00:20.400> are<00:00:20.850> very<00:00:21.210> agile<00:00:21.539> they<00:00:22.500> fly<00:00:22.859> not

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
bird birds are very agile they fly not

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.330 
bird birds are very agile they fly not
with<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.180> rotating<00:00:24.689> components<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.830> they<00:00:26.039> fly

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
with the rotating components so they fly

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.210 
with the rotating components so they fly
only<00:00:26.670> by<00:00:27.390> flapping<00:00:27.720> their<00:00:28.080> wings<00:00:28.189> so<00:00:29.189> we

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
only by flapping their wings so we

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.709 
only by flapping their wings so we
looked<00:00:29.730> at<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.539> birds<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.140> we<00:00:31.890> try<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.430> make<00:00:33.390> a

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
looked at the birds and we try to make a

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.150 
looked at the birds and we try to make a
model<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.920> powerful<00:00:36.079> ultralight<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.440> it

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
model that is powerful ultralight and it

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.549 
model that is powerful ultralight and it
must<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.700> excellent<00:00:39.559> aerodynamic

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
must have excellent aerodynamic

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.700 
must have excellent aerodynamic
qualities<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.579> would<00:00:42.239> fly<00:00:42.540> by<00:00:42.930> its<00:00:43.170> own<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
qualities that would fly by its own and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.090 
qualities that would fly by its own and
only<00:00:44.040> by<00:00:44.190> flapping<00:00:44.640> its<00:00:45.030> wings<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:46.590> what<00:00:46.890> would

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
only by flapping its wings so what would

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.569 
only by flapping its wings so what would
be<00:00:47.340> better<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:48.300> use<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:49.200> herring<00:00:49.559> gull<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.250> its

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
be better to use the herring gull in its

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.939 
be better to use the herring gull in its
freedom<00:00:51.059> circling<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.960> swooping<00:00:52.440> over<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
freedom circling and swooping over the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.290 
freedom circling and swooping over the
sea<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.570> use<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.930> as<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.320> role<00:00:55.680> model<00:00:56.270> so<00:00:57.270> we

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
sea and use this as a role model so we

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.450 
sea and use this as a role model so we
bring<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.930> team<00:00:58.109> together<00:00:58.350> there<00:00:59.190> are

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
bring a team together there are

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.360 
bring a team together there are
generalists<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.660> also<00:01:01.260> specialists<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.219> the

field of aerodynamics in the field of
building<00:01:05.700> lighters<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.200> task<00:01:07.439> was<00:01:07.799> to

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
building lighters and the task was to

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.380 
building lighters and the task was to
build<00:01:08.460> an<00:01:08.700> ultralight<00:01:09.630> indoor<00:01:10.560> flying<00:01:10.890> model

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
build an ultralight indoor flying model

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.350 
build an ultralight indoor flying model
that<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.600> able<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.439> fly<00:01:13.710> over<00:01:14.010> your<00:01:14.460> heads<00:01:14.729> so

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
that is able to fly over your heads so

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.840 
that is able to fly over your heads so
be<00:01:15.750> careful<00:01:16.229> later<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:19.220> this<00:01:20.220> was<00:01:20.520> one

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
be careful later on and this was one

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.570 
be careful later on and this was one
issue<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.509> build<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.350> lightweight<00:01:22.680> that

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
issue to build it that lightweight that

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.819 
issue to build it that lightweight that
no<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.540> would<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.990> hurt<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:26.509> fell<00:01:27.509> down<00:01:27.829> so

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
no one would be hurt if it fell down so

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.730 
no one would be hurt if it fell down so
why<00:01:29.490> do<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:29.759> always<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.840> are<00:01:30.960> company<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
why do we always we are company in the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.910 
why do we always we are company in the
field<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.130> automation<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.299> we'd<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.740> do

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
field of automation and we'd like to do

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.740 
field of automation and we'd like to do
very<00:01:35.189> lightweight<00:01:35.549> structures<00:01:36.479> because

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
very lightweight structures because

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.069 
very lightweight structures because
that's<00:01:37.640> energy-efficient<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.790> we'd<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:39.780> to

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
that's energy-efficient and we'd like to

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.789 
that's energy-efficient and we'd like to
learn<00:01:40.259> more<00:01:40.530> about<00:01:41.840> pneumatics<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.079> air<00:01:43.560> flow

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
learn more about pneumatics and air flow

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.469 
learn more about pneumatics and air flow
phenomena<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:47.490> take<00:01:48.299> your

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
phenomena so I not like to take your

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.950 
phenomena so I not like to take your
seat<00:01:48.780> belts<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.860> put<00:01:50.159> your<00:01:50.369> heads<00:01:50.610> off

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
seat belts on and you put your heads off

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.850 
seat belts on and you put your heads off
so<00:01:51.960> maybe<00:01:52.799> we<00:01:53.250> try<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.909> wants<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:55.170> fly<00:01:55.409> smart

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
so maybe we try it wants to fly smart

00:01:55.860 --> 00:03:07.180 
so maybe we try it wants to fly smart
bird<00:01:56.159> thank<00:01:56.670> you

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190

so<00:03:07.700> we<00:03:08.210> can<00:03:08.450> now<00:03:08.630> look<00:03:08.960> at<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:11.090> smartphone<00:03:12.220> so

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
so we can now look at the smartphone so

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.060 
so we can now look at the smartphone so
here<00:03:13.550> is<00:03:13.580> one<00:03:13.970> without<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.810> skin<00:03:15.230> we<00:03:15.860> have<00:03:16.040> a

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
here is one without the skin we have a

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.450 
here is one without the skin we have a
wingspan<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:16.790> about<00:03:17.510> two<00:03:18.110> meters<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:19.190> length

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
wingspan of about two meters the length

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.170 
wingspan of about two meters the length
is<00:03:19.730> 1<00:03:20.270> meter<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.900> 6<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:22.100> weight<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.670> is

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
is 1 meter and 6 and the weight it is

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.670 
is 1 meter and 6 and the weight it is
only<00:03:23.480> 450<00:03:24.470> grams<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:26.780> is<00:03:27.110> all<00:03:27.380> out<00:03:27.650> of

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
only 450 grams and it is all out of

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.790 
only 450 grams and it is all out of
carbon<00:03:28.340> fiber<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.720> middle<00:03:30.050> we<00:03:30.350> have<00:03:30.530> a

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
carbon fiber in the middle we have a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.200 
carbon fiber in the middle we have a
motor<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:31.670> we<00:03:32.450> also<00:03:32.690> have<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:33.800> gear<00:03:34.460> in<00:03:34.730> it<00:03:34.970> and

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
motor and we also have a gear in it and

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.890 
motor and we also have a gear in it and
we<00:03:35.990> use<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.770> gear<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.310> transfer<00:03:37.910> the

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
we use the gear to transfer the

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.860 
we use the gear to transfer the
circulation<00:03:39.710> of<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:40.040> motor<00:03:40.280> so<00:03:41.090> within<00:03:41.510> the

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
circulation of the motor so within the

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.530 
circulation of the motor so within the
motor<00:03:42.110> we<00:03:42.440> have<00:03:42.620> three<00:03:42.980> hall<00:03:43.220> sensors<00:03:43.820> that<00:03:44.300> we

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
motor we have three hall sensors that we

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.290 
motor we have three hall sensors that we
know<00:03:44.720> exactly<00:03:45.170> where<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.220> wing<00:03:46.460> is<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:49.120> if<00:03:50.120> we

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
know exactly where the wing is and if we

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:58.060 
know exactly where the wing is and if we
now<00:03:50.510> get<00:03:51.290> up<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:51.800> down<00:03:55.900> we<00:03:56.900> we<00:03:57.470> have<00:03:57.680> the

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
now get up and down we we have the

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.510 
now get up and down we we have the
possibility<00:03:58.610> to<00:03:58.940> fly<00:03:59.510> like<00:03:59.870> a<00:03:59.900> bird<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:00.920> if<00:04:01.310> you

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
possibility to fly like a bird so if you

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.340 
possibility to fly like a bird so if you
go<00:04:01.700> down<00:04:01.880> you<00:04:02.090> have<00:04:02.300> the<00:04:02.570> large<00:04:02.780> area<00:04:03.260> of

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
go down you have the large area of

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.050 
go down you have the large area of
propulsion<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.310> if<00:04:04.490> you<00:04:04.640> go<00:04:04.850> up<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:07.790> wings

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
propulsion and if you go up the wings

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.470 
propulsion and if you go up the wings
are<00:04:08.450> not<00:04:09.380> that<00:04:09.650> large<00:04:09.920> and<00:04:10.310> it<00:04:10.550> is<00:04:10.730> easier<00:04:11.270> to

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
are not that large and it is easier to

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.430 
are not that large and it is easier to
get<00:04:11.950> up<00:04:14.290> so<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:16.400> next<00:04:16.640> thing<00:04:17.060> we<00:04:17.750> did<00:04:17.930> all<00:04:18.169> the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
get up so the next thing we did all the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.000 
get up so the next thing we did all the
challenges<00:04:18.680> we<00:04:19.489> did<00:04:19.730> was<00:04:20.330> to<00:04:20.810> coordinate<00:04:21.470> this

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
challenges we did was to coordinate this

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.690 
challenges we did was to coordinate this
movement<00:04:22.400> we<00:04:23.330> have<00:04:23.540> to<00:04:23.720> turn<00:04:24.020> it<00:04:24.200> go<00:04:24.860> up<00:04:25.100> and<00:04:25.400> go

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
movement we have to turn it go up and go

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.690 
movement we have to turn it go up and go
down<00:04:25.970> we<00:04:26.480> have<00:04:26.660> a<00:04:26.690> split<00:04:27.200> wing<00:04:27.500> with<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.100> split

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
down we have a split wing with the split

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.080 
down we have a split wing with the split
ring<00:04:28.940> we<00:04:29.510> get<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:30.140> lift<00:04:30.350> at<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:31.520> upper<00:04:31.880> wing

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
ring we get the lift at the upper wing

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.750 
ring we get the lift at the upper wing
and<00:04:32.330> we<00:04:32.840> get<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.230> propulsion<00:04:33.710> at<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.550> lower

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
and we get the propulsion at the lower

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.620 
and we get the propulsion at the lower
wing<00:04:35.090> also<00:04:36.020> we<00:04:36.530> see<00:04:36.800> how<00:04:37.340> we<00:04:37.400> measure<00:04:38.120> the

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
wing also we see how we measure the

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.350 
wing also we see how we measure the
aerodynamic<00:04:39.169> efficiency<00:04:39.950> we<00:04:40.910> had<00:04:41.150> to

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
aerodynamic efficiency we had to

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.210 
aerodynamic efficiency we had to
knowledge<00:04:41.720> about<00:04:42.200> the<00:04:42.530> electro<00:04:43.070> mechanical

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
knowledge about the electro mechanical

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.140 
knowledge about the electro mechanical
efficiency<00:04:44.150> and<00:04:44.780> then<00:04:45.410> we<00:04:45.980> can<00:04:46.190> calculate<00:04:46.430> the

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
efficiency and then we can calculate the

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.500 
efficiency and then we can calculate the
aerodynamic<00:04:48.080> efficiency<00:04:48.250> so<00:04:49.250> therefore<00:04:50.180> it

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
aerodynamic efficiency so therefore it

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.530 
aerodynamic efficiency so therefore it
rises<00:04:51.110> up<00:04:51.140> from<00:04:51.350> passive<00:04:52.340> person<00:04:52.910> to<00:04:53.060> active

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
rises up from passive person to active

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.050 
rises up from passive person to active
portion<00:04:53.900> from<00:04:54.260> thirty<00:04:54.650> percent<00:04:55.220> up<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:55.820> eighty

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
portion from thirty percent up to eighty

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.860 
portion from thirty percent up to eighty
percent<00:04:57.100> next<00:04:58.100> thing<00:04:58.370> we<00:04:58.610> have<00:04:58.640> to<00:04:59.030> do<00:04:59.210> we<00:04:59.660> have

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
percent next thing we have to do we have

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.620 
percent next thing we have to do we have
to<00:05:00.110> control<00:05:00.710> and<00:05:01.160> regulate<00:05:02.090> the<00:05:02.450> whole

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
to control and regulate the whole

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.140 
to control and regulate the whole
structure<00:05:03.140> only<00:05:04.070> if<00:05:04.250> you<00:05:04.430> control<00:05:04.880> and

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
structure only if you control and

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.510 
structure only if you control and
regulate<00:05:05.720> it<00:05:05.900> you<00:05:06.350> will<00:05:06.590> get<00:05:06.800> that

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
regulate it you will get that

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.390 
regulate it you will get that
aerodynamic<00:05:08.060> efficiency<00:05:08.900> so<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:10.190> overall

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
aerodynamic efficiency so the overall

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.140 
aerodynamic efficiency so the overall
consumption<00:05:11.300> of<00:05:11.660> energy<00:05:11.990> is<00:05:12.470> about<00:05:12.800> 25<00:05:13.550> watts

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
consumption of energy is about 25 watts

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.760 
consumption of energy is about 25 watts
at<00:05:14.530> takeoff<00:05:15.530> and<00:05:15.830> 16<00:05:16.700> to<00:05:16.880> 80<00:05:17.090> watts<00:05:17.510> in<00:05:18.350> flight

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
at takeoff and 16 to 80 watts in flight

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:26.570 
at takeoff and 16 to 80 watts in flight
thank<00:05:19.729> you

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.820 

Marcus<00:05:27.569> I<00:05:27.720> think<00:05:28.080> that<00:05:28.110> we<00:05:28.379> should<00:05:28.409> fly<00:05:28.770> it

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
Marcus I think that we should fly it

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.270 
Marcus I think that we should fly it
once<00:05:29.099> more<00:05:29.280> yes<00:05:29.909> sure
