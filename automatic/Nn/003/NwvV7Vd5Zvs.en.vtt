00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 I want to suggest a master on this disk 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.000
 class which is called ownership basis 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.490
 with agate lesson 1 on it we will look at 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.620
 some simplest rhythms and 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.350
 try to impose them on the main 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.220
 dance movement and penetrations to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.090
 put on sagadas 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.019
 holes ordinary gum and tie and and with 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:32.989
 other side after that saga-san 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:36.180
 dress up on the big middle fingers 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.860
 so that they do not fly off rezinochka 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.800
 must be tightened pretty 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.120
 around the position of the hands can also be 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.350
 varied 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:51.730
 down below 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.730
 side way or so upstairs 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.739
 to in front 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.559
 not now let's get to the main 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.550
 rhythm the first rhythm is a triad starting from 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.530
 right hand 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:16.780
 if you're right handed doing three hits so well a 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:19.270
 there bye there now let's take 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.960
 uniform score 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.240
 and we will play the first line right 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:37.079
 4 accented punches 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:37.079
 1 2 3 4 1 hour or now the second line 1 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:58.920
 third line 1 now let's try 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:04.229
 by moving your arms with the usual 31 and 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.229
 first hand movement go up 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.180
 way down 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:27.380
 after all let's try to be like doing 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.989
 four steps forward 1 2 3 4 and 4 steps 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:46.569
 backwards 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:46.569
 234 around you 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:37.480
 and move on to pass simple com 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:37.480
 movements 1 pass to the eight 1 2 3 4 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.939
 taka-taka-taka-taka-taka-ta 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.859
 we will try to impose sagats on the usual 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:24.690
 key one two three four 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:24.690
 Once I play there so there because there 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.199
 cooked 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.060
 another version of the saga then we play there 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.979
 so there well and so as doom so 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.979
 there doom toca toca 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.820
 on the next drives which will be 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.690
 called the basics of ownership with agate 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.870
 lesson 2 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:10.010
 we will consider the development of basic rhythms 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:14.380
 said maxi would lady and more 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.380
 complex movements and bonded with agate
