there's<00:00:36.360> been<00:00:36.510> some<00:00:36.540> confusion<00:00:37.129> because<00:00:38.129> of

there's been some confusion because of

there's been some confusion because of
what<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.690> looks<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.320> little<00:00:40.730> kind<00:00:41.730> of

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
what this looks like that little kind of

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.930 
what this looks like that little kind of
pulsing<00:00:43.010> might<00:00:44.010> make<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.219> think<00:00:44.430> it's<00:00:44.610> built

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
pulsing might make you think it's built

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.069 
pulsing might make you think it's built
into<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.629> display<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.700> could<00:00:47.930> run<00:00:48.930> your

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
into the display but you could run your

finger<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.649> all<00:00:49.829> day<00:00:49.980> long<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.610> not

finger on that all day long and it's not

finger on that all day long and it's not
going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.969> make<00:00:51.059> any<00:00:51.180> difference<00:00:51.329> what<00:00:52.050> you're

what you're running your finger over is
the<00:00:53.940> actual<00:00:54.300> button<00:00:54.510> there<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.250> worth<00:00:56.250> keeping

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the actual button there so worth keeping

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.709 
the actual button there so worth keeping
in<00:00:56.820> mind<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.420> I'll<00:00:58.320> do<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.680> do<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> test<00:00:59.719> for

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
in mind and I'll do it do a test for

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.529 
in mind and I'll do it do a test for
false<00:01:01.170> positives<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> will<00:01:03.149> scan<00:01:03.390> my

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
false positives here and I will scan my

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:11.570 
false positives here and I will scan my
finger<00:01:05.900> scan<00:01:06.900> my<00:01:07.080> finger<00:01:09.409> so<00:01:10.409> Mac's<00:01:11.100> attempts

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
finger scan my finger so Mac's attempts

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.560 
finger scan my finger so Mac's attempts
reached<00:01:11.850> enter<00:01:12.450> alternative<00:01:12.960> password<00:01:14.570> these

things<00:01:15.869> usually<00:01:16.740> there<00:01:16.890> they<00:01:17.340> test<00:01:17.670> out<00:01:17.820> at

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
things usually there they test out at

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.330 
things usually there they test out at
like<00:01:18.270> one<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.170> fifty<00:01:19.530> thousand<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.159> got<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
like one in fifty thousand we got a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.160 
like one in fifty thousand we got a
false<00:01:20.610> positive<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> haven't<00:01:21.960> done<00:01:22.080> that

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
false positive so I haven't done that

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.160 
false positive so I haven't done that
many<00:01:22.470> tests<00:01:22.680> yet<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.720> that's<00:01:24.720> why<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:24.990> kick

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
many tests yet but that's why they kick

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.249 
many tests yet but that's why they kick
you<00:01:25.290> over<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.840> password

protection<00:01:29.189> screen<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:30.150> way<00:01:30.299> you'll<00:01:30.479> have

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
for the fingerprint manager I worked out

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.390 
for the fingerprint manager I worked out
well<00:02:12.500> right<00:02:13.500> here<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.800> could<00:02:13.950> change

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
well right here you could change

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.069 
well right here you could change
is<00:02:14.459> your<00:02:14.640> alternative<00:02:15.060> password<00:02:15.780> that's<00:02:15.930> your

is your alternative password that's your

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.819 
is your alternative password that's your
login<00:02:16.349> password<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.489> could<00:02:17.790> set<00:02:18.299> when<00:02:18.829> how

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
login password you could set when how

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.800 
login password you could set when how

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
you lock the screen I have it obviously

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.960 
you lock the screen I have it obviously
in<00:02:21.870> fingerprint<00:02:22.290> mode<00:02:22.439> you<00:02:23.340> could<00:02:23.579> verify

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
in fingerprint mode you could verify

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.610 
in fingerprint mode you could verify
your<00:02:24.269> Samsung<00:02:24.599> Account<00:02:24.629> if<00:02:25.049> you<00:02:25.170> want<00:02:25.379> you

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
biometric creds for that I'm not going

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.130 
biometric creds for that I'm not going
to<00:02:31.769> do<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:33.450> most<00:02:33.629> interesting<00:02:33.989> thing

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
to do that the most interesting thing

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.270 
to do that the most interesting thing
here<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.319> obviously<00:02:34.409> the<00:02:34.739> fingerprint

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
here is obviously the fingerprint

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.130 
here is obviously the fingerprint
manager<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:37.590> what<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.849> need<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.060> do<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.420> login

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
manager so what you need to do is login

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.300 
manager so what you need to do is login
because<00:02:40.769> it's<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.579> secure<00:02:41.939> device<00:02:43.310> recognized

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
because it's a secure device recognized

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.030 
because it's a secure device recognized
that's<00:02:44.670> awesome<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.170> have<00:02:46.290> one<00:02:46.560> fingerprint

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
that's awesome so I have one fingerprint

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.030 
that's awesome so I have one fingerprint
in<00:02:47.159> there<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.549> only<00:02:47.639> register<00:02:47.819> up<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.239> three

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
in there I can only register up to three

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.000 
in there I can only register up to three
which<00:02:50.040> is<00:02:50.069> interesting<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:51.930> can't<00:02:52.859> name

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
which is interesting and I can't name

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.610 
which is interesting and I can't name
them<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.700> I'll<00:02:53.760> have<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.150> remember<00:02:54.620> go

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
them so I'll have to just remember go

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.300 
them so I'll have to just remember go
here<00:02:56.269> so<00:02:57.269> I<00:02:57.599> did<00:02:58.079> my<00:02:58.230> pointer<00:02:58.769> finger<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.250> will

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
here so I did my pointer finger I will

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.250 
here so I did my pointer finger I will
do<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.930> other<00:03:00.959> one<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:02.000> just<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.510> with<00:03:03.840> any

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
do the other one and just like with any

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.420 
do the other one and just like with any
other<00:03:04.349> one<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.769> these<00:03:04.859> scanners<00:03:05.159> you<00:03:05.280> need<00:03:05.370> to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
other one of these scanners you need to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.429 
other one of these scanners you need to
rub<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.510> know<00:03:06.599> scan<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.079> few<00:03:07.230> times

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
rub it you know scan it a few times

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.349 
rub it you know scan it a few times
which<00:03:08.129> is<00:03:08.280> really<00:03:08.639> simple<00:03:08.879> to<00:03:09.150> put<00:03:09.269> your

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
which is really simple to put your

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.729 
which is really simple to put your
finger<00:03:09.599> over<00:03:09.720> there<00:03:09.989> scan<00:03:10.859> it<00:03:10.980> down<00:03:12.680> one<00:03:13.680> more

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
finger over there scan it down one more

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.270 
finger over there scan it down one more
time<00:03:14.930> or<00:03:15.930> more<00:03:16.260> than<00:03:16.470> one<00:03:16.620> more<00:03:16.769> time<00:03:16.980> just

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
time or more than one more time just

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.000 
time or more than one more time just
keep<00:03:17.430> going<00:03:17.819> until<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.329> dial<00:03:19.139> fills<00:03:19.530> up<00:03:19.739> and

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
keep going until that dial fills up and

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.439 
keep going until that dial fills up and
it<00:03:20.639> doesn't<00:03:20.819> really<00:03:20.940> tell<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.209> too<00:03:21.329> much

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
it doesn't really tell you too much

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:22.939 
it doesn't really tell you too much
about<00:03:21.660> getting<00:03:21.720> alternate<00:03:22.440> sides<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.859> your

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
about getting alternate sides of your

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.580 
about getting alternate sides of your
finger<00:03:23.340> or<00:03:23.699> different<00:03:24.660> angles<00:03:25.079> or<00:03:25.410> anything

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
finger or different angles or anything

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.710

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
finger I just registered recognize it

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.949 
finger I just registered recognize it
and<00:03:52.639> can't<00:03:53.639> get<00:03:53.760> any<00:03:53.909> quicker<00:03:54.150> or<00:03:54.419> easier<00:03:54.599> than

and can't get any quicker or easier than

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.059 
and can't get any quicker or easier than
that<00:03:55.109> so<00:03:55.819> nice<00:03:56.819> work<00:03:57.030> they're<00:03:57.239> easy<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.959> use

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
that so nice work they're easy to use

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.430 
that so nice work they're easy to use
really<00:03:59.069> quick<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.400> set<00:03:59.579> up<00:03:59.609> the<00:04:00.329> three<00:04:00.989> finger

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
really quick to set up the three finger

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.289 
really quick to set up the three finger
max<00:04:01.709> is<00:04:02.010> less<00:04:02.430> than<00:04:02.699> ideal<00:04:03.150> but<00:04:03.829> you<00:04:05.120> know<00:04:06.120> it

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
max is less than ideal but you know it

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.569 
max is less than ideal but you know it
is<00:04:06.449> what<00:04:06.569> it<00:04:06.659> is<00:04:06.810> anyway<00:04:07.739> this<00:04:08.010> is<00:04:08.159> South<00:04:08.370> Korea
