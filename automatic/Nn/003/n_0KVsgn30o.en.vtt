00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
get quite an interesting package I have

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.470 
get quite an interesting package I have
to<00:00:28.680> say<00:00:28.949> one<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.670> biggest<00:00:29.939> thing<00:00:30.300> is

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
to say one of the biggest thing is

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.060 
to say one of the biggest thing is
probably<00:00:30.660> what<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.050> wouldn't<00:00:31.380> expect<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
probably what you wouldn't expect in the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.110 
probably what you wouldn't expect in the
SmartWatch<00:00:32.550> at<00:00:33.030> all<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:35.489> high<00:00:35.730> resolution

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
SmartWatch at all is the high resolution

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.940 
SmartWatch at all is the high resolution
camera<00:00:37.340> 41<00:00:38.780> megapixel<00:00:39.780> camera<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
camera 41 megapixel camera in it and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.360 
camera 41 megapixel camera in it and
there<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:41.940> even<00:00:42.210> flash<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.230> imagine<00:00:43.860> how

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
there is even flash so imagine how

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.600 
there is even flash so imagine how
awkward<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.660> how<00:00:45.870> weird<00:00:46.320> look<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.890> when<00:00:47.520> you

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
awkward and how weird look like when you

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.540 
awkward and how weird look like when you
take<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> picture<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.780> your<00:00:49.289> watch<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:50.340> have

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
flash with it that's quite cool I have

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.930 
flash with it that's quite cool I have
to<00:00:53.520> say<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.600> ice<00:00:54.840> optics<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:56.309> microphone

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
to say it is ice optics this microphone

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.670 
to say it is ice optics this microphone
with<00:00:57.180> noise<00:00:57.449> reduction<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.500> can

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
with noise reduction and you can

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.670 
with noise reduction and you can
obviously<00:00:59.250> take<00:00:59.699> 41<00:01:00.239> megapixel<00:01:01.140> pictures

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
obviously take 41 megapixel pictures

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.899 
obviously take 41 megapixel pictures
with<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.219> shoot<00:01:03.210> videos<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.350> well
