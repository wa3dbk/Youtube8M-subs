00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 Hello we are and with skype 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.740
 making a turn we want to present 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.370
 you are interested in the wheels that we 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.400
 made it 14 diameter discs about 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.630
 car vaz 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.490
 we expanded two disks to 100 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.029
 millimeters and two disks on 70 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.769
 millimeters today drives but they are a little 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:26.250
 later the width of the disk turned out almost 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.039
 nine and a half inches also drives 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.900
 Unsubscribe were built and painted 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.520
 powder paint is all ours 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.610
 the workshop is done from everything at all 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.440
 qualitatively this kind of color is enough 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.329
 interesting yes let the light blue 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.690
 Maybe the camera does not transmit a little 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.780
 all shade of color is still color 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.950
 interesting enough to be beautiful 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.930
 interesting to see how it all 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:55.199
 it looks like steel wheels too 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.920
 qualitatively this diameter wheels also 14 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:03.719
 but for a car volkswagen golf 2 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.549
 razboltovka 4 on 100 were disks 45 they 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.040
 two disks were expanded by 70 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.390
 mm here are the front wheels are not two 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.369
 90 mm disc such also us 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.890
 asked in the comments to show something 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.509
 our welding seams 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.030
 now show after coloring by the way yes 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:27.000
 powder paint also complements 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.759
 seals well ie seams up 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.579
 becomes older tight if 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.979
 somewhere there were some pores I could not 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.560
 bleed air 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.229
 then powder paint follow 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.670
 seals close everything sometimes 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.670
 quite well also found 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.670
 to ply 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.130
 our seams 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.710
 the seam 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.730
 seam type is normal that is quite 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:10.140
 suitable for this type of metal but still 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:13.450
 I will say that for each thickness of metal 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.660
 go on metal using different shui 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.910
 that is somewhere more current somewhere else what 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:26.610
 that is, it's all enough 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:31.660
 individually for each type of metal 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.240
 there is no need for that help 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:48.720
 processed than immediately here vinegar cooked 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:48.720
 he heard quite tight such seams 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.250
 so now also show the junction 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:09.900
 still good enough we don't care 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:13.290
 noticeable obzorchik such thanks to all 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.290
 put likes
