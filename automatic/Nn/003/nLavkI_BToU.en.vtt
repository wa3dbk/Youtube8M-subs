00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:10.410
 Zhora this means with you again a new review 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:13.799
 and today we have lenovo a850 plus a850 we 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.870
 already watched with you now came out a850 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.869
 with the inscription plus thank you store 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.090
 complain and . Kei z for providing 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.460
 gadget year warranty from implementer and 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.460
 delivery throughout Kazakhstan and for good reason 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.769
 by the way i hold it backside to you 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.439
 because it is here that there is a very 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.809
 interesting feature in this phone 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.000
 back cover is made in this 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.910
 I don’t know what to call it 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.399
 In my opinion this is such a plastic 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.800
 plastic rubber probably soft touch and 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.260
 for sure I can't say I in this kind of 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.350
 not really but the feeling is so 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.670
 plastic rubber is very cool but 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.620
 leaves prints which in principle 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.079
 quite easy to wash 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.360
 the display has 5 5 inches of this and ps 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.969
 matrix and the rest will talk a little bit 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.309
 later when we open antutu to start 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.170
 let's look at the front view 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.720
 we see as usual the lenovo logo 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.850
 front camera and all kinds of 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.490
 the sensors below are all also three 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.799
 touch keys this menu back and home 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.009
 there is nothing on the left but above 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.960
 headphone jack and charging microusb 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.520
 I like when the connector 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.770
 microusb is on top 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.500
 much more convenient than if it were below 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.600
 the cord gets in the way and when it's on top with it all 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.460
 cool lock button and button 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.740
 volume controls are on the right 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.280
 in the back we see a 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.320
 lenovo logo flash and speaker all well 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.900
 wheelbarrow dynamics that's all probably by 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.619
 appearance because there is nothing below 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.930
 no 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.689
 let's open antutu I have something for you 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.540
 show that I was surprised in principle 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.009
 because I was told that this is a budget 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.570
 telephone and 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.909
 Well, I counted on the fact that this 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.320
 weak jed ny phone but when 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.719
 I opened antutu and saw 28,000 points I 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.409
 really surprised this is really cool this 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.719
 it is a lot of it it is great even to samantha 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.940
 Some say that it is great it really 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.650
 really great phone eight 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.829
 operates at a frequency of 1 and 6 megahertz 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.930
 mtk mt6582 m processor 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:20.049
 the graphics processor is the same mali 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.560
 450 and the coupe and the resolution of his display 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:27.430
 540 by 960 is the so-called kill 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.739
 hd i don’t really like it 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.079
 points would be better but still not 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.709
 forget about the price is $ 200 well 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:38.500
 230 we have a pixel density of 240 wild 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.650
 oh let's see the cameras this is the front 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.540
 5 megapixel camera and front 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.389
 0.3 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.269
 720p battery resolution for two thousand 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:51.430
 500 milliamps is enough but enough 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.329
 certainly not enough for four days but 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.030
 Still, it's better than 1800 for example 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.549
 I did not notice such special cons 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.670
 to be apart from the fact that here it was not originally 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.290
 youtube application was installed but I 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.480
 I can not say that it is in all 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.250
 phones anyway but this 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.769
 The problem was that he and not 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.780
 installed then simply issued 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.660
 some kind of mistake there 24 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.180
 but I found a solution to this problem 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.760
 easy enough i downloaded the app under 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.609
 root explorer name and using it 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.680
 just went to the data folder and deleted 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.840
 youtube stock tail 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.449
 and everything flow reinstalled and how 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.319
 see all right the application got up and 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:37.599
 the app works well here probably 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.389
 all that I noticed on the cons in general 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.479
 the phone is really awesome 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:44.500
 inexpensive really budget and 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:47.650
 28,000 points in antutu 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.959
 I was really surprised by what you think 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.090
 about this, write in the comments 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.120
 be any questions you ask 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.310
 and as always the owners of this phone 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.979
 maybe you noticed some cons 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.680
 which I did not notice you write in 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:04.239
 comments or me in PM and people 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.209
 should know all the same truth 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.049
 5 5 inches size in hand lies 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:13.329
 yourself quite comfortable though all the same 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.430
 slow fan of 5 inch phones 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.949
 draw conclusions and decide whether or not to take 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.959
 I always take as the only assistant you 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.330
