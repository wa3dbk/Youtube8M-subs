today<00:00:00.630> I'm<00:00:00.989> going<00:00:01.290> to<00:00:01.380> join<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:01.800> team<00:00:02.100> whose

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
today I'm going to join the team whose

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.700 
today I'm going to join the team whose
job<00:00:02.760> it<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.030> clean<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.720> outside<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:04.350> the

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
job it is to clean the outside of the

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:22.130 
job it is to clean the outside of the
world's<00:00:05.190> highest<00:00:05.549> windows

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:32.940 

it<00:00:23.039> was<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:23.369> three<00:00:24.859> come<00:00:25.859> up<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.250> one

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.420 

okay<00:00:33.220> then<00:00:33.460> look<00:00:33.610> at<00:00:33.820> the<00:00:33.880> rock

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
okay then look at the rock

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.300 
okay then look at the rock
yep

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
yep

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.660 
yep
okay<00:00:38.090> stay<00:00:38.660> back<00:00:38.840> swing<00:00:39.500> back<00:00:39.680> okay<00:00:40.340> you<00:00:40.400> look

okay stay back swing back okay you look
don't<00:00:41.030> do<00:00:41.270> know<00:00:41.390> where<00:00:45.100> put<00:00:46.100> in<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:46.310> bucket

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.490 
don't do know where put in the bucket

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.630 
don't do know where put in the bucket
yeah

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.520 

you<00:00:54.640> get<00:00:54.760> nervous<00:00:54.940> at<00:00:55.239> all<00:00:55.420> yeah<00:00:55.900> get<00:00:56.290> a<00:00:56.320> little

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
you get nervous at all yeah get a little

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.380 
you get nervous at all yeah get a little
bit<00:00:56.650> scared<00:00:56.890> I<00:00:57.660> haven't<00:00:58.660> looked<00:00:58.750> down<00:00:59.020> yet<00:01:00.390> now

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
bit scared I haven't looked down yet now

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.620 
bit scared I haven't looked down yet now
I'd<00:01:01.540> look<00:01:01.750> down<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:05.619> almost<00:01:05.860> inconceivable

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
I'd look down it's almost inconceivable

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.770 
I'd look down it's almost inconceivable
how<00:01:07.630> high<00:01:07.900> these<00:01:07.960> windows<00:01:08.619> are<00:01:08.880> I'm<00:01:09.880> 60<00:01:10.450> meters

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
how high these windows are I'm 60 meters

at<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.659> height<00:01:28.720> if<00:01:29.350> I<00:01:29.560> dropped<00:01:29.920> anything<00:01:30.250> it

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
at this height if I dropped anything it

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:41.950 
at this height if I dropped anything it
could<00:01:31.060> do<00:01:31.270> serious<00:01:31.689> damage

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.780 

building<00:01:42.960> hide<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> load<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.040> factors

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
building hide is a load of factors

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.280 
building hide is a load of factors
you've<00:01:44.909> got<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.119> take<00:01:45.299> into<00:01:45.600> consideration

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
you've got to take into consideration

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.649 
you've got to take into consideration
one<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.590> them<00:01:46.710> obviously<00:01:46.830> is<00:01:47.759> gravity<00:01:48.479> which

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
one of them obviously is gravity which

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.149 
one of them obviously is gravity which
I'm<00:01:48.810> feeling<00:01:49.229> right<00:01:49.380> now<00:01:49.590> think<00:01:49.979> about

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
I'm feeling right now think about

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.830 
I'm feeling right now think about
gravity<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.850> very<00:01:51.060> predictable<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:51.750> a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
gravity is it very predictable it's a

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.080 
gravity is it very predictable it's a
force<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.290> going<00:01:52.560> one<00:01:53.250> way<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.790> you've

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
force is going one way that you've

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.030 
force is going one way that you've
really<00:01:54.450> got<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.630> worry<00:01:54.869> about<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.350> wind

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
really got to worry about is wind

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.950 
really got to worry about is wind
because<00:01:56.460> its<00:01:56.759> very<00:01:56.940> nature<00:01:57.180> it's<00:01:57.540> it's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
because its very nature it's it's

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.810
