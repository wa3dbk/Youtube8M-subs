00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
rear brake here actually front brake is

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.200 
rear brake here actually front brake is
on<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> opposite<00:00:37.710> side<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.670> got<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> code

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
on the opposite side it's got the code

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.830

for piston caliper and 200 mil rotors

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.510 
for piston caliper and 200 mil rotors
that's<00:00:43.230> kind<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.530> standard<00:00:43.770> most<00:00:44.250> guys

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
that's kind of standard most guys

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.060 
that's kind of standard most guys
they're<00:00:44.820> using<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> 200s<00:00:46.200> especially<00:00:46.710> here

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
they're using the 200s especially here

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.940 
they're using the 200s especially here
with<00:00:47.820> them<00:00:48.090> with<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.809> course<00:00:49.079> being<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.620> heavy

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
with them with the course being so heavy

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.569 
with them with the course being so heavy
on<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.160> brakes

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
on the brakes

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.779 
on the brakes
moving<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> seat<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.530> Eastern<00:00:52.920> EC<00:00:53.340> 90

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
moving to the seat here at Eastern EC 90

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.610 
moving to the seat here at Eastern EC 90
so<00:00:54.300> that's<00:00:54.420> actually<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.960> believe<00:00:55.379> that's

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
so that's actually I believe that's

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.920 
so that's actually I believe that's
their<00:00:55.800> cross<00:00:56.010> country<00:00:56.250> sort<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.879> rely<00:00:57.660> tiss

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
their cross country sort of rely tiss

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.560 
their cross country sort of rely tiss
weight<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.890> carbon<00:00:59.340> seatpost<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.180> they've

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
weight just carbon seatpost and they've

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.369 
weight just carbon seatpost and they've
matched<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.140> with<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.739> custom<00:01:02.430> SDG<00:01:03.090> seat<00:01:03.420> ok

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
matched that with a custom SDG seat ok

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.010 
matched that with a custom SDG seat ok
moving<00:01:04.769> down<00:01:05.010> obviously<00:01:06.000> you've<00:01:06.119> got<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
moving down obviously you've got the the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.950 
moving down obviously you've got the the
boxer<00:01:07.530> world<00:01:08.130> cup<00:01:08.369> 4<00:01:08.640> cup<00:01:08.670> front<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.750> their

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the nitrate black stanchions can choose

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.609 
the nitrate black stanchions can choose
to<00:01:13.650> run<00:01:13.770> err<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.100> spring<00:01:15.170> like<00:01:16.170> he's<00:01:16.350> running

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
to run err or spring like he's running

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.920 
to run err or spring like he's running
an<00:01:16.710> air<00:01:16.979> cartridge<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.640> there<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> fork<00:01:18.750> is

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
an air cartridge in there so the fork is

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.580 
an air cartridge in there so the fork is

to run the air rear shock one thing that

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.740 
to run the air rear shock one thing that
I<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.130> like<00:01:29.490> about<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.909> bike<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.360> all<00:01:30.600> the

I do like about this bike is all the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.960 
I do like about this bike is all the
weight<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> bottom<00:01:32.549> obviously

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
weight is is in the bottom obviously

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.090 
weight is is in the bottom obviously
it's<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.509> turn<00:01:33.720> really<00:01:34.170> well<00:01:34.320> low

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
it's going to turn really well low

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.160 
it's going to turn really well low

center of gravity which is super

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.810 
center of gravity which is super
important<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.650> Daniel<00:01:37.979> because<00:01:38.159> mostly

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
important in Daniel because mostly

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.219 
important in Daniel because mostly
there's<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> lot<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.299> time<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:39.810> made<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.140> the

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
see on motorcycles and this is probably

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.120 
see on motorcycles and this is probably

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
area I'm packing up in there so that's

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.560 
area I'm packing up in there so that's
just<00:03:11.400> quite<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.640> nice<00:03:11.820> touch<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.090> keep<00:03:12.420> that

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
just quite a nice touch to keep that

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.289 
just quite a nice touch to keep that
area<00:03:12.840> clean<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.470> stop<00:03:14.250> any<00:03:14.400> debris<00:03:14.730> going<00:03:15.180> in

area clean and stop any debris going in

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.610 
area clean and stop any debris going in
there<00:03:15.390> especially<00:03:15.720> when<00:03:16.019> they're<00:03:16.170> racing<00:03:16.530> in

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
there especially when they're racing in

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.160 
there especially when they're racing in
the<00:03:16.709> mud

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
the mud

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.430 
the mud
moving<00:03:19.170> up<00:03:19.549> like<00:03:20.549> runs<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.970> 63<00:03:21.870> degree<00:03:22.200> head

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
moving up like runs a 63 degree head

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.009 
moving up like runs a 63 degree head
angle<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.609> believe<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:24.180> he<00:03:24.269> can<00:03:24.480> go<00:03:24.720> a

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
angle and I believe that he can go a

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.420 
angle and I believe that he can go a
slack<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:25.920> 61<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.959> up<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.230> 64<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:29.010> half<00:03:29.220> so

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
slack of 61 and up to 64 and a half so

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.160 
slack of 61 and up to 64 and a half so
they've<00:03:29.579> got<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:30.120> little<00:03:30.840> bit<00:03:31.079> of

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
they've got a little bit of

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.110 
they've got a little bit of
adjustability<00:03:31.590> by<00:03:32.070> using<00:03:32.400> different<00:03:32.910> cups

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
adjustability by using different cups

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.509 
adjustability by using different cups
