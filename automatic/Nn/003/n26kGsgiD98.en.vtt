00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 so here you have the case the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.440
 more common ie you have 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.040
 within a radius of 2 meters around 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.080
 your pool a son attached point 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.470
 here you have a landing so we're going 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.180
 attach the pole to the palm trees 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.789
 there could also be a wall a 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.470
 barrier but in this case I do not 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.810
 see that the palm tree so you go 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.449
 able to attach your glass ch to this 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.460
 landing so there you see it in this 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.210
 type of pool there is a multitude of 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.949
 points the task 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.770
 so you can tie your 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.899
 search for example at the amount of the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.329
 glass structure that covers the pool 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.579
 you need a fixed point is here 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.820
 During the course, we note that there is 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.760
 has a large number that links to here neither tree 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.230
 neither culture nor wall indeed the walls that 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.149
 you can see left and 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.190
 right are more than two meters from the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.590
 pool coping there is no 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.559
 solution to tear off our fishing is 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.480
 the pyramid base we will install it to 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.510
 about one meter from the edge of the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.489
 pool is fixed the perch to the ground 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.280
 carlo is roughly at ground level 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.799
 int you notice it is a swimming pool 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.590
 Aboveground 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.869
 a priori if one measured the lip of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.250
 the pool is about 90 cm 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.830
 above ground level 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.820
 so we can not in this case use 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.210
 the pyramid and surrounding Geneva pedestal 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.119
 neither tree nor claude sturni barrier to 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.869
 you can use the task and string 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.509
 that is here 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.420
 so you will be able to attach your 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.840
 perch at the pool scale thanks to 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.329
 this system here here you see that it's 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.979
 a superb swimming pool which neither 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.649
 does not exempt the external task 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.899
 fixed eventually on the barrier that 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.000
 is on your right but it seems 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.920
 to be more than two meters from the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.320
 pool coping so we go 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.020
 use in this case the pyramid base 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.510
 unless you see in the background 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.950
 the two stone balls 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.750
 if they are strong enough he 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.090
 is possible to attach 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.220
 a link around the ball buildings and 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.690
 the perch 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.710
 in this case I leave you 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.600
 guess where we are going to fix the boom 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.430
 you see it on your right you have 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.960
 actually a barrier that seems to 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.490
 less than two meters from there marc gene 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.260
 the pool and so it's at this 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.330
 barrier we're going to fix the boom 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.340
 we are going to fix the pole flush with the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.530
 floor so that the tip of the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.660
 perch comes slightly above 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.880
 the water so to carry the swimmer and 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.750
 make swimming in a crawl easier 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:41.160
 nice here you have a pool off 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:44.130
 soil whose height at the level of 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.960
 margin it seems to be less than 90 cm 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.850
 in a case like this you have 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.810
 two solutions be the scale task 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.140
 the use of the pyramid base 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.600
 one of the two solutions may be suitable 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.730
 here there is a trap or do you think he 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.650
 fault attached the perch and well 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.480
 certainly not the rope because 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.580
 actually the rope will give a game 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.220
 but the boom that will make the coward 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.220
 very uncomfortable with a yoyo effect 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.930
 like with an elastic so especially do not 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.420
 do not tie the pole to the rope 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.489
 you absolutely need a fixed point the most 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.480
 rigid possible that does not give 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.730
 pole movement 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.890
 so we will choose here be a 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.470
 wooden amount as indicated 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.830
 the example here is the scale of the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.830
 swimming pool
