00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.970
 paschal the city councils the 1st so much in which we are 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.619
 for the architect that we have been working together from the 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.409
 deep reform term 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:20.460
 a study in common 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.669
 and we are working on that 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.140
 In sevilla 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.149
 this was certified by the 12 31 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.280
 and the little-known body is also a new cycle 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.250
 working hard 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.510
 in the city of Seville and Andalusia but we have acted throughout Padang 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.450
 in the rest of Spain who also in European countries 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.230
 the position of the establishment 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.810
 I have been a workshop 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.850
 in oberÃ¡ is not part of the contest we won the year 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.890
 uu 2001 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.570
 to do the remodeling of the main building of the racc taught us 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.790
 that was something that arose in parallel the actress that that charge 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.400
 He tells me that he occupied a very large Reynosa blanket that is occupied by a building 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.810
 that size other than the pool that was difficult but it's right next to it 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.780
 like big villas and big residential buildings but really 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.920
 our intervention 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.259
 the owner to occupy the center of the block a building that is not perceived 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.330
 of course you can not almost almost perceived once you get in to receive it the bodies 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.450
 that are leaving the other party is important because 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.470
 when it reads 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.270
 we are used to nobody 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.250
 they say out there 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.760
 in front of these areas one can always recognize 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.870
 according to three partial views but always perimeter 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.070
 so recognizable 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.020
 and site assistant 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.840
 can be done after that was very insistent protest 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.170
 of security this artisanal work where the munificent from the point of 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.020
 view 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.250
 climatic and p the lucimiento before these matters of state 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.340
 often received by members of a very positive response from the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.750
 users a bit olympic 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.640
 We decided to keep part of the building in the second extension of the control of 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.799
 building on its part we could accept to do 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.909
 or we would also have that part on the front of the 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.409
 building the same its first and highly loans to name the villa 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:27.159
 because of its appearance it was worth keeping it in percent more 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.859
 part of the environment of the area 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:35.119
 my age no more parties while others who substituted these rahman voices 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:37.160
 There is the apple theme 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.909
 and from there to make a building that would fracture without two more pieces 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.120
 for in the volume similar to all the other buildings this is in its 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.149
 environment 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:53.799
 p enter the same brick the same player by side Berlin buildings 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:54.749
 resistant 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:56.899
 Peter, we think that 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:01.199
 it is to see the new and the old is truly a narrative mechanism 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.159
 something more complex more compact 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.109
 the user person who simply in that decision 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:17.109
 I think you can walk around the cilic president who constantly 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:22.359
 building efe narrating the story is still telling its scars
