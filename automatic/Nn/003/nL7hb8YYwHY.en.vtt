00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.550
 hello mi5 hottie like all on a 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.850
 video chipset i want to know how 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.200
 to be warm without elastic 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.809
 when I think you are like me 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.420
 you did have to stay everything at the end 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.230
 in the application mail contact drak as 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.340
 and Morocco has so today I'm going 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.220
 to show you how to do it with us 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.300
 are elastic I think of clamp at 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:36.890
 start a little problem it's really 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:42.690
 very simple us to the machine like that 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:48.780
 we do tasks and I do not see 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:52.530
 elastic crisis have so first fire 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.989
 sounds a condition it takes in 2011 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.170
 to be able to do that our mass in 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.320
 outside will be so I have not bad so 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.049
 step by step step 1 we all have our 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.109
 matches in pay we'll tell you 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:19.770
 counting in two parts a part 

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:20.810
 rise from there we're just going in 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:28.189
 below the upper part 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.189
 we will try quite long snow 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.790
 Paul's going to season because I 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.310
 Germans agreed according to the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.180
 hair under the blows one understands a 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:52.340
 wick if I haggard gives a little the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.340
 during French then out I like 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.920
 here 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.920
 we are going and would like because it is 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.480
 you canvas f1 to take back the beautiful 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.670
 in the mouth and that spear think 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.670
 wrong one of the choices ok 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.450
 normally super turtle either because 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:53.970
 otherwise it finally works little shame between 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:56.430
 So here we come out at the end we get 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.080
 find with a wick there you jump on 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.970
 while assuring it this is going to be very 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.860
 useful 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.630
 So now I want to say three 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.480
 quarters of his reminds that this snow 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.370
 which has served as a slack so it takes 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.900
 take it and in fact we're going on TV in 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.600
 the opposite direction of the gym so for me 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:21.870
 do it like that so the phase has to 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:27.989
 of his choice in fact at each jump on 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:29.370
 draws on two wicks you 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.040
 feel bad for my child 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.040
 teasing will do 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.160
 so here we go 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.799
 so here I hope this video you 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:13.810
 will have pleased to relive the chain and 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.329
 next according to another video 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.880
 So here it is not because here 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.479
 commented game if you have to leave 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.590
 commented too and here already loved the 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.590
