00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello I introduce you to him the dandy 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.540
 Robin I do not know if you know 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.360
 so good I have this remark but 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.880
 there are other brands in fact that's it 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.509
 comes from amazonia okay it's on a 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.279
 fruit is actually the Amazonian Indians 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.070
 has been feeling for a long time 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.390
 I love these guys the guys 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.949
 amazonian because you shamans 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.480
 and from where they argue with the trees and 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.970
 all these excellent and they come to 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.560
 to have the information we have 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.179
 obliged to put 50 years of research 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.450
 scientist to be able to confirm so 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.550
 it's pretty interesting 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.630
 these tiles especially but good if 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.980
 you never want to buy 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.850
 do what you want there is 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.930
 maybe other brands but what 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.590
 I 'll tell you is that this one 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.210
 it's 100% of its tiles and first 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.590
 cold pressure it's important when 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.539
 you buy an oil if you really want 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.190
 have the virtues first pressure to 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.410
 cold not just cold pressure 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.350
 this is poor for not that it spoils 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.760
 the tuning components so in fact 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.230
 it's very good for the tax and it's 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.420
 also an insect repellent 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.309
 so I'm reading you because I found 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.820
 on a website that calls for 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.950
 amazon originally used by 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.290
 indigenous populations of amazonia for 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.970
 to treat infections of the skin 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.310
 joint inflammations as well as 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.720
 to repel insects extensively studied 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.560
 by scientists these tiles has 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.939
 revealed the presence of immo our ideas 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.530
 compound responsible for the bitterness of 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.299
 oil but especially its many 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.720
 anti-inflammatory properties and 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.740
 powerful analgesic if I do not tell you 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.100
 nonsense the beds mono id 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.829
 I think useful in the four cancers to 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.479
 check but I believe I continue the 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.580
 descriptive it fits perfectly 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.490
 to people suffering from rheumatism 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.130
 and joint pain the oil in 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.659
 shooting dandy robin is also famous 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.840
 for its beneficial action on 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.580
 skin lesions and psoriasis 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.170
 finally many studies reveal a 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.590
 very strong repulsive capacity of 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.840
 insects and parasites and the smell not 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.220
 many hours months for 2 hours 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.539
 while citronella for example that in 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.009
 I come if you want to fight against 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.630

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.900

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.319
 it's after I'll tell you the 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.080

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.200
 antibacterial for the skin are getting ready 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.390
 for after insect bites 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.620
 ok so it also serves as repellents but 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.049

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.690
 then it's natural then for the skin 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.610
 still according to the Amazon site but 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.100
 it's true that these are news 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.620
