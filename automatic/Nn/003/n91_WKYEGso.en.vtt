00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello today i will talk about bucks in 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.049
 the game battlefield 4 beta which concerns 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.599
 helicopters and allow you to use 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.120
 traps with almost no cooldown 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.429
 before this a little bit of theory in the usual 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.890
 game situation when on us are 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.070
 stinger and rocket we 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.020
 accordingly use traps with 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.529
 we release countermeasures and after that we 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.090
 have 25 seconds then recharge them 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.550
 accordingly at this time we need either 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.769
 hide behind cover either fly off on 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.750
 sufficient distance from 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.410
 stinger operator to avoid 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.120
 re- block but not always these 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.050
 The methods are applicable depending on 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.450
 the position of your helicopter its height and 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.640
 elementary from what is around you 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.370
 that is, it may not be easy 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.550
 just hiding what to do in the data 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.340
 cases comes to the aid of us bang 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.980
 which allows almost instant 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.449
 reload traps let me first 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.219
 I will show how he acts 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.219
 and then I will explain everything in detail 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.830
 as you can see in 2 seconds I released 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.990
 traps 2 times and in principle the algorithm 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.530
 action, I think is more or less clear 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.960
 that is, immediately after we 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.170
 release traps switch to the place 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.659
 arrow that is, press f2 and after 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.890
 this switch back to the place 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:33.259
 the pilot that is, press f1 and the indicator 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.670
 trap states here 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.090
 showing trades ie traps again 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.479
 The meaning of the bug is ready in that trap 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.670
 are dumped if we leave the helicopter 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.100
 more precisely or leave the helicopter or 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.649
 switching to another place and so 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.429
 further, respectively, this bug works and 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.440
 on the transport helicopter ok now 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:02:00.210
 let's try 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:03.380
 make a series that is how many times you can 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.150
 release the traps for the maximum 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.860
 a short period of time and see 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.869
 if we have some 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:16.870
 restrictions and accordingly we will 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:19.140
 read 1 2 4 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.100
 five 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.130
 67 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.130
 8 and here 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.629
 ten times to be honest I have 10 times 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.150
 the first time it turns out maybe because 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.010
 the fact that I very quickly clicked on 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.980
 the f2 key that is after 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.640
 pressed the alt key on the alto 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.129
 there is not enough trap before that maximum 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.280
 one could squeeze it six seven times but 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.590
 keep in mind that in real combat 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.909
 gaming situations naturally combat 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.969
 situations so fast traps you 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.290
 releases never need that is 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:01.599
 stinger so fast doesn't work i mean 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.379
 he doesn't want a rocket so quickly 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.750
 does not fly fast even if several 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.419
 counter stinger work anyway 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.879
 so fast the traps let out from 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.260
 you will never need and 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.480
 accordingly, the real combat situation 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.450
 looks like this is released 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.840
 trapped there for two three seconds 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.150
 released again flew off behind cover 45 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.549
 seconds we release again that is real 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.430
 can be used practically 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:33.319
 infinite without to u duty say well 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.840
 you and what to do in situations when 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.680
 place the arrow is occupied and accordingly on 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.540
 it is impossible to switch, there is another 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.670
 a way that requires a certain 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.010
 skill but after a few minutes 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.989
 workouts you will get exactly 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.049
 just like me let me 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:54.129
 demonstrate first and then all of this 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.129
 commented on the case 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.430
 without as you can see again two seconds and 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.710
 twice releasing traps and again 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.920
 the sequence of actions is more or less clear 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.050
 There is releasing but in the ears we press the key 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.690
 e that is leaving on a helicopter 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.269
 turn around and once in our field 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.120
 of view get a helicopter carcass push 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.050
 once again and accordingly traps 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.270
 recharged and let's try now 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.290
 make a small series again on 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.290
 speed of action 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:44.980
 I think in principle enough yes if 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.850
 do continuously large enough 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:51.550
 the number of times again where is he still 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.050
 appear but consider what i said 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.660
 earlier that is in real combat 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.980
 situations so fast traps you 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.810
 do not have to release 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:04.390
 and so I think all the same, this bug will be corrected with 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.000
 release of the game but still in beta for now 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.760
 he is and if you are a fan of flying on 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.610
 helicopters and you can fly like this 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.220
 say impunity to the gods while you can 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.170
 enjoy this all i wanted to say 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.170
 Thank you for your attention goodbye
