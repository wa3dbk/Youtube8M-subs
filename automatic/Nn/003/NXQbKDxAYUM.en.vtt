00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello friends and welcome to 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.420
 another minecraft building tip 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.090
 Today we become a medieval one 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.190
 build gallows in smaller ones 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.540
 when he considered himself a big city 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.000
 or something but actually rather for 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.770
 smaller villages but definitely have 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.449
 i thought okay can actually hurt 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.760
 to have such a great time around which 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.769
 to execute people according to theirs 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.170
 which one, for example, what a shit 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.849
 did and yes i would say then 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.849
 we'll see it right after the intro 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.949
 So here we are again 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.449
 back on the map I want to but im 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.429
 in advance say that today 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.989
 maybe the audio and not quite like that 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:45.250
 is good or 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.570
 I just can not do it myself 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.979
 really listen because my headset unfortunately 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.010
 broken and I currently 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:53.260
 Everything here about my my headphones 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.729
 That's why it's on 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.809
 bit critical at the moment though 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.000
 maybe she will notice that, too 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.890
 did not make a difference and everything fits 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.739
 So let's start now with first 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.619
 our cobblestone by going down here 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.330
 each three this little ring here 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.940
 three times down each make a suitcase 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.670
 stone in and then we start here 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.220
 to do the whole first five then 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.100
 at the sixth block practically once 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.159
 cross over and also back up so 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.929
 that whole here in the end 5 then 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.100
 one with the crossbeam and up here 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.950
 So one more thing is on the whole 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.530
 seven high and on the side in the 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.899
 end effect also 7 ready 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.190
 what would be next, do it 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.740
 relatively easy we take ours here 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.209
 Bodens labs and fill this here for the first time 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.350
 Of course you can count on full 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:41.379
 make blocks I just got it 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.500
 for space reasons made with rapeseed and 

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:46.569
 what we do now is the following 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.429
 fulfill as here on the outside pack 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.349
 here two stairs each 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.550
 stairs up everywhere 

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:56.050
 on the one hand, I still do that 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.330
 Just like that and we will have it like that 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.250
 then we take our wood again 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.129
 grab the corners in front here 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.110
 which way and thus a shift to 

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:07.000
 in front practically here and here too 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.660
 Make a block behind each one 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.090
 we on the one hand, of course 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.819
 just that is once here once 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.910
 here and there and who could have had that 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.030
 we put labs on top of each one 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.310
 and then here on the sides too 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.980
 with fans is complete 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.300
 here comes a middle of the first 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.069
 stairs in which you do not look down there 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.290
 can be here on the side two each 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.550
 normal and this we fill in the back 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.900
 now just take it out now 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.060
 Just have that labs for it 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.470
 works faster and we can do that here 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.819
 It does not have to do the same over there 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.280
 again and so on both stairs 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.650
 property buyers and up here then 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.870
 according to still this labs but that 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.630
 I have fans in it 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.500
 the middle of a fan skate and that is exactly what 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.660
 same front 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.700
 then come the main part here 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.680
 just a trap door one with one 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.110
 We can say that we are wonderful too 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.519
 do and what they can do now 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.549
 for example, it's down here now 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.340
 first so coincidentally so a few 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.910
 other blocks may be easy stairs 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.530
 use 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.260
 this is not quite right here 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.690
 maybe we'll do it all this way and that 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.400
 then over here one more thing that it is the 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.190
 one possibility the other possibility 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.630
 would be easy to take other wood or 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.549
 maybe even combine both 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.220
 after what you like the most 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.099
 and that just a bit 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.970
 to make more random 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.620
 maybe even just here 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.150
 slabke or something that's here 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:36.000
 a little more responsive and random 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.470
 said basit and if we have to 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.239
 Let's go for a bit 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.560
 fine details means here and came 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:46.080
 each heads made of wood and then 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.840
 come down below respectively 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.330
 After all, down here was the knit 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.630
 also from two fences and up here 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.540
 each still labs on top of it that is 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.060
 here outside each one button and 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.890
 they are us, too 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.720
 by the only thing we do 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.250
 if we have to get a leash 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.050
 you have I do not know I can 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.110
 I believe forces or so either 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.090
 you have to do it either for yourself 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.150
 somehow or just in the creative 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.920
 pool and jan alone and looking for us here 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.720
 an animal of our choice i take you 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.600
 Just a cow and best 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.800
 even a sword to it and that 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.470
 Let's grab her the cow 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.360
 suffer and grab this up here 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.980
 hin that you are in this ball here 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.590
 and I personally think so 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.900
 pretty cool because now we can 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.200
 simply the kÃ¶then we get ours 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.850
 meat and this leash is left 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.170
 practically still and the whole thing 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.420
 actually looks as well as a knot 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.530
 that means I think that brings 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.230
 just a little bit more detail 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.550
 which is actually pretty cool and jan 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.440
 we are already with this video 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.030
 finished as I said relatively short, I hope 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.370
 it comes today also accordingly 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.130
 online because it is already relatively late 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.110
 I just finally made glad 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.910
 yes what a quantum I would of course 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.440
 As always, a positive evaluation 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.910
 looking forward 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.070
 and yes , this is what we are looking at 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.000
 next car until then and one 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.000
 bye
