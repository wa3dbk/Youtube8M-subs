00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:06.640
 hello everyone welcome a tutorial 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:10.299
 today I come to show you how 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.999
 install minecraft 1.6 points in windows 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.309
 xp we will do the first thing we have to do 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:18.150
 it is to download the file that goes to 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.610
 be in the description of the video 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.260
 and you can unpack it as always 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.529
 as the file comes with 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.090
 password the password is also going to 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.250
 be in the description of the video worth 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.840
 in this case, I already have the file 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.310
 it is compressed 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.090
 we are going to enter that folder 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.240
 Very well, here are three more folders 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.590
 records 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:49.960
 let's enter is that is the launcher 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:53.680
 in the minecraft file we are going to copy and 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:58.410
 we are going to paste it on the desk and 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.410
 let's double click to execute it 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.210
 when they load us in the window that we 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.980
 out let's write the name of 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.870
 user that we want and then we're going 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.530
 to click on login 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:17.420
 then at the top we're going to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.490
 see click on profile age 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.130
 let's select the profile that 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.960
 we just created we are going to click 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.570
 right copy profile in 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.030
 and as a man in profile we're going to 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.760
 place the number of the version of 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.800
 minecraft which in this case is 1.6 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.130
 Point 2 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.910
 and we're going to enable the option that is 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.560
 call directory and in space in 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.290
 white at the end we are going to give a click 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.720
 we are going to leave a space and we are going to 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.230
 place the number of the version of 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.160
 minecraft also 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:02:00.540
 below where you use version or use a 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:04.200
 perversion we are going to place the religion 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.220
 1.6 point 2 and we will give in safe 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.890
 profile 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.660
 if you wonder why this step is 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.510
 because when here in the bottom 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.370
 one makes him play before then he 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.510
 they downloaded the internet files 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.489
 because of the micro 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.280
 but with the new update of 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:27.019
 minecraft 1.7 point 4 because it has generated a 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.959
 error and you can not download the 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.500
 files as you see then here it's over and 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.210
 says clown loud 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.750
 that is, you can not download the 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.280
 files and here I get that error with 26 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.780
 files worth what we 're going to do is 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.730
 close the microsoft and 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.410
 and enter again to the folder that 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.260
 unzip on the desk 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.160
 there we will now enter the folder 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.550
 which says original files 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.970
 and those files that are here are going to 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.670
 copy and we will paste them into the folder 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.120
 where the minecraft was installed that the 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.540
 route is home 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.510
 my pc local disk ce 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.909
 documents and settings 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.110
 and the name of your user in this case 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:22.370
 I only have one 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.050
 here is worth and here as you can see there is a folder 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.990
 what is minecraft 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:31.730
 we entered and it is the installation folder 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:34.190
 there we should paste the files worth in 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.280
 the case then suddenly tell them that 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.370
 yes they want to join folders or replace 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.860
 some file is worth as in this case 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.880
 let's give if anything goes 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.250
 here happens what they want to the folder 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.650
 user and can create an access 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.170
 direct on the desk as in arriving 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.840
 I have it here for later then do more 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.870
 Easy from the minecraft folder itself 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.060
 they need to put some map software 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.000
 of something extra worth 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.420
 then we will run again the 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.520
 Minecraft 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.840
 in the window that comes out we're going to 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.000
 give play 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.609
 then in the lower left corner 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.790
 where is the name of the profile we are going to 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.270
 click and we will choose the 1.6 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:29.360
 point 2 again in the window that we 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.360
 it comes out play and in the bottom play 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.990
 ok as a company here I already have the 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.550
 open market then they are going to 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:44.100
 set up like this is quickly for 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.190
 that they do that effectively 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.920
 It works and obviously obviously, I'm going to 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.590
 load a map I told them so that 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.409
 works 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.209
 then good 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.209
 and then we are going to wait for them to carry them 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:06.409
 It's worth as you see here I already have a map 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.639
 initial 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.639
 with lacquer 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:17.680
 not to say much 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.680
 and then I have problems with him 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:25.650
 that's what I 'm using a machine 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.650
 virtual is something that we have I move 

00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:35.910
 we try to put his head 

00:05:34.549 --> 00:05:42.800
 down 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:42.800
 to some horses and then we go to crowe 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.710
 good 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:53.710
 to the sand because it also does not sound 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.710
 not because 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:03.729
 we have like this one can hit a neck 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:12.360
 to that point and I think the water runs out 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.360
 and that also sounds good 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.180
 problems well then as I tell you is from 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.270
 the one of the machine this is that I'm 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.000
 using but as you can see there 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:28.800
 minecraft well works well 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.520
 well then enter that is all 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:37.069
