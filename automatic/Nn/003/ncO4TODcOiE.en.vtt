00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
through the LAT legging after that part

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.680 
through the LAT legging after that part
you'll<00:05:41.220> know<00:05:41.340> where<00:05:41.490> to<00:05:41.520> do<00:05:41.729> here<00:05:41.940> it<00:05:42.060> goes

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
you'll know where to do here it goes

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.400

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
and right after Part B goes into this

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.550 
and right after Part B goes into this
I'm<00:05:45.360> sure<00:05:45.419> it's<00:05:45.960> still<00:05:46.080> think<00:05:46.410> they<00:05:46.470> were

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
through the chords but now this is the

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.000 
through the chords but now this is the
only<00:05:51.600> part<00:05:51.810> where<00:05:51.960> you<00:05:52.080> don't<00:05:52.320> like<00:05:52.500> alternate

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010
