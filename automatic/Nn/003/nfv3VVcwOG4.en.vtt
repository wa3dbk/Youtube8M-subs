10 centimeters which is going to be
great<00:02:19.260> for<00:02:19.500> macro<00:02:19.920> but<00:02:20.910> let's<00:02:21.360> talk<00:02:21.569> a<00:02:21.599> little

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
great for macro but let's talk a little

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.240 
great for macro but let's talk a little
bit<00:02:21.989> more<00:02:22.140> about<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.560> lens<00:02:22.739> now<00:02:22.920> because<00:02:23.160> it

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
bit more about the lens now because it

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.449 
bit more about the lens now because it
is<00:02:23.430> really<00:02:23.849> important<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:25.260> camera<00:02:25.680> has<00:02:25.860> a

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
is really important this camera has a

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.050 
is really important this camera has a
fixed<00:02:27.120> focal<00:02:27.690> length<00:02:28.019> lens<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:29.060> 23

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
fixed focal length lens of 23

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.420 
fixed focal length lens of 23
millimeters<00:02:30.420> which<00:02:31.049> is<00:02:31.260> around<00:02:31.739> about<00:02:32.160> the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
millimeters which is around about the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.660 
millimeters which is around about the
equivalent<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.239> about<00:02:33.360> 35<00:02:34.110> mil<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:34.680> film

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
equivalent to about 35 mil on film

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.780 
equivalent to about 35 mil on film
there's<00:02:36.480> no<00:02:36.780> zoom<00:02:37.080> now<00:02:37.920> some<00:02:38.489> people<00:02:38.640> might

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
there's no zoom now some people might

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.030 
there's no zoom now some people might
miss<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.269> I<00:02:39.480> don't<00:02:40.049> I<00:02:40.260> think<00:02:40.290> it's<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.830> good

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
miss it I don't I think it's a good

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.309 
miss it I don't I think it's a good
thing<00:02:41.329> what<00:02:42.329> it<00:02:42.480> means<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:42.930> if<00:02:43.200> you

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
thing what it means is that if you

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.080 
thing what it means is that if you
compose<00:02:43.829> your<00:02:44.040> shots<00:02:44.310> you're<00:02:44.760> going<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:44.940> have

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
compose your shots you're going to have

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.120 
compose your shots you're going to have
to<00:02:45.239> move<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.170> might<00:02:46.440> have<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.650> get<00:02:46.920> a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
to move so you might have to get a

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.610 
to move so you might have to get a
little<00:02:47.340> bit<00:02:47.549> closer<00:02:47.819> or<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.599> little<00:02:49.500> bit

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
little bit closer or a little bit

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.770 
little bit closer or a little bit
further<00:02:49.890> back<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.760> get<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.450> perfect

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
further back to get you that perfect

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.600 
further back to get you that perfect
composition<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.890> as<00:02:53.130> far<00:02:53.310> as<00:02:53.370> I'm<00:02:53.579> concerned

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
composition and as far as I'm concerned

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.020 
composition and as far as I'm concerned
that<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> good<00:02:55.230> thing<00:02:55.530> however<00:02:56.250> if<00:02:56.519> you<00:02:56.819> want

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
that is a good thing however if you want

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.600 
that is a good thing however if you want
a<00:02:57.239> longer<00:02:57.750> lens<00:02:58.049> or<00:02:58.319> even<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.769> wider<00:02:59.040> lens<00:02:59.310> there

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
a longer lens or even a wider lens there

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.030 
a longer lens or even a wider lens there
are<00:02:59.790> accessory<00:03:00.660> options<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.319> they<00:03:01.500> simply

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
are accessory options and they simply

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.640 
are accessory options and they simply
pop<00:03:02.370> over<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:02.910> front<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.900> existing<00:03:04.410> lens

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
pop over the front of the existing lens

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.920 
pop over the front of the existing lens
so<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.549> camera<00:03:05.880> really<00:03:06.150> has<00:03:06.329> got<00:03:06.480> all<00:03:06.660> the

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
so this camera really has got all the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.080 
so this camera really has got all the
knobs<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.380> whistles<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.010> if<00:03:08.609> you<00:03:08.760> want

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
knobs and whistles and if you want

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.449 
knobs and whistles and if you want
geekiness<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.019> infinite<00:03:10.410> detail<00:03:10.799> there<00:03:11.250> is

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
geekiness and infinite detail there is

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.280 
geekiness and infinite detail there is
going<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:12.000> be<00:03:12.030> somebody<00:03:12.540> who's<00:03:12.840> going<00:03:13.170> to

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
I want to know is what are the shots

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.629 
I want to know is what are the shots
like<00:03:19.889> how<00:03:20.700> easy<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.660> use<00:03:22.109> can<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.069> get<00:03:23.489> my

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
like how easy is it to use can I get my

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.660 
like how easy is it to use can I get my
head<00:03:23.910> around<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:25.079> I'm<00:03:26.040> going<00:03:26.340> on<00:03:26.430> for<00:03:26.639> a

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
head around it so I'm going on for a

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.720 
head around it so I'm going on for a
spin

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.149 

right<00:03:33.360> okay<00:03:33.930> so<00:03:34.230> I'm<00:03:34.379> going<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.560> go<00:03:34.739> for<00:03:34.920> point

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
right okay so I'm going to go for point

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.899 
right okay so I'm going to go for point
and<00:03:35.280> shoot<00:03:35.550> mode<00:03:35.879> first<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:38.010> be<00:03:38.129> honest<00:03:38.489> it's<00:03:38.760> a

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
and shoot mode first to be honest it's a

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.580 
and shoot mode first to be honest it's a
bit<00:03:39.060> like<00:03:39.180> taking<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.629> Lamborghini<00:03:40.200> down<00:03:40.440> the

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
bit like taking a Lamborghini down the

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.550 
bit like taking a Lamborghini down the
shops<00:03:40.830> but<00:03:41.670> it'll<00:03:42.629> show<00:03:42.810> us<00:03:42.900> what<00:03:43.049> it<00:03:43.170> can<00:03:43.319> do

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
shops but it'll show us what it can do

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.190 
shops but it'll show us what it can do
how<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.250> do<00:03:44.430> this<00:03:44.610> is<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:46.340> said<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:48.480> aperture<00:03:48.989> to

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
how I do this is I said the aperture to

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.880 
how I do this is I said the aperture to
a<00:03:50.569> speed<00:03:51.569> to<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:52.860> focus<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:54.060> continual<00:03:54.890> and

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
a speed to a the focus to continual and

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:21.469 
a speed to a the focus to continual and
away<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.280> go

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.939 

right<00:04:22.479> let's<00:04:22.720> get<00:04:22.900> a<00:04:22.960> little<00:04:23.229> more<00:04:23.620> creative

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:23.949 
right let's get a little more creative

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.670 
right let's get a little more creative
now<00:04:24.759> it's<00:04:25.030> not<00:04:25.270> such<00:04:25.509> a<00:04:25.539> bright<00:04:25.840> day<00:04:25.870> but<00:04:26.470> if<00:04:26.560> it

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
now it's not such a bright day but if it

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.809 
now it's not such a bright day but if it
was<00:04:26.979> and<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.819> wanted<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.360> shoot<00:04:28.629> wide<00:04:29.169> open<00:04:29.819> to

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
was and I wanted to shoot wide open to

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:35.399 
was and I wanted to shoot wide open to
this<00:04:31.629> camera<00:04:32.050> will<00:04:32.229> shoot<00:04:32.800> at<00:04:33.330> 132<00:04:34.409> thousandth

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:35.409 
this camera will shoot at 132 thousandth

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.920 
this camera will shoot at 132 thousandth
of<00:04:35.560> a<00:04:35.680> second<00:04:36.129> so<00:04:36.550> light<00:04:36.939> is<00:04:37.180> never<00:04:37.629> going<00:04:37.870> to

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
of a second so light is never going to

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.140 
of a second so light is never going to
be<00:04:37.990> a<00:04:38.110> problem<00:04:38.289> and<00:04:38.650> it's<00:04:38.979> also<00:04:39.129> got<00:04:39.400> an<00:04:39.550> ND

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
be a problem and it's also got an ND

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.719 
be a problem and it's also got an ND
filter<00:04:40.180> that<00:04:40.750> will<00:04:40.810> stop<00:04:41.229> down<00:04:41.500> three<00:04:42.340> stops

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
filter that will stop down three stops

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.209 
filter that will stop down three stops
so<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:43.180> can<00:04:43.419> shoot<00:04:43.719> as<00:04:43.930> bright<00:04:44.620> as<00:04:44.830> you<00:04:44.979> want

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:45.219 
so you can shoot as bright as you want

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.119 
so you can shoot as bright as you want
and<00:04:45.370> you<00:04:45.460> can<00:04:45.699> still<00:04:46.090> have<00:04:46.539> that<00:04:46.780> control<00:04:47.289> so

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
and you can still have that control so

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:49.920 
and you can still have that control so
