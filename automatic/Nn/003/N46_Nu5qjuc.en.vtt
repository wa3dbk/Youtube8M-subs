00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:21.560
 hello people let's talk about papers today 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:26.000
 on android 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:29.540
 I'm going to use the galaxy s 4 in the other versions 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.820
 android is everything is very similar is 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:36.590
 very similar and I'll start talking 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.890
 about the ways we have to 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.750
 arrive to change the wallpaper 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.750
 the first one is through the menu 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:53.229
 external menu and set the wallpaper 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.360
 it is a way of arriving at a role of 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:02.000
 wall 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.739
 the other way we have and I go 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.680
 get a free screen here 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.590
 The other way we have it is 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.500
 holding a free area of ​​the screen for 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.689
 three seconds or so it opens 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.610
 here this little window so people 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:21.890
 can choose what we want 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.900
 add our land in case you have a 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.180
 wallpaper and other things here that 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.050
 Let's talk in the future. 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.730
 nor the two ways of reaching the 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.950
 definition of the treaty for it exist 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.320
 others but these two are the most 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.990
 practical and fastest 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.300
 click then set the wallpaper 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.020
 we have the option main screen 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.750
 lock or screen start and lock 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.300
 the main screen this screen here for me 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.840
 here is in blue on the lock screen 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:57.710
 she will appear only when you 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.630
 the phone is locked and the phone 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.750
 start blocking it put the same 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.150
 image for both screens 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.729
 then you make an example with the screen 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.590
 and the others follow the same 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.230
 rule 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:16.280
 so choose here main will open 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.970
 here another window to be made 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.740
 selection in case you have gallery of 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.350
 wall paper animated 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.410
 I'll start here for paper 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.520
 Maria of just excited I did not find 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.830
 no new friends 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:35.650
 worth pointing out here that we can 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:38.560
 download from the play of other places né 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.390
 walls of roles in general I have here 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.490
 the beam of light and bubbles I will choose 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.730
 the beam of light to show you 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.040
 how it works and here below you have a 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.430
 preview of how the wallpaper is 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.800
 animated and below here has a button 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.950
 set the wallpaper 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.900
 I 'm going to play and I'll play the role of 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:06.780
 wall now aas my area 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.780
 Work is with the animated background 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.820
 only that also sucks is papers of 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.160
 animated wall usually consume a lot 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.990
 so I do not really like using 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.460
 sink more lively I like each other 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.430
 I'm going back to the main quintet. 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.550
 now choose the wallpaper and 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.510
 this option varies from device to device. 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.300
 appliance 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:38.110

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:41.730
 added here pro galaxy s 4g 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.730
 we put here is that the balloon 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:53.130
 now notice that the balloon now makes the screen 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.130
 background of our icons 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.000

 here it will give us a sizing 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:36.250
 a resizing then we can 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.520
 in the event of a reduction in the framework 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.069

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:45.190
 we want to focus here I'll choose 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:47.620

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:52.090

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.280
 come back here to my standard that I do not 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.800
