the laser machine that we use is called

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.660 
the laser machine that we use is called
the<00:01:22.190> qtr<00:01:22.850> laser<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.750> light<00:01:24.320> actually

penetrates the tissue and it seeks out

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.670 
penetrates the tissue and it seeks out
these<00:01:27.710> cells<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.550> these<00:01:29.390> molecules<00:01:30.110> that<00:01:30.650> a

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
cell has these molecules have what we

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.310 
cell has these molecules have what we
call<00:01:34.120> photoreceptors<00:01:35.120> and<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:36.080> laser

call photoreceptors and the laser
targets<00:01:37.310> those<00:01:37.690> photoreceptors<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:39.040> what<00:01:40.040> it

does is actually produces some very

low-grade heat once we do the

low-grade heat once we do the
examination<00:01:45.350> then<00:01:46.250> we<00:01:46.430> do<00:01:46.640> an<00:01:46.940> actual<00:01:47.360> stirol'

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170

sterilizer<00:02:00.680> prior<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.280> surgery<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.940> next

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
sterilizer prior to surgery the next

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.570 
sterilizer prior to surgery the next
thing<00:02:02.390> that<00:02:02.420> we<00:02:02.660> do<00:02:02.810> is<00:02:03.020> we<00:02:03.200> actually

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
thing that we do is we actually

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.100 
thing that we do is we actually
mechanically<00:02:04.580> divide<00:02:05.090> we<00:02:05.330> use<00:02:05.510> a<00:02:05.540> electric

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
mechanically divide we use a electric

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.669 
mechanically divide we use a electric
grinder<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:07.340> thin<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.910> nail<00:02:08.149> plate<00:02:08.480> and<00:02:08.780> that

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
grinder to thin that nail plate and that

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.830 
grinder to thin that nail plate and that
is<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:09.980> very<00:02:10.399> important<00:02:10.940> factor<00:02:11.300> in<00:02:11.360> why<00:02:11.540> we

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
is a very important factor in why we

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.420 
is a very important factor in why we
believe<00:02:12.170> we're<00:02:12.410> more<00:02:12.590> successful<00:02:13.250> with

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
believe we're more successful with

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.610 
believe we're more successful with
thinning<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.940> nail<00:02:14.120> plate<00:02:14.470> allowing<00:02:15.470> the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
thinning the nail plate allowing the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.220 
thinning the nail plate allowing the
laser<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:16.190> penetrate<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:17.090> nail<00:02:17.300> plate<00:02:17.540> into

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
laser to penetrate the nail plate into

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.680

the nail bed where a lot of the fungus
resides<00:02:21.580> we<00:02:22.580> prescribed<00:02:23.440> initially<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.650> we

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
resides we prescribed initially that we

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.490 
resides we prescribed initially that we
have<00:02:24.920> three<00:02:25.160> laser<00:02:25.340> sessions<00:02:26.239> I<00:02:26.570> have<00:02:27.350> the

have three laser sessions I have the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.550 
have three laser sessions I have the
option<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:28.040> using<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.550> laser<00:02:28.760> either<00:02:29.330> all<00:02:30.260> the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
laser lights brought together it's

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.620 
laser lights brought together it's
multiple<00:02:33.470> lights<00:02:33.709> or<00:02:34.459> I'm<00:02:34.700> going<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.030> spread

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
multiple lights or I'm going to spread

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.440 
multiple lights or I'm going to spread
them<00:02:35.810> out<00:02:35.959> in<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.380> bigger<00:02:36.790> circle<00:02:37.790> one<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.360> I'm

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
them out in the bigger circle one so I'm

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.930 
them out in the bigger circle one so I'm
doing<00:02:38.780> like<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:38.959> grid<00:02:39.380> I'm<00:02:40.280> kind<00:02:40.520> of<00:02:40.580> going<00:02:40.820> up

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
doing like a grid I'm kind of going up

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.580 
doing like a grid I'm kind of going up
and<00:02:41.120> down<00:02:41.209> but<00:02:41.480> I'm<00:02:41.570> trying<00:02:41.840> not<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.050> overlap

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.210 
and down but I'm trying not to overlap
overlapping<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.750> pulses<00:02:44.950> will<00:02:45.950> create

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
overlapping that pulses will create

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.040 
overlapping that pulses will create
increased<00:02:46.820> heat<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.420> we<00:02:47.510> don't<00:02:47.690> want<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.900> do

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
increased heat and we don't want to do

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.020 
increased heat and we don't want to do
that<00:02:48.290> now<00:02:48.650> my<00:02:48.800> thumb<00:02:49.040> is<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.250> temperature<00:02:49.820> gauge

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
that now my thumb is a temperature gauge

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.750 
that now my thumb is a temperature gauge
I<00:02:50.330> can<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:50.780> can<00:02:50.959> tell<00:02:51.320> if<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:52.040> heat<00:02:52.190> is<00:02:52.340> building

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
I can I can tell if the heat is building

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.370 
I can I can tell if the heat is building
up<00:02:52.880> within<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.330> nail<00:02:53.540> or<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.020> one<00:02:54.140> thing

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
up within the nail or the one thing

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.250 
up within the nail or the one thing
we'll<00:02:54.530> concentrate<00:02:54.920> on<00:02:55.400> is<00:02:56.090> back<00:02:56.510> here<00:02:56.959> where

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
we'll concentrate on is back here where

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.900 
we'll concentrate on is back here where
I'm<00:02:57.440> not<00:02:57.590> even<00:02:57.860> on<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.160> nail<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.580> where<00:02:58.790> the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
I'm not even on the nail is where the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.449 
I'm not even on the nail is where the
nail<00:02:59.090> root<00:02:59.360> is<00:02:59.510> it's<00:02:59.780> called<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.110> matrix<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:01.430> we

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
nail root is it's called a matrix so we

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.199 
nail root is it's called a matrix so we
want<00:03:01.820> to<00:03:01.910> make<00:03:02.030> sure<00:03:02.060> we<00:03:03.250> we<00:03:04.250> brush<00:03:04.550> that<00:03:04.790> area

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
want to make sure we we brush that area

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.509 
want to make sure we we brush that area
with<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.450> laser<00:03:05.690> so<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:06.920> we're<00:03:07.070> killing<00:03:07.400> any

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
with the laser so that we're killing any

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.990 
with the laser so that we're killing any
fungus<00:03:07.970> that<00:03:08.120> may<00:03:08.300> be<00:03:08.360> in<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.720> root

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.180 

we<00:03:11.750> actually<00:03:11.930> provide<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.650> patient<00:03:13.070> an

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
we actually provide the patient an
