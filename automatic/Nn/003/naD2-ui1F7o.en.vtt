00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
hey guys I'm gonna do some macro shots

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.160 
hey guys I'm gonna do some macro shots
of<00:00:06.870> this<00:00:07.440> benchmade<00:00:08.220> pin<00:00:08.460> that<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.790> got<00:00:09.170> and

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
of this benchmade pin that I got and

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.770 
of this benchmade pin that I got and
it's<00:00:10.410> more<00:00:10.679> for<00:00:11.040> just<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:12.320> little<00:00:13.320> camera<00:00:13.920> test

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
it's more for just a little camera test

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.060 
it's more for just a little camera test
this<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.990> what<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.199> used<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.800> do<00:00:16.920> with

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
this is what I used to have to do with

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.590 
this is what I used to have to do with
this<00:00:17.160> camera<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:18.210> let<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.109> focus<00:00:19.289> like<00:00:19.680> that

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
this camera is let it focus like that

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.179 
this camera is let it focus like that
and<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.720> was<00:00:21.779> really<00:00:21.990> noisy<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.830> kind<00:00:23.100> of

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
and it was really noisy and kind of

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.089 
and it was really noisy and kind of
annoying<00:00:23.779> so<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.810> think<00:00:25.260> I'm<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:25.560> gonna<00:00:25.680> focus

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
annoying so I think I'm just gonna focus

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.040 
annoying so I think I'm just gonna focus
it<00:00:26.490> myself<00:00:26.970> with<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> little<00:00:27.539> focus<00:00:27.900> ring<00:00:28.170> and

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
it myself with a little focus ring and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.970 
it myself with a little focus ring and
instead<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.109> zooming<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:33.649> or<00:00:34.649> instead<00:00:34.860> of

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
instead of zooming in or instead of

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.470 
instead of zooming in or instead of
bringing<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.309> up<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> macro<00:00:36.000> shot<00:00:36.270> I'll

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
bringing it up for a macro shot I'll

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.690 
bringing it up for a macro shot I'll
just<00:00:36.690> zoom<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.370> then<00:00:39.149> focus<00:00:40.110> in

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
just zoom in like that and then focus in

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.330 
just zoom in like that and then focus in
like<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.200> think<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.800> will<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.129> much

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
like this and I think this will be much

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.690 
like this and I think this will be much
better<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.730> quality<00:00:45.469> this<00:00:46.469> camera<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.550> has

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
better for quality this camera just has

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.639 
better for quality this camera just has
such<00:00:47.940> better<00:00:48.180> quality<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.960> that's<00:00:49.350> why<00:00:49.530> I've

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
such better quality so that's why I've

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.360 
such better quality so that's why I've
been<00:00:49.770> willing<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.070> use<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.460> for<00:00:51.300> my<00:00:51.420> videos<00:00:52.370> so

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
been willing to use it for my videos so

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.529 
been willing to use it for my videos so
uh<00:00:54.320> did<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:56.010> one<00:00:56.190> downside<00:00:56.699> will<00:00:57.180> be<00:00:57.300> that

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
uh did the one downside will be that

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.080 
uh did the one downside will be that
when<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.719> touched<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.260> camera<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:59.430> change<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
when I touched the camera to change the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.830 
when I touched the camera to change the
focus<00:01:00.539> it'll<00:01:00.899> wobble<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.690> tell<00:01:03.690> me

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
focus it'll wobble like that so tell me

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.660 
focus it'll wobble like that so tell me
if<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.439> will<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:04.890> annoying<00:01:05.159> if<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.549> would

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
if that will be annoying if you would

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.179 
if that will be annoying if you would
rather<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.869> lower<00:01:07.140> quality<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.770> no

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
rather have the lower quality and no

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.240 
rather have the lower quality and no
bumps<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.210> or<00:01:09.680> if<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.950> would<00:01:11.070> rather

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
bumps like that or if you would rather

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.010 
bumps like that or if you would rather
have<00:01:12.470> really<00:01:13.470> good<00:01:13.650> quality<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:15.020> but

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
have really good quality like this but

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.550 
have really good quality like this but
with<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.350> occasional<00:01:18.080> occasional<00:01:19.080> little

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
with the occasional occasional little

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.749 
with the occasional occasional little
bump<00:01:20.210> so<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.270> guess<00:01:21.479> I'll<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.720> show<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.759> some

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
bump so I guess I'll just show you some

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:24.920 
bump so I guess I'll just show you some
of<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.939> stuff<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.330> didn't<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.750> show<00:01:24.869> you

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
of the stuff I didn't get to show you

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.749 
of the stuff I didn't get to show you
another<00:01:25.229> video<00:01:25.500> like<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.189> pattern<00:01:26.549> right

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
another video like the pattern right

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:53.789 
another video like the pattern right
there<00:01:27.000> that's<00:01:27.270> pretty<00:01:27.630> cool<00:01:30.049> and<00:01:31.790> right<00:01:32.790> here

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799
