this<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.510> one<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.809> those<00:00:33.930> areas<00:00:34.200> where<00:00:34.380> it's

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
this is one of those areas where it's

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.030 
this is one of those areas where it's
all<00:00:35.070> based<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.550> time<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.360> some<00:00:37.079> kids<00:00:37.410> are<00:00:37.620> are

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
all based on time so some kids are are

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.369 
all based on time so some kids are are
gonna<00:00:38.280> be<00:00:38.489> quick<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.300> some<00:00:39.540> are<00:00:39.690> not<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.110> quick

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
gonna be quick and some are not so quick

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.500

but<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.070> bottom<00:00:41.370> line<00:00:41.399> about<00:00:41.579> our<00:00:42.030> game<00:00:42.270> is

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
but the bottom line about our game is

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.139 
but the bottom line about our game is
time<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.890> be<00:00:44.100> important<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.730> guess<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.120> some

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
time can be important I guess in some

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.619 
time can be important I guess in some
areas<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.610> really<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.820> part<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
areas but really it's part of the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.340 
areas but really it's part of the
toolbox<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.500> what<00:00:50.100> makes<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.700> difference<00:00:50.879> is

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
toolbox and what makes the difference is

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.600 
toolbox and what makes the difference is
whether<00:00:52.350> or<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.680> could<00:00:52.829> use<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.190> toolbox

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
whether or not you could use the toolbox

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.700 
whether or not you could use the toolbox
can<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.059> play<00:00:54.300> some<00:00:54.840> kids<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.230> fast<00:00:55.500> feet

do<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.290> think<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.500> did<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:08.000> think<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.240> was<00:01:09.330> a

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
do you think you did I think I was a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.289 
do you think you did I think I was a
little<00:01:09.570> average<00:01:09.890> in<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> mix<00:01:11.280> there<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.700> was

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
little average in the mix there I was

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.609 
little average in the mix there I was
actually<00:01:12.479> lucky<00:01:12.689> enough<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.170> do<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.409> when<00:01:13.530> they

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
actually lucky enough to do it when they

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.780 
actually lucky enough to do it when they
first<00:01:13.830> came<00:01:14.010> out<00:01:14.159> with<00:01:14.280> their<00:01:14.369> product<00:01:14.729> I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
first came out with their product I

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.789 
first came out with their product I
think<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.180> 2009<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.530> did<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> same

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
think in 2009 and I just did the same

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.850 
think in 2009 and I just did the same
test<00:01:17.159> then<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.689> think<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.380> guys<00:01:19.530> are<00:01:19.560> used

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
test then but I think the guys are used

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.140 
test then but I think the guys are used
to<00:01:19.979> playing<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> Fernet<00:01:20.490> Scouts<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:20.970> don't

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
to playing the Fernet Scouts and I don't

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.640 
to playing the Fernet Scouts and I don't
think<00:01:21.360> they<00:01:21.540> changed<00:01:21.869> attitudes<00:01:22.259> at<00:01:22.380> all<00:01:22.470> just

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
think they changed attitudes at all just

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.020 
think they changed attitudes at all just
because<00:01:22.920> they're<00:01:23.040> not<00:01:23.100> looking<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.729> you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
because they're not looking for you

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.100 
because they're not looking for you
change<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.360> attitude<00:01:24.420> they're<00:01:24.810> looking<00:01:24.990> for

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
change your attitude they're looking for

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.910 
change your attitude they're looking for
the<00:01:25.170> person<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.530> really<00:01:25.560> are

they<00:02:21.390> get<00:02:21.600> tested<00:02:22.080> for<00:02:22.110> skating<00:02:22.620> backwards

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
they get tested for skating backwards

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.050 
they get tested for skating backwards
something<00:02:23.550> they<00:02:23.640> aren't<00:02:23.819> all<00:02:24.030> that

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
something they aren't all that

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.180 
something they aren't all that
accustomed<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.900> when<00:02:25.560> they<00:02:25.650> do<00:02:25.709> have<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.950> skate

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
accustomed to when they do have to skate

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.920 
accustomed to when they do have to skate
backwards<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.940> game<00:02:27.150> situation<00:02:27.390> that's

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
backwards in a game situation that's

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.780 
backwards in a game situation that's
normally<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.440> transition<00:02:29.069> place<00:02:29.340> not<00:02:29.640> where

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
normally in a transition place not where

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.699 
normally in a transition place not where
they're<00:02:30.000> doing<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.270> from<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.540> stop<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.020> there<00:02:31.590> is

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
they're doing it from a stop so there is

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.320 
they're doing it from a stop so there is
a<00:02:31.739> little<00:02:32.130> bit<00:02:32.220> more<00:02:32.370> degree<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:32.760> difficulty

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
a little bit more degree of difficulty

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.840 
a little bit more degree of difficulty
here<00:02:33.360> yeah<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.410> sure<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.620> floors<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:35.220> little

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
here yeah for sure the floors a little

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.400 
here yeah for sure the floors a little
bit<00:02:35.940> backwards<00:02:36.300> games<00:02:36.690> didn't<00:02:36.989> do<00:02:37.110> too<00:02:37.260> often

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
bit backwards games didn't do too often

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.259 
bit backwards games didn't do too often
the<00:02:37.650> games<00:02:37.860> or<00:02:38.070> anything<00:02:38.250> like<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.489> but<00:02:38.880> you

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
the games or anything like that but you

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.110 
the games or anything like that but you
know<00:02:40.019> obviously<00:02:40.530> as<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:40.800> defenseman

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
know obviously as a defenseman

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.910 
know obviously as a defenseman
a<00:02:42.180> strong<00:02:42.870> point<00:02:43.110> for<00:02:43.140> me<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.350> be<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.530> backwards

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
a strong point for me to be a backwards

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.949 
a strong point for me to be a backwards
skating<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.400> last<00:02:45.209> one<00:02:45.390> they<00:02:45.540> are<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.750> going

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
skating and last one they are you going

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.780 
skating and last one they are you going
around<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.230> cones<00:02:46.560> just<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.950> top<00:02:47.489> speed<00:02:47.760> just

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
around the cones just a top speed just

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.240 
around the cones just a top speed just
crossing<00:02:48.660> over<00:02:48.750> like<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.709> felt<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.220> was

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
crossing over like that I felt I was

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.220 
crossing over like that I felt I was
strong<00:02:50.610> in<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:50.850> point<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.480> think<00:02:52.080> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
strong in that point to you I think the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.080 
strong in that point to you I think the
hardest<00:02:52.470> one<00:02:52.680> for<00:02:52.709> everyone<00:02:53.100> was<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.640> going

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
hardest one for everyone was the going

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.090 
hardest one for everyone was the going
through<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.390> pylons<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.140> cross<00:02:55.769> of<00:02:55.950> one

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
through the pylons the cross of one

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.500 
through the pylons the cross of one
cross<00:02:56.310> over<00:02:56.519> each<00:02:56.580> radius<00:02:56.940> because<00:02:57.209> when<00:02:57.390> she

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
cross over each radius because when she

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.180 
cross over each radius because when she
picked<00:02:57.690> up<00:02:57.810> speed<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.200> was<00:02:58.290> you're<00:02:58.860> going<00:02:59.010> too

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
picked up speed it was you're going too

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.710 
picked up speed it was you're going too
far<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.700> once<00:02:59.819> you<00:02:59.940> crossed<00:03:00.150> over<00:03:00.300> you'll<00:03:00.540> hit

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
far and once you crossed over you'll hit

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.059 
far and once you crossed over you'll hit
the<00:03:00.840> pylon<00:03:01.019> so<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.350> think<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.709> was<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.950> most

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
the pylon so I think that was the most

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.740 
the pylon so I think that was the most
difficult<00:03:02.220> for<00:03:02.550> everyone<00:03:02.819> it<00:03:03.030> was<00:03:03.269> for<00:03:03.480> me<00:03:03.569> for

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
difficult for everyone it was for me for

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.900 
difficult for everyone it was for me for
sure<00:03:03.900> probably<00:03:04.560> just<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.069> pivoting<00:03:05.519> going

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
sure probably just like pivoting going

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.580 
sure probably just like pivoting going
when<00:03:06.420> you're<00:03:06.480> going<00:03:06.660> 100<00:03:06.959> percent<00:03:07.260> it's<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.470> lot

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
when you're going 100 percent it's a lot
