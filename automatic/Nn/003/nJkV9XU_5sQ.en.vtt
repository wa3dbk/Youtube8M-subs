00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.070
 well here we are in a new career 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.550
 from mario kart 19 million 100 so 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.930
 Let's go there 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.930
 let's overcome 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.630
 Nero brings about almost the name 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.640
 james we are on this map a long time ago 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.439
 time that there were not there I think I'm not very 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.759
 safe 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.430
 I stayed in the position that remains because 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:37.190
 I think it does more than your vote 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.460
 look at 32 maps and many times 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.230
 they repeat and I do not understand why 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.790
 because I usually climb good races and 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.790
 bad races but I do not know what happens 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.480
 good bad races 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.030
 here for me the Malaga race where 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.310
 worth playing a lot although bad face 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.080
 should make driving more direct but 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.450
 It is very difficult for me to drive badly in a 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.960
 circuit you already know it so much by heart 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.960
 that is over 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.910
 OK 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.789
 the slice that does not send two 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.990
 cojones sends cojdos triplets up 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:18.670
 plays and not the games were a creed 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.670
 you know I do not want to fall 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.680
 for what at rates that is nothing 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.760
 very little 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.580
 I was going 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.580
 fuck right day 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.830
 I 'll bust you as soon as I have 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.830
 This time 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.230
 or good did not have photos 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.300
 so nothing first position how much 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.750
 will take the blue shell in by 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.740
 host we do not know only in rooms 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.740
 after the publicity 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.850
 have a 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.590
 monedite 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.740
 let's keep moving forward come 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.120
 of course 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:34.570
 I have ping ping ping ping ping ping in the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.210
 that gives very little very little very little for not 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.220
 just coins notio be I am among the 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.630
 sword and the wall commit something I'm 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.290
 fucking 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.290
 but come 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.629
 I do not have anything of the web 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.519
 not scared in an imbecile plan for nothing 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.150
 so see you at the next race 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.150
 until next time 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.270
 well here we are in a race of 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.270
 kart 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.890
 at the airport but I think it does 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.640
 I do not play that mythical map 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.640
 legendary 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.750
 where we all live for the first time 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.250
 Once that is bullshit me say boy 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.800
 I would cut the uncle tongue so I could not 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.640
 talk more nonsense 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.640
 balls 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.380
 we go there 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.830
 let's super like little pam pam 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.459
 let's go monedita monedita 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.630
 clean first of the beginning and I 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.630
 scares you know because I know it is that he loves me 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.260
 I know that a blue shell can come in 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.940
 nothing so I do not like anything the first 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.650
 of the first ace 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.460
 I'm more in tension than in any 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.560
 moment 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.990
 what should be done in these cases 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.350
 is to try to get the maximum advantage slut 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.350
 what can you 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.230
 not making the mistakes left 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.470
 comment so 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.860
 I say it very carefully 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.860
 we go 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.430
 do not 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.430
 unclothed 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.330
 to take advantage to take advantage to take out 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.340
 advantage to have only take out 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.320
 advantage take advantage 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.320
 with grasshopper coming against blue and co 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.850
 we go 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:59.160
 no one comes sometimes seems about the 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.160
 point 20 not anyone 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:07.270
 nobody nobody 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.669
 It's worth only one round, let's go 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.340
 this had not happened for a long time 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.740
 the first to fucking go solo or be 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.889
 wow the whole career first amazing 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.670
 I dropped the pilotines 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:24.169
 in the form of a bathrobe 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.950
 ok ok let's go 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.490

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.060

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.060

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:41.030
 and let the ray of shit no longer come 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:43.560

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.930

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.190
 I'm just asking the Lord not to come 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.970
 a blue shell at the last moment 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.970
 I will scream 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.770
