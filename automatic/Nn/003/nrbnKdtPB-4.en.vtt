00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and the habitat the seasonal habitat

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.380 
and the habitat the seasonal habitat
will<00:01:46.020> change<00:01:46.470> based<00:01:47.010> on<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.880> season<00:01:48.240> you're

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
in so if you see a green seasonal type

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.710 
in so if you see a green seasonal type
dragon<00:01:51.860> that's<00:01:52.860> because<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.490> someone<00:01:54.330> took<00:01:54.659> a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
dragon that's because you someone took a

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.020 
dragon that's because you someone took a
picture<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.229> or<00:01:55.590> film<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.250> during<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
picture of it or film that during the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.500 
picture of it or film that during the
summer<00:01:57.320> um<00:01:58.320> if<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.580> an<00:01:59.640> orange<00:01:59.820> type<00:02:00.270> of

around<00:02:07.940> those<00:02:08.150> colors<00:02:08.479> it's<00:02:09.229> because<00:02:09.590> they've

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
around those colors it's because they've

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.990 
around those colors it's because they've
taken<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:10.580> during<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.990> autumn<00:02:12.410> or<00:02:12.620> winter

I usually say in the video about how it
doesn't<00:02:41.720> really<00:02:41.930> matter<00:02:42.170> which<00:02:42.500> side<00:02:42.740> you

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
doesn't really matter which side you

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.830 
doesn't really matter which side you
select<00:02:43.160> your<00:02:43.310> dragon<00:02:43.700> what<00:02:44.330> level<00:02:44.690> your

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
dragons are because those things just

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.690 
dragons are because those things just
don't<00:02:47.960> affect<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.680> breeding<00:02:48.980> process<00:02:49.130> and

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
don't affect the breeding process and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.700 
don't affect the breeding process and

you use a combination with lightning and

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.240 
you use a combination with lightning and
cold<00:03:26.260> there's<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.350> chance<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:27.980> will<00:03:28.100> be<00:03:28.220> a

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
cold there's a chance that it will be a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.920 
cold there's a chance that it will be a
Sun<00:03:28.400> dragon<00:03:28.550> or<00:03:28.790> moon<00:03:28.910> dragon<00:03:29.120> if<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:29.750> use

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
Sun dragon or moon dragon if you use

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.860 
Sun dragon or moon dragon if you use
four<00:03:30.230> elements<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:30.830> might<00:03:31.010> get<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.870> rainbow

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
would recommend something like the

would recommend something like the
blazing<00:03:41.840> dragon<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.590> plant<00:03:42.769> dragon<00:03:43.160> but

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
blazing dragon and the plant dragon but

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.190 
blazing dragon and the plant dragon but
I've<00:03:43.550> used<00:03:43.850> a<00:03:44.000> different<00:03:44.330> combination<00:03:44.660> here

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
I've used a different combination here

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.590 
I've used a different combination here
but<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:45.709> doesn't<00:03:45.920> really<00:03:46.010> matter<00:03:46.239> okay<00:03:47.239> thank

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600
