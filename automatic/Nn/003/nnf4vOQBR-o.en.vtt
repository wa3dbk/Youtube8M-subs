00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
if you're gonna have to neat to answer

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.820 
if you're gonna have to neat to answer
with<00:03:50.269> my<00:03:50.390> case<00:03:50.660> I'm<00:03:50.840> gonna<00:03:50.930> use<00:03:51.019> one<00:03:51.610> so

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.770 

so<00:03:56.760> very<00:03:57.180> gently<00:03:57.650> pry<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:59.270> from<00:04:00.270> there<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.570> it

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
so very gently pry it from there and it

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
comes off as you can see there's a screw

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.670 
comes off as you can see there's a screw
here<00:04:08.330> there<00:04:09.330> is<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.510> screw<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.320> have<00:04:10.530> to

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
here there is a screw that you have to

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.450 
here there is a screw that you have to
do<00:04:10.860> under<00:04:11.400> which<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.030> forgot<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.300> mention<00:04:13.460> which

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
do under which I forgot to mention which

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.910 
do under which I forgot to mention which
I've<00:04:14.640> already<00:04:14.790> done<00:04:14.910> earlier<00:04:15.650> say<00:04:16.650> is<00:04:16.709> the

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
I've already done earlier say is the

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.820 
I've already done earlier say is the
screw<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:18.720> have<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:19.019> obviously<00:04:19.290> do<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.650> to

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
screw you have to obviously do that to

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.680 
screw you have to obviously do that to
release<00:04:20.100> this<00:04:20.310> plastic<00:04:20.820> it's<00:04:20.940> quite<00:04:21.120> easy<00:04:21.269> but

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
release this plastic it's quite easy but

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.550 
release this plastic it's quite easy but
that's<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:22.200> short<00:04:23.160> explanation<00:04:24.170> how<00:04:25.170> to<00:04:25.230> take

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
that's a short explanation how to take

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.190 
that's a short explanation how to take
the<00:04:25.650> blades<00:04:25.890> off<00:04:26.720> your<00:04:28.400> yeah<00:04:29.430> si<00:04:29.880> 31<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.870> I

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
the blades off your yeah si 31 and I

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.350 
the blades off your yeah si 31 and I
think<00:04:31.470> it<00:04:31.590> goes<00:04:31.800> for<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.190> SOP<00:04:32.670> 2<00:04:32.910> as<00:04:33.030> well<00:04:33.270> I'm

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
think it goes for the SOP 2 as well I'm

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.000 
think it goes for the SOP 2 as well I'm
not<00:04:33.510> sure<00:04:34.850> kind<00:04:35.850> in<00:04:35.970> and<00:04:36.720> obviously<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.860> have

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
not sure kind in and obviously you have

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.330 
not sure kind in and obviously you have
to<00:04:38.840> vice<00:04:39.840> versa<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:40.650> putting<00:04:40.950> it<00:04:41.010> all<00:04:41.070> back<00:04:41.190> on

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
to vice versa and putting it all back on

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.110 
to vice versa and putting it all back on
again<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.670> guess<00:04:42.680> that's<00:04:43.680> it

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
again I guess that's it

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.940 
again I guess that's it
any<00:04:45.120> questions<00:04:45.570> let<00:04:45.750> me<00:04:45.780> know<00:04:46.020> I'm<00:04:46.680> waiting

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
see they're all screws in there so you

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.390 
see they're all screws in there so you
got<00:05:03.900> our<00:05:04.020> undoing<00:05:04.230> the<00:05:04.350> screws<00:05:04.470> quite<00:05:04.980> simple

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
got our undoing the screws quite simple

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.460

that's given and the screw jaw and
another<00:05:09.870> screwdriver<00:05:10.230> I<00:05:10.590> used<00:05:10.950> -<00:05:11.930> okay

another screwdriver I used - okay
pretty<00:05:13.950> cool<00:05:14.250> pretty<00:05:14.580> cool<00:05:14.880> stuff<00:05:15.150> that's<00:05:15.870> how

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
pretty cool pretty cool stuff that's how

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.140 
pretty cool pretty cool stuff that's how
you<00:05:16.110> do<00:05:16.290> it<00:05:16.320> folks<00:05:16.410> um<00:05:16.919> I'm<00:05:17.580> not<00:05:17.700> sure<00:05:17.760> you<00:05:18.000> get

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
you do it folks um I'm not sure you get

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.050 
you do it folks um I'm not sure you get
the<00:05:18.240> cogs<00:05:18.480> out<00:05:18.690> but<00:05:19.320> I'll<00:05:20.250> see<00:05:20.460> if<00:05:20.550> it<00:05:20.640> comes<00:05:20.790> to

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
the cogs out but I'll see if it comes to

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.140 
the cogs out but I'll see if it comes to
it<00:05:21.090> I'm<00:05:21.360> guessing<00:05:21.810> it<00:05:22.410> should<00:05:22.650> be<00:05:22.770> quite<00:05:22.980> easy

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
it I'm guessing it should be quite easy
