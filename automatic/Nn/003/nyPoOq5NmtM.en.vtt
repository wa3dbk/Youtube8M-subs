00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
this not bad either so that's wondering

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.260 
this not bad either so that's wondering
where<00:01:58.950> that's<00:01:59.159> gonna<00:01:59.310> go<00:01:59.490> exactly<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.090> yet

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
where that's gonna go exactly is yet

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.749 
where that's gonna go exactly is yet
enough<00:02:00.659> spot<00:02:00.869> not<00:02:01.020> out<00:02:01.170> at<00:02:01.290> some<00:02:01.439> point<00:02:01.710> I'm<00:02:02.579> do
