00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:13.730
 Introducing the wireless keyboard 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:13.730
 such a box with the Russian language 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:27.260
 box and vishnu instruction in English 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.260
 language and 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:38.309
 battery instruction can immediately say 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.350
 what a disgusting translation 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.550
 disgusting well that's figured out 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:49.320
 little want to share with you means 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.930
 Here is a keyboard closer show how 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.809
 we see that she is practically nothing 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:02.070
 different from the usual keyboard 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:06.350
 nafig battery is inserted so necessary 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.080
 note that in a small container 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.159
 the manufacturer assures that there is enough 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.170
 about three weeks 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:20.759
 the only plus is that charging is fast 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:29.960
 charging and somewhere in half an hour full 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:29.960
 battery down also raised sensor 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.119
 which all have by plug and 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:41.710
 designed for any devices that 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:46.420
 have the same connector working with 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.780
 android windows systems for all 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.780
 fits 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.590
 keyboard 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:06.280
 we see buttons designed for 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:11.760

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:16.980
 tell in the tanks means whom off 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:23.910
 rewind fast rewind and here 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:29.799
 I installed another laser I often watch 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.540
 so as you can see works pretty 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.250
 powerful 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.769
 I tried to go outside for the Turks away 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.730
 Someone needs someone there for example 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:45.669
 I do not need read instructions offers 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.889
 it says there seems to be for 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:51.190
 teaching staff who leads 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:53.040
 lectures will be convenient for them to work as 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.450
 laser rulers 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:01.290

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.250

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.829
 when charging when driving a finger 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.740
 it is visible and all sorts of indicators but 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:18.200

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:23.390
 our recharging buttons are located here 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:26.000

 let's run 9 or some other devices 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:42.050
 the most important thing was to beat and mean 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.100

 what you want as long as the button is on 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.490
 Programming has gone out already 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.880
 it will not be necessary to do the procedure 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.030
 re- burning for about 10 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.210

 so that you can conveniently manage 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.789

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.960

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:14.159
 so put a computer on add that 

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:14.849
 here is the most important button as I understood

 we get this or that function 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:33.439
 for example, if this first button 

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:37.639
 Well, how would she act to 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:39.319

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:54.919
 switched and you can manage it 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:59.309
