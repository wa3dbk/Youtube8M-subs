00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
just a lot of small issues with the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.569 
just a lot of small issues with the
motor<00:00:41.280> carburetor<00:00:42.590> gas<00:00:43.590> tank<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.370> see

so yeah it's not running the best but I
plan<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> change<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.320> that's<00:00:52.590> when<00:00:53.489> this

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
plan to change it and that's when this

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.020 
plan to change it and that's when this
bad<00:00:54.030> boy<00:00:54.270> comes<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.980> as<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.489> see<00:00:56.670> it's

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
kind of spray painted and destroyed I

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.229

had some fun with it
what<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.719> though<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.170> there's<00:01:04.739> three

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
what you can see though is there's three

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.130 
what you can see though is there's three
pedals<00:01:05.250> over<00:01:05.729> there<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.420> was<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> five-speed

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
pedals over there so it was a five-speed

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.370 
pedals over there so it was a five-speed
I<00:01:07.760> drove<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.850> home<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.330> week<00:01:09.540> ago<00:01:09.780> believe<00:01:10.229> it

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.330 
transfer
should<00:02:13.950> bolt<00:02:14.220> up<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.640> back<00:02:14.849> of<00:02:15.060> there<00:02:16.160> I'm<00:02:17.160> not

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
should bolt up the back of there I'm not

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.809 
should bolt up the back of there I'm not
mistaken<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:19.769> only<00:02:19.890> other<00:02:20.069> thing<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.489> do

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
mistaken so the only other thing to do

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.479 
mistaken so the only other thing to do
is<00:02:21.800> probably<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:23.010> have<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.190> move<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
is probably I have to move the

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.280 
is probably I have to move the
crossmember<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.150> little<00:02:24.360> bit<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.660> then<00:02:24.959> figure

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
crossmember a little bit and then figure

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.290 
crossmember a little bit and then figure
out<00:02:25.349> how<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.590> get<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.860> hydraulic<00:02:26.370> hydraulic

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
out how to get a hydraulic hydraulic

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.250 
out how to get a hydraulic hydraulic
clutch<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:28.140> there's<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:30.360> one's<00:02:30.569> all<00:02:30.720> manual

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
clutch in there's that one's all manual

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.729 
clutch in there's that one's all manual
so<00:02:32.030> we'll<00:02:33.030> see<00:02:33.420> how<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.470> goes

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
so we'll see how that goes

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.710 
so we'll see how that goes
yeah<00:02:37.739> that<00:02:38.670> should<00:02:38.910> be<00:02:39.060> interesting<00:02:39.569> they'll

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
yeah that should be interesting they'll

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.140 
yeah that should be interesting they'll
be<00:02:39.870> way<00:02:40.049> nicer<00:02:40.590> there's<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.670> couple<00:02:41.910> advantages

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
be way nicer there's a couple advantages

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.890 
be way nicer there's a couple advantages
on<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:43.650> training<00:02:44.010> over<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.750> what's<00:02:45.750> in

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
on that training over the what's in

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.670 
on that training over the what's in
there<00:02:46.049> now<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.260> SM<00:02:46.829> 465<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:49.290> big<00:02:49.470> ones

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
there now the SM 465 the big ones

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.309 
there now the SM 465 the big ones
overdrive<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.610> one<00:02:50.790> has<00:02:50.940> overdrive<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:52.170> one

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
overdrive this one has overdrive the one

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.020 
overdrive this one has overdrive the one
out<00:02:52.440> there<00:02:52.680> does<00:02:52.860> not<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.790> second<00:02:54.209> one<00:02:54.360> is

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
out there does not the second one is

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.600 
out there does not the second one is
this<00:02:57.030> one<00:02:57.360> has<00:02:57.739> it's<00:02:58.739> just<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.980> lot<00:02:59.129> smoother

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
this one has it's just a lot smoother

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.729 
this one has it's just a lot smoother
shift<00:03:00.000> it's<00:03:00.269> not<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.900> know<00:03:00.989> super<00:03:01.410> spread

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
shift it's not you know super spread

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.780 
shift it's not you know super spread
over<00:03:01.890> too<00:03:02.069> far<00:03:02.310> away<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:04.370> spread<00:03:05.370> between<00:03:05.549> the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
over too far away I spread between the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.559 
over too far away I spread between the
gears<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.739> one<00:03:07.739> in<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.610> truck<00:03:08.849> now<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.360> then

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
gears on one in the truck now and then

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.660 
gears on one in the truck now and then
the<00:03:09.750> third<00:03:10.049> reason<00:03:10.079> is<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:11.220> just<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.489> lot

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
the third reason is it's just a lot

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.220 
the third reason is it's just a lot
easier<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:13.440> shift<00:03:14.299> it<00:03:15.299> goes<00:03:15.569> into<00:03:15.840> gear<00:03:16.049> way

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
easier to shift it goes into gear way

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.360 
easier to shift it goes into gear way
smoother<00:03:18.319> so<00:03:19.319> yeah<00:03:19.500> I'm<00:03:19.650> really<00:03:19.829> excited<00:03:20.040> to

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
smoother so yeah I'm really excited to

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.610 
smoother so yeah I'm really excited to
get<00:03:20.459> this<00:03:20.700> in<00:03:20.880> here<00:03:21.590> really<00:03:22.590> excited<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.480> just

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
get this in here really excited I just

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.080 
get this in here really excited I just
can't<00:03:25.620> wait<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.950> get<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.489> in<00:03:26.609> there<00:03:26.819> and

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
can't wait to get it in there and

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.580 
can't wait to get it in there and
shrimpie<00:03:27.720> too<00:03:27.870> hard<00:03:28.139> to<00:03:29.069> get<00:03:29.250> going<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:30.410> once<00:03:31.410> I

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
shrimpie too hard to get going so once I

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.890 
shrimpie too hard to get going so once I
finish<00:03:32.160> tearing<00:03:32.579> this<00:03:32.700> apart<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.329> scrap<00:03:33.660> it

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
finish tearing this apart and scrap it
