00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
found a freedom with the ball and a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.019 
found a freedom with the ball and a
sense<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.650> joy<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.010> purpose<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.760> somebody

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
soccer or something and I was like I

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.940 
soccer or something and I was like I
feel<00:00:36.780> like<00:00:36.840> I'm<00:00:37.050> doing<00:00:37.200> what<00:00:37.500> I'm<00:00:37.559> supposed<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.619 
feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to
be<00:00:38.070> doing<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.670> know<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.090> that's<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.300> feeling

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
be doing you know and that's a feeling

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.869 
be doing you know and that's a feeling
that<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.809> had<00:00:40.100> with<00:00:41.100> soccer<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.640> with<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
that I had with soccer and with the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.729 
that I had with soccer and with the
balls<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.360> almost<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:42.840> felt<00:00:43.170> connected<00:00:43.500> to

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
balls it almost just felt connected to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.029 
balls it almost just felt connected to
me<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.100> some<00:00:44.340> way<00:00:45.170> with<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.379> crazy<00:00:46.649> schedule

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
me in some way with the crazy schedule

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.790 
me in some way with the crazy schedule
that<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:48.000> live<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:49.079> kind<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.469> didn't<00:00:49.710> really

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
that we live it kind of didn't really

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.470 
that we live it kind of didn't really
make<00:00:50.160> sense<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:50.700> me<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:50.969> paying<00:00:51.210> rent

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
make sense for me to be paying rent

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.869 
make sense for me to be paying rent
somewhere<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:52.949> really<00:00:53.219> using<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> place

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
somewhere and not really using the place

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.270 
somewhere and not really using the place
so<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.809> kind<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.170> balance<00:00:55.559> from<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.070> there

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
so I kind of balance from here to there

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340 
so I kind of balance from here to there
and<00:00:56.760> through<00:00:57.420> our<00:00:57.570> general<00:00:57.780> manager<00:00:58.199> he's

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and through our general manager he's

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.229 
and through our general manager he's
constantly<00:00:58.890> asking<00:00:59.340> me<00:00:59.520> where<00:00:59.879> I'm<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.180> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
constantly asking me where I'm going to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.389 
constantly asking me where I'm going to
be<00:01:00.300> flying<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.840> because<00:01:01.260> he<00:01:01.590> knows<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.800> every

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
be flying to because he knows that every

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.189 
be flying to because he knows that every
time<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.730> gonna<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:03.030> different<00:01:03.059> usually<00:01:03.840> if

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
