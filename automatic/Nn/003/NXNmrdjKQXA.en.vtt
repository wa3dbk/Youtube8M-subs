Hi.

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.320
I'm Christy with Duck Brand
duct tape, and today I'm

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.250
going to show you how to
make a holiday gift box.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.320
For this project, you will
need Duck Brand duct tape

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.060
in a variety of colors-- Today I'm
using Chrome and Candy Cane-- a gift box

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.170
or a shoe box, floral wire,
and nonstick scissors.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.720
First, it's very simple.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.650
You're going to want to take
your gift box or a shoe box

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.150
and cover it with duct tape using
any pattern or design you want.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.570
On this, I just used red and
white stripes to cover the front.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.440
And on the bottom it's just solid red.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.940
And then I created a bow
using the reindeer pattern

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.030
with two strips on the front
and made sure to tuck in sides

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.500
underneath like this so you
can still open and close.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.200
And I also continued the
ribbon under onto the back

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.910
and then tucked those sides
in underneath as well.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.100
Now I'm going to show you
how to make a duct tape bow.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.370
First, cut off about
11 inches of duct tape.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.180
And you will actually want
to work with two pieces.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.550
Also take your floral wire and
measure about the same length, which

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.765
is 11 inches, and lay it
on both top and bottom

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:19.430
of one of the pieces of the
duct tape, on the sticky side.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.890
Take the other piece of duct tape and
line it up sticky side to sticky side

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.920
to make a duct tape fabric
with floral wire inside.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.670
I'm going to take my scissors and
just clean off the edges on both sides

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.040
since I had some extra tape overlapping.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.920
And then we want to find where
the middle of this piece is.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.270
So we're going to fold it in half
just to create a seam to work with.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.850
And we'll use that as our guide.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.830
Next step, tape one side
over and gently fold it

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.340
so the end is in the middle
of your piece of tape.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.120
Do the same thing on the other side.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.080
Pinch the entire middle section
together as best as you can.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.620
And then working with the
floral wire that's inside, just

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.600
start puffing it out a little bit.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.650
Once you have it where it
looks good and you're happy,

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.360
just take another one-inch
piece of duct tape

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.880
and secure both sides
together right in the center.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.790
Next I'm going to show you how to
make the ribbon portion of your bow.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.120
So I've actually already
recreated the duct tape fabric

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.090
sheets with the floral wire inside.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.940
So I have two strips,
about 11 inches long again,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.940
that I have cut out triangles at
the bottom to look more like ribbon.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.790
I'm going to take the top and
actually pinch the two edges together

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.090
so the floral wire is next to each
other, and do the same with this side.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.810
And then this part will go on the back
of the bow that you've already created.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.010
And I have a couple
pieces of duct tape strips

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.970
here just to secure them on the back.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.630
And then just like you
see here, we want to move

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.330
the floral wire around a little bit just
to give it more of a ribbon look again.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.920
Now that you have your
completed bow, you

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.870
can take another small piece of
duct tape-- this is about an inch

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.300
wide-- create a loop with
it, and then I am just

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.360
putting it right on the back of my bow.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.760
And then the other sticky portion will
go right on top of your decorated box.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.730
And that's how you make a
duct tape holiday gift box.
