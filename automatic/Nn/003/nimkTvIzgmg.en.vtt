now and he's ex bounty it's big yet
bigger<00:01:40.590> than<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.040> think<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.610> bigger<00:01:41.820> than

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
bigger than I think it's bigger than

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.050 
bigger than I think it's bigger than
luffy's<00:01:42.420> current<00:01:42.930> bounty<00:01:43.320> ain't<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:44.060> because

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
luffy's current bounty ain't it because

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.090 
luffy's current bounty ain't it because
Luffy's<00:01:45.450> come<00:01:45.689> about<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.320> I'm<00:01:46.619> sure<00:01:46.920> he's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
Luffy's come about the I'm sure he's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.760 
Luffy's come about the I'm sure he's
from<00:01:48.229> 400<00:01:49.229> million<00:01:49.439> belly<00:01:49.860> buried<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.439> think

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
from 400 million belly buried so I think

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.160 
from 400 million belly buried so I think
