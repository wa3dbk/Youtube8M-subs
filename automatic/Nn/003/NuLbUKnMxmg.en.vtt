00:00:46.240 --> 00:01:26.380 
processor and grinding them until
they're<00:00:46.390> crumbs<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.860> here<00:00:48.010> we<00:00:48.130> go<00:00:48.220> with<00:00:48.370> that

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.340 

I'm<00:01:27.390> going<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.630> check<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.810> make<00:01:27.900> sure<00:01:28.050> they're

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
I'm going to check to make sure they're

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.090 
I'm going to check to make sure they're
all<00:01:28.380> grounds<00:01:30.440> I'm<00:01:31.440> going<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.650> let<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.860> go<00:01:31.950> just

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
all grounds I'm going to let it go just

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.350 
all grounds I'm going to let it go just
for<00:01:32.250> another<00:01:32.490> minute<00:01:32.670> there's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.940> big<00:01:33.150> big

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
for another minute there's a big big

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:43.010 
for another minute there's a big big
Chuck<00:01:33.630> still<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.080> there

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.740 

okay<00:01:44.020> so<00:01:44.080> those<00:01:44.380> are<00:01:44.440> all<00:01:44.710> ground<00:01:45.010> up<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.570> now

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
okay so those are all ground up and now

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.920 
okay so those are all ground up and now
what<00:01:46.960> I<00:01:46.990> want<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.290> do<00:01:47.440> is<00:01:47.740> pour<00:01:48.190> these<00:01:48.910> into<00:01:49.570> a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
what I want to do is pour these into a

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.550 
what I want to do is pour these into a
bowl<00:01:50.560> here<00:01:51.510> so<00:01:52.510> it's<00:01:52.720> easier<00:01:53.110> for<00:01:53.140> me<00:01:53.410> to

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
bowl here so it's easier for me to

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.850 
bowl here so it's easier for me to
measure<00:01:53.740> three<00:01:54.250> cups<00:01:54.610> of<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.000> controls<00:01:55.860> to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
measure three cups of the controls to

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:48.330 
measure three cups of the controls to
make<00:01:56.980> the<00:01:57.040> truffles<00:02:25.740> I'm<00:02:26.740> going<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:47.160> stir<00:02:48.160> this

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
make the truffles I'm going to stir this

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:59.310 
make the truffles I'm going to stir this
to<00:02:48.520> mix<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.940> is<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.150> really<00:02:58.450> stiff<00:02:58.720> batter<00:02:58.900> so

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
to mix this is a really stiff batter so

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.590 
to mix this is a really stiff batter so
once<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.160> get<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.520> a<00:03:00.550> certain<00:03:00.820> point<00:03:01.270> it's

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
once you get it to a certain point it's

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.210 
once you get it to a certain point it's
a<00:03:01.720> little<00:03:01.750> bit<00:03:02.020> easier<00:03:02.350> just<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.620> go<00:03:02.770> ahead<00:03:02.860> and

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
a little bit easier just to go ahead and

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.970 
a little bit easier just to go ahead and
do<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:03.940> rest<00:03:04.150> with<00:03:04.270> your<00:03:04.510> hands

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.130 

this<00:03:08.980> eventually<00:03:09.310> all<00:03:09.730> comes<00:03:10.450> together<00:03:10.660> and

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
this eventually all comes together and

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.490 
this eventually all comes together and
makes<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.770> stiff<00:03:12.100> ball<00:03:12.989> so<00:03:13.989> this<00:03:14.140> is<00:03:14.260> what<00:03:14.410> it

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
makes a stiff ball so this is what it

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.820 
makes a stiff ball so this is what it
looks<00:03:14.680> like<00:03:16.140> okay<00:03:17.140> so<00:03:17.200> what<00:03:17.410> we're<00:03:17.500> gonna<00:03:17.590> do

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
looks like okay so what we're gonna do

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.520 
looks like okay so what we're gonna do
now<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:19.390> need<00:03:19.540> some<00:03:19.810> cookie<00:03:20.110> sheets<00:03:20.350> that

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530

now is you need some cookie sheets that
have<00:03:20.650> been<00:03:20.800> lined<00:03:21.010> with<00:03:21.370> wax<00:03:21.850> paper<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:23.410> we're
