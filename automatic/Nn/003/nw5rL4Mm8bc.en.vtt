00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
noises with this thing so if i put on I

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.940 
noises with this thing so if i put on I
put<00:02:25.820> on<00:02:25.940> mod<00:02:26.210> up<00:02:26.480> put<00:02:26.600> on<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.750> modify<00:02:27.050> so<00:02:27.470> to

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
put on mod up put on the modify so to

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.770 
put on mod up put on the modify so to
switch<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.490> I<00:02:28.700> want<00:02:28.970> right<00:02:29.270> now<00:02:29.300> i'm<00:02:29.570> pretty

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
switch to I want right now i'm pretty

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.320 
switch to I want right now i'm pretty
sure<00:02:29.930> i<00:02:29.960> have<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.170> on<00:02:30.200> course<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.760> i<00:02:31.790> have<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.300> on

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
sure i have it on course so i have it on

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.280 
sure i have it on course so i have it on
course<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:32.900> that's<00:02:32.990> number<00:02:33.230> one<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:35.390> if<00:02:36.110> you

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
course and that's number one so if you

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.690 
course and that's number one so if you
can<00:02:36.530> see<00:02:36.800> that<00:02:36.940> course<00:02:37.940> is<00:02:38.090> number<00:02:38.390> one<00:02:39.550> so<00:02:40.550> now

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
can see that course is number one so now

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.060 
can see that course is number one so now
i'm<00:02:40.760> going<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.940> switch<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:42.250> 2<00:02:43.250> which<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:43.610> phaser

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
i'm going to switch to 2 which is phaser

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.190 
i'm going to switch to 2 which is phaser
that<00:02:46.070> I'm<00:02:46.220> going<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.430> crank<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:46.970> crank<00:02:47.270> both<00:02:48.020> of

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
that I'm going to crank it crank both of

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.890 
that I'm going to crank it crank both of
them<00:02:48.350> all<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.220> way<00:02:49.280> up<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.400> 50<00:02:49.910> so<00:02:50.630> this<00:02:50.810> is

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
them all the way up to 50 so this is
