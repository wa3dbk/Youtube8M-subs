nothing<00:02:46.709> on<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.370> really<00:02:47.790> makes<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.390> n9

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
nothing on it and it really makes the n9

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.949 
nothing on it and it really makes the n9
look<00:02:48.930> very<00:02:49.200> pretty<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:50.670> top<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.180> where<00:02:51.450> most

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
look very pretty the top is where most

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.199 
look very pretty the top is where most
of<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.290> action<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.800> that<00:02:52.830> let<00:02:53.790> me<00:02:53.820> just<00:02:54.060> get

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
of the action is that let me just get

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.490 
of the action is that let me just get
that<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.390> focus<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.900> little<00:02:55.050> bit<00:02:55.940> there<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:56.970> go

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
that and focus a little bit there you go

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.210 
that and focus a little bit there you go
there's<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.590> 3.5<00:02:59.220> millimeter<00:02:59.430> jack<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:01.220> holds

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
there's a 3.5 millimeter jack this holds

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.930 
there's a 3.5 millimeter jack this holds
micro<00:03:02.610> sim<00:03:02.880> just<00:03:03.239> like<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.540> iPhone<00:03:03.630> 4<00:03:04.290> and

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
micro sim just like the iPhone 4 and

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.270 
micro sim just like the iPhone 4 and
hence<00:03:05.940> bad<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.330> can<00:03:06.510> plug<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:07.020> USB<00:03:07.170> in<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:08.160> if

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
hence bad you can plug the USB in so if

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.310 
hence bad you can plug the USB in so if
you<00:03:08.400> want<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.700> open<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.180> thing<00:03:09.239> up<00:03:09.600> you<00:03:10.110> just

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
you want to open this thing up you just

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.710 
you want to open this thing up you just
push<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.590> lever<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.489> opens<00:03:11.790> up<00:03:11.910> as<00:03:12.480> you

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
push that lever and it opens up as you

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.080 
push that lever and it opens up as you
can<00:03:12.870> see<00:03:12.989> that's<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.440> micro<00:03:13.709> USB<00:03:14.130> port<00:03:14.160> which

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
can see that's the micro USB port which

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.150 
can see that's the micro USB port which
you<00:03:15.270> can<00:03:15.420> use<00:03:15.540> for<00:03:15.810> charging<00:03:16.290> or<00:03:16.500> transferring

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
you can use for charging or transferring

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.060 
you can use for charging or transferring
data<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.700> if<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.660> want<00:03:18.840> remove<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.590> SIM<00:03:19.799> card

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.720 
data and if you want remove the SIM card
you<00:03:20.340> have<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.420> slide<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:21.900> towards<00:03:22.230> left<00:03:22.830> ass

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
you have to slide it towards left ass

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.580 
you have to slide it towards left ass
little<00:03:24.239> slide<00:03:24.510> towards<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:25.080> side<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.470> it

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
little slide towards that side and it

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.860 
little slide towards that side and it
pops<00:03:25.799> up<00:03:26.040> then<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.430> can<00:03:26.640> drag<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:27.000> out<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.570> put

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
pops up then you can drag it out to put

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.170 
pops up then you can drag it out to put
your<00:03:28.019> micro<00:03:28.290> sim<00:03:28.500> inside<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.160> then<00:03:29.850> once

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
your micro sim inside and then once

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.330 
your micro sim inside and then once
you're<00:03:30.510> done<00:03:30.540> with<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.860> can<00:03:31.890> just<00:03:32.040> put

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
you're done with that you can just put

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.729 
you're done with that you can just put
it<00:03:32.430> back<00:03:32.459> in<00:03:33.019> slide<00:03:34.019> it<00:03:34.049> towards<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.620> right

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
it back in slide it towards the right

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.940 
it back in slide it towards the right
little<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.340> then<00:03:35.880> shut<00:03:36.390> this<00:03:36.510> off<00:03:36.950> very

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
little and then shut this off very

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.550 
little and then shut this off very
elegant<00:03:38.489> it<00:03:38.760> does<00:03:39.450> make<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.840> n9<00:03:40.140> look<00:03:40.350> very

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
elegant it does make the n9 look very

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.819 
elegant it does make the n9 look very
pretty<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.750> since<00:03:42.750> there's<00:03:42.989> no<00:03:43.049> removable

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
pretty and since there's no removable

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.020 
pretty and since there's no removable
battery<00:03:44.220> or<00:03:44.549> anything

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
battery or anything

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.690 
battery or anything
the<00:03:45.570> n9<00:03:46.019> is<00:03:46.230> just<00:03:46.470> one<00:03:46.709> solid<00:03:47.340> piece<00:03:47.519> of

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
the n9 is just one solid piece of

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.210 
the n9 is just one solid piece of
monoblock<00:03:48.420> there's<00:03:48.810> nothing<00:03:49.260> there's<00:03:49.500> so

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
monoblock there's nothing there's so

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.160 
monoblock there's nothing there's so
therefore<00:03:50.549> there's<00:03:50.700> no<00:03:50.760> creaks<00:03:51.269> nothing<00:03:51.930> and

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
therefore there's no creaks nothing and

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.729 
therefore there's no creaks nothing and
it<00:03:52.260> just<00:03:52.650> looks<00:03:52.890> very<00:03:53.280> very<00:03:53.640> pretty

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.380 

keeping<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.860> n9<00:03:59.160> aside<00:03:59.549> for<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.820> second<00:04:00.209> let's

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
keeping the n9 aside for a second let's

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.130 
keeping the n9 aside for a second let's
see<00:04:00.570> what<00:04:00.750> else<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.230> inside<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.709> box<00:04:04.370> a

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
see what else is inside the box a

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.560 
see what else is inside the box a
separator<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.500> then<00:04:07.560> we<00:04:08.010> have<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.549> few<00:04:09.239> guides

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
separator and then we have a few guides

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.449 
separator and then we have a few guides
which<00:04:09.959> nobody<00:04:10.410> will<00:04:10.590> probably<00:04:10.920> even<00:04:11.100> look<00:04:11.280> at

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
which nobody will probably even look at

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.789
