two or three tubs a month you can hit
all<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> times<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> number<00:00:43.829> one<00:00:44.070> most

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
all the times so the number one most

important time to take your whey protein

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.500 
important time to take your whey protein
shake<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.879> immediately<00:00:47.879> following<00:00:48.450> your

workout and why this is so important is

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.930 
workout and why this is so important is
you<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.199> spent<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.680> know<00:00:52.710> an<00:00:52.920> hour<00:00:53.070> killing

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
a very slow digesting protein so what

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
a very slow digesting protein so what
it's<00:01:41.189> going<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.400> do<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.729> you're<00:01:41.909> going<00:01:42.030> to
