00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.740 
my website guitar by Quentin dot-com and
I<00:00:26.189> thought<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.700> put<00:00:26.970> together<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.510> quick

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
I thought I put together this quick

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.330 
I thought I put together this quick
lesson<00:00:28.279> well<00:00:29.509> for<00:00:30.509> two<00:00:30.660> purposes<00:00:31.080> really<00:00:31.650> just

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
lesson well for two purposes really just

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.460 
lesson well for two purposes really just
to<00:00:32.489> show<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.030> Triads<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.960> top<00:00:34.200> three

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
to show you the Triads and the top three

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.740 
to show you the Triads and the top three
strings<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.220> that<00:00:35.640> how<00:00:35.910> they<00:00:36.150> work<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
strings and that how they work and the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.470 
strings and that how they work and the
theory<00:00:37.050> behind<00:00:37.200> them<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.800> then<00:00:38.430> also<00:00:38.640> what<00:00:39.449> I

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
theory behind them and then also what I

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.360 
theory behind them and then also what I
would<00:00:39.780> suggest<00:00:39.989> doing<00:00:40.290> whenever<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.160> learn<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
would suggest doing whenever you learn a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.750 
would suggest doing whenever you learn a
voicing<00:00:41.970> that's<00:00:42.120> new<00:00:42.330> to<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.040> a<00:00:44.040> few

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
voicing that's new to you and a few

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.340 
voicing that's new to you and a few
ideas<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.300> what<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.600> can<00:00:45.780> do<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> new

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
ideas of what you can do with a new

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.860 
ideas of what you can do with a new
voicing<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.070> get<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.699> into<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:48.089> playing<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
voicing to get it into your playing and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.320 
voicing to get it into your playing and
to<00:00:49.559> kind<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.800> open<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.820> up<00:00:50.940> more<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
to kind of open it up more and

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.530 
to kind of open it up more and
experiment<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:52.080> it<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.309> first<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.699> all<00:00:53.790> let's

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
experiment with it so first of all let's

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.850 
experiment with it so first of all let's
look<00:00:54.600> at<00:00:54.750> these<00:00:54.870> little<00:00:55.049> these<00:00:55.530> are<00:00:55.710> cool

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
look at these little these are cool

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.219 
look at these little these are cool
closed<00:00:56.280> voice<00:00:56.640> triads<00:00:57.210> closed<00:00:57.629> voice<00:00:57.930> means

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
closed voice triads closed voice means

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.149 
closed voice triads closed voice means
there's<00:00:58.530> no<00:00:58.739> open<00:00:59.580> strings<00:01:00.019> in<00:01:01.019> when<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
there's no open strings in when in a

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.579 
there's no open strings in when in a
particular<00:01:02.489> chord<00:01:03.000> or<00:01:03.210> cluster<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.170> if<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.379> take

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
particular chord or cluster so if I take

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.090 
particular chord or cluster so if I take
a<00:01:04.619> deep<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.159> little<00:01:05.489> basic<00:01:06.180> D<00:01:06.330> chord<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.409> I'm

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
a deep this little basic D chord and I'm

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.000 
a deep this little basic D chord and I'm
just<00:01:08.280> taking<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> top<00:01:08.909> three<00:01:09.240> strings

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
just taking the top three strings

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.590 
just taking the top three strings
I'll<00:01:11.010> see<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.460> there's<00:01:11.610> no<00:01:11.760> open<00:01:12.180> open

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
I'll see that there's no open open

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.370 
I'll see that there's no open open
string<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.229> closed<00:01:13.530> voice<00:01:14.479> also<00:01:15.479> every

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
string so it's closed voice also every

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.960 
string so it's closed voice also every
little<00:01:16.680> chord<00:01:16.950> or<00:01:17.130> triad<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.549> made<00:01:17.729> up<00:01:17.850> of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
little chord or triad is made up of

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.020 
little chord or triad is made up of
three<00:01:18.299> notes<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.869> one<00:01:19.080> three<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.530> five

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
three notes the one three and five

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.660 
three notes the one three and five
indeed<00:01:21.030> my<00:01:21.299> ones<00:01:21.540> D<00:01:21.900> my<00:01:22.590> three<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.010> f-sharp<00:01:23.220> my

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
indeed my ones D my three is f-sharp my

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.770 
indeed my ones D my three is f-sharp my
fives<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:25.789> if<00:01:26.789> I<00:01:26.850> took<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.090> look<00:01:27.240> at<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.570> I'd

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
fives a so if I took a look at this I'd

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.719 
fives a so if I took a look at this I'd
see<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.079> a<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.439> actually<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.159> lowest<00:01:29.310> note

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
see that a is actually the lowest note

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.569 
see that a is actually the lowest note
in<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.060> chord<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.679> I<00:01:31.890> would<00:01:32.159> call<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.399> a

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
in this chord and so I would call that a

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.219 
in this chord and so I would call that a
D<00:01:33.270> try<00:01:33.829> with<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.859> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> bass<00:01:35.750> which<00:01:36.750> makes<00:01:37.020> it

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
D try with a in the bass which makes it

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.029 
D try with a in the bass which makes it
a<00:01:37.320> D<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.909> second<00:01:39.869> inversion<00:01:40.789> all<00:01:41.789> right

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
a D in in in second inversion all right

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.120 
a D in in in second inversion all right
if<00:01:44.039> I<00:01:44.310> were<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.640> jumble<00:01:45.090> those<00:01:45.299> notes<00:01:45.659> around

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
if I were to jumble those notes around

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.789 
if I were to jumble those notes around
the<00:01:47.760> one<00:01:47.939> three<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.330> five<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.990> put<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> one

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the one three and five and put the one

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.649 
the one three and five and put the one
in<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> base<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.580> could<00:01:51.030> play<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.450> just

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
in the base I could play it just

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.420 
in the base I could play it just
remember<00:01:52.439> we're<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.619> doing<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> top

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
remember we're just doing it on the top

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.800 
remember we're just doing it on the top
three<00:01:53.700> strings<00:01:54.020> there<00:01:55.020> I've<00:01:55.110> got<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.380> shape<00:01:55.710> now

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
three strings there I've got a shape now

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.520 
three strings there I've got a shape now
with<00:01:57.810> my<00:01:58.500> D<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.700> base<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:01.140> I've<00:02:01.259> got

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
with my D in the base and then I've got

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.350 
with my D in the base and then I've got
my<00:02:01.560> my<00:02:02.460> three<00:02:03.619> which<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.770> my<00:02:04.920> F<00:02:05.130> sharp<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.700> then

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
my my three which is my F sharp and then

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.840 
my my three which is my F sharp and then
my<00:02:06.509> five<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:07.200> over<00:02:07.500> there<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.550> would<00:02:08.700> be

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
my five a over there so this would be

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.400 
my five a over there so this would be
Indian<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.600> know<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.750> could<00:02:09.929> call<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.229> root

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
Indian you know I could call it root

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.130 
Indian you know I could call it root
position

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
position

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.320 
position
all<00:02:12.380> right<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.830> then<00:02:13.400> I'm<00:02:13.580> going<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.000> have<00:02:14.210> my

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
all right and then I'm going to have my

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.370 
all right and then I'm going to have my
next<00:02:14.570> shape<00:02:14.750> over<00:02:15.470> here<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.780> that's<00:02:18.050> got<00:02:18.260> the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
next shape over here and that's got the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.840 
next shape over here and that's got the
third<00:02:18.620> in<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.950> base<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:19.400> it's<00:02:19.490> in<00:02:19.640> first

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
third in the base so it's in first

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.660 
third in the base so it's in first
inversion<00:02:20.270> of<00:02:20.600> them<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.740> there's<00:02:21.920> my<00:02:22.130> one<00:02:22.400> at

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
inversion of them so there's my one at

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.470 
inversion of them so there's my one at
the<00:02:23.000> tenth<00:02:23.300> fret<00:02:23.600> there's<00:02:24.260> my<00:02:24.710> five<00:02:25.480> also

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
the tenth fret there's my five also

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.360 
the tenth fret there's my five also
tenth<00:02:26.750> fret<00:02:26.990> second<00:02:27.410> string<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.920> there's<00:02:28.130> my

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
tenth fret second string and there's my

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.840 
tenth fret second string and there's my
three<00:02:28.810> my<00:02:29.810> F<00:02:30.020> shop

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
three my F shop

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.980 
three my F shop
so<00:02:31.850> that's<00:02:32.060> eleventh<00:02:32.960> fret<00:02:33.170> third<00:02:33.680> string<00:02:34.990> so

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
so that's eleventh fret third string so

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.900 
so that's eleventh fret third string so
I've<00:02:36.080> got<00:02:36.230> these<00:02:36.380> 3d<00:02:37.100> shapes<00:02:37.490> that<00:02:37.700> we've

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
I've got these 3d shapes that we've

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
I've got these 3d shapes that we've
learnt<00:02:38.120> now<00:02:38.740> and<00:02:40.150> they're<00:02:41.150> all<00:02:41.270> movable<00:02:41.810> so

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
learnt now and they're all movable so

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.660 
learnt now and they're all movable so
you<00:02:42.020> can<00:02:42.170> play<00:02:42.320> them<00:02:42.500> all<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.860> way<00:02:43.010> up<00:02:45.670> all

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
you can play them all the way up all

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.310 
you can play them all the way up all
right<00:02:46.820> so<00:02:47.000> what<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.209> suggest<00:02:47.870> doing<00:02:47.959> is

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
right so what I suggest doing is

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.870 
right so what I suggest doing is
whenever<00:02:48.590> learning<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.040> shape<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.550> to<00:02:49.670> be<00:02:49.760> able

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
whenever learning a shape is to be able

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.699 
whenever learning a shape is to be able
to<00:02:50.090> make<00:02:50.270> it<00:02:50.450> you<00:02:50.930> know<00:02:51.020> figure<00:02:51.410> out<00:02:51.470> how<00:02:51.620> to

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
to make it you know figure out how to

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.229 
to make it you know figure out how to
make<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:52.100> minor<00:02:52.520> and<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:55.280> make<00:02:55.459> each<00:02:55.760> one<00:02:55.820> of

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
make that minor and to make each one of

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.000 
make that minor and to make each one of
these<00:02:56.330> shapes<00:02:56.630> minor<00:02:56.959> is<00:02:57.170> easy<00:02:57.440> all<00:02:57.739> you<00:02:57.770> have

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
these shapes minor is easy all you have

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.190 
these shapes minor is easy all you have
to<00:02:58.100> do<00:02:58.220> is<00:02:58.310> drop<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.700> third<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.720> third<00:02:59.989> and

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
to do is drop the third the third and

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.740 
to do is drop the third the third and
deer's<00:03:00.440> F<00:03:00.709> sharp<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.489> all<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.970> F<00:03:02.090> shops<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.600> have

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
deer's F sharp so all the F shops I have

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.100 
deer's F sharp so all the F shops I have
to<00:03:02.900> just<00:03:03.140> flatten<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.860> by<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.070> half<00:03:04.310> step<00:03:05.020> so<00:03:06.020> if

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
to just flatten it by a half step so if

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.930 
to just flatten it by a half step so if
I<00:03:06.200> drop<00:03:06.410> that<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.650> half<00:03:06.920> step<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.280> get<00:03:07.459> that

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
I drop that a half step I get that

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.590 
I drop that a half step I get that
so<00:03:08.570> there's<00:03:08.750> D<00:03:08.989> minor<00:03:10.000> with<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.120> fifth<00:03:11.360> in<00:03:11.480> the

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
so there's D minor with the fifth in the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.729 
so there's D minor with the fifth in the
base<00:03:11.950> all<00:03:12.950> right<00:03:13.480> next<00:03:14.480> one<00:03:14.810> take<00:03:15.380> that<00:03:15.530> F

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
base all right next one take that F

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.350 
base all right next one take that F
sharp<00:03:15.770> drop<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:17.049> so<00:03:18.049> there's<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.350> D<00:03:18.620> minor<00:03:19.360> with

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
sharp drop it so there's a D minor with

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.560 
sharp drop it so there's a D minor with
D<00:03:20.570> in<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.810> base<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.320> then<00:03:22.310> our<00:03:23.120> next<00:03:23.299> little

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
D in the base and then our next little

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.160 
D in the base and then our next little
shape<00:03:23.930> drop<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.410> third<00:03:25.600> all<00:03:26.600> right<00:03:26.780> so

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
shape drop the third all right so

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.100 
shape drop the third all right so
there's<00:03:27.380> D<00:03:27.620> minor<00:03:27.890> with<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.330> flat<00:03:29.810> third

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
there's D minor with the the flat third

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.990 
there's D minor with the the flat third
and<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.410> best<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:31.190> that<00:03:31.340> still<00:03:31.610> makes<00:03:31.820> it

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
and the best so that still makes it

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.820 
and the best so that still makes it
there<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:32.630> know<00:03:32.750> in<00:03:32.959> being<00:03:33.440> in<00:03:33.560> first

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
there you know in being in first

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.789 
there you know in being in first
inversion<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:35.180> root<00:03:35.360> position<00:03:35.799> first

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
inversion so root position first

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.259 
inversion so root position first
inversion<00:03:37.900> second<00:03:38.900> inversion<00:03:39.880> great<00:03:40.880> so<00:03:41.120> that

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
inversion second inversion great so that

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.210 
inversion second inversion great so that
was<00:03:41.390> an<00:03:41.480> example<00:03:41.780> of<00:03:41.959> an<00:03:42.080> open<00:03:42.290> void<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:43.100> a

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
was an example of an open void of a

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.400 
was an example of an open void of a
closed<00:03:43.730> voice<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:44.269> he<00:03:44.390> closed<00:03:44.660> voice<00:03:44.959> try<00:03:45.350> it

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
closed voice so he closed voice try it

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.120 
closed voice so he closed voice try it
an<00:03:46.130> example<00:03:46.459> of<00:03:46.640> an<00:03:46.760> open<00:03:46.970> voice<00:03:47.330> I<00:03:47.920> could<00:03:48.920> do

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
an example of an open voice I could do

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.350 
an example of an open voice I could do
this<00:03:49.370> let's<00:03:49.790> see<00:03:51.190> so<00:03:52.190> I<00:03:52.610> could<00:03:53.120> for<00:03:53.330> example

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
this let's see so I could for example

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.020 
this let's see so I could for example
take<00:03:53.720> my<00:03:54.110> D<00:03:56.170> at<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.410> third<00:03:57.709> third<00:03:58.400> fret<00:03:58.640> second

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
take my D at the third third fret second

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.140 
take my D at the third third fret second
string<00:03:59.060> and<00:03:59.620> take<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.830> fifth<00:04:01.100> of<00:04:01.310> D<00:04:01.489> which<00:04:02.120> is

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
string and take the fifth of D which is

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.780 
string and take the fifth of D which is
is<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:05.350> then<00:04:06.350> put<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.890> third<00:04:07.250> in<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.580> bass

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
is a and then put the third in the bass

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.130 
is a and then put the third in the bass
but<00:04:08.720> now<00:04:08.900> I'm<00:04:09.820> I'm<00:04:10.820> skipping<00:04:11.329> a<00:04:11.570> string

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
but now I'm I'm skipping a string

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.479 
but now I'm I'm skipping a string
because<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.560> third<00:04:12.799> I'm<00:04:13.010> playing<00:04:13.250> on<00:04:13.400> the

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
because the third I'm playing on the

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.120 
because the third I'm playing on the
fourth<00:04:13.760> string<00:04:13.880> I'm<00:04:14.750> leaving<00:04:15.290> out<00:04:15.440> there's<00:04:15.920> no

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
fourth string I'm leaving out there's no

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.710 
fourth string I'm leaving out there's no
notes<00:04:16.400> being<00:04:16.669> played<00:04:16.729> on<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.180> third<00:04:17.419> string

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
notes being played on the third string

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.229 
notes being played on the third string
all<00:04:18.590> right<00:04:18.829> and<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.220> have<00:04:19.459> a<00:04:19.489> note<00:04:19.729> on<00:04:19.970> the

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
all right and I have a note on the

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.300 
all right and I have a note on the
second<00:04:20.750> in<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:20.870> first<00:04:21.080> so<00:04:21.560> I<00:04:21.590> have<00:04:21.799> that<00:04:21.950> gap

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
second in the first so I have that gap

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.550 
second in the first so I have that gap
between<00:04:22.520> these<00:04:23.060> strings<00:04:23.479> so<00:04:24.020> that's<00:04:24.200> an<00:04:24.380> open

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
between these strings so that's an open

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.620 
between these strings so that's an open
voice<00:04:25.240> D<00:04:26.240> major<00:04:26.450> chord<00:04:27.460> so<00:04:28.460> if<00:04:28.610> someone<00:04:29.539> is

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
voice D major chord so if someone is

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.060 
voice D major chord so if someone is
just<00:04:29.780> showing<00:04:29.960> you<00:04:30.140> this<00:04:30.289> chord<00:04:30.590> if<00:04:30.740> this<00:04:30.890> was

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
when I when someone showed me cause like

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.990 
when I when someone showed me cause like
that<00:06:15.840> oh<00:06:15.870> yeah<00:06:16.530> I<00:06:16.950> just<00:06:17.070> didn't<00:06:17.490> do<00:06:17.640> much<00:06:17.790> with

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
that oh yeah I just didn't do much with

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.820 
that oh yeah I just didn't do much with
it<00:06:18.090> we're<00:06:18.300> now<00:06:18.510> I<00:06:18.540> use<00:06:18.990> them<00:06:19.200> because<00:06:19.470> like<00:06:19.650> now

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
it we're now I use them because like now

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.890 
it we're now I use them because like now
I<00:06:19.860> can<00:06:20.040> see<00:06:20.520> how<00:06:20.700> they<00:06:20.880> relate<00:06:21.210> to<00:06:21.240> the<00:06:21.540> scale

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
I can see how they relate to the scale

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.770 
I can see how they relate to the scale
and<00:06:22.830> then<00:06:23.190> also<00:06:23.490> they<00:06:23.760> fun<00:06:24.120> to<00:06:24.300> make<00:06:24.450> licks

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
and then also they fun to make licks

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.770 
and then also they fun to make licks
with<00:06:24.870> with<00:06:25.230> with<00:06:25.470> chords<00:06:25.910> so<00:06:26.910> for<00:06:27.090> example<00:06:27.480> if

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
with with with chords so for example if

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.950 
with with with chords so for example if
I<00:06:27.900> go<00:06:28.020> to<00:06:28.080> the<00:06:28.230> four<00:06:28.500> and<00:06:28.530> the<00:06:28.740> five<00:06:28.800> chord<00:06:29.430> then

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
I go to the four and the five chord then

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.300
