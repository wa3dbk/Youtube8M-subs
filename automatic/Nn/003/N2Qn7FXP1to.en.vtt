00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.390
 two 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.460
 when you ask for telepizza you just want that 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.380
 telepizza arrives the wait is over 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.360
 now we bring you the new three pizza 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.630
 floors by 795 if I think that 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.910
 it's an important week because 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.760
 there are few games left, there are fewer 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.520
 margin of error and that in a week 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:39.060
 we have three then of course it is 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.740
 important we hope we have some good 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.690
 matches and 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.510
 and follow the line to follow wanting 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.720
 win continue to want to improve each 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.050
 day and that's what we're looking for today I think 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.740
 that is normal so many games played 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.170
 so many minutes I think there are moments in 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.260
 that one is worse there are moments 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.670
 that are better but I think that 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.470
 to the final straight we arrive with a lot 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.810
 illusion with the objective of extracting the most 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.550
 possible points and to fight until the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.710
 last minute for being in a position 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.950
 up on the table well I think that 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.520
 same in the last two games I've 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.870
 been a little 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.150
 more tired a little I have lacked that 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.910
 if it's so many times just having 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.150
 but I think it 's nothing important 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.580
 we keep working we keep trying 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.640
 continue in the good line all year 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.480
 and I will work for that to contribute to 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.120
 my team the maximum possible and what 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.470
 and that together we can add and search 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.360
 the goal that is to continue in europe and 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.390
 continue to give war to all teams 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.480
 it's nice after all the year so 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.400
 well we've had so many 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.760
 moments 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.280
 the unforgettable moments not normal 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.670
 for the club I think it ends well 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.550
 way would be to close a great year and hopefully and 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.800
 we can achieve it we are going to work for 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.090
 to get it is complicated but I think 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.840
 what 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.990
 the three of us who are a little bit out there 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.850
 anything can happen but what 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.430
 what we want is to focus on our 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.670
 I work on going 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.010
 at this moment almería and take our 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.890
 good result already after it does not depend on 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.560
 we already if the others lose or win 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.790
 no longer depends on us I think there 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.090
 to focus on doing well our 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.430
 I work to give my best every game and 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.120
 at the end of the season we'll see 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.920
 where he gave us our clear work is 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.590
 important obviously we know that 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.250
 champions every year is very complicated 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.459
 for removing 23 equipment for others 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.069
 it's almost impossible to always stay there 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.900
 but make it a habit that the real 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.389
 always be fighting for the positions of 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.980
 up I think it's something that either 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.930
 I would have signed a few years ago 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.349
 will go more down than for 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.310
 above 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:17.500
 now being in a position is of 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.569
 europe do that europe I think it's a 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.939
 great step in the club and hopefully we can 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.700
 keep that line for a long time 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.240
 yes i think that 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.290
 that would be a success because 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.080
 normally teams that are not 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.520
 used to playing in Europe when 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.270
 enter europe always tend to suffer 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.790
 by the league of permanence and we 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.190
 we keep fighting for europe we got to 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.430
 be the cup final and in champions not 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.430
 It was like we wanted but we also fight 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:52.140
 I think it 's a great year and culminate with 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.940
 europe would be very positive but staying 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.750
 10 games we still want to fight for 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.209
 something else and see how far we can if 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.390
 it is complicated because they are other objectives 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.850
 but but equally important I think that 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.940
 in this case the almería already showed that 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:12.000
 at home he is strong he won the athletic of 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.440
 madrid that are playing a lot and go 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.940
 to go to death but I think also 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.480
 we have to go with the same 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:22.000
 mentality and go out 100% 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.560
 and to try to make our football and I 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.240
 I think that starting from that base we can 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.460
 have options to get a result 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.990
 positive at this time those who 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.420
 we are closer I tell you about 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.860
 electric for you bilbao villarreal and 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.870
 us but we already know that sevilla 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.480
 is doing a great year yesterday from another 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.860
 show that it is a great team and 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.710
 that will fight to the end I think that 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.470
 all the equipment we want the best for 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.570
 each one and we will fight for 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.620
 get the most is not time 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:56.920
 I'm still not thinking of any 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.190
 side I think what 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:03.870
 What I should do is focus on the real 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.640
 that is where I am and where where better 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.760
 I'm going through this moment and finish 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.430
 well already in summer when the 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.440
 moment of the transfers that will be seen that 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.920
 the best option for me for the 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:22.840
 club and we will make a decision at the moment 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:25.660
 I'm focused here and I want to finish 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.370
 good way the year and helping her to 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.980
 real to be in europe 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.760
 obviously help helps because he wants 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:36.070
 say that the club has more goals 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.360
 tall and that is doing a good 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:42.960
 work but I think that also the 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.960
 been in europe 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.330
 it's something that we win and if 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.500
 we are in europe is that we are well and 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.840
 that there will always be options but 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.000
 I'm like you repeat something that we do not 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.419
 it does not make us nervous or take away the 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.100
 dream and that we only think about the real one in 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.100
 make a good year and finish well
