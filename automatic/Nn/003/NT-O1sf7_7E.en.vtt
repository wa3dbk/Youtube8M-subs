00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.070
 the frame of all eyes will always be 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.180
 eyebrows and eyelashes and in this 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.520
 occasion we are going to make an evaluation 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.470
 staff of what they represent 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.980
 masks to lend the only thing I've 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.630
 managed to discover so maybe for you 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.060
 give us a discovery but for me if 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.590
 is that because of my type of lashes 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.419
 all my lashes will have to be to 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.180
 water base one because in the state 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.340
 Where I live there is a lot of heat then 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.520
 I always tend to close very strong 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.040
 eyes are carved me melos and with something that 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.800
 not be based on water very surely it 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.329
 I will not just that nobody likes the 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.449
 raccoon most of my time 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.429
 always use the bayamÃ³n that are 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.559
 that they were being like that 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.179
 tradition in the family one because it 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.579
 supposed to be based on products 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:54.190
 natural like mamey bone or bone 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.140
 of avocado that is supposed to nourish 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.570
 good eyelashes are not supposed if you nourish them 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.290
 however not all are proof of 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.090
 water and that for me it was a problem 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.950
 as you are already aware of access 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.630
 independent gets his own things 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.360
 gave me the task of getting a good 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.200
 mask and the first one that I bought was this 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.840
 of maybelline very black 3 more times 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.450
 This was about two years has the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.830
 I bought and still the bus or these 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.280
 I love products because they last 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.490
 quite and that I think for how is 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.490
 the economy 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.770
 anyone can become fascinated 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.930
 well it is 33 times more volume is a 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.290
 water proof and it is the first mask 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.760
 that I marvel all over the planet 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.820
 comes when these bristles that even 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.760
 some are already like that you break and what 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.340
 yes I'm not going to lie to you either 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.070
 more than you are already just running out 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.570
 but when it's an event you already know that 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.340
 the oil for the dream and mouth and not so much 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.440
 well but when you see near or not it's 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.230
 nothing important has lost I paint 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.720
 the tabs and I do it with this is 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.620
 orange and here I had a colored stripe 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.930
 blue 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.710
 obviously it symbolizes that it is proof of 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.649
 Water 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.990
 after it was being spent I left 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.940
 I surprise myself not take my mascara 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.580
 or mask for eyelashes as you want 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.540
 tell him and I bought this one from 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.510
 false eyelashes express volume against 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.569
 water that is the same mailing 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.870
 What can I say about her? I'm 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.299
 disillusioned yes it is true leaves you a 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.890
 eyelash much longer but if you 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.780
 You are from people like me who use 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.329
 the curler because unfortunately the 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.549
 nature I do not give you a kind lash 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.950
 sunflower that is looking at the sky as 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.319
 This is not your mask because because you 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.569
 the raisin to continue devoting you to curl 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.470
 the eyelash and I surprise you 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.910
 use is 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:00.330
 and despite the fact that despite 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.190
 brush is curved as soon as you get off 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.950
 that is to say when this falls and you 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.700
 tab is already down on other 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.100
 holiday again I forget my mascara 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.080
 I go to another store and there was no water 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:18.890
 but it had been colossal 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:23.110
 there was this colossal that is powerful black 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:27.200
 and oh real surprise not to be dry water 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.150
 it dries very very slowly and this and does what 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.340
 same works the tabs then you 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.200
 leaves them bushy and more but down 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.390
 then it does not serve much or at least for 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.730
 I do not use much of all the masks 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.250
 that I have of maybelline is that I'm going 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.920
 to show would be the same ridge 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.010
 In between, the only difference is that 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.870
 This is waterproof and I have been 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.040
 fascinated dry of flying without being the 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:55.340
 product so totally thick or dry 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.940
 in fact he paints only what is necessary and 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.220
 then that makes it ideal because in a 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.230
 two by three is dry which helps 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.050
 that if you laugh your eyelashes 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.990
 keep up then that 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.540
 combine this product with wine with this 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.410
 this when it is dry only me 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.510
 applied this senate at the tips for 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.239
 all these masks are in a 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.900
 average between 150 Mexican pesos and 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.360
 the 200 pesos another mascara that was my 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.880
 sister the city of mexico and he devoted himself 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.310
 you know how to shop and so he brought me 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:35.969
 this mascara elongated this mascara lengthener 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:40.020
 says no more false eyelashes 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:41.849
 of 20 in samborns hardly 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.940
 Well honestly I do not think what 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:48.000
 I bought assembly but this one 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.420
 caught is a brush 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.490
 it's very liquid, it tends to come down a little 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.410
 the tabs but nevertheless it gives you a 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.930
 good finish I was surprised with 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.220
 this because it takes you away more skinny 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.830
 which means that he leaves them to you 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.720
 much more natural then when 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.050
 are not events that are very important to me 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.390
 I put this however the only bad thing is 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.580
 that this is not water proof then 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.860
 if it looks like winner of between 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.530
 these two this for being waterproof 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.550
 and it costs you this one will have cost I think 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.650
 about 30 pesos and it costs you 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.500
 150 to 200 pesos according to the super to which 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.169
 go then then if you are walking by 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.870
 the street and you come across a 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:34.020
 promotion like this I think you're going to 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:37.020
 be happy this mask what you have is 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.200
 a formula with collagen plus brush 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.240
 colossal seven times more volume 24 hours 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.000
 of duration you dare 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.610
 the truth that this yes is true 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.979
 they last me 24 I do not use 24 hours 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.930
 firm, but what about me? 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.340
 8 o'clock in the morning, 10 o'clock in the morning 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.200
 night and another I'm already clinging 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.270
 taking away the 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.040
 and the product which for me does 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.930
 very viable because many times I do not have 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.630
 time not even come to eat at my 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.760
 house and then it is wonderful person to 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.950
 definitive this would be the big winner 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.780
 for being waterproof by drying 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.470
 fast and keep your eyelashes like 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.730
 tours 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.740
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.600

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.850
 day

 he is animated
