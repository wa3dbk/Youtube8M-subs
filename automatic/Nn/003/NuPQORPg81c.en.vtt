now<00:00:11.880> dehydration<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.840> food<00:00:13.110> preservation

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
now dehydration is a food preservation

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.440 
now dehydration is a food preservation
process<00:00:14.040> that's<00:00:14.490> been<00:00:14.639> practiced<00:00:15.150> all<00:00:15.330> the

environments the process of dehydration

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.269 
environments the process of dehydration
is<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.840> remove<00:00:31.170> as<00:00:31.380> much<00:00:31.560> moisture<00:00:31.949> as

the moisture out of the food and you

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.290 
the moisture out of the food and you
need<00:00:58.289> time<00:00:58.609> there<00:00:59.609> are<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.789> variety<00:00:59.940> of

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
need time there are a variety of

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.060 
need time there are a variety of
techniques<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.170> leverage<00:01:01.500> all<00:01:01.710> three<00:01:01.980> of

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
techniques that leverage all three of

techniques that leverage all three of
those

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
those

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.840 
those
the<00:01:03.180> first<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.750> sun<00:01:03.989> drying<00:01:04.290> by<00:01:05.129> placing<00:01:05.729> the

the first is sun drying by placing the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.730 
the first is sun drying by placing the
food<00:01:06.030> items<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> tray<00:01:06.960> covering<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.619> with<00:01:07.680> a

cheesecloth and setting it out in the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.679 
cheesecloth and setting it out in the
Sun<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:11.040> successfully<00:01:11.689> dehydrate

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
Sun you can successfully dehydrate

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.560 
Sun you can successfully dehydrate
fruits<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.740> vegetables<00:01:14.460> one<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.509> the

fruits and vegetables one of the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.719 
fruits and vegetables one of the
challenges<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.290> Sun<00:01:16.740> drying<00:01:17.070> those<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.580> need

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
challenges to Sun drying those you need

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.070 
challenges to Sun drying those you need
to<00:01:17.850> make<00:01:18.000> sure<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.509> right<00:01:18.689> humidity

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
to make sure that the right humidity

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.109 
to make sure that the right humidity
level<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.799> there<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.610> can<00:01:20.759> extract

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
level is there so that you can extract

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.789 
level is there so that you can extract
the<00:01:21.240> moisture<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.990> also<00:01:22.259> need<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.680> know

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the moisture and you also need to know

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.109 
the moisture and you also need to know
in<00:01:23.100> advance<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.610> you're<00:01:23.820> going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:23.970> have

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
in advance that you're going to have

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.530 
in advance that you're going to have
enough<00:01:24.590> consecutive<00:01:25.590> warm<00:01:26.009> days<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:27.299> for

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
enough consecutive warm days so for

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.569 
enough consecutive warm days so for
example<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.290> typically<00:01:28.650> need<00:01:28.799> somewhere<00:01:29.520> in

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
example you typically need somewhere in

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.719 
example you typically need somewhere in
the<00:01:29.640> neighborhood<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.000> 3<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.540> 5<00:01:30.780> days<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:32.130> 95

to 100 degrees temperature a second
option<00:01:35.670> for<00:01:35.850> dehydration<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.140> use<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
option for dehydration is to use the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.730 
option for dehydration is to use the
oven<00:01:37.939> you<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.150> place<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.600> food<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.350> oven

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
oven you can place the food in the oven

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.639 
oven you can place the food in the oven
and<00:01:41.150> dehydrate<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.180> at<00:01:42.509> about<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> hundred<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and dehydrate it at about a hundred and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.010 
and dehydrate it at about a hundred and
forty<00:01:43.979> degrees<00:01:44.460> temperature<00:01:44.970> now<00:01:45.540> one<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
forty degrees temperature now one of the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.620 
forty degrees temperature now one of the
challenges<00:01:46.560> with<00:01:46.680> oven<00:01:47.299> dehydration<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.479> that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
challenges with oven dehydration is that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.480 
challenges with oven dehydration is that
some<00:01:48.960> ovens<00:01:49.380> don't<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.829> settings<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.430> are

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
some ovens don't have settings that are

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.370 
some ovens don't have settings that are
down<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:51.000> low<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.689> you'll<00:01:51.960> tend<00:01:52.229> to

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
down that low and you'll tend to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.200 
down that low and you'll tend to
overcook<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.100> food<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.610> may<00:01:53.759> lose<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
overcook the food you may lose the
