00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.860
 Hello everyone, at this point we can 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.929
 inoculate the yeast in the must if there is 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.270
 we forgot to activate the 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.670
 leaven patience may be that the 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.010
 fermentation starts a little late not 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.990
 it's a problem we can pay the 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.180
 yeast directly evenly up 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.310
 all the surface of the must without 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.830
 at this point we can mix 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.869
 decide to close the fermenter e 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.210
 wait half an hour so that you 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.280
 I avoid 0 hydrate or pass directly 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.960
 to the oxygenation of the monster 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.300
 obviously if we had already activated the 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.690
 yeast waiting will not be necessary e 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.670
 we will pass directly to oxygenation 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.489
 so we brandi the pallet that will have to 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.129
 be clean and sanitizer and we will mix 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.859
 energetically for a few minutes 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.469
 I usually sony to mix like a 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.510
 crazy for several minutes thanks to reds 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.940
 genoa is the yeast sugars 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.649
 they will begin to reproduce themselves blissfully 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.690
 when oxygen will start to 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.760
 shortage of the mild will begin to 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.620
 transform sugars into alcohol e 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.680
 carbon dioxide 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.690
 this is the only phase in which we must 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.490
 voluntarily giving oxygen to the must 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.550
 in fact during all the phases of the 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.870
 brewing up to bottling 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.600
 it will be necessary to avoid as much as possible 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.910
 doing it this way we will avoid effects 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.680
 oxidative in place that would carry the 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.350
 beer to acquire aromas and flavors 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.990
 unpleasant so we will deal with the 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.000
 our must however once 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.310
 we can close everything oxygenated 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.440
 hermetically the fermenter with the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.690
 lid and fill the gurgling tore 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.270
 with the sanitizer solution up to 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.550
 level indicated by the notches so 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.320
 that rubbish does not enter the must and al 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.810
 at the same time the carbon dioxide produced 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.700
 during fermentation can 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.950
 come out of the burbling cloth itself 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.450
 foiling the danger of explosion of 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.400
 fermenter to put the cap on 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.800
 bubbler is not mandatory 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.130
 let's make sure we didn't tighten too much 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.110
 otherwise carbon dioxide 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.630
 will be able to escape freely e 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.300
 you will notice a worrying swelling 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.430
 of the lid I recommend washing everything 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.440
 what was used immediately after 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.739
 the brewing especially the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.819
 plastic tools to avoid 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.590
 encrustations and reduce the risks of 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.140
 infections in view of the cups 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.239
 following this point before 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.280
 leave fermenting yeasts 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.519
 we have to do the reading 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.000
 of density in jargon we speak of today 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:38.220
 original wealthy initial density this 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.380
 value will provide us with an estimate on 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.130
 concentration of sugars present in the 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.260
 must 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.450
 this operation is carried out using the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.040
 but mÃ©tro we should take a 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.590
 sample of must from the tap of 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.330
 fermenter I usually before 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.239
 open the faucet inside 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.290
 a bit of a sanitizing solution and I'm looking for 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.329
 to drain a little using 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.910
 the appropriate cylinder for the test there 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.459
 we will fill about two thirds 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.780
 we will immerse the dm in much 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.329
 of the whole tree is set for 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.489
 to function properly in liquids 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.859
 temperature of 20 degrees centigrade 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.840
 if the temperature of the must should 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.060
 depart a lot from 20 degrees 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.980
 centigrade a correction should be made 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.220
 reading on the instruction sheet 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.769
 of the dm you should find a table with 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.680
 indicate the corrections to be made to 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.900
 each way the dm will float in the sample 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.299
 of must the numbered mark in 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.819
 correspondence of the point where the dm 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.190
 will surface out of the must indicate 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.410
 just take the density of the must 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.959
 note of this reading will be a point of 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.299
 reference to then check the status 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.459
 of fermentation as well as to make one 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.489
 estimate of the alcohol content of beer 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.470
 when in bottles we pay attention to 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.230
 in order to avoid risks of infections of the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.269
 must when it is picked up for 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.209
 the density reading it will not have to 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.549
 being returned to the fermenter is a 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.760
 small sacrifice must be made for a purpose 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.019
 bigger though you can taste 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.239
 quietly of the must perhaps 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.519
 you will be disappointed by the sweetness from the 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.989
 flatness and from the bitterness that will follow e 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.699
 all normal 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.519
 something that you will have to learn from 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:18.220
 immediately is patience given way to 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.560
 yeast 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.870
 do their initial density job 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.550
 indicative that it should have the must e 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.230
 a value that you should find on 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.360
 instructions or on the label of the 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.400
 jar if your reading of the 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.440
 density should not match not 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.960
 be alarmed if we are talking about two 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.540
 three four points more or less 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.670
 this will not be a problem if instead 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.100
 the discrepancy is greater we can 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.320
 describe two cases in the eventuality in 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.130
 where the density read is higher than 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.810
 as expected 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.730
 it means that the must to a 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.360
 greater sugar concentration than 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.150
 expected 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.320
 vice versa if the density is read 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.180
 lower than necessary 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.640
 probably the must will have one 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.500
 lower concentration of sugars in the 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.620
 first case you could get a beer 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.720
 more alcoholic and more dense or vice versa 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.600
 in the second case you will get a beer 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.700
 less alcoholic and / or less full-bodied 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.740
 eventualities could be caused by 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.470
 a use of sugar amount of 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.419
 water different from those indicated 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.550
 about alcohol many i 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.380
 novice home inspectors 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.960
 they hope to get more beer 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.750
 alcohol using larger amounts 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.180
 of the expected of fermentable I admit of 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.970
 having laughed tempore and shared the same 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.740
 hope reiterating the concept that with 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.630
 the method of the kit we can not 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.050
 personalize our very own 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.750
 beer 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.840
 however we can increase the quantities 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.940
 Predicted fermentable is discouraged 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.550
 however, exceed the quantities 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.380
 expected as you could get 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.870
 disappointing results 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.380
 for example a beer is more alcoholic but 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.150
 even more dry and inconsistent or 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.490
 a beer in which the must was not 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.630
 properly fermented due to yeasts 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.979
 put under stress 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.290
 so that could result 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.960
 cloying being rich in sugars 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.270
 unfermented this obviously depends 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.550
 also from the type of fermentables adopted 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.100
 so I strongly advise you not to 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.229
 use more sugar 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.610
 of those indicated in the instructions of the 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:18.919
 jar of concentrated must 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.389
 at this point we just have to wait 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.210
 that yeasts do their job 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:25.460
 in the next video we will see what happens 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:32.389
 during the first days of fermentation 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:35.810
 hello can come out of the bar screened 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:37.550
 our things can be healed by that 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:42.860
 but flavors come out 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:44.719
 what does it mean because I have blood and 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.729
 to root one of the taste where I cisco if la 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:47.960
 temperature of the must where you are 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:52.250
 if the natural life show the este 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.629
 depart a lot from the first ones there is one 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.729
 what you need to learn right away 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:58.639
 immediately from the beginning one thing that 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:01.990
 you have a new thing to give way to 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:04.350
 yesterday I compare theirs 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:33.160
 little brother but he will say yes 

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:33.160
