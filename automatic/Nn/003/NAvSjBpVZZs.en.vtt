in my opinion this is the best fusion

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.479 
in my opinion this is the best fusion
rifle<00:00:48.360> out<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.690> all<00:00:48.840> fusion<00:00:49.289> rifles<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.340> is

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
rifle out of all fusion rifles but it is

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.520 
rifle out of all fusion rifles but it is
a<00:00:50.520> completely<00:00:51.180> different<00:00:51.719> fusion<00:00:52.050> rifle<00:00:52.410> it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
a completely different fusion rifle it

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.130 
a completely different fusion rifle it
acts<00:00:52.950> as<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.940> sniper<00:00:54.360> rifle<00:00:54.539> but

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
acts as if it's a sniper rifle but

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.299 
acts as if it's a sniper rifle but

anybody in pvp in one shot it's going to

shot<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.780> same<00:01:52.200> with<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.500> combat<00:01:52.950> site<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.490> I

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
shot and same with the combat site so I

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.880 
shot and same with the combat site so I
had<00:01:53.700> found<00:01:53.970> combat<00:01:54.479> sites<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.350> more<00:01:55.619> useful

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
had found combat sites to be more useful

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.030 
had found combat sites to be more useful
in<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.700> PvP<00:01:57.240> world<00:01:57.479> but<00:01:57.930> for<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> PvE<00:01:58.470> world<00:01:58.829> I

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
in the PvP world but for the PvE world I

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.380 
in the PvP world but for the PvE world I
guess<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.399> all<00:01:59.520> depends<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.060> what<00:02:00.210> kind<00:02:00.240> of

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
guess it all depends on what kind of

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.209 
guess it all depends on what kind of
situation<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.170> are<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.320> whether<00:02:01.920> or<00:02:02.009> not<00:02:02.130> to

with<00:02:31.970> this<00:02:32.120> weapon<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.630> they<00:02:33.050> would<00:02:33.170> add<00:02:33.350> it

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
with this weapon and they would add it

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.440 
with this weapon and they would add it
unflinching<00:02:34.160> just<00:02:34.430> because<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.880> how<00:02:35.030> much<00:02:35.210> the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
unflinching just because of how much the

vanilla<00:03:02.870> rifle<00:03:03.380> is<00:03:03.500> if<00:03:03.830> you're<00:03:03.980> going<00:03:04.100> up

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
against a sniper in the PvP world it

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.260 
against a sniper in the PvP world it
seems<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.860> sniper<00:03:07.220> is<00:03:07.490> at<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.790> advantage

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
seems the sniper is at the advantage

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.030 
seems the sniper is at the advantage
just<00:03:08.480> because<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:09.140> sniper<00:03:09.410> doesn't<00:03:09.920> have<00:03:10.010> a

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
just because the sniper doesn't have a

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.970 
just because the sniper doesn't have a
charge<00:03:10.370> time<00:03:10.640> makes<00:03:11.060> sense<00:03:11.360> yes<00:03:12.050> in<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.770> end<00:03:12.920> I

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
charge time makes sense yes in the end I

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.500 
charge time makes sense yes in the end I
guess<00:03:13.130> it<00:03:13.250> all<00:03:13.340> depends<00:03:13.670> on<00:03:13.760> your<00:03:13.880> dodge<00:03:14.090> skill

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
guess it all depends on your dodge skill

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.540 
guess it all depends on your dodge skill
and<00:03:14.720> also<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.380> sniper<00:03:15.680> skill<00:03:16.190> going<00:03:16.400> up

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
and also the sniper skill going up

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.340 
and also the sniper skill going up
against<00:03:16.940> you<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.360> also<00:03:17.540> has<00:03:17.750> single<00:03:18.110> point

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
against you it also has single point

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.870 
against you it also has single point
sling<00:03:18.620> which<00:03:18.890> allows<00:03:19.160> you<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.370> switch<00:03:19.520> weapons

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
sling which allows you to switch weapons

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.730 
sling which allows you to switch weapons
faster<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:20.840> can<00:03:20.990> move<00:03:21.140> quicker<00:03:21.470> while

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
faster and you can move quicker while

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.380 
faster and you can move quicker while
aiming<00:03:21.950> which<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:22.520> don't<00:03:22.580> really<00:03:22.820> find<00:03:23.150> this

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
aiming which I don't really find this

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.150 
aiming which I don't really find this
perk<00:03:23.660> that<00:03:23.840> useful<00:03:24.230> out<00:03:24.320> of<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.560> three<00:03:24.830> perks

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
perk that useful out of the three perks

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.710 
perk that useful out of the three perks
that<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.400> can<00:03:25.520> choose<00:03:25.730> from<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.270> also<00:03:26.510> has

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
that you can choose from it also has

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.180 
that you can choose from it also has
flared<00:03:27.020> magwell<00:03:27.140> which<00:03:27.709> allows<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.100> to

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
flared magwell which allows you to

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.100 
flared magwell which allows you to
reload<00:03:28.490> the<00:03:28.520> weapon<00:03:28.790> even<00:03:29.180> faster<00:03:29.660> but<00:03:29.990> the

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
reload the weapon even faster but the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.560 
reload the weapon even faster but the
weapon<00:03:30.380> hardy<00:03:30.709> reloads<00:03:31.100> fast<00:03:31.430> enough<00:03:31.790> so<00:03:31.820> this

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
weapon hardy reloads fast enough so this

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.780 
weapon hardy reloads fast enough so this
also<00:03:32.840> isn't<00:03:33.170> my<00:03:33.440> typical<00:03:34.010> choice<00:03:34.250> out<00:03:34.640> of

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
also isn't my typical choice out of

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.580 
also isn't my typical choice out of
these<00:03:34.910> three<00:03:35.030> options<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.990> choice<00:03:36.020> down<00:03:36.410> when

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
these three options the choice down when

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.560 
these three options the choice down when
we<00:03:36.680> go<00:03:36.920> with<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.580> seems<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:38.000> be<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.300> best

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
we go with and it seems to be the best

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.590 
we go with and it seems to be the best
option<00:03:38.840> is<00:03:39.310> sin<00:03:40.310> detz<00:03:40.520> which<00:03:40.940> increases<00:03:41.450> the

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
option is sin detz which increases the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.660 
option is sin detz which increases the
range<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.170> accuracy<00:03:42.620> on<00:03:42.920> this<00:03:43.070> weapon<00:03:43.250> which

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
range and accuracy on this weapon which

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.490 
range and accuracy on this weapon which
is<00:03:43.820> a<00:03:43.850> deadly<00:03:44.390> combination<00:03:44.720> with<00:03:45.110> combat

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
is a deadly combination with combat

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.590 
is a deadly combination with combat
sights<00:03:45.860> lastly<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:46.790> last<00:03:47.000> perk<00:03:47.239> on<00:03:47.450> this

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
sights lastly the last perk on this

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.449 
sights lastly the last perk on this
weapon<00:03:47.780> is<00:03:48.110> hidden<00:03:48.650> ham<00:03:48.860> which<00:03:49.100> gains<00:03:49.340> you

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
weapon is hidden ham which gains you

exactly<00:04:02.690> how<00:04:02.780> those<00:04:02.989> vandals<00:04:03.260> snipers<00:04:03.830> are

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
exactly how those vandals snipers are

exactly how those vandals snipers are
shooting<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:04.610> could<00:04:04.760> probably<00:04:04.940> even<00:04:05.120> confuse

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
shooting you could probably even confuse

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.210 
shooting you could probably even confuse
some<00:04:05.750> other<00:04:05.900> guardians<00:04:06.380> in<00:04:06.500> Patrol<00:04:06.890> or

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
some other guardians in Patrol or

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.160 
some other guardians in Patrol or
wherever<00:04:07.730> if<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:08.420> start<00:04:08.630> shooting<00:04:08.959> at<00:04:09.020> the

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
wherever if you start shooting at the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.270 
wherever if you start shooting at the
other<00:04:09.320> Guardians<00:04:09.709> they're<00:04:09.920> probably<00:04:10.070> like

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
other Guardians they're probably like

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.040 
other Guardians they're probably like
what<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.550> heck<00:04:10.700> where's<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.570> enemy<00:04:11.900> ads

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
what the heck where's the enemy ads

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.320 
what the heck where's the enemy ads
because<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:12.830> works<00:04:13.070> exactly<00:04:13.280> like<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.970> Vandal

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
because it works exactly like the Vandal

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.110 
because it works exactly like the Vandal
snipers<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:14.989> like<00:04:15.350> I<00:04:15.470> said<00:04:15.530> before<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:16.280> is<00:04:16.489> the

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
snipers and like I said before it is the

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.000 
snipers and like I said before it is the
Vandal<00:04:17.510> sniper<00:04:17.750> it's<00:04:18.020> a<00:04:18.080> wire<00:04:18.290> rifle<00:04:18.799> this

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
Vandal sniper it's a wire rifle this

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.070 
Vandal sniper it's a wire rifle this
weapon<00:04:19.400> is<00:04:19.520> amazing<00:04:20.330> it's<00:04:20.510> one<00:04:20.660> of<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.840> three

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
weapon is amazing it's one of the three

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.110 
weapon is amazing it's one of the three
choices<00:04:21.290> that<00:04:21.950> you<00:04:22.100> get<00:04:22.310> from<00:04:22.520> completing

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
choices that you get from completing

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.820 
choices that you get from completing
elder<00:04:23.510> cipher<00:04:23.990> what<00:04:24.260> you<00:04:24.380> get<00:04:24.530> from<00:04:24.680> the

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
elder cipher what you get from the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.900 
elder cipher what you get from the
prison<00:04:25.130> of<00:04:25.190> elders<00:04:25.400> level<00:04:25.850> 35<00:04:26.240> or<00:04:26.570> 34<00:04:27.080> it's<00:04:27.470> see

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.700 
prison of elders level 35 or 34 it's see
seems<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.240> elder<00:04:28.540> cipher<00:04:28.900> drops<00:04:29.290> more

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
seems the elder cipher drops more

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.130 
seems the elder cipher drops more
frequently<00:04:30.220> in<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.940> level<00:04:31.180> 35<00:04:31.600> than<00:04:32.050> the

frequently in the level 35 than the

frequently in the level 35 than the
level<00:04:32.290> 34<00:04:32.830> though<00:04:33.100> so<00:04:33.310> keep<00:04:33.340> that<00:04:33.580> in<00:04:33.760> mind

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
level 34 though so keep that in mind

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
the Queen breakers bow is that it can
