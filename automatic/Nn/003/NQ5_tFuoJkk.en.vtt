00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.730

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.119
 are very good today I bring you 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.520
 the auto porsche mode this is a very 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.860
 very very simple but pretty good is 13 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.710
 hype that is also already available for 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.930
 the 0.11 zero point and it works pretty 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.329
 Well, I'm going to explain how it works 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.579
 fact I took the link borrowed from my friend 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.899
 raul this package is not another youtuber of 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.730
 minecraft and in fact I think that many 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.460
 when it is maintained as 150,000 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.050
 subscribers and good also goes up many 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.930
 much to his channel if they did not know him 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.850
 clear good mode is very very easy to 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.469
 occupy and is very father because then we 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.269
 helps not to lose the basic is 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.489
 mainly the function that it has is 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.620
 do not get lost in a world not then it is 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.679
 explain how it works we need to have 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.600
 how to put an inventory here 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.070
 glass or I put myself 64 nothing else 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.800
 because yes but with one that they have is 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.469
 enough and a torch and good that 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.180
 that as we turn it on we put it 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.650
 in the glass block then we put on 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.600
 the torch in the hand and with the torch 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.850
 we touch glass and how can we 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.680
 appears and a message from the author 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.540
 has already been activated and what does this mod 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.790
 Well, very easy, let's start walking 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.970
 is to unite with stretches of life 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.980
 I am 17 years old and I am called a teacher and 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.080
 compose that he put on a torch by himself 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.610
 guata fac that I'm not putting anything and 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.760
 Suddenly they are putting torches 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.760
 Well, I just did the biggest 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.370
 stupidity of my life but basically the 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.400
 boats and basically that 's the way 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.260
 we are walking and agree 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.090
 let's go forward every determined what 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.010
 that are the calculation every eight 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.290
 blocks or something like that is giving us a 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.300
 torch and this serves as well as 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.460
 mainly to not get lost when 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.440
 for example we left our house to 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.420
 investigate or something and we do not know the way 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.520
 back then simply because 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.070
 we follow the torches, but also 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.259
 It is good if you have such as by 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.300
 example they go in a cave and gives them 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.710
 Lazy to go putting torches or I do not know 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.780
 hey, well, why are they getting 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.340
 You do not see her alone that she is very good or 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.080
 You can even follow us to duplicate 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.880
 torches can now be considered a 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.280
 little trap but hey I guess 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.959
 you who are very creative read 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.640
 some utility I simply 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.500
 I bring the mod so that they know him 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.730
 to download, try it and 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.830
 basically on my channel I'm taking 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.810
 for a catalog of mods not any 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.090
 I want that way here on my channel 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.760
 can see the review and if they like it 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.319
 they download it more critical the same a js 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.150
 in the description is the download and 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.069
 they install it just remember that the 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.510
 ando interceded many core class 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.670
 I have had many problems for 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.340
 record all the mods that the 62 but 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.620
 I always do my best, that's why 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.769
 so I love them classically and we 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.769
 we see in a next video bye bye
