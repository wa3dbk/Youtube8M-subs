00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
hair ornament I started by adding a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.410 
hair ornament I started by adding a
ribbon<00:01:01.920> scrap<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.609> had<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.000> all<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> did

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
ribbon scrap that I had and all I did

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.630 
ribbon scrap that I had and all I did
was<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.809> glue<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.140> end<00:01:04.350> onto<00:01:04.680> one<00:01:05.040> side<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
was to glue the end onto one side and

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.640 
was to glue the end onto one side and
then<00:01:06.090> as<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.570> see<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:07.080> kind<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.350> glued

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
of roughly all the way around the edges

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.999 
of roughly all the way around the edges
into<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> base<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:34.049> paper<00:01:34.320> shape<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.920> I

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
into the base of that paper shape that I

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.740 
into the base of that paper shape that I
cut<00:01:35.250> out<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.670> all<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.210> need<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.600> a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
little bit of glue but the tool really

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.910 
little bit of glue but the tool really
gives<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.390> kind<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.840> romantic<00:01:40.229> look<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920

gives it kind of a romantic look and
really<00:01:41.340> makes<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.610> look<00:01:41.759> more<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.090> hair

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
really makes it look more like a hair

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.910 
really makes it look more like a hair
piece<00:01:42.479> instead<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.350> piece<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.770> paper

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
piece instead of just a piece of paper

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.550 
piece instead of just a piece of paper

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.749 
there just like this and looks like that
when<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.780> was<00:01:49.020> done<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.500> next<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.310> wanted<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.640> add

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
those big pearls are just pieces of a

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.160 
those big pearls are just pieces of a
necklace<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.890> broke<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.600> recycle

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
so when I finished with the beads I

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.160 
so when I finished with the beads I
decided<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:14.970> didn't<00:02:15.210> like<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.390> loops<00:02:15.750> anymore

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
decided I didn't like the loops anymore

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.170 
decided I didn't like the loops anymore
so<00:02:16.350> i<00:02:16.380> just<00:02:16.770> trimmed<00:02:17.340> them<00:02:17.580> up<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.820> little<00:02:17.850> bit

so i just trimmed them up a little bit

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.790 
so i just trimmed them up a little bit
and<00:02:18.330> then<00:02:18.390> frayed<00:02:18.870> them<00:02:19.080> out<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.470> make<00:02:19.620> them

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800
