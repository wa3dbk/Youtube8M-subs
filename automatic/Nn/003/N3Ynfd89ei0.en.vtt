00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.759
 it's everybody knows dream it's 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.730
 today end up for the back 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.369
 on black ops 2 I hope that of 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.109
 the opera already little parenthesis you have 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.119
 seen the welcome as he is handsome he is 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.439
 brand new it will be good to be on 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.050
 this game within a week so I have them 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.300
 so today is I propose you a 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.579
 little of 2 on black ops 2 so I 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.610
 pose is just the gameplay then 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.629
 it's a gameplay at dessert 50 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.309
 panels on the cargo map so 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.590
 I hope this little video you 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.829
 will like it a little bit 6 minutes 30 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.120
 I will not be too late to talk to you 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.430
 because I have lots of things to you 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.050
 say 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.199
 so there right I mean anyway 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.719
 it's developers of black ops 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.370
 treyarch so and as you see 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.770
 it's one in studio mode 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.180
 so I'm already going to explain it to you 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.220
 a little bit so the points you see 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.210
 so there for example happened to 10 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.060
 for right one and the other key not 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.049
 this now so it's a system 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.450
 a bit particular of so this stamp 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.009
 it's the mode it's the art paint mode 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.770
 looks a little bit like the zone zone 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.810
 release two flagship models 3 but 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.720
 it's not really the same already the limit 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.259
 of time it is no longer a ten minutes 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.600
 if in arcade mode a game lasts six 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.180
 minutes they do not have 10 minutes like 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.880
 on all other causes of the type so 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.640
 already that will change a lot 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.540
 the parties will be shorter we are going 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.460
 see what it will look like 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.829
 personally I do not know it's a 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.110
 very good thing 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.460
 and at the points in art paint 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.820
 so you surely remember 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.610
 business 3 it was 20 points 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.710
 I believe in a second well here it is 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.200
 because it's just really 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.460
 very simple it's every second that 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.459
 you are in the area where you win a 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.830
 point even if you are 5 in the zone 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.110
 you earned only one point for each 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.180
 second of which you are in the area of 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.290
 club saw every second the clips 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.180
 blue win a bridge and down in just 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.080
 underneath you see a player 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.280
 there we see a player in the area and that 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.989
 it's a bit like the system to grind to 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.019
 to make bullish cold which is a game a 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:35.040
 note that I appreciate everything 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:38.190
 especially then snipers 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:43.069
 available on black ops 2 so there will be 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:46.290
 the dsr 50 you see the end there the 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.080
 player has switched so we do not see the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.780
 ball 10 k and the x loses 50 only one kind 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.030
 of five years but I believe that I you 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.980
 have already talked about this we last 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.330
 video 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.099
 so I talked about the soft dark pool not this 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.440
 that I'm doing a little sheet like I 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.720
 a lot to say at the level of 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.640
 packs that you can preorder finally 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.659
 I still do not know if you can 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.190
 preorder again in your shop 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:15.739
 so you'll have the prestige pack 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:19.920
 so I 'll put a little one a little 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:22.379
 image at the bottom of the video in the pack 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.650
 prestige there will simply be 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.060
 there will be a package so it's a necklace 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.830
 to these great powers years I have not bad 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.180
 of things in there is enough enough 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:36.150
 class a package to a small drone that 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.659
 you can fly a little gadget 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.010
 media jeans and other things have me the 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.019
 more important it's I think it's 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.060
 newton are bi that will be available 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.260
 only in this pack but 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.080
 unfortunately it costs a little bit 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.820
 dear his 150 euros 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.520
 so that I know it will delight more 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.330
 a good but it's like that 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.360
 so me personally I 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.930
 pre-ordered the ardennes pack help 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:03.170
 so it's a park at 80 euros which there 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:07.900
 has two teeth so there is the lazarette of 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:11.030
 necessarily there are some exclusivities 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.790
 of which skylight 2025 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.860
 facing a 2025 cane if you 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.010
 preorder the game you will have it there 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.959
 are otherwise will have to pay it so I know 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.730
 not really too much if she does not, because 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.890
 dead 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.090
 I think there is the neck of the telethon 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.220
 I am really not sure 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.760
 I would see frenchy way 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.120
 unpacking and so on in a 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.120
 week 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.090
 so you are told that the slang word 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.970
 is a bit similar to the art zombie 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.070
 pledges at the level of what I'm going to do 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.250
 tomorrow next days you know 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.400
 maybe after no it's the betting 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.190
 games week that opens its doors 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.000
 the pgw so magistrates for two 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.530
 days on Wednesday and Thursday 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.660
 so when charente is eager to be there 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.180

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.940

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.160

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.919

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.210

 the class knowing that we can play that 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.840
 six minutes so bring that puts a mode 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.000
 hard paint when it's three hours 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.240
