00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.949
 hello dear hungry today there is 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.170
 tomato casserole with ricotta cream and 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.730
 that's one of my favorite rights 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.039
 brings together a whole lot of benefits 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.010
 it tastes excellent 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.720
 it looks great it is low in calories 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.369
 is not so vegan yet 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.480
 at least meatless and last but not least 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.189
 we'll see 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.250
 the preparation does not take long 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.950
 we need for three eggs slightly 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.200
 olive oil circa 15 small tomatoes that 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.090
 child costs or cocktail tomatoes 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.520
 a bit more fat on the fresh cheese ricotta 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.550
 Peas are preferably frozen salt 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.199
 pepper tabasco some spring onions 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.600
 garlic and basil 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.980
 that prepares me the lousy tour 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.170
 that is the cleaned unwashed ones 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.370
 onions are about 110 meters 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.420
 cut long pieces and 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.680
 then the peeled ones 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.680
 cloves of garlic in thin slices 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.869
 Now we put some oil in a pan 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.140
 Add the onion garlic mixture 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.140
 in 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.310
 and steam them over medium heat 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.310
 for about 2 minutes 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.380
 then remove from the pan and 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.850
 let cool down 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.380
 Now let's talk about ricotta trenches 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:37.869
 in addition we give into a bowl in 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:40.560
 cream cheese the ricotta and season with 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.560
 salt pepper 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.900
 and some tabasco and also the flour 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.940
 Let's add everything now 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.870
 mix thoroughly 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.760
 convenient to rest in one 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.780
 fork and then with the 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.620
 whisk so long until a smooth 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.970
 creamy mass arises 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.050
 wash some basil games and 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.240
 pat dry 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.830
 the leaves pluck a half thereof 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.410
 pack for the later 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:21.080
 garnish and the other half beautiful 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:24.140
 small that said little basil 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.450
 We sent the reporters cream as well as the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:32.000
 peas and the onion garlic 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:35.290
 mix everything thoroughly again 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.290
 mix together 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.129
 now we need a casserole dish of approx 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.329
 20 cm diameter should not be smaller 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.060
 if a little bit bigger is not 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:53.219
 problem and would have this with some height 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.109
 and now give the day advantage 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:59.489
 go and delete something from the end 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:01.109
 smooth and have only the task before 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.049
 that makes everything nice and colorful 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.459
 the spread of tomatoes and about 15 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:11.040
 this results in a healthy one 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:14.700
 Mixing ratio so it looks now 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.129
 off and we give the casserole for about 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.980
 25 to 30 minutes to the middle 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.530
 rail of the stove and that at 200 degrees 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.400
 normal upper and lower heat than around 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.359
 Air is not necessarily 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.760
 recommendable 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.950
 yes and so delicious looks like this from ours 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.180
 tomato casserole with a ricotta cream 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.650
 real treat 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.109
 I wish you a lot of fun with the 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.859
 preparation very good appetite and up 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.859
