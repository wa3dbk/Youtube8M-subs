00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.590 
and saving these up they're going to be
very<00:01:34.479> hard<00:01:34.750> to<00:01:34.899> come<00:01:34.929> by<00:01:35.729> not<00:01:36.729> as<00:01:36.909> hard<00:01:37.179> as<00:01:37.360> some

of the strong safeties were initially so

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.570 
of the strong safeties were initially so
hopefully<00:01:40.000> they<00:01:40.119> released<00:01:40.479> more<00:01:40.840> of<00:01:40.929> them<00:01:41.110> and
