00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
activated so yeah first off probably

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.410 
activated so yeah first off probably
easiest<00:01:01.949> deck<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.370> actually<00:01:02.670> use<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.120> card

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
easiest deck to actually use this card

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.929 
easiest deck to actually use this card
in<00:01:03.600> would<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:05.010> blue-eyes<00:01:05.339> -<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.820> know

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
in would be the blue-eyes - you know

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.399 
in would be the blue-eyes - you know
because<00:01:06.240> that's<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.869> seems<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.320> would

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
because that's it seems like that would

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.810 
because that's it seems like that would
be<00:01:07.470> easiest<00:01:07.860> way<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.100> get<00:01:08.220> two<00:01:08.520> blue-eyes

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
be easiest way just get two blue-eyes

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.490 
be easiest way just get two blue-eyes
White<00:01:09.000> dragons<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.570> use<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.409> works

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
White dragons and use this it works

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.460

dragon boss monsters I mean you might be

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.090 
dragon boss monsters I mean you might be
able<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> use<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.630> Trinity's<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.470> don't

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
able to use this in Trinity's I don't

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.679 
able to use this in Trinity's I don't
know<00:01:23.420> heretics

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
know heretics

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.100 
know heretics
I<00:01:25.140> was<00:01:25.740> thinking<00:01:26.070> possibly<00:01:26.750> photons

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
I was thinking possibly photons

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.260 
I was thinking possibly photons
sort<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.829> mean<00:01:28.950> galaxy-eyes<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.150> can

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
sort of I mean galaxy-eyes you you can

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.149 
sort of I mean galaxy-eyes you you can
get<00:01:30.329> galaxy-eyes<00:01:30.659> fairly<00:01:31.170> easy<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.920> might

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
get galaxy-eyes fairly easy so it might

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.010

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
card the anime effect was better

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.460 
card the anime effect was better
of<00:02:47.670> course<00:02:48.000> anime<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.599> usually<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.109> better<00:02:49.410> I

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
of course anime that usually is better I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.990 
of course anime that usually is better I
mean<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.829> know<00:02:49.950> what<00:02:50.160> are<00:02:50.220> we<00:02:50.310> who<00:02:50.579> we<00:02:50.730> kiddin

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
mean you know what are we who we kiddin

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.069 
mean you know what are we who we kiddin
I<00:02:51.060> mean<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.239> anime<00:02:51.480> effect<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:51.750> just<00:02:51.959> about

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
I mean the anime effect is just about

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.199 
I mean the anime effect is just about
always<00:02:52.440> better<00:02:52.680> than<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.700> real<00:02:53.849> fact<00:02:54.090> they

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
always better than the real fact they

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.619 
always better than the real fact they
they<00:02:54.660> bring<00:02:54.870> out<00:02:54.989> on<00:02:55.170> most<00:02:55.379> cards<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:57.090> think

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
they bring out on most cards I think

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.059 
they bring out on most cards I think
it's<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.930> great<00:02:58.140> card<00:02:58.379> though<00:02:58.530> it's<00:02:58.739> pretty

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
it's a great card though it's pretty

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.949 
it's a great card though it's pretty
situational<00:02:59.700> it's<00:02:59.819> not<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.090> generic<00:03:00.450> monster

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
situational it's not a generic monster

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.319 
situational it's not a generic monster
but<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:01.500> artwork<00:03:01.769> is<00:03:02.099> freakin<00:03:02.519> awesome<00:03:02.700> the

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
but the artwork is freakin awesome the

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.259 
but the artwork is freakin awesome the
stats<00:03:03.900> are<00:03:04.230> very<00:03:04.560> good<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.129> effects<00:03:05.760> are<00:03:05.909> very

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
stats are very good the effects are very

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.210 
stats are very good the effects are very
nice<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:07.109> I<00:03:07.440> think<00:03:07.650> this<00:03:07.799> could<00:03:07.950> come<00:03:08.129> in

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
nice and I think this could come in

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.830 
nice and I think this could come in
handy<00:03:08.340> like<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.790> said<00:03:08.970> it's<00:03:09.120> mainly<00:03:09.450> gonna<00:03:09.690> be
