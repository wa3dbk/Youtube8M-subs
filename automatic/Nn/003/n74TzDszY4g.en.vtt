standing<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.659> shower<00:02:06.810> picking<00:02:07.229> wax<00:02:07.469> off

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
standing in the shower picking wax off

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.859 
standing in the shower picking wax off
but<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.429> wax<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.789> actually<00:02:09.270> just<00:02:09.390> sealed<00:02:09.690> like

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869

but the wax is actually just sealed like
right<00:02:10.110> here<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.849> then<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:12.840> know
