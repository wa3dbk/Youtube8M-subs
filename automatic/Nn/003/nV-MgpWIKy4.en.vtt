00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
innovative design this project you have

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.260 
innovative design this project you have
focused<00:01:44.200> on<00:01:44.650> design<00:01:45.340> students<00:01:45.850> because

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
focused on design students because

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.210 
focused on design students because
they're<00:01:46.750> going<00:01:47.050> to<00:01:47.260> work<00:01:47.470> out<00:01:47.860> in<00:01:48.100> the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
they're going to work out in the

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.749 
they're going to work out in the
industry<00:01:48.450> they'll<00:01:49.450> soon<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:50.770> it's<00:01:51.070> important

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
industry they'll soon so it's important

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.790 
industry they'll soon so it's important
for<00:01:51.790> them<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:52.450> they<00:01:52.720> have<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:53.110> knowledge<00:01:53.290> to

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
for them that they have the knowledge to

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.399 
for them that they have the knowledge to
take<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.460> right<00:01:54.820> decisions<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.750> we<00:01:56.200> hope

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
take to the right decisions and we hope

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.280 
take to the right decisions and we hope
that<00:01:56.770> we<00:01:57.520> with<00:01:57.820> this<00:01:58.030> project<00:01:58.659> can<00:01:58.930> sort<00:01:59.200> of

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
that we with this project can sort of

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.969 
that we with this project can sort of
give<00:01:59.680> our<00:02:00.250> plant<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.540> seed<00:02:01.840> for<00:02:02.830> this

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
give our plant the seed for this

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.730 
give our plant the seed for this
knowledge<00:02:03.250> in<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.729> students<00:02:04.240> so<00:02:05.050> that<00:02:05.470> in<00:02:05.619> the

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
knowledge in the students so that in the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.100 
knowledge in the students so that in the
future<00:02:06.039> they<00:02:06.520> know<00:02:06.789> how<00:02:07.149> to<00:02:07.210> work<00:02:07.630> with<00:02:07.869> it<00:02:07.990> and

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
future they know how to work with it and

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.070 
future they know how to work with it and
which<00:02:08.640> decision<00:02:09.640> they<00:02:09.820> can<00:02:10.000> take<00:02:10.300> when<00:02:10.899> they

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
which decision they can take when they

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:32.780 
which decision they can take when they
work<00:02:11.290> with<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.739> design

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.050 

the<00:02:33.790> show's<00:02:34.030> over<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.780> pavn<00:02:35.260> didn't<00:02:35.620> win<00:02:36.060> but

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
the show's over and pavn didn't win but

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.790 
the show's over and pavn didn't win but
how<00:02:37.240> was<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.600> feeling<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:38.110> entering<00:02:38.650> her

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
how was the feeling of entering her
