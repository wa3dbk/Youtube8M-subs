or not fabric or paper but I I'm using a

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.380 
or not fabric or paper but I I'm using a
starter<00:01:18.220> because<00:01:18.580> it's<00:01:18.760> just<00:01:18.909> like<00:01:19.000> some

starter because it's just like some
fabric<00:01:19.750> that<00:01:19.870> I<00:01:19.930> have<00:01:20.170> that<00:01:21.100> I'm<00:01:21.190> not<00:01:21.370> going<00:01:21.580> to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
use so I'll just use this and then I'll

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.760 
use so I'll just use this and then I'll
keep<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.670> pattern<00:01:24.880> so<00:01:25.750> I<00:01:25.780> wrote<00:01:26.290> on<00:01:26.470> it<00:01:26.620> with<00:01:26.740> a

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
keep the pattern so I wrote on it with a

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.500 
keep the pattern so I wrote on it with a
marker<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:28.210> mark<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.229> inch<00:01:29.530> as<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:31.210> can<00:01:31.360> see

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.300 
it's an inch away from the dress and I
just<00:01:33.820> traced<00:01:34.390> out<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:35.409> dress<00:01:35.740> all<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.219> way

going to cut that out right now
okay<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:45.670> want<00:01:45.939> to<00:01:46.030> fold<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:47.350> pattern<00:01:47.740> in

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
okay you want to fold the pattern in

00:01:47.950 --> 00:02:12.090 
okay you want to fold the pattern in
half

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.300 

what

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
what

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.330 
what
okay<00:02:15.030> now<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.330> can<00:02:15.780> trace<00:02:16.200> out<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.740> hourglass

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
okay now you can trace out the hourglass

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:26.100 
okay now you can trace out the hourglass
part

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.360 

now<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.800> usually<00:02:27.160> do<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.760> light<00:02:28.060> trace<00:02:28.450> at<00:02:28.750> first

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
now I usually do a light trace at first

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.130 
now I usually do a light trace at first
to<00:02:30.370> make<00:02:30.550> sure<00:02:30.820> that<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.390> how<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:34.600> want<00:02:35.050> it

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
and then I'll go over it darker so this

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.200 
and then I'll go over it darker so this
is<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.690> hip<00:02:40.870> area<00:02:41.200> this<00:02:41.320> is<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.620> waist<00:02:41.830> area

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
so see as you can see and then these are

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.180 
so see as you can see and then these are
the<00:04:36.040> side<00:04:36.490> pieces<00:04:36.850> and<00:04:37.360> so<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.530> back<00:04:38.740> piece<00:04:39.040> I

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
the side pieces and so the back piece I

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.800 
the side pieces and so the back piece I
removed<00:04:39.669> it<00:04:39.850> as<00:04:40.060> you<00:04:40.210> can<00:04:40.390> see<00:04:40.510> I<00:04:40.540> have<00:04:40.780> it

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
removed it as you can see I have it

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.040 
removed it as you can see I have it
hanging<00:04:41.080> up<00:04:41.410> there<00:04:42.030> but<00:04:43.030> that<00:04:43.060> back<00:04:43.540> piece<00:04:43.780> is

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
hanging up there but that back piece is

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.990 
hanging up there but that back piece is
just<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.470> solid<00:04:44.890> piece<00:04:45.010> because<00:04:45.430> usually<00:04:45.669> it

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
just a solid piece because usually it

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.370 
just a solid piece because usually it
would<00:04:46.090> just<00:04:46.300> be<00:04:46.390> a<00:04:46.419> solid<00:04:46.810> color<00:04:46.990> you<00:04:47.169> can't

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
would just be a solid color you can't

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.840 
would just be a solid color you can't
trace<00:04:47.650> this<00:04:47.770> again<00:04:48.100> if<00:04:48.220> you<00:04:48.340> want<00:04:48.550> this<00:04:48.669> on<00:04:48.820> the

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
trace this again if you want this on the

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.060 
trace this again if you want this on the
back<00:04:49.120> as<00:04:49.330> well<00:04:49.360> so<00:04:50.050> when<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:50.560> cut<00:04:50.770> out<00:04:50.890> your

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
back as well so when you cut out your

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.880 
back as well so when you cut out your
fabric<00:04:51.270> you<00:04:52.270> will<00:04:52.419> cut<00:04:52.660> this<00:04:52.930> piece<00:04:53.260> out<00:04:53.500> use

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
fabric you will cut this piece out use

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.260 
fabric you will cut this piece out use
this<00:04:54.070> for<00:04:54.580> your<00:04:54.669> pattern<00:04:55.030> for<00:04:55.210> the

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
this for your pattern for the

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.300 
this for your pattern for the
centerpiece<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:56.020> use<00:04:56.500> this<00:04:56.740> for<00:04:57.130> your

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
centerpiece and use this for your

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.570 
centerpiece and use this for your
pattern<00:04:57.790> for<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.240> side<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:59.830> side<00:05:00.040> fabric

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
pattern for the side the side fabric

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.520 
pattern for the side the side fabric
that<00:05:00.730> will<00:05:00.880> match<00:05:01.120> the<00:05:01.570> back<00:05:01.780> fabric<00:05:02.290> and

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
that will match the back fabric and

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:13.140 
that will match the back fabric and
that's<00:05:02.950> it

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.210
