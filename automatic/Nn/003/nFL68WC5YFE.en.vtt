00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
c4 on this one pretty heavily so I

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.259 
c4 on this one pretty heavily so I
thought<00:00:28.590> why<00:00:28.920> not<00:00:28.949> take<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.609> first<00:00:29.910> one<00:00:30.119> when

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
thought why not take this first one when

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.910 
thought why not take this first one when
i<00:00:30.300> get<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> ton<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:30.990> basically<00:00:31.289> how<00:00:31.859> to

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
i get a ton it's basically how to

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.330 
i get a ton it's basically how to
anti-tank<00:00:32.880> video<00:00:33.239> with<00:00:33.719> c4<00:00:34.230> i<00:00:34.500> think<00:00:35.130> i<00:00:35.190> get

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
anti-tank video with c4 i think i get

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.920 
anti-tank video with c4 i think i get
more<00:00:35.520> kills<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:35.880> c4<00:00:36.270> than<00:00:36.450> i<00:00:36.510> did<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
more kills with c4 than i did with the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.770 
more kills with c4 than i did with the
Spads<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.530> first<00:00:37.800> video<00:00:37.980> here<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.780> I

very useful they are a fire-and-forget

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.750

a little tip if you guys ever needed to

a little tip if you guys ever needed to
damage<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.229> building<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.799> put<00:01:56.009> your

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
damage a building if you put your

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.800 
damage a building if you put your
anti-tank<00:01:56.640> mine<00:01:56.820> inside<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.180> building<00:01:57.600> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
anti-tank mine inside a building you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.530 
anti-tank mine inside a building you
will<00:01:58.100> do<00:01:59.100> some<00:01:59.310> good<00:01:59.340> damage<00:01:59.820> it's<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> c4

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
will do some good damage it's like a c4

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.760 
will do some good damage it's like a c4
well<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.020> got<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.350> careful<00:02:01.530> with

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
well but you just got to be careful with

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.550 
well but you just got to be careful with
having<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.369> shoot<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.930> another<00:02:03.930> useful<00:02:04.200> bit

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
having to shoot it another useful bit

having to shoot it another useful bit
about<00:02:04.860> c4<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.869> that<00:02:06.869> there<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.259> three

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
about c4 is that there is a three

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.800 
about c4 is that there is a three
quarters<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.310> second<00:02:08.700> delay<00:02:09.000> time<00:02:09.270> from

when you pushing the trigger to when it

I<00:02:18.930> love<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.620> with<00:02:19.770> tanks<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.280> get<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.989> hunt

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
I love it with tanks you get to hunt

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.050 
I love it with tanks you get to hunt
them<00:02:22.080> down<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:23.130> little<00:02:23.340> killing<00:02:23.730> spree<00:02:24.030> of

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
them down this little killing spree of

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.890 
them down this little killing spree of
the<00:02:24.239> spaz<00:02:24.569> is<00:02:24.900> probably<00:02:25.560> my<00:02:25.830> best<00:02:26.690> streak<00:02:27.690> ever

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
the spaz is probably my best streak ever

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.890 
the spaz is probably my best streak ever
with<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> shotgun<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:29.330> killed<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.390> guy<00:02:30.690> there

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
with a shotgun I killed that guy there

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.780 
with a shotgun I killed that guy there
then<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.140> had<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> bit<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.650> lull<00:02:31.830> before<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:32.640> got

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
then I had a bit of a lull before I got

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.910 
then I had a bit of a lull before I got
any<00:02:32.970> shots<00:02:33.239> but<00:02:33.510> this<00:02:34.200> little<00:02:34.349> streak<00:02:34.769> I

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
any shots but this little streak I

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.970 
any shots but this little streak I
really<00:02:35.190> enjoyed<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:37.260> know<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.709> said<00:02:37.890> with

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
really enjoyed you know like I said with

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.890 
really enjoyed you know like I said with
disp<00:02:38.220> as<00:02:38.370> they<00:02:38.640> are<00:02:38.760> basically<00:02:39.000> it's

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
disp as they are basically it's

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.360 
disp as they are basically it's
basically<00:02:40.260> identical<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:41.010> all<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> other

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
basically identical to all the other

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.120 
basically identical to all the other
pump<00:02:41.640> actions<00:02:42.060> 100<00:02:42.660> damage<00:02:42.810> up<00:02:43.049> close<00:02:43.290> 50<00:02:44.040> at

max<00:02:44.370> range<00:02:44.959> again<00:02:45.959> I'm<00:02:46.110> using<00:02:46.140> them<00:02:46.500> with

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
max range again I'm using them with

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.250 
max range again I'm using them with
slugs<00:02:46.950> some<00:02:47.310> people<00:02:47.580> like<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.760> use<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.330> normal

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
slugs some people like to use the normal

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
slugs some people like to use the normal
shots<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:50.239> typically<00:02:51.239> typically<00:02:51.750> don't<00:02:52.130> if<00:02:53.130> I'm

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
shots I typically typically don't if I'm

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.620 
shots I typically typically don't if I'm
going<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.489> be<00:02:53.549> that<00:02:53.760> close<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.090> do<00:02:54.450> anything

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
going to be that close to do anything

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.440 
going to be that close to do anything
like<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:54.900> I'd<00:02:55.140> rather<00:02:55.290> have<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.590> g3<00:02:56.160> or<00:02:56.190> a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
like that I'd rather have a g3 or a

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.309 
like that I'd rather have a g3 or a
engineer<00:02:57.450> kit<00:02:57.980> but<00:02:59.810> the<00:03:00.810> only<00:03:00.930> difference

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
engineer kit but the only difference

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.830 
engineer kit but the only difference
here<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.560> again<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.130> reload<00:03:02.549> time<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:03.150> the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
here is again the reload time and the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.080 
here is again the reload time and the
reload<00:03:04.170> for<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.440> spaz<00:03:04.769> is<00:03:04.799> slightly<00:03:05.580> slower

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
reload for the spaz is slightly slower

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.970 
reload for the spaz is slightly slower
than<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.390> neo<00:03:06.660> steel<00:03:07.049> which<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.680> don't<00:03:07.739> think

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
than the neo steel which I don't think

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.530 
than the neo steel which I don't think
it's<00:03:08.069> that<00:03:08.099> big<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.519> deal<00:03:08.700> some<00:03:09.060> people<00:03:09.360> do

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
it's that big of a deal some people do

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.940 
it's that big of a deal some people do
but<00:03:10.790> just<00:03:11.790> as<00:03:12.420> I've<00:03:12.569> said<00:03:12.810> three<00:03:13.500> videos<00:03:13.680> now

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
but just as I've said three videos now

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.199 
but just as I've said three videos now
just<00:03:14.160> pick<00:03:14.370> whichever<00:03:14.640> one<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.030> like<00:03:15.060> the

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
just pick whichever one you like the

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.940 
just pick whichever one you like the
most<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.870> pump<00:03:16.109> actions<00:03:16.500> are<00:03:16.590> pretty<00:03:16.829> much

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
most the pump actions are pretty much

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.490 
most the pump actions are pretty much
identical<00:03:17.100> so<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:18.060> like<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.660> spaz<00:03:18.900> some<00:03:19.230> people

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
identical so I like the spaz some people

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.880 
identical so I like the spaz some people
don't<00:03:19.730> it<00:03:20.730> holds<00:03:20.970> six<00:03:21.359> shots<00:03:21.660> at<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.290> time<00:03:22.650> now

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
don't it holds six shots at the time now

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.880 
don't it holds six shots at the time now
and<00:03:23.190> if<00:03:23.609> you<00:03:23.790> want<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.450> can<00:03:24.859> choose<00:03:25.859> to

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
and if you want you can choose to

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.210 
and if you want you can choose to
basically<00:03:26.900> get<00:03:27.900> rid<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.170> Magnum<00:03:28.829> on<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.100> now

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
basically get rid of Magnum on it now

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.559 
basically get rid of Magnum on it now
because<00:03:29.549> it<00:03:29.670> just<00:03:29.790> doesn't<00:03:30.239> matter<00:03:30.390> anymore

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
because it just doesn't matter anymore

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.960 
because it just doesn't matter anymore
it<00:03:31.260> used<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.650> make<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.829> slight<00:03:32.160> difference<00:03:32.640> but

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
it used to make a slight difference but

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.080 
it used to make a slight difference but
ever<00:03:33.510> since<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.840> nerf<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.530> they<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:35.090> simply

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
ever since the nerf and they it simply

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.000 
ever since the nerf and they it simply
doesn't<00:03:36.269> mean<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.540> thing<00:03:36.630> now<00:03:36.959> it's<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.410> one-shot

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
doesn't mean a thing now it's a one-shot

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.160 
doesn't mean a thing now it's a one-shot
kill<00:03:38.489> up<00:03:38.609> close<00:03:38.639> or<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.209> two<00:03:39.269> shot<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.019> body

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
kill up close or a two shot to the body

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.920 
kill up close or a two shot to the body
at<00:03:40.440> max<00:03:40.680> range<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:42.120> can<00:03:42.239> free<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.480> up<00:03:42.630> and

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
at max range so you can free that up and

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.170 
at max range so you can free that up and
get<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.290> more<00:03:43.620> ammo<00:03:43.799> capacity<00:03:44.069> if<00:03:44.850> you'd

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
get the more ammo capacity if you'd

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.390 
get the more ammo capacity if you'd
rather<00:03:45.329> have<00:03:45.600> more<00:03:45.780> than<00:03:45.930> just<00:03:45.989> four<00:03:46.410> shots<00:03:46.680> so

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
rather have more than just four shots so

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.759 
rather have more than just four shots so
it's<00:03:47.700> really<00:03:47.850> up<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:48.810> now<00:03:49.049> it<00:03:49.200> doesn't

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
it's really up to you now it doesn't

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.229 
it's really up to you now it doesn't
really<00:03:49.859> benefit<00:03:50.280> from<00:03:50.310> Magnum<00:03:50.730> again<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.090> get

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
really benefit from Magnum again you get

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.509 
really benefit from Magnum again you get
to<00:03:51.450> have<00:03:51.660> more<00:03:51.900> versatility<00:03:52.380> with<00:03:52.799> more

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
to have more versatility with more

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:54.800 
to have more versatility with more
freedom<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:54.000> choose<00:03:54.209> whatever<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.660> heck<00:03:54.780> you

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
freedom to choose whatever the heck you

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.900 
freedom to choose whatever the heck you
want<00:03:55.079> which<00:03:56.069> I<00:03:56.190> guess<00:03:56.220> is<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.549> good<00:03:56.760> thing

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
want which I guess is a good thing

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.309 
want which I guess is a good thing
because<00:03:57.030> it's<00:03:57.359> consistent<00:03:57.930> with<00:03:57.959> or<00:03:58.200> without

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
because it's consistent with or without

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.680 
because it's consistent with or without
it<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:58.889> make<00:03:59.489> more<00:03:59.670> choices<00:03:59.940> which<00:04:00.299> is

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
it so you make more choices which is

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.990 
it so you make more choices which is
good<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.200> like<00:04:01.500> being<00:04:01.739> able<00:04:01.799> to<00:04:01.950> feel<00:04:02.730> like<00:04:02.850> I'm

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
good I like being able to feel like I'm

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.180 
good I like being able to feel like I'm
not<00:04:03.090> keeping<00:04:03.389> myself<00:04:03.630> by<00:04:04.079> choosing<00:04:04.950> some

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
not keeping myself by choosing some

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.160 
not keeping myself by choosing some
other<00:04:05.340> things

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
other things

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.330 
other things
alright<00:04:07.170> that's<00:04:07.290> about<00:04:07.650> all<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:08.010> info<00:04:08.280> you

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
alright that's about all the info you

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.010

really<00:04:08.640> need<00:04:08.790> them<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.060> spaz<00:04:09.360> I<00:04:09.690> mean<00:04:09.900> they

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
really need them the spaz I mean they

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.500

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.410 
figured I'd combine these two videos
together<00:04:14.100> and<00:04:14.490> not<00:04:14.670> get<00:04:14.910> something<00:04:15.150> out<00:04:15.270> to
