need to look at this round from dominion

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.780 
need to look at this round from dominion
after<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.810> dominating<00:01:45.050> round<00:01:45.680> from<00:01:45.920> Fudo<00:01:46.190> so<00:01:46.729> I

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
after a dominating round from Fudo so I

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.170 
after a dominating round from Fudo so I
median<00:01:47.090> on<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.270> verge<00:01:47.510> of<00:01:47.720> taking<00:01:47.900> around

and he does side up and round to reason

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.150 
and he does side up and round to reason
I<00:01:59.780> think<00:01:59.990> this<00:02:00.050> is<00:02:00.110> pretty<00:02:00.290> strong<00:02:00.560> compile<00:02:01.010> is

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
I think this is pretty strong compile is

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.400 
I think this is pretty strong compile is
