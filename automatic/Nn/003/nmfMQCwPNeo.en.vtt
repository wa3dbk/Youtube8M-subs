 of adventure is episode number 104 in 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.780
 total is also the first episode of 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.790
 a three-part special where end 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.869
 he has a dream where he sees Billy being 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.880
 attacked by the lic 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.549
 he and jake are headed to see if his hero 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.470
 he is well he will entrust them 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.659
 the mission to help you save all the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.570
 existing life but you will encounter 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.789
 a terrible surprise the first thing is the 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.100
 title letter in it looks that the 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.140
 leeds has fini to jake in his eyes 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.420
 this is reference to what is your goal 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.759
 you also see that the end and the law that are in 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.100
 fetal position as if they were afraid 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.920
 fear of the lic 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.360
 the second the film dream we can see 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.700
 that Billy is transformed by a 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.710
 millisecond in the lic so that from now on 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.020
 they made reference to that billy in 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.850
 reality was the leeds also that 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.280
 you can see the episode bear in your 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.789
 shoes with a white mask and recites 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.110
 a very emblematic phrase in the episode 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.640
 followed by this you can see what purpose 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.770
 is seeing something cosmic in the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.110
 computer and it clearly shows that 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.500
 he is very nervous and he tries to warn 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.660
 something similar also appears the snail 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.400
 which is still owned by the niche who 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.960
 after reciting one more step 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.910
 referring to the gems of the 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.850
 princesses that get with the help of 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.340
 end and jake murderous weak and third 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.290
 after the end dream tells the law that 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.900
 has dreamed several nights in a row with the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.150
 snail the bear and with billy then ya and 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.830
 he says he dreamed he was in the garden 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.440
 children and that he was the teacher too 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.320
 says he had big legs he was 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.810
 there and some hairs and the weak old woman and 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.959
 Billy and I was scared something but it 's old 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.040
 something really fierce and the cosmic owl 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.989
 I was there, I think 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.550
 the cosmic owl was a dream 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.130
 premonitory order 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.960
 or maybe I do not know better we send him to 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.170
 Billy a message just in case he will know 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.170
 what to do 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.490
 I dreamed I was going back to kindergarten 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.400
 but he had very big feet and 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.990
 it was also the teacher doing this 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.630
 reference to the past episodes 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.360
 goliat and the worm king respectively 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.340
 since in the episode the king worm end 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.160
 and jake enlarges his feet to raise the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.290
 fastest mountain fourth 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.270
 Billy refuses to touch the jewels since 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.890
 as he is possessed by the lecce these 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.140
 they cancel their mental control power 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.180
 He also says that he found the inquiring 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.540
 jon in the mouth of a bear another reference 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.580
 to the episode in your fifth shoes the 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.590
 multidimensional map reveals that in the 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.870
 solar system of adventure time are missing 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.510
 planets in addition to showing the sun in a 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.080
 weaker state we can also see that 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.420
 evoked is very similar to Mr. keys 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.730
 sixth in Latin America and Spain the 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.870
 scene where the sweet princess 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.180
 experiment with small candy is 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.980
 censored possibly by the graphic 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.170
 what is the scene and the fact that 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.930
 the sweet princess does not seem to flinch 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.670
 how immoral it is what it does 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.680
 seconds later the sweet short princess 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.060
 to end with scissors in the face but 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.740
 you only see that it touches you for a 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.440
 millisecond pushes it 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.770
 and finally has cut the latter is not 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.230
 censored in Latin America seventh in the 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.630
 Original storyboard when I look for sample 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.610
 the multiverse mentions a brave 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.550
 warrior that was encased in the crystal 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.890
 matrix there interferes billy that is the 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.530
 lic and he says to end that that was his father 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.510
 end does not recognize it at the beginning but 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.300
 ends by recognizing that the parents of 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.100
 jake were just adoptive then 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.100
 we will see the scene made by a fan 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.840
 I will push licha and one of the 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.430
 most common dimensions of the multiverse 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.870
 this dimension called the city â€‹â€‹of 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.520
 crystal 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.700
 it is very easy to enter it but it is very 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.800
 difficult to leave 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.970
 with this dimension it has been used as 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.550
 prison for the most dangerous moments 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.830
 of all the multiverse does not make many 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.700
 years a great warrior has thrown 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.860
 the city of glass 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.840
 trapped forever in a battle without 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.490
 you 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.490
 That was your father 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.370
 my role is that of jake 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.330
 Dad and mom found you in the forest 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.330
 when you sat down a little 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:34.249
 we will always be brothers no matter if 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:34.249
 we have different fathers or not 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.680
 Thank you 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.170
 eighth the ending is the most surprising 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.180
 of the episode in it is shown to end in 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.550
 a farm with a robotic arm in a 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.310
 farm accompanied by a jake without powers 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.530
 then a person similar to the 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.860
 sweet princess flame to order to inside 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:58.080
 which turns out to be the end mom 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.520
 ninth the flute that plays alternate end is 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.420
 the same one that plays in the episode 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.670
 prisoners of love tenth this special 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.410
 makes reference to the famous story the paw 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.080
 of monkey where three people 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.360
 different make a wish the first 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.970
 desire is done without any care when 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.650
 everything is disastrous the 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.720
 second wish is requested so that the 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.690
 correct first wish but when it 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.580
 meets the result is worse and the last 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.710
 and third wish is done with hope 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.590
 that the first wish has never been 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.470
 fulfilled in this case the leeds wish the 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:34.910
 first wish good that's been all for 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.910

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.450

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.950
