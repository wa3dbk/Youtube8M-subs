00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:03.590
 I have since Mike di Meglio has so far in the last 14 years so far 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.890
 analyze 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.150
 what really characterizes? 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.619
 Seller out 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:11.279
 the TUM example last year 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.079
 in the crisis year 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:18.300
 30% growth with products that are still high 30 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.399
 in an industry with home competition for example in the case shop Bauer 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.470
 is he now that there is no competition 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.169
 the future 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.829
 what are the features that characterizes these guys from UNIQA are long 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.899
 essential in properties the most elementary criticized 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.140
 The first is I am optimistic that they are optimistic that secondly 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.300
 This human test is the hammer strategy behind what they do 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.270
 optimistic means 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.670
 they are convinced of themselves 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.940
 they have a high level of self-confidence 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.940
 If they say they are expensive, Jagla said 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.740
 five low-cost suppliers want to work with the GAL 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.160
 He knows that he is the best partner for this customer 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.480
 but it never makes an arrogantly arrogant way and then it comes packed 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.570
 It also makes sense of this for the sake of humanity 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.320
 Bund makes it pleasant to work with a bit of humor 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.700
 a little bit of fun 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.150
 customer-oriented 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.760
 the cessation of these sales is not with me with this customer buys 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.430
 makes the customer mistakes 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.100
 and that can be determined on 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.680
 we get that 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.630
 The customer might then actually think of a soccer match in Bonn 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.490
 to go to know that 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.369
 Percent of the squad that and the beautiful is so talented del there is the attacks 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.369
 banned Foundation called that I think very well that fits exactly in the direction 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.539
 the basic attitude is the decisive one 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.030
 The customer made mistakes if he did not buy from me 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.260
 and of course the third topic strategy 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.650
 they have goals 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.220
 Recently, "sports have gotten the last good word of the year's five seminars 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.900
 Talk to the sellers, he says 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.140
 Rapper Fler we had degrees 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.090
 target agreements 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.529
 and I had to talk to some company 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.529
 we had to correct the goals that van Eck a challenge 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.119
 call it by the setting or 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:18.409
 who has the attitude 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.760
 Most seller gamers I experience and the goals this year are much too 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.069
 high you never create a possibility 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.759
 incorrect adjustment 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:32.929
 and these influences are outgoing if Pipas then the rest is relative 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:33.969
 pretty easy
