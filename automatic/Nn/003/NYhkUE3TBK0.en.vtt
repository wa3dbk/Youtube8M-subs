 further click the settings here we have 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.869
 somewhat remarkable points but 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.409
 very important for the game namely not 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.700
 binds the saved password to ip 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.900
 put a tick if you are dynamic 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.939
 address that is 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.619
 ip address that is constantly changing 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.229
 when you connect the Internet 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.600
 if you do not know what type of address you have 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.619
 dynamic or static then better 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.780
 tick the second very important 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.450
 item memory that is how much operational 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.490
 memory you allocate for the game for example 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.920
 I have two gigabytes in total therefore I 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.780
 I expose one gigabyte as one more 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.159
 gigabyte goes for windows work and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.070
 other programs further item update 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.180

 did not start further play offline if 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.000
 there is a tick then the launcher does not use 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.000
 internet in general 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.720

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.340

 last item delete folder in case 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.400
 if something doesn't work and fix it 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:20.230

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.400
