00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
actually this year you know we 6,800

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.090 
actually this year you know we 6,800
people<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.960> came<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.500> main<00:01:13.710> event<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
people that came to the main event is a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.649 
people that came to the main event is a
great<00:01:14.280> testament<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> power<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.330> poker

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
great testament to the power of poker

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.630 
great testament to the power of poker
because<00:01:15.780> with<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> online<00:01:16.350> sites<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.430> US

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
because with the online sites in the US

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.539 
because with the online sites in the US
being<00:01:17.850> shut<00:01:18.030> down<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.689> thought<00:01:18.840> we'd<00:01:19.020> go<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> lot

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
being shut down we thought we'd go a lot

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.370 
being shut down we thought we'd go a lot
less<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.939> number<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.930> ESPN

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
less with that number so the ESPN

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.710 
less with that number so the ESPN
coverage<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:23.040> think<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.369> helps<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.180> keep<00:01:24.360> poker

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
coverage I think it helps to keep poker

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.840 
coverage I think it helps to keep poker
in<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> mainstream<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:26.280> takes<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.700> long

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
in the mainstream and it takes a long

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.800 
in the mainstream and it takes a long
time<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.090> get<00:01:27.270> any<00:01:27.420> type<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.630> legislation

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
time to get any type of legislation

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.179 
time to get any type of legislation
through<00:01:28.320> Congress<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.829> there's<00:01:28.950> another

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
through Congress and there's another

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.160 
through Congress and there's another
bill<00:01:29.610> right<00:01:29.790> now<00:01:29.820> about<00:01:30.030> online<00:01:30.270> poker<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:31.110> it

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
bill right now about online poker but it
