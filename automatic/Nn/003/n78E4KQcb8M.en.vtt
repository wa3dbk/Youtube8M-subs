00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.430
 idea to put on the back 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.410
 smartphone 2 energy saving display 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.969
 cool and just incredible 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.440
 think no more 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.599
 unlock the device to 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.230
 see the time or availability of updates 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.539
 in social networks 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.390
 all information is always available on the 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.859
 case it is great for reading 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.109
 don't bother your eyes at all 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.150
 and most importantly in theory its presence 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.940
 should have a positive effect on time 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.649
 work 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.079
 yotaphone first similar experiment but 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.780
 what makes it even more interesting is this 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.670
 that it was developed in Russia release 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.949
 there are no samples yet 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.989
 got but not the final version with a number 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.019
 technical problems which then be 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.120
 I should not say right away even with my eyes closed 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.710
 on them if yotaphone wouldn't have 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.809
 his unique chips in front of us 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.829
 would be a very weak device in 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.929
 IN many respects 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.149
 for example size three four and three 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.949
 inch display so large frames 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.650
 sides especially on top and bottom 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.810
 Look mildly sad and the thickness 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.060
 so-so about the design itself, I generally keep quiet 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.040
 although it promises that the release model will 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.350
 made of better quality 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.420
 materials weird somehow replaced 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.730
 Buttons instead offer us two 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.720
 touch areas below each display 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.000
 swipe left 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.090
 this back hold debt window opens 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.990
 multitasking right this is google on 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.570
 really pleasure dubious 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.480
 dual core snapdragon msm 8960 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.020
 looks at the end of 2013 somehow 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.330
 strange 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.060
 however, RAM as it should be 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.580
 2 gigabytes but according to the data will allocate 32 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.800
 or 64 GB 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.330
 the main screen has a resolution of 720p 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.370
 which is enough for him 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.500
 viewing angles and brightness decent but 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.570
 let's dwell on that 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.250
 screen that is made by liquid technology 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.960
 ink 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.610
 Of course, this is still a test sample. 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.350
 see here even a marriage in the form of two 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.540
 vertical bars present but 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.060
 hardly anything will change in terms of stuffing 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.880
 the screen has the same diagonal of 4.3 inches 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.179
 as the main one, but the resolution is noticeable 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.790
 below only 360 by 640 pixels that 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.640
 strongly striking fonts look 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.069
 it's not so hot he is not touch black and white 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.939
 and supports 16 grayscale 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.620
 and on top is a matte finish 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.390
 thanks to the energy link display 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.730
 almost does not consume but on the contrary 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.870
 is designed to increase the time from one 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.390
 charge in one thousand eight hundred 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.670
 milliamp hours which will be equipped 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.250
 yotaphone look more or less normal 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.620
 on the other hand, if you are active 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.090
 use lt and networks for the whole day 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.469
 the device may be calm and not enough 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.689
 Naturally the second display is not easy 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:48.849
 duplicate information from his first 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:51.159
 the primary task is constantly 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.959
 display time and updates with everything 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.209
 this is a good customization with 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.189
 built-in widgets that display any 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.829
 from time to time with the weather coming up 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:02.439
 meeting something else other important 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.720
 function is reading e-books for 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.480
 what is already preinstalled service 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.370
 Beech made also have built-in 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.049
 application notes and organizer 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.659
 work with them switching between 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.120
 display and quite convenient now 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.979
 moreover are present even unpretentious 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.530
 game teach me development skills game 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:22.540
 English but sometimes you just want 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.549
 transfer some information from 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.500
 the main display for extra for 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.139
 more convenient and constant access to 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.120
 for this, we take a screenshot using 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.129
 gestures with two fingers from top to bottom 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.560
 image appears on the back 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.000
 This opportunity is convenient on the 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.699
 this moment needs a little 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.739
 own dopiling for example cards 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:43.900
 look bad on a black and white screen 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.699
 due to lack of contrast because 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.379
 not designed to display showing 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:49.000
 only 16 shades of gray 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.829
 I would like the application to 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.169
 need first adapted 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.209
 picture in the future is planned as 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:56.889
 third-party developers will be able to write and 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.639
 adapt your software to the second 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:02.979
 display yotaphone and in general the idea 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.540
 embedded in the smartphone is extremely interesting 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:06.549
 unequivocal applicable in everyday life 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.590
 even if the yotaphone itself does not shoot at 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.810
 any reason let's hope that 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.269
 someone else will pick up and successfully 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.680
 implements this idea on the market but if 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.659
 is it still manage it 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.659
 Russian company is doubly pleased
