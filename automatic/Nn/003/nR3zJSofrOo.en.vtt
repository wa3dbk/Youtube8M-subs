00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
several folders out of a pair of these a

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.220 
several folders out of a pair of these a
couple<00:02:50.520> of<00:02:50.910> tips<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.360> did<00:02:51.630> find<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.080> was

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
couple of tips I did find that it was

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.930 
couple of tips I did find that it was
easiest<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.830> use<00:02:52.860> these<00:02:53.160> with<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.400> stippling

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
easiest to use these with a stippling

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.080 
easiest to use these with a stippling
motion<00:02:54.570> making<00:02:54.810> little<00:02:55.200> dots<00:02:55.880> see<00:02:56.880> that's

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
motion making little dots see that's

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.590 
motion making little dots see that's
most<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.810> my<00:02:57.930> design<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.680> dotted<00:02:59.670> um<00:03:00.209> that's

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
most of my design is dotted um that's

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.880 
most of my design is dotted um that's
just<00:03:00.630> because<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.170> way<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.680> flows

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
just because of the way that it flows

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.170 
just because of the way that it flows
out<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.190> this<00:03:02.459> particular<00:03:02.760> type<00:03:03.150> of

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
out of this particular type of

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.000 
out of this particular type of
correction<00:03:03.780> pen<00:03:03.959> if<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.530> use<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:04.800> different

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
correction pen if you use a different

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.130 
correction pen if you use a different
brand<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.640> may<00:03:05.820> flow<00:03:06.180> where<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.480> can<00:03:06.780> do<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.050> in

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
brand it may flow where you can do it in

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.380 
brand it may flow where you can do it in
more<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.320> a<00:03:07.500> line<00:03:07.850> this<00:03:08.850> was<00:03:09.060> just<00:03:09.239> what<00:03:09.360> I

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
more of a line this was just what I

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.670 
more of a line this was just what I
found<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.750> be<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.870> easiest

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
found to be the easiest

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.670 
found to be the easiest
so<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.400> henna<00:03:11.580> inspired<00:03:12.300> sort<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:13.080> stippling

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
so the henna inspired sort of stippling

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.979 
so the henna inspired sort of stippling
look<00:03:13.920> worked<00:03:14.160> really<00:03:14.400> well<00:03:14.519> for<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:15.060> but<00:03:15.330> play

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
look worked really well for it but play

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.350 
look worked really well for it but play
