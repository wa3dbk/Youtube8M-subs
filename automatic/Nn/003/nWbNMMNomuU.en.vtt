they're speeding like lettuce container
here<00:00:56.290> that<00:00:57.290> is<00:00:57.500> fed<00:00:57.770> by<00:00:58.010> grip<00:01:00.940> so<00:01:01.940> as<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.540> table

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
here that is fed by grip so as the table

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.180 
here that is fed by grip so as the table
drops<00:01:04.220> into<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.670> second<00:01:05.120> layer<00:01:05.360> here<00:01:06.190> once

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
drops into the second layer here once

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.580 
drops into the second layer here once
again<00:01:07.340> food<00:01:07.910> is<00:01:08.119> going<00:01:08.540> out<00:01:08.750> of<00:01:09.670> fish<00:01:10.670> way

again food is going out of fish way
turned<00:01:12.590> into<00:01:12.920> nitrogen<00:01:14.229> and<00:01:15.229> if<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:15.530> look

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
turned into nitrogen and if you look

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.410 
turned into nitrogen and if you look
closely<00:01:16.009> you'll<00:01:16.640> be<00:01:16.790> able<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:17.950> hear<00:01:19.420> sediments

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
closely you'll be able to hear sediments

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.620 
closely you'll be able to hear sediments
on<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.720> bottom<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:22.729> then<00:01:22.880> cleaner<00:01:23.300> water

on the bottom and then cleaner water

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.930 
on the bottom and then cleaner water
comes<00:01:23.990> out<00:01:24.259> you<00:01:25.160> know<00:01:25.280> water<00:01:25.460> right<00:01:25.729> now<00:01:25.910> I

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
comes out you know water right now I

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:41.460 
comes out you know water right now I
just<00:01:26.060> have<00:01:26.479> going<00:01:26.750> into<00:01:27.020> this<00:01:39.340> table<00:01:40.340> here<00:01:40.970> I

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
now the overflow of this second dip unit

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.820 
now the overflow of this second dip unit
here<00:02:30.400> comes<00:02:31.400> out<00:02:31.790> here<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:35.110> dumps<00:02:36.110> back<00:02:36.350> into

the pond the influent overflows the

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.020 
the pond the influent overflows the
supply<00:02:47.959> just<00:02:48.890> be<00:02:49.340> supplier<00:02:50.170> overflows<00:02:52.030> which

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
supply just be supplier overflows which

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.960 
supply just be supplier overflows which
raises<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.810> table<00:02:55.959> until<00:02:56.959> it<00:02:57.080> gets<00:02:57.970> either

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
raises the table until it gets either

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.870 
raises the table until it gets either
stand<00:02:59.390> off<00:02:59.690> and<00:03:00.020> that's

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
stand off and that's

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.590 
stand off and that's
to<00:03:01.170> determine<00:03:02.170> yep<00:03:02.770> I<00:03:03.100> can<00:03:03.580> raise<00:03:03.790> that<00:03:03.820> simply

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
to determine yep I can raise that simply

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:12.030 
to determine yep I can raise that simply
by<00:03:04.780> raising<00:03:10.080> their<00:03:11.080> that<00:03:11.260> comes<00:03:11.470> down<00:03:11.680> into

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
by raising their that comes down into

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.010 
by raising their that comes down into
this<00:03:12.160> other<00:03:12.640> container<00:03:14.490> you<00:03:15.490> can<00:03:15.790> see<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.300> try

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
this other container you can see I try

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.670 
this other container you can see I try
to<00:03:18.390> catch<00:03:19.390> anything<00:03:19.690> through<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.200> previous

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
to catch anything through the previous

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.200 
to catch anything through the previous
table<00:03:20.980> with<00:03:21.640> anything<00:03:22.510> organic<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:24.210> then

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
table with anything organic and then

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.640 
table with anything organic and then
it's<00:03:26.880> just<00:03:27.880> another<00:03:28.120> filtration<00:03:28.930> system<00:03:29.440> and

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
it's just another filtration system and

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.520 
it's just another filtration system and
then<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.970> outputs<00:03:31.120> down<00:03:31.750> here<00:03:32.080> out<00:03:32.320> of<00:03:32.350> this

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
then it outputs down here out of this

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:40.660 
then it outputs down here out of this
PVC

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.010 

beehives<00:03:41.670> are<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.030> core
