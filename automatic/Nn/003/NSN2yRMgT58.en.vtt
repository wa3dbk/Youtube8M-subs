00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
simply just reapply the wax later so

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.340

let's go outside and take a look see how

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.729 
let's go outside and take a look see how
this<00:02:17.530> works<00:02:18.840> hey<00:02:19.840> guys<00:02:20.049> what's<00:02:20.230> up<00:02:20.380> now<00:02:20.560> we're

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
this works hey guys what's up now we're

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.130 
this works hey guys what's up now we're
outside<00:02:20.860> we're<00:02:21.459> here<00:02:21.579> with<00:02:21.730> my<00:02:21.880> 2008<00:02:22.420> Nissan

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
outside we're here with my 2008 Nissan

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.630 
outside we're here with my 2008 Nissan
Rogue<00:02:23.350> we're<00:02:23.980> going<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.190> try<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.340> clean<00:02:24.549> the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
Rogue we're going to try to clean the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.370 
Rogue we're going to try to clean the
windshield<00:02:24.850> it<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.630> bitterly<00:02:25.930> cold<00:02:26.170> outside

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
windshield it is bitterly cold outside

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.310 
windshield it is bitterly cold outside
so<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.769> really<00:02:27.040> do<00:02:27.220> hope<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.660> solution

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
so I really do hope that the solution

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.860 
so I really do hope that the solution
we've<00:02:29.440> just<00:02:29.650> created<00:02:29.799> does<00:02:30.519> not<00:02:30.700> freeze<00:02:30.970> up<00:02:31.000> so

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
we've just created does not freeze up so

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.750 
we've just created does not freeze up so
what<00:02:32.049> we're<00:02:32.169> basically<00:02:32.200> going<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.680> do<00:02:32.829> is

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
what we're basically going to do is

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.880 
what we're basically going to do is
start<00:02:34.939> up<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.090> driver's<00:02:35.450> side<00:02:35.799> we're<00:02:36.799> gonna

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
start up a driver's side we're gonna

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.470
