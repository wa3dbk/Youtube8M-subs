00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Dr. Alberto Cormillot as they are very 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.440
 good morning, good morning, 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.650
 Today's topic is a disturbing topic 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.860
 a question that sounded to me like 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.400
 banana 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.490
 there is a difference in size for look no 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.230
 also with the white horse of san 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.750
 martín what color was what happens that 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.140
 it depends on different countries or is there 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.470
 different fruits of long weighed banana 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.689
 there are bananas of different types in 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.579
 some banana countries equal silver 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.010
 does not depend on each country in Latin America 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:42.079
 and in each country and in Spain and in others the 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.620
 banana is smaller less sweet and there 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.350
 that eating it cooked that would be the essence 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.720
 but to which we are going to that the tree 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.850
 it's the banana as the tree is the 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.710
 banana the tree is the most fruit 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.120
 known to Havana is the banana the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.260
 best known fruit is the truth that there 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.160
 of different type 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.440
 that's good what it's like 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.300
 Newly nacho for him and other athletes 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.130
 of elite is one is a key food 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.869
 because good source of hydrate 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.060
 carbon to vitamin of the fiber complex 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.190
 potassium fruits to warm that are a 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.740
 very very special fiber species more 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.600
 beyond the name that are very good for 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.520
 good for the digestive system for the 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.960
 circulation but basically it's a very 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.120
 good source of carbohydrates for 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.820
 they use it a lot 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.550
 the athletes how many calories does 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.130
 a banana because there is always talk of 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.390
 that the banana should not be eaten in a 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.100
 diet in a slimming treatment 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.530
 in the sea you can not eat a banana 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.150
 girl has 120 calories or is it a 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.310
 collation that can be perfectly used 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.920
 It is a dessert that can be quietly 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.140
 eat up to a teaspoon 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.360
 for of teaspoons sweet milk that you 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.640
 you add about 60 calories because that 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.450
 smile 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:01.729
 I was thinking Fabian did not want to 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.530
 as a median but half for not 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.790
 agree both in fruit salad the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:11.540
 median of 250 calories but not 125 per 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:15.530
 that's perfectly with orange apple 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.950
 It is a fruit that can be perfectly 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.930
 consume because we recommend it a lot is 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.959
 Easy to transport and keeps 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.220
 cool for several hours or you can 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.370
 taking her to work can take her to the 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.250
 office or you can calmly 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.070
 have it during all day 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.840
 Even in the summer, the 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.540
 you can eat sliced ​​with cereals with 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.130
 nuts with a little honey or milk 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:46.670
 but with a little honey with milk a 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.770
 little sweet milk 5 thousand 300 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.660
 calories 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.230
 depends on the amount of people passing you 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.080
 I said a couple of teaspoons of light in 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.670
 the possible ones that they can be because if 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.140
 from the common 2 teaspoon of tea 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.540
 then they are 15 grams each 2 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.990
 large spoons two teaspoons of tea 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.580
 Groceries do not go they will make slices 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.850
 drowned in an ocean of dulce de leche 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:18.190
 not because there is to have between two bands 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:20.050
 large spaces therefore did not tell me 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.380
 for us, the athletes commit crimes 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.690
 fundamental is the 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.580
 kilometer 35 of marathon piece of 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.490
 banana 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.310
 we raise here and we are going to put a photo 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.740
 of nacho but we do not get good 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.500
 we put this other one is good for the 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.650
 Sport protects against microorganisms 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.680
 stimulates the defense system and is very 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.560
 good antioxidant we could not get 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.260
 the photo of nacho but the same thing 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.540
 we have with us 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.000
 Carlos Moya Carlos Moya like the 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.140
 selection wants Carlos Moyá via tennis 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.220
 number one in the world at the time won 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.810
 the first his first Peruvian tomato 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.820
 very good then good as 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.590
 select them if they are green they go to 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.350
 take a long time to buy them firm 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.050
 but not too hard with appearance 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.180
 bright without beating the stem and tip 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.459
 It has to be intact and the size does not 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.000
 is related to its quality because 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.340
 Sometimes they do not like it 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.470
 in the north for example is in the area 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.990
 of the coast the panista of more hours 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.450
 girl does not like to anything clear because 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.340
 those different types of banana are the 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.220
 Chinese banana that is different types 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.960
 of banana and perhaps the one that is collected 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.910
 in the north or the one that is grown in the 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.710
 north or where it reaches north is a 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.270
 kind of banana that does not have that much 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:48.940
 taste that which is used to give its 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:48.940
 test maryland what is the one that there is a 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.040
 favorite dish as a very occasionally 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.200
 when they have a lot of calories because 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.700
 fried banana to your cousin in the cream 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.700
 corn is the bacon 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:10.220
 every year we will reach the supreme 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.400
 maryland and Cuban rice without 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.229
 fried banana you have to return them 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.759
 that is me every so often as to heal by 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:22.460
 years like Cuban rice and once 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.460
 every two years as one in two years 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.050
 the truth that usually 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:42.500
 all the great supreme many 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:45.210
 calories that dish and 1500 or so 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.280
 good to keep it 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.139
 without downstairs he does not soon put it in the 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.770
 refrigerator and although the shell was 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:55.800
 darken the interior is not affected 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:58.020
 it's one thing you have to know how 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.750
 it can be consumed I can upload it 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.370
 raw cooked in salad for creams and 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.840
 smoothies in smoothies with milk or 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.520
 blender water of few children milk 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.190
 be skim in ice cream salad 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.080
 fruit and sometimes is also used in the 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.900
 alcoholic drinks 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.569
 and finally if you are going to serve salad 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.930
 of fruits is added at the end because it 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:22.349
 oxidizes rapidly and the sight of the banana is 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:25.069
 put a splash of lemon the lemon does not 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:32.370
 put the black banana a little lemon 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:34.379
 good and I wanted to see if he can 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.960
 code to cut the fruit 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:40.690
 greens and mature falls alone 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.819
 to cut unripe green fruit 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.060
 that there is only I do not know if I'm clear who 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.060
 you are
