00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
this mower will be running and have been

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.110 
this mower will be running and have been
sold<00:03:42.930> probably<00:03:43.230> for<00:03:43.530> two<00:03:43.680> months<00:03:44.070> but<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.910> is

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
sold probably for two months but it is

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.870 
sold probably for two months but it is
what<00:03:45.330> it<00:03:45.450> is<00:03:45.980> well<00:03:46.980> anyway<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.280> problem<00:03:47.490> we've

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
what it is well anyway the problem we've

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.760 
what it is well anyway the problem we've
got<00:03:48.090> with<00:03:48.240> this<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:48.720> see<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:48.990> shaft<00:03:49.290> right

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
got with this is you see the shaft right

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.010 
got with this is you see the shaft right
the<00:03:50.370> shaft<00:03:50.670> on<00:03:50.880> this<00:03:51.000> engine<00:03:51.240> is<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.750> size

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
the shaft on this engine is that size

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.690 
the shaft on this engine is that size
which<00:03:52.290> I'm<00:03:52.440> going<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.770> say<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.070> probably<00:03:53.310> one

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
which I'm going to say is probably one

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.840 
which I'm going to say is probably one
inch<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:54.060> haven't<00:03:54.360> measured<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:55.430> this<00:03:56.430> is<00:03:56.670> not

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
inch I haven't measured it this is not

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.580 
inch I haven't measured it this is not
really<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.210> problem<00:03:57.810> that's<00:03:57.960> gonna<00:03:58.170> be<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.350> big

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
really a problem that's gonna be a big

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.090 
really a problem that's gonna be a big
deal<00:03:59.930> this<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:00.990> part<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.440> an<00:04:01.560> air<00:04:01.680> conditioner

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
deal this is part of an air conditioner

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.710 
deal this is part of an air conditioner
compressor<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:04.530> old<00:04:04.680> motor<00:04:05.010> had<00:04:05.220> this<00:04:05.340> shift

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
compressor the old motor had this shift

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.600 
compressor the old motor had this shift
the<00:04:06.720> new<00:04:06.900> motor<00:04:07.110> has<00:04:07.320> chef<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.830> size<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.310> as

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
the new motor has chef that size and as

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.970 
the new motor has chef that size and as
you<00:04:08.790> can<00:04:08.910> tell<00:04:09.150> ain't<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.080> same<00:04:10.290> damn<00:04:10.470> size

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
you can tell ain't the same damn size

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.310 
you can tell ain't the same damn size
yeah<00:04:11.490> I<00:04:11.820> think<00:04:12.360> it's<00:04:12.570> a<00:04:12.630> three-quarter<00:04:13.140> that's

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
yeah I think it's a three-quarter that's

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.680 
yeah I think it's a three-quarter that's
a<00:04:13.440> hold<00:04:13.920> on<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.100> entropy<00:04:14.370> kneeling<00:04:14.670> these<00:04:15.330> use

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
a hold on the entropy kneeling these use

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.880 
a hold on the entropy kneeling these use
a<00:04:16.640> wedge<00:04:17.810> pull<00:04:18.810> these<00:04:18.930> upside<00:04:19.350> down<00:04:19.560> but<00:04:19.770> it

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
a wedge pull these upside down but it

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.710 
a wedge pull these upside down but it
goes<00:04:20.010> in<00:04:20.250> there<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.549> wages<00:04:20.940> in<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.330> that's

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
goes in there and it wages in and that's

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.130 
goes in there and it wages in and that's
it<00:04:22.040> that's<00:04:23.040> what<00:04:23.250> holds<00:04:23.370> it<00:04:23.520> together<00:04:24.140> the

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
it that's what holds it together the

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.629 
it that's what holds it together the
original

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
original

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.149 
original
Fiat<00:04:27.030> had<00:04:28.129> it<00:04:29.129> set<00:04:29.400> like<00:04:29.580> that<00:04:30.949> totally<00:04:31.949> set

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:32.159 
Fiat had it set like that totally set

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.730 
Fiat had it set like that totally set
like<00:04:32.310> that<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:33.749> know<00:04:33.870> I've<00:04:34.080> got<00:04:34.110> one<00:04:34.289> pull

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
like that and you know I've got one pull

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.879 
like that and you know I've got one pull
here<00:04:35.099> that<00:04:35.639> could<00:04:35.789> use<00:04:36.349> which<00:04:37.349> way<00:04:37.529> this<00:04:37.710> is

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
here that could use which way this is

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.839 
here that could use which way this is
made<00:04:38.099> it's<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.699> compression<00:04:39.090> fully<00:04:40.669> plus<00:04:41.669> it's

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
made it's a compression fully plus it's

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.580 
made it's a compression fully plus it's
got<00:04:41.969> stamped<00:04:42.509> keyway<00:04:43.460> so<00:04:44.460> can't<00:04:45.090> use<00:04:45.240> that<00:04:45.590> not

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
got stamped keyway so can't use that not

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.709 
got stamped keyway so can't use that not
to<00:04:46.770> mention<00:04:46.800> it's<00:04:47.249> bigger<00:04:47.520> which<00:04:48.330> would<00:04:48.479> slow

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:48.719 
to mention it's bigger which would slow

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:50.869 
to mention it's bigger which would slow
down<00:04:48.749> that<00:04:49.279> propulsion<00:04:50.279> of<00:04:50.400> the<00:04:50.490> lawnmower

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:50.879 
down that propulsion of the lawnmower

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.070 
down that propulsion of the lawnmower
but<00:04:51.029> to<00:04:51.090> be<00:04:51.180> honest<00:04:51.389> we<00:04:51.449> he's<00:04:51.569> fast<00:04:51.779> as<00:04:51.960> that

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
but to be honest we he's fast as that

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.709 
but to be honest we he's fast as that
damn<00:04:52.229> thing<00:04:52.439> was<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:53.210> don't<00:04:54.210> think<00:04:54.330> it's<00:04:54.629> the

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:54.719 
damn thing was I don't think it's the

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:57.409 
damn thing was I don't think it's the
original<00:04:55.080> drive<00:04:55.499> pulley<00:04:55.740> anyway<00:04:56.419> this

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
original drive pulley anyway this

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.269 
original drive pulley anyway this
thing's<00:04:57.629> so<00:04:57.810> damn<00:04:57.990> fast<00:04:58.259> it<00:04:58.650> would<00:04:58.830> break<00:04:59.129> your

00:04:59.269 --> 00:04:59.279 
thing's so damn fast it would break your

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:01.490 
thing's so damn fast it would break your
neck<00:04:59.490> it<00:04:59.699> was<00:04:59.759> too<00:04:59.969> fast<00:05:00.210> so<00:05:00.719> the<00:05:01.319> bigger

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
neck it was too fast so the bigger

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.249 
neck it was too fast so the bigger
pulley<00:05:01.770> would<00:05:01.979> slow<00:05:02.250> it<00:05:02.400> down<00:05:02.430> but<00:05:02.960> why<00:05:03.960> screw

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
pulley would slow it down but why screw

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:05.959 
pulley would slow it down but why screw
of<00:05:04.319> a<00:05:04.379> science<00:05:04.800> it<00:05:05.219> worked<00:05:05.490> that<00:05:05.669> way

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:05.969 
of a science it worked that way

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:08.450 
of a science it worked that way
the<00:05:06.389> belts<00:05:06.659> fit<00:05:06.900> it<00:05:07.050> so<00:05:07.439> we're<00:05:08.069> just<00:05:08.099> going<00:05:08.430> to

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
the belts fit it so we're just going to

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.950 
the belts fit it so we're just going to
get<00:05:08.610> another<00:05:08.729> pulley<00:05:09.150> gonna<00:05:09.990> go<00:05:10.110> to<00:05:10.169> town<00:05:10.699> yet

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
get another pulley gonna go to town yet

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.140 
get another pulley gonna go to town yet
another<00:05:12.960> pulley<00:05:13.289> and<00:05:13.620> another<00:05:14.009> pulley<00:05:14.340> and

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
another pulley and another pulley and

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.140 
another pulley and another pulley and
just<00:05:15.840> put<00:05:15.990> this<00:05:16.110> thing<00:05:16.289> back<00:05:16.469> together

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
just put this thing back together

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.519 
just put this thing back together
this<00:05:18.150> motor<00:05:18.419> lock<00:05:18.629> right<00:05:18.839> here<00:05:19.080> I've<00:05:19.199> got<00:05:19.229> the

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
this motor lock right here I've got the

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.890 
this motor lock right here I've got the
our<00:05:19.650> meter<00:05:20.009> here<00:05:20.250> summers<00:05:20.610> on<00:05:20.819> the<00:05:20.849> on<00:05:21.509> the

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
our meter here summers on the on the

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.409 
our meter here summers on the on the
harness<00:05:22.259> it's<00:05:22.710> laying<00:05:22.919> over<00:05:23.099> there<00:05:23.189> I<00:05:23.520> forget

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
harness it's laying over there I forget

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:25.760 
harness it's laying over there I forget
what's<00:05:24.629> on<00:05:24.779> this<00:05:24.930> thing<00:05:25.199> but<00:05:25.349> I'm<00:05:25.499> wanting<00:05:25.740> to

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
what's on this thing but I'm wanting to

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.800 
what's on this thing but I'm wanting to
say<00:05:25.919> that<00:05:25.949> that<00:05:26.189> motor<00:05:26.400> has<00:05:26.610> like<00:05:26.879> 40<00:05:27.300> hours<00:05:27.599> on

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
say that that motor has like 40 hours on

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.489 
say that that motor has like 40 hours on
it<00:05:27.960> or<00:05:28.080> something

00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:28.499 
it or something

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:30.860 
it or something
they<00:05:28.919> didn't<00:05:29.129> got<00:05:29.219> a<00:05:29.249> whole<00:05:29.370> lot<00:05:29.580> it's<00:05:30.449> you

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
they didn't got a whole lot it's you

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.209 
they didn't got a whole lot it's you
know<00:05:30.990> it's<00:05:31.110> set<00:05:31.319> around<00:05:31.529> four<00:05:31.800> numbers<00:05:32.069> eight

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 
know it's set around four numbers eight
