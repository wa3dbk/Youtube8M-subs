00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.400
 another new policy is coming up here 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.570
 call or duty black face is it all 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.770
 nobody is screaming through a knife 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.480
 to talk to his mother another 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.919
 language but we are going to try today with 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.600
 win your sim free pro book on the mat 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.189
 take-off ' it wieder an area with a 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.689
 peacekeeper sauce cheese in the peacekeeper 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.099
 is a pilsie weapon from the very first 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.660
 that l'cie of place or two 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.039
 and the man who plays again makes sense then 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.670

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.449
 in between you see 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.140
 but on late I map a matte map pack 4 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.910
 and there perth 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.170
 from the standard game of course because you 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.489
 do not have a partially ip workshop 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.829

 to use it is a bit of a 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:46.649
 sos rivals they might be purely natural 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.000
 because he can on the long distances 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.229

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.880
 short distances shoot there is it is one 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.979

 long distance is also a reasonable one 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.340
 high it was absolutely top and of course 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.140
 bag and sl doubts and maybe win 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.429
 with another high damage on the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.390
 long distances is just really a whole 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.530

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.130
