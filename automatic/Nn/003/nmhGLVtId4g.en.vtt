00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.080 
little bit for the offense and also I
guess<00:02:22.860> with<00:02:23.010> losing<00:02:23.310> Chris<00:02:23.519> poke<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.940> maybe

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
guess with losing Chris poke and maybe

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.009 
guess with losing Chris poke and maybe
putting<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.420> little<00:02:24.540> more<00:02:24.690> weight<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:24.930> your

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
putting a little more weight on your

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.890 
putting a little more weight on your
shoulders<00:02:25.380> in<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.920> situation<00:02:26.580> as<00:02:26.760> well<00:02:26.940> how

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900
