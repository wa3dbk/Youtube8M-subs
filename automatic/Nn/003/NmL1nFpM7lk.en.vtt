00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 

be<00:00:00.210> almost<00:00:00.420> all<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.319> way<00:00:01.350> through<00:00:01.740> in<00:00:01.979> the

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
be almost all the way through in the

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.100 
be almost all the way through in the
same<00:00:02.280> build<00:00:02.580> so<00:00:03.149> luckily<00:00:03.480> we<00:00:03.629> have<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.780> bit<00:00:03.959> of<00:00:03.990> a

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
same build so luckily we have a bit of a

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.480 
same build so luckily we have a bit of a
divergence<00:00:04.620> here<00:00:04.799> so<00:00:05.040> it'll<00:00:05.160> make<00:00:05.339> it<00:00:05.460> a

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
divergence here so it'll make it a

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.419 
divergence here so it'll make it a
little<00:00:05.580> bit<00:00:05.759> more<00:00:05.850> interesting<00:00:06.170> historic

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:07.429 
little bit more interesting historic

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.610 
little bit more interesting historic
getting<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.550> robotics<00:00:08.820> facility<00:00:09.620> almost

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
getting that robotics facility almost

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.770 
getting that robotics facility almost
certainly<00:00:10.800> going<00:00:11.099> for<00:00:11.340> Reavers<00:00:11.780> first

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
certainly going for Reavers first

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.450 
certainly going for Reavers first
especially<00:00:13.290> because<00:00:13.500> he<00:00:13.530> has<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.710> Scout<00:00:14.190> in

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
especially because he has that Scout in

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.450 
especially because he has that Scout in
widgets<00:00:15.089> base<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:15.719> he<00:00:15.750> knows<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:17.100> moujik

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
widgets base so he knows that moujik

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.950 
widgets base so he knows that moujik
isn't<00:00:17.760> getting<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.119> tech<00:00:18.390> right<00:00:18.600> now<00:00:18.750> and

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
isn't getting that tech right now and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.099 
isn't getting that tech right now and
doesn't<00:00:19.140> have<00:00:19.640> the<00:00:20.640> Civil<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.390> dune<00:00:21.600> isn't

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
doesn't have the Civil of a dune isn't

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.540 
doesn't have the Civil of a dune isn't
going<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.380> getting<00:00:22.470> dark<00:00:22.710> templar<00:00:23.220> anytime

early expand looks like voltage is

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.869 
early expand looks like voltage is
dedicated<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.200> tech<00:00:49.760> okay<00:00:52.699> infantry<00:00:53.699> bush

knows that he can afford to spend money
on<00:01:05.129> his<00:01:05.339> tech<00:01:05.580> because<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.210> ramp<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.750> it's

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
on his tech because that ramp is it's

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.770 
on his tech because that ramp is it's
really<00:01:07.260> nice<00:01:07.500> ramp<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.040> defend<00:01:08.540> whereas<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:09.570> he

aim here unless he gets that Reever out

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.389 
aim here unless he gets that Reever out
very<00:01:42.750> quickly<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:43.380> that's<00:01:43.860> true<00:01:44.070> if<00:01:44.189> he<00:01:44.280> can

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
very quickly here that's true if he can

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.859 
very quickly here that's true if he can
get<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.640> rear<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.390> he's<00:01:45.540> building

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
get that rear out we know he's building

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.569 
get that rear out we know he's building
the<00:01:45.960> Reaver<00:01:46.229> he<00:01:46.320> has<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.619> shuttle<00:01:46.950> going

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
the Reaver he has the shuttle going

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.069 
the Reaver he has the shuttle going
around<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.909> think<00:01:48.240> he'll<00:01:48.450> probably<00:01:48.689> be<00:01:48.869> able<00:01:48.930> to

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
around I think he'll probably be able to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.350 
around I think he'll probably be able to
barely<00:01:49.320> hold<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.740> off<00:01:49.890> yeah<00:01:50.640> he<00:01:50.820> sends<00:01:51.149> out<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
barely hold it off yeah he sends out the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.179 
barely hold it off yeah he sends out the
probes<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.750> distract<00:01:52.170> when<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.530> one<00:01:53.070> that

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
probes to distract when that one that

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.280 
probes to distract when that one that
drew<00:01:53.369> Dragoon<00:01:54.000> comes<00:01:54.270> out<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.930> Reavers

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
drew Dragoon comes out that Reavers

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.780 
drew Dragoon comes out that Reavers
going<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> come<00:01:55.710> out<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.310> second<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
going to come out in just a second and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.730 
going to come out in just a second and
that<00:01:57.180> might<00:01:57.450> save<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.899> game<00:01:58.079> I'm<00:01:58.350> probably

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
that might save the game I'm probably

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.440 
that might save the game I'm probably
just<00:01:58.950> being<00:01:59.070> optimistic<00:01:59.340> because<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.060> love

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
just being optimistic because I love

his economy is severely behind here i'm
actually<00:02:03.909> very<00:02:04.090> i'm<00:02:04.450> surprised<00:02:04.810> when<00:02:04.990> she

those<00:02:55.480> zealots<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.900> just<00:02:56.049> push<00:02:56.319> right<00:02:56.470> up<00:02:56.709> and

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
those zealots to just push right up and

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.890 
those zealots to just push right up and
stork<00:02:57.430> was<00:02:57.459> trying<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.819> micro<00:02:58.150> backwards<00:02:58.599> and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
stork was trying to micro backwards and

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.110 
stork was trying to micro backwards and
that<00:02:59.079> was<00:02:59.230> just<00:02:59.260> enough<00:02:59.920> for<00:03:00.670> him<00:03:00.819> to<00:03:00.849> push

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
that was just enough for him to push

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.539 
that was just enough for him to push
those<00:03:01.359> extra<00:03:01.870> two<00:03:02.140> or<00:03:02.170> three<00:03:02.590> G<00:03:02.769> goons<00:03:03.010> up<00:03:03.310> that

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
those extra two or three G goons up that

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.120 
those extra two or three G goons up that
ramp<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:05.019> take<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.470> advantage<00:03:05.739> there

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
ramp and and take the advantage there

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.309 
ramp and and take the advantage there
that<00:03:06.310> was<00:03:06.459> that<00:03:06.700> was<00:03:06.819> a<00:03:06.880> that<00:03:07.450> was<00:03:07.510> yeah<00:03:08.049> I'm

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
that was that was a that was yeah I'm

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.479 
that was that was a that was yeah I'm
really<00:03:08.620> intelligent<00:03:09.069> on<00:03:09.160> new<00:03:09.310> joke

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
really intelligent on new joke

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.280 
really intelligent on new joke
recognizing<00:03:10.180> Adly<00:03:10.569> infantry<00:03:10.930> advantage

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
recognizing Adly infantry advantage

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.349 
recognizing Adly infantry advantage
pushing<00:03:11.709> up<00:03:11.829> with<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.220> really<00:03:12.940> i<00:03:12.970> think<00:03:13.090> that's

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
pushing up with it really i think that's

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.569 
pushing up with it really i think that's
stores<00:03:13.660> fault<00:03:13.930> for<00:03:14.139> not<00:03:14.290> not<00:03:14.739> having<00:03:14.769> a<00:03:15.280> single

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
stores fault for not not having a single

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.069 
stores fault for not not having a single
driven<00:03:15.910> blocking<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.299> gate<00:03:16.510> instead<00:03:16.840> letting

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
driven blocking a gate instead letting

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.990 
driven blocking a gate instead letting
all<00:03:17.290> those<00:03:17.410> forces<00:03:17.769> kind<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.099> fan<00:03:18.400> in<00:03:18.669> that

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
all those forces kind of fan in that

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.390 
all those forces kind of fan in that
that<00:03:19.599> that<00:03:20.349> slope<00:03:20.739> I<00:03:20.919> think<00:03:21.099> you<00:03:21.160> could<00:03:21.280> have

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
that that slope I think you could have

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.800 
that that slope I think you could have
defended<00:03:21.609> it<00:03:21.849> if<00:03:21.970> you'd<00:03:22.120> left<00:03:22.359> that<00:03:22.540> single

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
defended it if you'd left that single

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.390 
defended it if you'd left that single
dragon<00:03:23.079> in<00:03:23.200> place<00:03:23.470> but<00:03:23.739> having<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.130> for

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
dragon in place but having this for

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.550 
dragon in place but having this for
spread<00:03:24.669> like<00:03:24.849> that<00:03:25.079> just<00:03:26.079> let<00:03:26.260> all<00:03:26.440> those

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
spread like that just let all those

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.559 
spread like that just let all those
dragoons<00:03:26.950> flood<00:03:27.310> up<00:03:27.459> let<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.730> zealot<00:03:28.480> to

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
dragoons flood up let the zealot to

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.390 
dragoons flood up let the zealot to
leave<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.959> that<00:03:28.989> that<00:03:29.440> was<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.799> and<00:03:30.010> just

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
leave and that that was that and just

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.339 
leave and that that was that and just
forces<00:03:31.090> even<00:03:31.690> though<00:03:31.870> there's<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.200> big

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
forces even though there's that big

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.920 
forces even though there's that big
distance<00:03:32.769> enough<00:03:33.040> force<00:03:33.280> is<00:03:33.430> coming<00:03:33.730> in<00:03:33.930> store

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
distance enough force is coming in store

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.930 
distance enough force is coming in store
closing<00:03:35.500> quickly<00:03:35.650> that's<00:03:36.280> extremely

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
closing quickly that's extremely

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.210 
closing quickly that's extremely
surprising<00:03:37.500> yeah<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.739> is<00:03:38.829> extremely

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
surprising yeah that is extremely

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.479 
surprising yeah that is extremely
surprising<00:03:39.639> I<00:03:39.849> I<00:03:40.030> i<00:03:40.480> I'd<00:03:41.200> like<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:41.560> said<00:03:41.799> I<00:03:42.010> had

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
surprising I I i I'd like you said I had

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.150 
surprising I I i I'd like you said I had
to<00:03:42.639> give<00:03:42.849> it<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.060> mojo<00:03:43.389> for<00:03:43.660> for<00:03:44.200> recognizing

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
to give it to mojo for for recognizing

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.680 
to give it to mojo for for recognizing
that<00:03:45.250> slight<00:03:45.549> advantage<00:03:45.730> that<00:03:46.150> he<00:03:46.269> had<00:03:46.450> and

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
that slight advantage that he had and

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.839 
that slight advantage that he had and
going<00:03:47.319> in<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.590> lot<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:47.859> the<00:03:47.980> times<00:03:48.220> when<00:03:48.519> players

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
going in a lot of the times when players

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.580 
going in a lot of the times when players
really<00:03:49.209> realized<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.109> the<00:03:50.200> other<00:03:50.319> players

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
really realized that the other players

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.650 
really realized that the other players
doing<00:03:51.160> text<00:03:51.639> they<00:03:51.730> don't<00:03:51.940> press<00:03:52.180> home<00:03:52.419> that's

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
doing text they don't press home that's

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.900 
doing text they don't press home that's
my<00:03:52.870> slight<00:03:53.139> advantage<00:03:53.319> and<00:03:53.769> moujik<00:03:54.519> was<00:03:54.669> able

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
my slight advantage and moujik was able

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.390 
my slight advantage and moujik was able
to<00:03:55.030> although<00:03:55.480> I<00:03:55.780> have<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.319> say<00:03:56.470> even<00:03:57.220> though
