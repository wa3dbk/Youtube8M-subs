00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.959 
users so I'm just letting you know that
now<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.250> don't<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.730> waste<00:01:02.879> your

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
now so that you don't have to waste your

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.289 
now so that you don't have to waste your
time<00:01:03.680> okay<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:04.739> when<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.489> open<00:01:05.519> 3ds<00:01:06.000> max

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
time okay so when you open 3ds max

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.440 
time okay so when you open 3ds max
obviously<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.890> pretty<00:01:08.189> familiar<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:09.000> you

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
obviously it is pretty familiar to you

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.250 
obviously it is pretty familiar to you
since<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:09.990> already<00:01:10.260> used<00:01:10.740> Maya<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
since you have already used Maya so to

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.160 
since you have already used Maya so to
set<00:01:13.500> up<00:01:13.650> your<00:01:13.860> navigation<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:15.840> go<00:01:16.080> ahead

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
set up your navigation you can go ahead

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.679 
set up your navigation you can go ahead
and<00:01:16.380> try<00:01:16.590> navigating<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.460> Maya<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.450> mean

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and try navigating in Maya and I mean

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.440 
and try navigating in Maya and I mean
studio<00:01:19.080> max<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.220> could<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.180> see

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
studio max but you could as you can see

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.320 
studio max but you could as you can see
it's<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.960> lot<00:01:22.320> different<00:01:22.530> than<00:01:22.830> Maya<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.850> two

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it's a lot different than Maya but two

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.990 
it's a lot different than Maya but two
different<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:26.549> controls<00:01:26.880> are

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
different but the the controls are

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.060 
different but the the controls are
different<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.509> navigation<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.860> you're<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
different for navigation and if you're a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.120 
different for navigation and if you're a
Maya<00:01:29.369> user<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.150> don't<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.930> know<00:01:31.619> how<00:01:32.070> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
Maya user and don't really know how to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.999 
Maya user and don't really know how to
deal<00:01:32.549> with<00:01:32.579> learning<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.780> new<00:01:34.470> way<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.680> navigate

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
deal with learning a new way to navigate

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.240 
deal with learning a new way to navigate
you<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.939> your<00:01:36.119> 3d<00:01:36.360> space<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.680> may<00:01:37.799> want<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.040> set

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you in your 3d space you may want to set

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.440 
you in your 3d space you may want to set
that<00:01:38.430> up<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.909> max<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.310> easiest<00:01:41.729> way<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.000> do

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.219 
that up in max so the easiest way to do
that<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.649> customize<00:01:44.189> menu<00:01:44.430> and

interaction to be set to Maya now this

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.729 
interaction to be set to Maya now this
may<00:02:08.759> be<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.970> good<00:02:09.300> idea<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.869> probably<00:02:10.560> is

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
may be a good idea and probably is

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.400 
may be a good idea and probably is
probably<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.340> easiest<00:02:11.550> way<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.000> go<00:02:12.330> about<00:02:12.420> it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
probably the easiest way to go about it

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.070 
probably the easiest way to go about it
this<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.770> going<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.190> change<00:02:14.990> navigation<00:02:15.990> is

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
this is going to change navigation is

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.140 
this is going to change navigation is
going<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.410> be<00:02:16.500> exactly<00:02:17.070> like<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:17.970> Maya

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
going to be exactly like it is in Maya

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.810 
going to be exactly like it is in Maya

Maya<00:02:48.710> navigation<00:02:49.710> here<00:02:50.120> was<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.390> when<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.630> was

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
Maya navigation here was that when I was

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.900 
Maya navigation here was that when I was
watching<00:02:51.960> tutorials<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:52.920> some<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.220> and

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
the person doing the tutorial would say

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.800

and since I changed mine to the Maya

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.990 
and since I changed mine to the Maya
navigation<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.860> was<00:03:05.070> completely<00:03:05.610> different

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
navigation it was completely different

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.140 
navigation it was completely different
and<00:03:06.330> B<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:07.680> keyboard<00:03:08.130> shortcuts<00:03:08.640> that<00:03:08.850> were

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
and B the keyboard shortcuts that were

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.230 
and B the keyboard shortcuts that were
shown<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:10.170> tutorials<00:03:11.100> wouldn't<00:03:11.610> be<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.970> same

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
shown in tutorials wouldn't be the same

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.190 
shown in tutorials wouldn't be the same
and<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:13.700> that's<00:03:14.700> mainly<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.330> main<00:03:15.540> problem

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
and and that's mainly the main problem

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.280 
and and that's mainly the main problem
with<00:03:16.380> doing<00:03:16.800> it<00:03:16.920> this<00:03:16.980> way<00:03:17.780> so<00:03:18.780> instead<00:03:19.230> of

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
with doing it this way so instead of

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.710 
with doing it this way so instead of
doing<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.920> way<00:03:19.980> what<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:20.459> decided<00:03:21.030> was<00:03:21.690> to

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
doing it that way what I decided was to

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.000 
doing it that way what I decided was to
just<00:03:23.000> set<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.150> up<00:03:24.300> set<00:03:25.080> up<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.530> keyboard

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
just set it up set up the keyboard

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.250 
just set it up set up the keyboard
shortcuts<00:03:26.490> myself<00:03:27.120> instead<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:27.900> doing<00:03:28.170> it

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
shortcuts myself instead of doing it

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.770 
shortcuts myself instead of doing it
this<00:03:28.410> way<00:03:28.580> so<00:03:29.580> if<00:03:29.790> you're<00:03:29.940> comfortable<00:03:30.240> just

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
this way so if you're comfortable just

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.699 
this way so if you're comfortable just
doing<00:03:30.990> it<00:03:31.080> that<00:03:31.260> way

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
doing it that way

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.770 
doing it that way
just<00:03:32.310> be<00:03:32.459> aware<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:32.970> if<00:03:33.270> you<00:03:33.390> watch<00:03:33.600> other

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
so that makes it so that our navigation

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
so that makes it so that our navigation
is<00:05:33.840> set<00:05:34.050> up<00:05:34.169> for<00:05:34.470> Maya<00:05:35.870> and<00:05:36.870> you<00:05:37.199> can<00:05:37.440> test<00:05:37.680> that

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
is set up for Maya and you can test that

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.649 
is set up for Maya and you can test that
out<00:05:37.889> here<00:05:38.130> in<00:05:38.159> the<00:05:38.340> viewport<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:38.940> it<00:05:39.449> works

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
out here in the viewport and it works

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:44.270 
out here in the viewport and it works
exactly<00:05:40.020> like<00:05:40.229> it<00:05:40.440> does<00:05:40.590> in<00:05:40.830> Maya<00:05:41.039> and<00:05:43.280> that's

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
exactly like it does in Maya and that's

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.159 
exactly like it does in Maya and that's
really<00:05:44.610> nice<00:05:44.909> because<00:05:45.240> it's<00:05:45.630> not<00:05:45.810> going<00:05:46.050> to

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
really nice because it's not going to

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.379 
really nice because it's not going to
change<00:05:46.729> keyboard<00:05:47.729> shortcuts<00:05:48.150> that<00:05:48.240> are

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
change keyboard shortcuts that are

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.779 
change keyboard shortcuts that are
already<00:05:48.810> assigned<00:05:49.229> for<00:05:49.620> max<00:05:49.830> so<00:05:50.550> if<00:05:50.580> you're

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
already assigned for max so if you're

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.430 
already assigned for max so if you're
watching<00:05:50.940> a<00:05:51.150> tutorial<00:05:51.479> and<00:05:51.810> they<00:05:51.930> say

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
watching a tutorial and they say

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.200 
watching a tutorial and they say
something<00:05:53.099> or<00:05:53.220> keyboard<00:05:53.639> shortcut<00:05:54.000> it's

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
something or keyboard shortcut it's

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.760 
something or keyboard shortcut it's
going<00:05:54.479> to<00:05:54.570> work<00:05:54.690> perfectly<00:05:56.720> ok<00:05:57.720> so<00:05:58.560> that's

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
going to work perfectly ok so that's

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.450 
going to work perfectly ok so that's
pretty<00:05:59.070> much<00:05:59.280> how<00:05:59.520> you<00:05:59.580> set<00:06:00.030> up<00:06:00.060> your<00:06:00.509> new

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
pretty much how you set up your new

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.879 
pretty much how you set up your new
navigation<00:06:02.460> for<00:06:02.849> Maya<00:06:03.090> and<00:06:03.449> in<00:06:04.440> a<00:06:04.530> way<00:06:04.710> that

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
navigation for Maya and in a way that

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.159 
navigation for Maya and in a way that
doesn't<00:06:05.099> mess<00:06:05.430> up<00:06:05.690> shortcuts<00:06:06.690> that<00:06:07.050> are

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
doesn't mess up shortcuts that are

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.640 
doesn't mess up shortcuts that are
already<00:06:07.320> default<00:06:08.039> in<00:06:08.250> max<00:06:08.599> ok<00:06:09.599> so<00:06:10.229> in<00:06:10.349> the<00:06:10.440> next

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
already default in max ok so in the next

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.710 
already default in max ok so in the next
video<00:06:11.130> I'm<00:06:11.190> going<00:06:11.370> to<00:06:11.460> show<00:06:11.789> you<00:06:11.820> how<00:06:12.360> to<00:06:12.419> set
