posted a video and a she's trying on the
lap<00:00:07.310> missing<00:00:07.939> the<00:00:08.060> gate<00:00:08.300> so<00:00:09.140> i<00:00:09.880> wanted<00:00:10.880> to<00:00:10.970> go

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.060 
lap missing the gate so i wanted to go

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.000 
lap missing the gate so i wanted to go
over<00:00:11.090> speaking<00:00:11.540> pattern<00:00:11.870> that<00:00:12.110> that<00:00:12.590> I<00:00:12.680> found

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
over speaking pattern that that I found

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.000 
over speaking pattern that that I found
really<00:00:13.100> helpful<00:00:13.660> in<00:00:14.660> my<00:00:14.900> plane<00:00:15.230> that<00:00:15.560> you<00:00:15.830> can

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
really helpful in my plane that you can

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.259 
really helpful in my plane that you can
use<00:00:16.460> it<00:00:16.490> a<00:00:16.640> lot<00:00:16.730> of<00:00:16.820> different<00:00:17.029> subdivisions

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:17.269 
use it a lot of different subdivisions

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:19.599 
use it a lot of different subdivisions
so<00:00:17.660> let's<00:00:17.929> get<00:00:18.019> right<00:00:18.140> down<00:00:18.199> to<00:00:18.380> it<00:00:18.619> the

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
so let's get right down to it the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.370 
so let's get right down to it the
stinking<00:00:19.939> pattern<00:00:20.269> is<00:00:20.359> going<00:00:20.480> to<00:00:20.539> be<00:00:20.660> right

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
stinking pattern is going to be right

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.859 
stinking pattern is going to be right
left<00:00:21.679> right<00:00:22.189> left<00:00:22.249> left<00:00:22.640> for<00:00:23.329> the<00:00:23.419> first<00:00:23.630> one

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
left right left left for the first one

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.779 
left right left left for the first one
and<00:00:24.079> we're<00:00:24.619> going<00:00:24.740> to<00:00:24.769> base<00:00:24.949> off<00:00:25.189> 16<00:00:25.669> up

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
and we're going to base off 16 up

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.909 
and we're going to base off 16 up
triplets<00:00:26.240> or<00:00:26.419> excuse<00:00:26.839> me<00:00:26.960> 16<00:00:27.349> notes<00:00:27.499> at<00:00:27.710> first

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
triplets or excuse me 16 notes at first

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.550 
triplets or excuse me 16 notes at first
so<00:00:28.849> it's<00:00:29.300> going<00:00:29.390> to<00:00:29.449> descend<00:00:29.869> on<00:00:29.989> Tom's<00:00:30.289> going

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
so it's going to descend on Tom's going

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.950 
so it's going to descend on Tom's going
to<00:00:30.650> start<00:00:30.890> on<00:00:31.070> hi<00:00:31.400> Tom<00:00:31.699> move<00:00:32.600> to<00:00:32.690> the<00:00:32.780> middle

to start on hi Tom move to the middle

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.500 
to start on hi Tom move to the middle

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.200 

alright<00:01:22.390> so<00:01:23.110> that's<00:01:23.260> um<00:01:23.920> when<00:01:24.820> outside

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
alright so that's um when outside

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.510 
alright so that's um when outside
discovered<00:01:25.840> was<00:01:25.990> that<00:01:26.020> if<00:01:26.470> you<00:01:26.500> put<00:01:27.010> a<00:01:27.070> bass

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
discovered was that if you put a bass

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.140 
discovered was that if you put a bass
drum<00:01:27.960> after<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.470> left<00:01:29.770> left<00:01:30.190> you<00:01:30.670> get<00:01:30.880> six

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
drum after the left left you get six

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.700 
drum after the left left you get six
notes<00:01:31.360> obviously<00:01:31.810> but<00:01:31.990> you<00:01:32.050> can<00:01:32.170> use<00:01:32.290> that<00:01:32.470> as

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
notes obviously but you can use that as

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.040 
notes obviously but you can use that as
a<00:01:32.740> 16<00:01:33.340> uh<00:01:33.430> triplet<00:01:33.910> so<00:01:34.690> that<00:01:34.960> Phil<00:01:35.320> would<00:01:35.650> be

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
a 16 uh triplet so that Phil would be

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.480 
a 16 uh triplet so that Phil would be
you<00:01:38.050> would<00:01:38.170> cycle<00:01:38.440> that<00:01:38.680> over<00:01:39.010> four<00:01:39.250> times

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
you would cycle that over four times

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.700 
you would cycle that over four times
with<00:01:40.210> a<00:01:40.240> double<00:01:40.690> bass<00:01:40.900> drum<00:01:41.200> on<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:41.350> end<00:01:41.560> to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
with a double bass drum on the end to

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.880 
with a double bass drum on the end to
get<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:42.010> one<00:01:42.190> so<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.550> would<00:01:42.640> be<00:01:46.620> does<00:01:47.620> it<00:01:47.740> have

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
get the one so it would be does it have

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.310 
get the one so it would be does it have
to<00:01:48.040> feel<00:01:48.280> like<00:01:48.460> 60<00:01:48.790> not<00:01:48.940> triplets<00:01:49.180> again<00:01:49.660> kind

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
to feel like 60 not triplets again kind

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.749 
to feel like 60 not triplets again kind
of<00:01:50.380> like<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.590> if<00:01:56.680> you<00:01:56.800> just<00:01:57.040> solo<00:01:57.400> the

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
of like that so if you just solo the

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.499 
of like that so if you just solo the
bass<00:01:57.970> drum<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.540> right<00:01:59.140> hand<00:01:59.440> maybe

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.999 

that's<00:02:04.509> what<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.810> 16<00:02:05.170> on<00:02:05.290> triple<00:02:05.619> Phyllis

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
that's what the 16 on triple Phyllis

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.370 
that's what the 16 on triple Phyllis
sound<00:02:06.220> like<00:02:06.369> so<00:02:06.490> here<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.729> is

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:25.980 

vinegar

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.140 

alright<00:02:26.990> so<00:02:27.410> here's<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.830> 69<00:02:28.310> triplet<00:02:28.670> fell<00:02:28.880> in

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
alright so here's the 69 triplet fell in

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:41.220 
alright so here's the 69 triplet fell in
a<00:02:29.360> group

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.600 

so<00:02:42.230> at<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:42.500> very<00:02:42.530> end<00:02:42.980> instead<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.370> doing<00:02:43.550> the

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
so at the very end instead of doing the

so at the very end instead of doing the
same<00:02:43.819> filled<00:02:44.180> up<00:02:44.770> i'm<00:02:45.770> doing<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:48.610> base<00:02:49.610> if<00:02:49.790> you

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
same filled up i'm doing a base if you

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.970 
same filled up i'm doing a base if you
want<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.090> simplify<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.690> would<00:02:50.959> be<00:02:51.110> right<00:02:51.530> left

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
want to simplify it would be right left

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.729 
want to simplify it would be right left
right<00:02:52.370> right<00:02:53.680> symbol<00:02:56.080> it'd<00:02:57.080> be<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.260> fill<00:02:57.590> as

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
right right symbol it'd be a fill as

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:07.360 
right right symbol it'd be a fill as
well<00:03:04.209> right<00:03:05.440> but<00:03:06.440> what<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:06.680> do<00:03:06.769> is<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.100> played<00:03:07.340> a

tom then you move to the floor time to
the<00:03:28.819> snare<00:03:29.030> drum

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130

stand up kind of for some solidity to

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.890 
stand up kind of for some solidity to
the<00:04:32.919> that's<00:04:33.919> kind<00:04:34.129> of<00:04:34.159> cool<00:04:34.370> group<00:04:34.639> the<00:04:35.599> next

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
the that's kind of cool group the next

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.450 
the that's kind of cool group the next
thing<00:04:35.990> you<00:04:36.080> can<00:04:36.229> do<00:04:36.379> with<00:04:36.500> it<00:04:36.560> is<00:04:36.860> you<00:04:37.099> can<00:04:37.219> put

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
thing you can do with it is you can put

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.290 
thing you can do with it is you can put
it<00:04:37.550> as<00:04:37.639> 32nd<00:04:38.360> notes<00:04:38.710> so<00:04:39.710> now<00:04:40.669> they<00:04:40.849> get<00:04:40.939> six

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
it as 32nd notes so now they get six

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.020 
it as 32nd notes so now they get six
notes<00:04:41.569> you<00:04:41.780> can't<00:04:42.050> fit<00:04:42.319> the<00:04:42.800> six<00:04:43.520> no<00:04:43.639> grouping

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
notes you can't fit the six no grouping

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.879 
notes you can't fit the six no grouping
and<00:04:44.120> into<00:04:44.300> 32<00:04:44.599> notes<00:04:44.780> you<00:04:45.050> can<00:04:45.080> only<00:04:45.259> get<00:04:45.469> it<00:04:45.530> 30

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
and into 32 notes you can only get it 30

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.429 
and into 32 notes you can only get it 30
right<00:04:46.520> 6<00:04:46.729> times<00:04:46.879> 5<00:04:47.060> is<00:04:47.120> 30<00:04:47.479> so<00:04:47.810> it<00:04:47.930> leaves<00:04:48.110> over

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:48.439 
right 6 times 5 is 30 so it leaves over

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:52.390 
right 6 times 5 is 30 so it leaves over
two<00:04:49.009> notes<00:04:49.250> so<00:04:50.060> if<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:50.689> last<00:04:50.960> group<00:04:51.439> of<00:04:51.680> six

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
two notes so if the last group of six

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.800 
two notes so if the last group of six
would<00:04:52.969> be<00:04:54.280> that<00:04:55.280> would<00:04:55.430> be<00:04:55.610> 30<00:04:55.969> if<00:04:56.569> I<00:04:56.750> do

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
would be that would be 30 if I do

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.070 
would be that would be 30 if I do
another<00:04:57.349> base<00:04:57.590> on<00:04:57.770> that<00:04:57.919> be<00:04:58.150> 31<00:04:59.150> followed<00:05:00.050> by

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
another base on that be 31 followed by

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.679 
another base on that be 31 followed by
the<00:05:00.229> snare<00:05:01.120> you<00:05:02.120> see<00:05:02.300> me<00:05:02.419> yeah<00:05:02.900> snare<00:05:03.939> as<00:05:04.939> 32

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:08.499 
the snare you see me yeah snare as 32
and<00:05:06.050> then<00:05:06.379> a<00:05:06.409> downbeat<00:05:07.000> three<00:05:08.000> so<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.270> last

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
and then a downbeat three so the last

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:14.050 
and then a downbeat three so the last
group<00:05:08.840> of<00:05:09.020> six<00:05:09.319> would<00:05:09.620> be<00:05:12.520> okay<00:05:13.520> to<00:05:13.580> finish<00:05:13.939> it
