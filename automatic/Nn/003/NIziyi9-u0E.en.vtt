00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:14.859

that<00:01:15.100> says<00:01:15.399> our<00:01:15.759> thoughts<00:01:16.109> become<00:01:17.109> words<00:01:17.560> and

00:01:18.059 --> 00:01:18.069 
that says our thoughts become words and

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:19.830 
that says our thoughts become words and
our<00:01:18.159> words<00:01:18.369> become<00:01:18.759> actions<00:01:19.240> our<00:01:19.450> actions

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840

become habit and our habits become our
character<00:01:23.319> and<00:01:23.679> then<00:01:24.130> our<00:01:24.280> character<00:01:24.609> becomes

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
character and then our character becomes

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.919 
character and then our character becomes
something<00:01:25.060> else<00:01:25.210> but<00:01:25.299> I<00:01:25.359> forget<00:01:25.630> what<00:01:25.749> it<00:01:25.840> is

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929
