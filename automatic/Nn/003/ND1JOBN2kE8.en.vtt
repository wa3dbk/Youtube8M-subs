that it's not common knowledge to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.779

well as its functionality because

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.350 
well as its functionality because
they're<00:00:38.280> talking<00:00:38.579> about<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.820> stony<00:00:39.059> side<00:00:39.270> of

talk about that for a little bit but yes
so<00:00:48.239> we'll<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.510> comparing<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> consoles<00:00:49.410> today

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
so we'll be comparing the consoles today

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.680 
so we'll be comparing the consoles today
let's<00:00:50.129> get<00:00:50.370> straight<00:00:50.579> into<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
let's get straight into it with the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.479 
let's get straight into it with the
graphics<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.530> first<00:00:52.710> thing<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.949> notice<00:00:53.309> when

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
graphics the first thing you notice when

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.910 
graphics the first thing you notice when
you<00:00:53.550> play<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> game<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.379> minecraft<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.890> game

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
you play a game and minecraft is a game

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.340 
you play a game and minecraft is a game
that<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.370> very<00:00:56.910> very<00:00:57.270> limited<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.199> they

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
that is very very limited and they

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.810 
that is very very limited and they
affect<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> graphics<00:00:59.039> tablet<00:00:59.340> because<00:00:59.670> it's

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
affect the graphics tablet because it's

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.189 
affect the graphics tablet because it's
Minecraft<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.420> literally<00:01:00.809> you're<00:01:00.930> placing

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
Minecraft it's literally you're placing

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.650 
Minecraft it's literally you're placing
blocks<00:01:01.590> that's<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.129> you're<00:01:02.309> doing<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.789> yeah

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
blocks that's what you're doing and yeah

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.570 
blocks that's what you're doing and yeah
you<00:01:03.719> can<00:01:03.989> get<00:01:04.439> basically<00:01:04.769> even<00:01:05.070> though<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you can get basically even though on the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.700 
you can get basically even though on the
PS<00:01:05.790> Vita<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> 540<00:01:06.840> P<00:01:06.990> screen<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.470> on

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
PS Vita you have a 540 P screen and on

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.210 
PS Vita you have a 540 P screen and on
the<00:01:07.799> ps4

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the ps4

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.370 
the ps4
it's<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.460> 1080p<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.600> know<00:01:09.720> display<00:01:10.140> so

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
it's a 1080p you know display so

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.410 
it's a 1080p you know display so
basically<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.369> kid<00:01:11.640> its<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.970> theoretically

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
basically you kid its to theoretically

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.539 
basically you kid its to theoretically
quadruple<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> pixels<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.159> any<00:01:14.310> regular

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
quadruple the pixels and in any regular

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.160 
quadruple the pixels and in any regular
game<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.180> would<00:01:15.299> make<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.570> look<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.140> much

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
game that would make it look so much

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.469 
game that would make it look so much
nicer<00:01:16.560> goddess<00:01:17.280> what<00:01:17.400> they<00:01:17.520> do<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:18.210> because

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
nicer goddess what they do but because

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.149 
nicer goddess what they do but because
it's<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:18.900> crop<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.500> said<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.040> a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
it's my crop like I said and it is a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.800 
it's my crop like I said and it is a
smaller<00:01:20.490> screen<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.180> pixel<00:01:21.509> density

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
smaller screen so you know pixel density

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.450 
smaller screen so you know pixel density
blah<00:01:22.020> blah<00:01:22.470> obviously<00:01:23.040> because<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.369> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
blah blah obviously because it's a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.120 
blah blah obviously because it's a
smaller<00:01:23.820> screen<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.479> looks<00:01:24.689> roughly<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.890> same

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
smaller screen it looks roughly the same

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.190 
smaller screen it looks roughly the same
like<00:01:26.400> there<00:01:26.580> are<00:01:26.670> some<00:01:26.909> definite<00:01:27.509> niceties<00:01:27.990> on

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
like there are some definite niceties on

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.350 
like there are some definite niceties on
the<00:01:28.290> ps4<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.460> render<00:01:29.790> distance<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.180> nice

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
the ps4 and the render distance is nice

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.480 
the ps4 and the render distance is nice
the<00:01:30.570> better<00:01:30.750> view<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.650> object<00:01:32.009> stuff<00:01:32.220> looks

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the better view the object stuff looks

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.999 
the better view the object stuff looks
nice<00:01:32.670> honestly<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:33.869> if<00:01:34.380> they're<00:01:34.590> given<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
nice honestly it's if they're given the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.140 
nice honestly it's if they're given the
difference<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> technical

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
difference that the technical

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.730 
difference that the technical
specifications<00:01:36.720> are<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.170> doesn't<00:01:37.619> look

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
specifications are it doesn't look

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.039 
specifications are it doesn't look
anywhere<00:01:38.189> near<00:01:38.520> as<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.210> know<00:01:39.329> stock<00:01:39.630> hips<00:01:39.840> as

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
anywhere near as you know stock hips as

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:40.550 
anywhere near as you know stock hips as
you<00:01:40.079> might<00:01:40.290> think

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
you might think

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.230 
you might think
and<00:01:40.710> again<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.189> Minecraft<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:41.939> not<00:01:42.090> that

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
and again it's Minecraft it's not that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.149 
and again it's Minecraft it's not that
big<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.390> deal<00:01:42.420> anyway<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:42.990> as<00:01:43.560> far<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:43.829> graphics

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
big a deal anyway so as far as graphics

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.399 
big a deal anyway so as far as graphics
go<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> nice<00:01:45.270> upgrade<00:01:45.509> from<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.990> ps3

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409

quite as big as you might expect because

my<00:01:51.030> cropped

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
my cropped

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.330 
my cropped
but<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.110> realize<00:01:52.710> I'm<00:01:52.860> gonna<00:01:52.980> have<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.160> mention

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
but I realize I'm gonna have to mention

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.630 
but I realize I'm gonna have to mention
that<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.640> game<00:01:53.760> is<00:01:53.940> minecraft<00:01:55.040> so<00:01:56.040> let's<00:01:56.520> move

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
that the game is minecraft so let's move

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.950 
that the game is minecraft so let's move
on<00:01:56.760> to<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.940> second<00:01:57.300> part<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.630> is

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
on to the second part and that is

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.050 
on to the second part and that is
control<00:01:58.500> scheme<00:01:58.830> what<00:01:59.070> controls<00:01:59.640> we<00:01:59.820> have<00:01:59.850> to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
control scheme what controls we have to

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.760 
control scheme what controls we have to
get<00:02:00.150> used<00:02:00.300> to<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.780> move<00:02:00.990> from<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.320> PS<00:02:01.560> Vita

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
get used to it you move from the PS Vita

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.190 
get used to it you move from the PS Vita
to<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.040> ps4<00:02:02.490> or<00:02:02.640> vice<00:02:03.180> versa<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.870> basically

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
to the ps4 or vice versa so basically

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200 
to the ps4 or vice versa so basically
even<00:02:04.800> though<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.730> both<00:02:05.880> PlayStation

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
even though they the both PlayStation

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.150 
even though they the both PlayStation
leave<00:02:06.480> the<00:02:06.630> same<00:02:06.780> control<00:02:07.260> of<00:02:07.380> being<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:08.040> big

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
leave the same control of being the big

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.370 
leave the same control of being the big
kind<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.430> difference<00:02:08.820> is<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.750> figured

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
kind of difference is that you figured

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.600 
kind of difference is that you figured
that<00:02:10.410> they<00:02:10.649> both<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.070> touched<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.460> three

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
that they both have touched and three

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.040 
that they both have touched and three
devices<00:02:11.940> which<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.420> really<00:02:12.690> different

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
devices which is really different

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.230 
devices which is really different
however<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.740> ps4<00:02:14.070> touchpad<00:02:14.610> isn't<00:02:14.910> properly

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
however the ps4 touchpad isn't properly

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.790 
however the ps4 touchpad isn't properly
being<00:02:15.480> used<00:02:15.750> yet<00:02:15.990> as<00:02:16.140> far<00:02:16.320> as<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.470> understand

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
being used yet as far as I understand

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.830 
being used yet as far as I understand
and<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.280> PS<00:02:17.490> Vita<00:02:17.730> only<00:02:18.180> has<00:02:18.300> very<00:02:18.510> basic

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
and the PS Vita only has very basic

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.720 
and the PS Vita only has very basic
touch<00:02:19.020> control<00:02:19.410> which<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.160> know<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.490> means

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
touch control which you know it means

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.880 
touch control which you know it means
the<00:02:21.090> reality<00:02:21.780> if<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.020> go<00:02:22.230> once<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.710> other

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
the reality if you go once the other

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.470 
the reality if you go once the other
it'll<00:02:23.220> be<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.400> pretty<00:02:23.700> smooth<00:02:23.940> expense<00:02:24.270> picker

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
it'll be a pretty smooth expense picker

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.720 
it'll be a pretty smooth expense picker
as<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:25.170> know<00:02:25.260> my<00:02:25.590> handheld<00:02:25.890> console<00:02:26.520> button

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
as you know my handheld console button

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.900 
as you know my handheld console button
so<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.660> control<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.200> very<00:02:28.620> similar<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.430> buses

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
so the control of very similar to buses

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.320 
so the control of very similar to buses
there<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.240> any<00:02:30.420> quiz<00:02:31.610> which<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.640> kind<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.120> nice

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
there is any quiz which is kind of nice

there is any quiz which is kind of nice
I<00:02:33.630> mean<00:02:33.750> doing<00:02:33.990> differences<00:02:34.650> drop<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.130> offer

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
I mean doing differences drop the offer
