mache cover over my masking tape mask
not<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.840> much<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> masking<00:00:25.740> tape<00:00:25.890> mask<00:00:26.160> itself

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
not so much the masking tape mask itself

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.900 
not so much the masking tape mask itself
but<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:26.970> mask<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:27.720> masking<00:00:28.199> tape<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.910> I'm

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
but the mask with masking tape on it I'm

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.209 
but the mask with masking tape on it I'm
very<00:00:29.970> very<00:00:30.359> happy<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:30.869> how<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.109> came<00:00:31.140> out<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
very very happy with how it came out the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.479 
very very happy with how it came out the
masking<00:00:32.700> tape<00:00:32.940> did<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.690> fact<00:00:34.370> keep<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
masking tape did in fact keep the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.729 
masking tape did in fact keep the
integrity<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:36.120> all<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.690> edges<00:00:37.020> they're<00:00:37.469> very

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
integrity of all the edges they're very

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.000 
integrity of all the edges they're very
sharp<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.280> very<00:00:38.370> clean<00:00:39.440> as<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.800> see

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
sharp and very clean as you can see

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.700 
sharp and very clean as you can see
there<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.340> no<00:00:41.760> working<00:00:43.399> and<00:00:45.379> everything<00:00:46.379> is

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
there is no working and everything is

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.900 
there is no working and everything is
left<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.760> should<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.500> on<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:50.309> camera<00:00:50.730> i<00:00:50.760> do

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
left as it should be on the camera i do

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.510 
left as it should be on the camera i do
see<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> lot<00:00:51.420> more<00:00:51.570> now<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:53.190> edge<00:00:53.489> here

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
see a lot more now that this edge here

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.139 
see a lot more now that this edge here
is<00:00:54.620> protruding<00:00:55.620> slightly<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.550> means<00:00:56.879> i

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
is protruding slightly so that means i

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.939 
is protruding slightly so that means i
will<00:00:57.360> be<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.750> back<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.289> adding<00:00:58.469> more

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
will be going back and adding more

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.740 
will be going back and adding more
layers<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.430> figure<00:00:59.699> machine<00:01:00.000> which<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.420> have

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
layers of figure machine which I have

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.329 
layers of figure machine which I have
right<00:01:00.899> there<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:03.570> want<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.989> build<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.100> up

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
right there and I want to build this up

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.750 
right there and I want to build this up
in<00:01:05.729> embark<00:01:07.909> making<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.659> even<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.760> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
in embark making it just as even and the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.590 
in embark making it just as even and the
rest<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.689> helmet<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.030> all<00:01:15.150> perfectly

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
rest of the helmet so it's all perfectly

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.780 
rest of the helmet so it's all perfectly
smooth<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.530> does<00:01:16.740> look<00:01:16.770> good<00:01:17.070> now<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.640> it

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
smooth it does look good now and it

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.660 
smooth it does look good now and it
could<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.210> used<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:19.400> that<00:01:20.400> being<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
could be used as is that being the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.550 
could be used as is that being the
perfectionist<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.420> am<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.990> I've<00:01:22.110> done<00:01:22.409> this

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
perfectionist I am that I've done this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.440 
perfectionist I am that I've done this
already<00:01:22.799> four<00:01:23.220> different<00:01:23.520> times<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.180> don't

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
already four different times I don't

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.240 
already four different times I don't
want<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.990> again<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.270> will<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:28.250> fixing

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
want to do it again so I will be fixing

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.999 
want to do it again so I will be fixing
that<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> couple<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.090> key<00:01:30.270> points<00:01:30.509> is

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
that but a couple of the key points is

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.510 
that but a couple of the key points is
the<00:01:32.009> way<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.159> did<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.490> eyes<00:01:33.229> there<00:01:34.229> are

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
the way I did the eyes there are

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.940 
the way I did the eyes there are
individual<00:01:35.520> layers<00:01:35.840> not<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.049> much<00:01:37.170> individual

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
individual layers not so much individual

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.069 
individual layers not so much individual
layers<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.329> layer<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.869> did

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
layers as in just one layer but I did

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.460 
layers as in just one layer but I did
each<00:01:40.470> strip<00:01:41.070> as<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:42.049> what<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.110> did<00:01:43.320> was

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
each strip as you can see what I did was

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.270 
each strip as you can see what I did was
I<00:01:43.560> took<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.950> long<00:01:44.189> piece<00:01:45.439> about<00:01:46.439> yay<00:01:46.680> long<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
I took one long piece about yay long and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.010 
I took one long piece about yay long and
I<00:01:47.369> would<00:01:47.610> dip<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.210> then<00:01:48.509> fold<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:54.119> it

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
I would dip it and then fold it in so it

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.469 
I would dip it and then fold it in so it
covers<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.500> eyes<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.070> there's<00:01:56.790> no<00:01:56.939> gaps<00:01:57.240> or

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
covers the eyes and there's no gaps or

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.740 
covers the eyes and there's no gaps or
seams<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> eyes<00:01:58.200> itself<00:02:00.740> top<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.070> bottom

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
seams on the eyes itself top and bottom

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.630 
seams on the eyes itself top and bottom
that's<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:04.049> prevent<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.619> from<00:02:04.829> warping<00:02:05.520> and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
that's to prevent it from warping and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.130 
that's to prevent it from warping and
expanding<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.270> getting<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.659> between<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
expanding and getting in between the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.119 
expanding and getting in between the
layer<00:02:07.290> paper<00:02:07.619> mache<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> card<00:02:08.580> stock

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
layer paper mache in the card stock

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.360 
layer paper mache in the card stock
right<00:02:11.129> here<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:12.030> can<00:02:12.209> see<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.780> ray

right here you can see a ray

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.940 
right here you can see a ray
is<00:02:13.430> section<00:02:13.970> from<00:02:14.180> where<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.540> drive<00:02:14.870> I'm<00:02:15.769> going

phase to make it look better is going to

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.670 
phase to make it look better is going to
make<00:02:34.970> things<00:02:35.239> easier<00:02:35.659> when<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:35.989> get<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.470> the

make things easier when you get to the
fiberglassing<00:02:37.340> stage<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.900> will<00:02:39.019> be<00:02:39.470> less

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
fiberglassing stage it will be less

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.750 
fiberglassing stage it will be less
sanding<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:41.390> less<00:02:41.629> marks<00:02:42.019> on<00:02:42.799> my<00:02:43.010> last<00:02:43.220> one<00:02:43.489> I

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
sanding and less marks on my last one I

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.039 
sanding and less marks on my last one I
ended<00:02:44.450> up<00:02:44.540> having<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.959> sand<00:02:45.620> down<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:46.129> the

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
ended up having to sand down to the

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.509 
ended up having to sand down to the
paper<00:02:48.049> mache<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.890> could<00:02:49.010> actually<00:02:49.040> see

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
paper mache and you could actually see

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.000 
paper mache and you could actually see
the<00:02:49.670> scuffing<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.120> we're<00:02:50.420> on<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:51.379> and<00:02:51.590> then<00:02:51.709> re

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
the scuffing and we're on it and then re

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.800 
the scuffing and we're on it and then re
paper<00:02:52.250> mache<00:02:52.609> on<00:02:52.730> top<00:02:52.970> of<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.359> not<00:02:53.569> paper

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
paper mache on top of that not paper

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.960 
paper mache on top of that not paper
machine<00:02:54.140> sorry<00:02:54.620> fiberglass<00:02:55.160> on<00:02:55.370> top<00:02:55.609> of<00:02:55.790> that

machine sorry fiberglass on top of that

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.280 
machine sorry fiberglass on top of that
and<00:02:58.030> then<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.209> just<00:02:59.450> ditches<00:02:59.810> came<00:02:59.989> out<00:03:00.170> all

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
and then it just ditches came out all

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.750 
and then it just ditches came out all
and<00:03:00.470> even<00:03:00.560> that's<00:03:00.920> probably<00:03:01.310> where<00:03:01.579> my

and even that's probably where my

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.069 
and even that's probably where my
problem<00:03:02.150> was<00:03:02.299> with<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.739> pitting<00:03:03.819> so<00:03:05.079> it's

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
problem was with the pitting so it's

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.869 
problem was with the pitting so it's

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
that's how it is I paper mache both the

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.599 
that's how it is I paper mache both the
inside<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.799> outside<00:03:27.829> and<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.459> really

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
inside and the outside and it really

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.240 
inside and the outside and it really
spend<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:29.000> whole<00:03:29.120> lot<00:03:29.180> of<00:03:29.299> time<00:03:29.569> doing<00:03:30.530> the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.949 
spend a whole lot of time doing the
inside<00:03:31.609> and<00:03:32.120> make<00:03:32.180> it<00:03:32.299> look<00:03:32.389> overly<00:03:32.690> neat

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
inside and make it look overly neat

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.080 
inside and make it look overly neat
because<00:03:33.200> I'm<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:34.190> inside<00:03:34.519> you're<00:03:34.819> not<00:03:34.970> going

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
because I'm the inside you're not going

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.259 
because I'm the inside you're not going
to<00:03:35.150> really<00:03:35.269> worry<00:03:35.569> about<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:35.989> part<00:03:37.269> but

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
to really worry about that part but

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.089 
to really worry about that part but
again<00:03:38.629> there<00:03:39.319> is<00:03:39.590> very<00:03:40.220> very<00:03:40.879> very<00:03:41.180> miniscule

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
again there is very very very miniscule

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.430 
again there is very very very miniscule
amounts<00:03:43.099> of<00:03:43.250> warpage<00:03:43.810> right<00:03:44.810> on<00:03:44.959> this<00:03:45.199> edge

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
amounts of warpage right on this edge

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.900 
amounts of warpage right on this edge
that<00:03:45.829> I<00:03:45.919> noticed<00:03:47.410> it<00:03:48.410> just<00:03:49.099> barely<00:03:49.430> curved

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
that I noticed it just barely curved

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.430 
that I noticed it just barely curved
opposed<00:03:50.329> to<00:03:50.480> this<00:03:50.599> one<00:03:50.810> which<00:03:50.840> is<00:03:51.019> straight

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
opposed to this one which is straight

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.430 
opposed to this one which is straight
I'm<00:03:52.190> not<00:03:52.400> worried<00:03:52.699> about<00:03:52.760> that<00:03:52.970> it's<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:54.199> very

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
I'm not worried about that it's so very

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.470 
I'm not worried about that it's so very
minor<00:03:54.739> that<00:03:55.010> it<00:03:55.129> won't<00:03:55.280> even<00:03:55.459> it<00:03:56.209> won't<00:03:56.419> even

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
minor that it won't even it won't even

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.949 
minor that it won't even it won't even
be<00:03:56.720> a<00:03:56.750> factor<00:03:57.230> for<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:58.430> final<00:03:58.760> product<00:03:59.000> but

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
be a factor for the final product but

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.670 
be a factor for the final product but
this<00:04:00.349> mask<00:04:00.620> is<00:04:00.980> turning<00:04:01.370> out<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:02.690> hundred

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
this mask is turning out a hundred

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.800 
this mask is turning out a hundred
percent<00:04:03.739> better<00:04:04.069> than<00:04:04.639> the<00:04:04.760> other<00:04:04.910> one<00:04:05.150> I'm

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
percent better than the other one I'm

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.809 
percent better than the other one I'm
very<00:04:05.870> satisfied<00:04:06.709> with<00:04:07.010> it<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.430> think<00:04:07.669> by

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
very satisfied with it and I think by

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.150 
very satisfied with it and I think by
the<00:04:07.879> end<00:04:08.000> of<00:04:08.180> this<00:04:08.299> tutorial<00:04:09.459> it<00:04:10.459> will<00:04:10.609> be

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
the end of this tutorial it will be

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.650 
the end of this tutorial it will be
something<00:04:13.160> with<00:04:14.000> displaying<00:04:14.510> worth<00:04:14.930> learning

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
something with displaying worth learning

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.890 
something with displaying worth learning
the<00:04:17.660> nose<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:17.870> still<00:04:18.289> open<00:04:18.470> for<00:04:18.859> breathing<00:04:19.609> and

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
the nose is still open for breathing and

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.140 
the nose is still open for breathing and
I<00:04:20.900> will<00:04:21.139> once<00:04:21.469> the<00:04:21.739> fiberglass<00:04:22.250> is<00:04:22.430> on<00:04:22.610> I<00:04:22.880> will

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
I will once the fiberglass is on I will

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.650 
I will once the fiberglass is on I will
be<00:04:23.360> cutting<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.900> lines<00:04:24.110> for

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
be cutting the lines for

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.270 
be cutting the lines for
or<00:04:24.800> easier<00:04:25.800> speech<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:27.270> then<00:04:28.140> that's<00:04:29.100> about

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
or easier speech and then that's about

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.610 
or easier speech and then that's about
it<00:04:29.340> so<00:04:29.820> this<00:04:30.000> is<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.210> son<00:04:30.600> Alexander<00:04:31.140> for<00:04:31.320> part

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
it so this is the son Alexander for part

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.000 
it so this is the son Alexander for part
