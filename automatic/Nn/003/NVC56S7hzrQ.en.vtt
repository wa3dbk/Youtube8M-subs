dark coppery bronzy brown in color so
when<00:02:45.910> you<00:02:46.030> lift<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.390> out<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.780> bottle<00:02:47.380> just

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
when you lift it out of the bottle just

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.440 
when you lift it out of the bottle just
be<00:02:48.040> sure<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:49.300> wipe<00:02:49.480> one<00:02:49.840> side<00:02:51.060> turn<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.239> side

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
be sure to wipe one side turn the side

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.120 
be sure to wipe one side turn the side
of<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.660> bottle<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.080> then<00:02:53.230> use<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.980> other

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
of the bottle and then use the other

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:04.610 
of the bottle and then use the other
side<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:54.549> the<00:02:54.610> brush<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:55.290> paint<00:02:56.290> your<00:02:56.530> nail

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.740 

why<00:03:05.160> some<00:03:05.370> people<00:03:05.489> might<00:03:05.790> find<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.270> shorter

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
why some people might find this shorter

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.949 
why some people might find this shorter
brush<00:03:06.959> easier<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.739> work<00:03:07.890> with<00:03:08.630> and<00:03:09.630> some

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
brush easier to work with and some

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.949 
brush easier to work with and some
people<00:03:10.260> I'll<00:03:10.380> find<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.770> harder<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.190> work<00:03:11.459> with

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
people I'll find it harder to work with

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.180 
people I'll find it harder to work with
that's<00:03:12.959> got<00:03:13.140> pretty<00:03:13.380> good<00:03:13.440> color<00:03:13.860> payoff

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
that's got pretty good color payoff

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.620 
that's got pretty good color payoff

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.780 
there and that's with just one coat and
I'm<00:03:19.410> just<00:03:19.650> going<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:19.890> do<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.130> middle<00:03:20.400> finger

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.180 
with that color as well and just
remember<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.630> stay<00:03:27.720> away<00:03:28.230> from<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.709> cuticles

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
remember to stay away from the cuticles

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.750 
remember to stay away from the cuticles
at<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.550> bottom<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.920> also<00:03:31.920> leave<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.519> little

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
at the bottom and also leave a little

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.000 
at the bottom and also leave a little
line<00:03:33.480> up<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.870> side<00:03:34.110> of<00:03:34.290> your<00:03:34.380> nails<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:34.860> that

line up the side of your nails and that

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.509 
line up the side of your nails and that
makes<00:03:35.280> them<00:03:35.489> look<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:36.450> wee<00:03:36.600> bit<00:03:36.780> longer<00:03:40.519> so

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
makes them look that wee bit longer so

color<00:05:58.610> on<00:05:59.089> each<00:05:59.149> nail<00:05:59.569> so<00:06:00.499> we'll<00:06:00.679> start<00:06:00.860> with

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
color on each nail so we'll start with

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.409 
color on each nail so we'll start with
the<00:06:01.249> pink<00:06:01.539> there's<00:06:02.979> number<00:06:03.979> 12<00:06:04.249> and<00:06:04.669> that's

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
the pink there's number 12 and that's

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.559 
the pink there's number 12 and that's
well<00:06:05.749> it's<00:06:05.869> like<00:06:06.050> two<00:06:06.559> coats<00:06:07.309> and<00:06:07.699> I<00:06:08.360> think

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:08.569 
well it's like two coats and I think

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.079 
well it's like two coats and I think
that<00:06:09.050> is<00:06:09.289> actually<00:06:09.469> really<00:06:09.889> nice<00:06:10.069> and<00:06:10.969> that's

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:11.089 
that is actually really nice and that's

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:12.850 
that is actually really nice and that's
come<00:06:11.300> out<00:06:11.330> really<00:06:11.629> well<00:06:11.930> and<00:06:12.199> it's<00:06:12.770> very

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
come out really well and it's very

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.730 
come out really well and it's very
pretty<00:06:13.279> color<00:06:13.639> it's<00:06:14.479> quite<00:06:14.719> opaque<00:06:15.110> and<00:06:15.559> it

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
pretty color it's quite opaque and it

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.649 
pretty color it's quite opaque and it
does<00:06:15.949> apply<00:06:16.189> nicely<00:06:16.729> it's<00:06:16.939> not<00:06:17.119> streaky<00:06:17.629> or

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659 
does apply nicely it's not streaky or

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:19.869 
does apply nicely it's not streaky or
anything<00:06:17.899> so<00:06:18.379> it's<00:06:19.039> a<00:06:19.069> big<00:06:19.249> thumbs<00:06:19.520> up<00:06:19.669> for

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:19.879 
anything so it's a big thumbs up for

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.790 
anything so it's a big thumbs up for
that<00:06:19.939> one<00:06:20.319> remember<00:06:21.319> that<00:06:21.439> these<00:06:21.559> nail

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
that one remember that these nail

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.689 
that one remember that these nail
polishes<00:06:22.249> only<00:06:22.580> cost<00:06:22.879> one<00:06:23.330> pint<00:06:23.719> so<00:06:24.550> they<00:06:25.550> are

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:25.699 
polishes only cost one pint so they are

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:29.980 
polishes only cost one pint so they are
an<00:06:25.849> absolute<00:06:26.240> steal<00:06:28.149> and<00:06:29.149> next<00:06:29.509> we<00:06:29.629> have<00:06:29.779> this

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
an absolute steal and next we have this

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.549 
an absolute steal and next we have this
one<00:06:30.909> and<00:06:31.909> this<00:06:32.029> is<00:06:32.089> my<00:06:32.330> favorite<00:06:32.839> it's<00:06:33.259> a<00:06:33.379> light

00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:33.559 
one and this is my favorite it's a light

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.859 
one and this is my favorite it's a light
shimmery<00:06:34.039> sort<00:06:34.399> of<00:06:34.490> silvery<00:06:34.939> briny<00:06:35.449> color

00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:35.869 
shimmery sort of silvery briny color

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:37.839 
shimmery sort of silvery briny color
it's<00:06:36.499> quite<00:06:36.679> hard<00:06:36.889> to<00:06:37.009> describe<00:06:37.309> but<00:06:37.639> that's

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
it's quite hard to describe but that's

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.689 
it's quite hard to describe but that's
got<00:06:38.119> two<00:06:38.330> coats<00:06:38.569> of<00:06:38.719> that<00:06:38.899> now<00:06:39.139> and<00:06:39.680> I<00:06:40.639> think

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:40.699 
got two coats of that now and I think

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.929 
got two coats of that now and I think
that<00:06:40.999> one's<00:06:41.180> lovely<00:06:41.569> so<00:06:42.289> it<00:06:43.219> does<00:06:43.399> take<00:06:43.669> two

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:43.939 
that one's lovely so it does take two

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:45.219 
that one's lovely so it does take two
coats<00:06:44.269> but<00:06:44.509> then<00:06:44.659> you're<00:06:44.809> going<00:06:44.899> to<00:06:44.959> have<00:06:45.080> to

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229 
coats but then you're going to have to

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:46.689 
coats but then you're going to have to
picture<00:06:45.409> it<00:06:45.589> comes<00:06:45.769> on<00:06:45.949> with<00:06:46.189> most<00:06:46.399> nail

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:46.699 
picture it comes on with most nail

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.179 
picture it comes on with most nail
polishes<00:06:47.209> so<00:06:47.930> bearing<00:06:48.319> in<00:06:48.439> mind<00:06:48.469> that<00:06:48.919> they're

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:49.189 
polishes so bearing in mind that they're

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.929 
polishes so bearing in mind that they're
only<00:06:49.339> a<00:06:49.430> pint

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:49.939 
only a pint

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:52.709 
only a pint
that's<00:06:50.599> another<00:06:50.839> thumbs<00:06:51.199> up<00:06:51.379> for<00:06:51.529> that<00:06:51.589> one

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:52.719 
that's another thumbs up for that one

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:57.730 
that's another thumbs up for that one
and<00:06:53.719> this<00:06:53.990> one<00:06:54.229> here<00:06:54.619> is<00:06:54.800> number<00:06:56.589> seven<00:06:57.589> I

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
and this one here is number seven I

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.439 
and this one here is number seven I
think<00:06:58.039> it's<00:06:58.459> hard<00:06:58.669> to<00:06:58.729> see<00:06:58.939> that<00:06:59.149> because<00:06:59.329> it's

00:06:59.439 --> 00:06:59.449 
think it's hard to see that because it's

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:03.339 
think it's hard to see that because it's
so<00:06:59.599> dark<00:07:00.009> but<00:07:01.009> that's<00:07:01.189> this<00:07:01.789> color<00:07:02.169> and<00:07:03.169> I

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:03.349 
so dark but that's this color and I

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:05.709 
so dark but that's this color and I
think<00:07:03.379> that<00:07:03.829> is<00:07:03.979> beautiful<00:07:04.189> as<00:07:04.579> well<00:07:04.789> very

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:05.719 
think that is beautiful as well very

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:07.839 
think that is beautiful as well very
dark<00:07:06.050> and<00:07:06.289> very<00:07:06.439> rich<00:07:06.769> color<00:07:07.129> maybe<00:07:07.550> more

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:07.849 
dark and very rich color maybe more

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:10.899 
dark and very rich color maybe more
appropriate<00:07:07.969> for<00:07:08.419> winter<00:07:09.019> but<00:07:09.979> very<00:07:10.519> very

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:10.909 
appropriate for winter but very very

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:13.449 
appropriate for winter but very very
nice<00:07:11.119> and<00:07:11.569> actually<00:07:12.409> complements<00:07:13.039> the

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:13.459 
nice and actually complements the

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:15.759 
nice and actually complements the
silvery<00:07:13.879> sort<00:07:14.180> of<00:07:14.269> color<00:07:14.449> quite<00:07:14.719> well<00:07:15.019> so
