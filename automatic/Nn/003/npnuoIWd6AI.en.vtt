00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.250
 many of you will have noticed that lately 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.589
 speaks little of willy and is that they are in the 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.990
 point of view both xbox one as 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:12.579
 playstation 4 is normal for 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.739
 attentive to this information more than 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:17.200
 interesting about architecture in 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:19.120
 wii hardware from the on in the 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.970
 German studio known for games like 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.980
 hands trail or nano a sun has insured 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.900
 that if companies are not able to 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.510
 make games that look impressive 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.880
 in wii u it 's just your fault and not because 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.649
 The manfred link console has been given a 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.050
 full technical explanation of the 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.870
 characteristics of willy in relation to 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.670
 xbox 360 to explain that the console 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.949
 It has good hardware and that is more 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.409
 capable of what some critics with the 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.559
 system have insinuated attentive to their 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:50.499
 words the one of ram of wiiu has a 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.260
 function similar to the run of xbox 360 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:54.760
 you put your gpu buffer there to have 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.949
 quick access in wii 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.799
 there are many more memories available 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.989
 in xbox 360 which means you can 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.300
 render all the woofers faster 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.159
 that you put in this ram a very ram 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.679
 fast on wii and age 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.990
 and it's available for the cpu and for the 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:13.210
 gpu so you can also use it for 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.549
 efficiently accelerate your program 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.229
 the general ram memory of a giga is used 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.200
 for all the resources of the game 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.810
 sounds textures geometry and much more 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.939
 the theoretical bandwidth of the ram does not 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.000
 it reveals you too much because the cache of 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.770
 GPU dissimulate much this latency the 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.659
 bandwidth is a gpu problem 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.060
 mainly if you do readings 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.069
 random in memory that has not been 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.200
 never a good idea to get good 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.750
 attentive performance because they say more 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.270
 words I can not give details about gpu 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.060
 of wiiu but remember what it is 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.610
 known as a gpu and cpu what comes to 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.069
 mean general purpose graphics 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.899
 processing units so you're releasing 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.420
 of most of the limits that there were 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.369
 in the previous consoles I think if 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.219
 you have problems making a game 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.140
 it looks great in will you then not 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.789
 it's a hardware problem the truth is 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.039
 that this news is more than necessary 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.410
 so that many unbelievers believe in 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.420
 wiiu's technical capabilities the new 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.460
 desktop console by nintendo one 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.400
 console that everyone is underestimates 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.770
 and also very unfairly we will see if wii 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.600
 or it gives us surprises during the next 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.800
 months that we do return to the same 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.420
 moral 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.420
 you have to know how to program for wii
