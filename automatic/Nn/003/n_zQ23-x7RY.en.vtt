 discount for 199 rubles with discount 50 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.779
 percent and perhaps I'll start from the very 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.640
 the last is us shade 4675 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.269
 light pink color stretching 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.730
 a little lilac very good 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.330
 suitable for blondes and tanned people 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:36.090

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.110
 lilac shade lipstick firebird on 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.870
 with a medium coating is something between 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.510
 new lipstick that we came out of the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.000
 a series of exotic and exciting luxury 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.280
 he has no dense coverage and and so 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.590
 I think such coverage is very good for 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:12.229
 summer period shade 45-47 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.229

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.770
 45-46 lingon brick color 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:44.250
 so dark that blocked my blue 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:46.409
 45-45-90 wreaths with a little purple 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.270
 lilac undertone 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:55.270
 reminds me of lip rouge 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.700
 classic luxury and natural shine but 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:03.569
 just a little darker and more brown 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:09.099
 colors 45 44 peach beige pink 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:11.709
 color here it looks even more like 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:16.049
 peach like coral but on hand he 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.049
 gives such a slightly pinkish tint 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.549
 although in the tube comes with a small redhead 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.989
 45 hands one is a beautiful coral 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.400
 beautiful orange lipstick 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.769
 coral color 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.829
 deep saturated coral 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.829
 shade 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:50.260
 4540 is pale pink 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:52.829
 a little rolling so that's pink 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.829
 flamingo 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.010
 45 39 berry pink 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.450
 45 38 tint similar to 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.780
 natural shine and exciting 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.570
 luxury but if there is a shade this lipstick 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.960
 exciting luxury she has a glossy 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.240
 shine then this here has nacreous 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.190
 brilliance 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:36.140
 pearl shine and in color they 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:38.600
 almost identical all lipstick they 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.080
 go where are you with light pearl u 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.240
 somewhere more with intense nacre 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.360
 glossy shine and give these two here 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.100
 lipstick pale pink 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.560
 and coral shade here they have 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.370
 practically no pearl shine 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.360
 either he is not so easy that 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.360
 looks like a glossy finish 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.240
 I think when choosing a lipstick you can 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.849

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.000
