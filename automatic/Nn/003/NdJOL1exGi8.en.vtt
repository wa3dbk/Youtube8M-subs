 American who occupies on 5th street and 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.090
 the best man this morning is the danish 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.400
 nerd license plates 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.070
 is that it will be favorite again, it will occupy 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.440
 at least that central street that street 4 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.380
 but let's see how it reacts 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.120
 6 biderman who has swum well here 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.120
 comfortable comfortable swim 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.120

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.810
 fourth swimmer of history to win 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.770
 three gold medals in this test in 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:39.940
 these 400 free something that has only 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.360
 got kowalski grant hackett and yuri 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.360
 luzhkov 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.069
 and final in theory in men 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.720
 I reaffirm myself I think it cuts well 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.980
 stay very superior so you have 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.989
 to be careful with america not 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.450
 concludes that in something the relay of the USA 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.319
 the 4 by 200 in the new very well that the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.319
 bet of 143 the memory bad daughter 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.150
 lu hao in the one but even though he has done 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.620
 better mark this morning in short can 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.720
 run far more than what he has done 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.540
 instantly his fourth names but not 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:22.290
 matter encounter with free and if you are 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:23.760
 well then there is the Chinese above that is 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.260
 dangerous because maybe it comes hand 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.840
 slight recalls a bit to the final in 2011 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.750
 when park surprised surprised by 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.720
 the 1st world street to blue that the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.780
 central streets and fuck taiwan came out by 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.569
 the 1 shotgun and I saw everyone all the 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.940
 while a very similar advantage to that of 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.220
 now 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.230
 and managed very well until the end and 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.050
 only when you wanted to give an account is 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.390
 too far to rebound but good 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.980
 biedermann is a lot more veteran than 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.680
 what was what it was then that 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:02.270
 I was starting this already has barely 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:06.020
 you want and I'm sure you know we've already left 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.580
 a powerful rival for that nonetheless is 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.070
 brave finalist when he does not 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.990
 surprises the one of london nobody good then 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:16.090
 still in first position let's see if 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.190
 they react in the rest of the swimmers 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.070
 It has taken an important advantage 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:25.060
 Chinese we already have work in the 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.010
 central streets concludes with the language 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.640
 that we still did not see him that I do not know with 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:34.750
 the legs and demand perfectly with 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.390
 this race knows that it is a good 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.790
 reference 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.350
 as a day that surely knows good what 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.030
 he knows one hundred percent that he did a very 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.650
 good step for 200 books and that will be 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.680
 above 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.840
 and he knows that to a sprint here there is nothing 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.880
 well in a 50 and so goes well to 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.039
 last trick 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:59.150
 Well, the Chinese is still little by little 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:59.150
 still there he went through the 200 in about 49 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.900
 this pass from vietnam basically as 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.290
 I do not have to use the most mentioned 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.120
 in 92,049 for those 7 seconds by 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.430
 on top of what I use in the test that 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.840
 you go when they lose they are going to attack starting 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.360
 of 300 and start 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.860
 of 300 who has nothing left to start 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.360
 take out the anger 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.969
 the heavy weaponry 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.750
 at 50 meters we will see biedermann who will 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.750
 says goodbye to club 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.960
 Hello 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:37.590
 they are less than a second from the Chinese 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:41.390
 it's like to get more 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:45.660
 little is losing that initial advantage 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:48.900
 and also a little bit like we talked to 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.340
 from 309 it was a little bit more and if not 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.290
 you do it to worry about why not 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.729
 will have no change of pace thing that 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:59.689
 I doubt seeing 49 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:02.060
 well, he has mentally in his feet 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:06.220
 comes german 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.419
 to start warning you appear 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.870
 it also has an ending not like that of 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.990
 life brother 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.400
 and there was tomorrow saying goodbye to 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.950
 problems for club to stay without 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.940
 medal the principle changes 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:24.630
 german like the hustlers had 50 a 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.910
 second and a half is difficult but also 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.520
 We see how much and moves her feet 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.970
 kills a lot of water collider man has gone to the 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.190
 home of the Chinese but he has little left 25 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.710
 meters that biedermann there is already 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.070
 is the game that many clubs do not 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.200
 Bank 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.630
 but Biedermann should take because it is 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:48.130
 until the last miracle meter 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:53.950
 a screen that goes the polar nothing locus 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:57.890
 339 magnificent leads to nothing 275 meters 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:07:00.860
 just the last one takes into account 25 and the 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:03.530
 Thursday is a real barbarity 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.370
 it's a technique to finish a 400 in short 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.370
 25-19 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:15.300
 50 meters finally with the bronze 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:19.480
 Danish with 342 bronze medals for 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:22.120
 Denmark in just 10 minutes 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.030
 there is a strategy has gone well 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.060
 of throwing it into the race to get out fast 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:31.740
 to try to have options 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:34.990
 of my sister size was practically 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:38.310
 unattainable so it has been the end it 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:42.540
 has taken the game then 3915 for 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:46.170
 bittermann 48 

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:47.280
 that is going to be left over but down with 

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.070
 quite fire yes it is true that 

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.030
 runs a lot in the final sprint but it's 

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.100
 there was a second and a half advantage 

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.960
 he is not lucky, he knows that strong 

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.120
 he still does not have a devastating final sprint 

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.940
 but we are one and a half of a 50 there are 

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.830
 remove it good because it is already inside the 

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:06.690
 great history of this test the 

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.690
 world in short the fourth man
