00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
fancy ringtone apparently you know it

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.420 
fancy ringtone apparently you know it
needs<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.230> lot<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.439> work<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:30.919> do<00:00:31.919> like<00:00:32.280> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
needs a lot of work I do like the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.660 
needs a lot of work I do like the
molding<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.360> will<00:00:33.420> say<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.010> I<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.310> like

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
molding on it I will say that I do like

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.460 
molding on it I will say that I do like
its<00:00:35.970> proportions<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:36.870> very<00:00:37.230> well

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
its proportions it's very well

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.360 
its proportions it's very well
proportioned<00:00:37.830> I<00:00:39.710> think<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.800> think<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.160> a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
proportioned I think I think it's a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.420 
proportioned I think I think it's a
great<00:00:41.730> kit<00:00:42.060> overall<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:42.990> details<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:44.340> I

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
great kit overall for details and I

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.310 
great kit overall for details and I
think<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.700> does<00:00:44.820> leave<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> lot<00:00:45.150> of<00:00:45.480> opportunity

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
think it does leave a lot of opportunity

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.570 
think it does leave a lot of opportunity
for<00:00:46.350> modelers<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.100> enhance<00:00:47.940> their<00:00:48.180> skills<00:00:48.600> I

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
for modelers to enhance their skills I

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.180 
for modelers to enhance their skills I
think<00:00:50.580> that<00:00:51.000> if<00:00:51.720> you<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.110> get<00:00:52.290> this<00:00:52.470> kit<00:00:52.770> you

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
think that if you do get this kit you

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.820 
think that if you do get this kit you
should<00:00:53.220> be<00:00:53.580> ready<00:00:53.880> to<00:00:53.940> paint<00:00:54.330> most<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.380> not<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
should be ready to paint most if not the

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.860 
should be ready to paint most if not the
entire<00:00:56.010> model<00:00:56.580> that's<00:00:57.270> what<00:00:57.420> I'm<00:00:57.510> doing<00:00:57.780> at

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
entire model that's what I'm doing at

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.340 
entire model that's what I'm doing at
least<00:00:58.280> a<00:00:59.280> few<00:00:59.730> things<00:00:59.970> little<00:01:00.570> nitpicks<00:01:01.050> about

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
least a few things little nitpicks about

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.560 
least a few things little nitpicks about
this<00:01:01.560> kit<00:01:01.830> that<00:01:01.860> I<00:01:02.070> really<00:01:02.790> hate<00:01:03.060> are<00:01:03.330> these

seam lines that go all the way down the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.370

anyway<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.950> would<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.130> been<00:01:23.190> kind<00:01:23.490> of

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
anyway but it would have been kind of

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.060 
anyway but it would have been kind of
nice<00:01:23.670> for<00:01:23.970> younger<00:01:24.560> modelers<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.830> don't

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
nice for younger modelers that don't

really paint at all to them they do you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.960 
really paint at all to them they do you
they<00:01:31.440> do<00:01:31.500> give<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.510> stickers<00:01:34.310> for<00:01:35.310> most<00:01:35.760> of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
they do give you stickers for most of

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.860 
they do give you stickers for most of
everything<00:01:36.240> else

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
everything else

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:46.399 
everything else
but<00:01:37.740> again<00:01:38.460> no<00:01:38.940> feet<00:01:42.560> see<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:44.070> articulation<00:01:45.409> I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
but again no feet see for articulation I

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.380 
but again no feet see for articulation I
guess<00:01:47.010> I'll<00:01:47.159> do<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.370> backpack<00:01:47.760> first<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.210> get

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
guess I'll do the backpack first to get

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.789 
guess I'll do the backpack first to get
out<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.690> way<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.870> can<00:01:49.200> move<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.560> wings

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
out of the way you can move the wings

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.520 
out of the way you can move the wings
here<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.610> down<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.700> rotate<00:01:54.530> let's

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
here up and down you can rotate let's

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.320 
here up and down you can rotate let's
see<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.280> rotate<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.760> the<00:01:56.850> wing<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.210> can

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
see you can rotate on the wing you can

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.880 
see you can rotate on the wing you can
move<00:01:57.450> them<00:01:57.540> up<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.750> down<00:01:57.840> here<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.650> can<00:01:58.799> move

move them up and down here you can move
them<00:01:59.070> at<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.549> hinge<00:01:59.820> back<00:02:00.150> here<00:02:01.430> and<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.640> can

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
them at the hinge back here and you can

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.140 
them at the hinge back here and you can
also<00:02:02.909> rotate<00:02:03.270> them<00:02:03.720> there<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.940> you<00:02:05.940> can<00:02:06.060> do

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
also rotate them there and you can do

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.960 
also rotate them there and you can do
the<00:02:06.270> same

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.729 

you<00:02:09.970> can<00:02:10.119> do<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.390> same<00:02:10.660> for<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.470> other<00:02:11.650> side

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
you can do the same for the other side

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.420 
you can do the same for the other side
and<00:02:12.370> for<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.060> back<00:02:13.209> wings<00:02:13.510> in<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.430> rotate

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
and for the back wings in the rotate

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.550 
and for the back wings in the rotate
them<00:02:15.760> if<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.390> could<00:02:16.450> different<00:02:16.900> camera<00:02:17.380> op

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.070 

you're<00:02:23.560> gonna<00:02:23.650> rotate<00:02:23.890> them<00:02:24.450> here<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.900> can

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
you're gonna rotate them here you can

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.089 
you're gonna rotate them here you can
move<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.349> wings<00:02:26.560> up<00:02:26.920> at<00:02:27.340> this<00:02:27.610> angle<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:29.099> you

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
move the wings up at this angle and you

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.790 
move the wings up at this angle and you
can<00:02:30.160> flap<00:02:30.790> them<00:02:30.970> like<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:32.260> there's<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.590> few

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
can flap them like that so there's a few

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.250 
can flap them like that so there's a few
different<00:02:32.860> ways<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.430> can<00:02:33.580> move<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.849> wings

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
different ways you can move the wings

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.759 
different ways you can move the wings

which<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.440> find<00:02:45.430> really<00:02:45.730> nice<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.330> that'll

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
which I find really nice and that'll

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.979

make<00:02:46.780> painting<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.470> lot<00:02:47.650> easier<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.840> don't

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
make painting a lot easier so I don't

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.800 
make painting a lot easier so I don't
have<00:02:50.049> to<00:02:50.200> modify<00:02:50.620> them<00:02:50.970> arms<00:02:51.970> will<00:02:52.150> go<00:02:52.180> up<00:02:52.360> 90

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
have to modify them arms will go up 90

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.930 
have to modify them arms will go up 90
they<00:02:53.230> don't<00:02:53.410> go<00:02:53.530> back<00:02:53.709> at<00:02:53.890> all<00:02:53.980> hands<00:02:54.670> are<00:02:54.849> just

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
they don't go back at all hands are just

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.020

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
move at all side skirts well they're on

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.449 
move at all side skirts well they're on
pegs<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.500> they'll<00:03:08.620> move<00:03:08.709> around<00:03:08.950> as<00:03:09.130> much<00:03:09.280> as

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
pegs and they'll move around as much as

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.220 
pegs and they'll move around as much as
you<00:03:09.519> can<00:03:09.640> get<00:03:09.790> them<00:03:10.110> legs<00:03:11.110> Bend<00:03:11.830> it<00:03:12.690> here<00:03:13.690> you

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
you can get them legs Bend it here you

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.599 
you can get them legs Bend it here you
can<00:03:14.350> make<00:03:14.470> him<00:03:14.590> roll<00:03:14.739> up<00:03:14.920> as<00:03:15.100> far<00:03:15.340> as<00:03:15.370> the

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
can make him roll up as far as the

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.690 
can make him roll up as far as the
skirts<00:03:15.940> will<00:03:16.120> let<00:03:16.329> them<00:03:16.500> then<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.769> two<00:03:18.190> joints

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
skirts will let them then the two joints

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.340 
skirts will let them then the two joints
probably<00:03:19.180> kept<00:03:19.329> joints<00:03:19.720> there<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:20.230> can

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
probably kept joints there so you can

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.280 
probably kept joints there so you can
bet<00:03:20.500> all<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.739> way<00:03:20.829> back<00:03:21.040> there<00:03:21.750> move<00:03:22.750> down<00:03:22.959> and

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
bet all the way back there move down and

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.360 
bet all the way back there move down and
then<00:03:23.440> ball<00:03:23.739> jointed<00:03:24.100> feet<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:26.190> that's<00:03:27.190> about

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
then ball jointed feet and that's about

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.620 
then ball jointed feet and that's about
it<00:03:27.549> for<00:03:27.700> articulation<00:03:28.269> wise<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:30.329> gimmick<00:03:31.329> that

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
it for articulation wise a gimmick that

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.020 
it for articulation wise a gimmick that
all<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:32.590> don't<00:03:33.069> know<00:03:33.310> if<00:03:33.400> all<00:03:33.549> of<00:03:33.579> them<00:03:33.850> but

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
all the I don't know if all of them but

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.289 
all the I don't know if all of them but
the<00:03:34.269> ones<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.630> bought<00:03:34.720> have<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:37.090> can

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
the ones that I bought have you can

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.819 
the ones that I bought have you can
actually<00:03:37.810> swap<00:03:38.530> out<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.940> chest<00:03:40.389> or<00:03:40.829> some

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
actually swap out the chest or some

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.949 
actually swap out the chest or some
other<00:03:42.010> thing<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.519> make<00:03:42.700> it<00:03:42.910> into<00:03:43.359> a<00:03:43.389> different

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
other thing to make it into a different

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.030 
other thing to make it into a different
pose<00:03:44.380> for<00:03:45.220> example<00:03:45.639> for<00:03:46.150> this<00:03:46.359> wing<00:03:46.810> 0<00:03:47.139> you<00:03:47.859> can

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
pose for example for this wing 0 you can

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.030 
pose for example for this wing 0 you can
swap<00:03:48.310> out<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.609> chest<00:03:48.970> for<00:03:49.420> this<00:03:49.720> piece<00:03:50.170> which

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
swap out the chest for this piece which

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.150 
swap out the chest for this piece which
is<00:03:51.069> it<00:03:51.489> bending<00:03:52.000> forward<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.810> it's<00:03:53.769> basically

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
is it bending forward and it's basically

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.620 
is it bending forward and it's basically
putting<00:03:54.549> it<00:03:54.639> into<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.910> pose<00:03:55.120> where<00:03:55.389> it<00:03:55.510> was

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
putting it into the pose where it was

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.199 
putting it into the pose where it was
shooting<00:03:56.139> the<00:03:56.889> guns<00:03:57.190> at<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.880> end<00:03:58.030> of<00:03:58.150> the

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
shooting the guns at the end of the

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:09.780 
shooting the guns at the end of the
movie<00:03:58.859> as<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:02.170> box<00:04:05.340> so<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:06.370> can<00:04:08.639> because<00:04:09.639> you

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
movie as the box so you can because you

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.099 
movie as the box so you can because you
can't<00:04:10.030> do<00:04:10.180> that<00:04:10.329> when<00:04:10.569> it<00:04:10.660> just<00:04:10.870> has<00:04:10.989> the

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
can't do that when it just has the

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:18.080 
can't do that when it just has the
normal<00:04:11.260> chest<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:13.060> anyway<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:14.470> put<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:15.419> new

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
normal chest but anyway to put the new

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.629 
normal chest but anyway to put the new
chest<00:04:19.090> on<00:04:19.419> basically<00:04:20.320> all<00:04:20.409> you<00:04:20.680> do<00:04:20.830> is

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
chest on basically all you do is

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.689 
chest on basically all you do is
rotate<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.300> legs<00:04:22.599> that<00:04:22.840> can<00:04:22.990> off<00:04:23.249> pop<00:04:24.249> off<00:04:24.460> the

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
rotate the legs that can off pop off the

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:31.969 
rotate the legs that can off pop off the
arms<00:04:27.060> pop<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.210> head<00:04:28.330> off<00:04:28.860> up<00:04:29.860> back<00:04:30.159> back<00:04:30.340> off

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
arms pop the head off up back back off

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.700 
arms pop the head off up back back off
and<00:04:32.979> then<00:04:33.969> you<00:04:34.150> just<00:04:34.389> swap<00:04:34.810> all<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.379> parts

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
and then you just swap all the parts

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:47.189 
and then you just swap all the parts
that<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:35.979> have<00:04:36.069> to<00:04:36.729> this<00:04:36.939> one<00:04:45.870> flying<00:04:46.870> back
