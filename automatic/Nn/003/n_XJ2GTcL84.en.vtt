the rampant growth is more important
than<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.000> land<00:02:31.800> because<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.880> rampant<00:02:34.180> growth

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
than the land because the rampant growth

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.320 
than the land because the rampant growth
shuffles<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.740> I<00:02:35.770> can<00:02:35.950> brainstorm<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.700> put

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
shuffles so I can brainstorm and put

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.020 
shuffles so I can brainstorm and put
crap<00:02:37.570> back<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.050> shuffle<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.350> away<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:41.670> just<00:02:42.670> run

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
crap back and shuffle it away I just run

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.340 
crap back and shuffle it away I just run
the<00:02:43.660> Oracle<00:02:44.080> out<00:02:44.200> there<00:02:44.440> because<00:02:45.959> like<00:02:46.959> if<00:02:47.200> he

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
the Oracle out there because like if he

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.570 
the Oracle out there because like if he
raps<00:02:47.620> here<00:02:47.950> then<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:49.239> just<00:02:49.989> have<00:02:50.380> Jace<00:02:51.130> active

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
raps here then I just have Jace active

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.960 
raps here then I just have Jace active
and<00:02:52.110> if<00:02:53.110> he<00:02:53.200> doesn't<00:02:53.380> wrath<00:02:53.680> then<00:02:54.040> my<00:02:54.700> time

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
and if he doesn't wrath then my time

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.800 
and if he doesn't wrath then my time
warp<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.390> insane<00:02:56.019> with<00:02:56.230> Oracle<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.830> Jace<00:02:57.810> and

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
warp is insane with Oracle and Jace and

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.920 
warp is insane with Oracle and Jace and
I<00:02:59.500> have<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.650> time<00:02:59.830> warp<00:03:00.010> on<00:03:00.130> top<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:01.570> sure

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
I have a time warp on top and sure

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.780 
I have a time warp on top and sure
enough<00:03:01.959> he<00:03:02.110> does<00:03:02.290> not<00:03:02.470> rap<00:03:02.709> so<00:03:03.100> that's<00:03:03.610> pretty

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
enough he does not rap so that's pretty

so<00:03:49.180> now<00:03:49.300> I<00:03:49.330> time<00:03:50.260> warps<00:03:50.500> before<00:03:50.980> just<00:03:51.850> started

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
so now I time warps before just started

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.710 
so now I time warps before just started
have<00:03:52.270> to<00:03:52.390> do<00:03:52.510> math<00:03:54.060> look<00:03:55.060> obviously<00:03:55.210> that's

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
have to do math look obviously that's

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.200 
have to do math look obviously that's
incorrect<00:03:56.230> but<00:03:56.920> anyone<00:03:57.610> I<00:03:57.670> have<00:03:57.820> to<00:03:57.940> do<00:03:58.030> math

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
the cards from the brain stone so just

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.760 
the cards from the brain stone so just
ponder<00:04:15.520> it<00:04:15.580> off<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:15.790> meta<00:04:16.140> in<00:04:17.140> here<00:04:17.410> I<00:04:17.440> go
