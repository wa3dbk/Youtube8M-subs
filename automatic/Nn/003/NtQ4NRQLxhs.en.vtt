00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
going to be taking a look at how you can

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.869 
going to be taking a look at how you can
destroy<00:00:04.230> enemy<00:00:04.680> wards<00:00:04.920> without<00:00:05.310> an<00:00:05.370> Oracle's

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
or a pink ward are only a handful of

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.950 
or a pink ward are only a handful of
champions<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:08.849> can<00:00:09.059> actually<00:00:09.330> do<00:00:09.510> this<00:00:09.719> and

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
champions that can actually do this and

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.680 
champions that can actually do this and
be<00:00:10.050> going<00:00:10.230> through<00:00:10.410> them<00:00:10.559> in<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:10.860> video<00:00:11.690> so

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
be going through them in this video so

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.330 
be going through them in this video so
pretty<00:00:12.960> much<00:00:13.110> how<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.380> works<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.920> if<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.219> ever

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
pretty much how it works is if you ever

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.820 
pretty much how it works is if you ever
see<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:15.000> enemy<00:00:15.750> place<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> warden<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.800> know

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
see the enemy place a warden you know

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.040 
see the enemy place a warden you know
where<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.970> need<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.180> drag<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.600> minion

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
where it is you need to drag a minion

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.109 
where it is you need to drag a minion
over<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.680> where<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.369> then<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.880> need<00:00:21.029> to

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
over to where it is and then you need to

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.730 
over to where it is and then you need to
put<00:00:21.330> some<00:00:21.539> sort<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.810> spell<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.529> minion

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
put some sort of spell on that minion

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.640 
put some sort of spell on that minion
where<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.820> see<00:00:23.880> invisible<00:00:24.630> units<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.560> it

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
where you can see invisible units so it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.170 
where you can see invisible units so it
could<00:00:25.769> be<00:00:25.859> like<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> needle<00:00:26.340> II<00:00:26.550> traffic<00:00:26.970> be

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
could be like a needle II traffic be

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.230 
could be like a needle II traffic be
Lulu's<00:00:27.570> help<00:00:27.869> Pixability<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.039> then<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.029> can

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
Lulu's help Pixability and then you can

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.430 
Lulu's help Pixability and then you can
find<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:31.470> ward<00:00:32.009> that's<00:00:32.430> under<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.180> minion<00:00:33.899> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
find the ward that's under the minion so

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.799 
find the ward that's under the minion so
it's<00:00:34.559> actually<00:00:34.710> really<00:00:35.100> interesting<00:00:35.660> you<00:00:36.660> can

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it's actually really interesting you can

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.450 
it's actually really interesting you can
also<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.320> on<00:00:37.440> enemy<00:00:37.800> champions<00:00:38.250> it's

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
also do this on enemy champions it's

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.639 
also do this on enemy champions it's
much<00:00:38.579> more<00:00:38.760> inefficient<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.530> how

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
much more inefficient but this is how

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.830 
much more inefficient but this is how
I'm<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:40.950> doing<00:00:41.070> my<00:00:41.280> examples<00:00:41.840> Lulu's

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
I'm going to be doing my examples Lulu's

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.180 
I'm going to be doing my examples Lulu's
a<00:00:42.870> better<00:00:43.140> champion<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.739> do<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:43.980> with

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
a better champion to do this with

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.340 
a better champion to do this with
because<00:00:44.640> she's<00:00:44.879> actually<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.329> viable<00:00:45.960> support

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
because she's actually a viable support

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.840 
because she's actually a viable support
so<00:00:46.590> what<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.010> need<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.579> when<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
so what you need to do is when the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.360 
so what you need to do is when the
minions<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> ward<00:00:48.690> use<00:00:49.440> help<00:00:49.770> picks<00:00:50.070> your

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
minions on the ward use help picks your

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.220 
minions on the ward use help picks your
ability<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.510> should<00:00:51.690> be<00:00:51.719> able<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.989> see<00:00:52.199> it

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
ability and you should be able to see it

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.790 
ability and you should be able to see it
once<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> minions<00:00:53.039> standing<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:54.620> next<00:00:55.620> is

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
once the minions standing on it next is

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.040 
once the minions standing on it next is
leasing<00:00:56.489> leasing<00:00:56.760> isn't<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.300> best<00:00:57.510> champion

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
leasing leasing isn't the best champion

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.500 
leasing leasing isn't the best champion
to<00:00:58.170> do<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.410> with<00:00:58.559> because<00:00:59.489> he's<00:00:59.609> melee<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.270> his

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
to do it with because he's melee and his

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.240 
to do it with because he's melee and his
visibility<00:01:01.050> suppose<00:01:01.530> don't<00:01:01.770> actually<00:01:02.010> last

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
visibility suppose don't actually last

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.179 
visibility suppose don't actually last
that<00:01:02.430> long<00:01:02.609> but<00:01:03.030> he<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.539> nonetheless<00:01:04.189> k

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
that long but he can do it nonetheless k

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.160 
that long but he can do it nonetheless k
is<00:01:05.400> another<00:01:05.700> really<00:01:05.970> unlikely<00:01:06.479> one<00:01:06.840> though

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
is another really unlikely one though

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.620 
is another really unlikely one though
she<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.530> ranged<00:01:08.100> her<00:01:08.369> traps<00:01:08.880> only<00:01:09.330> actually

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
she is ranged her traps only actually

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.890 
she is ranged her traps only actually
affect<00:01:09.869> champions<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:11.180> it's<00:01:12.180> actually<00:01:12.750> going

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
affect champions and it's actually going

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.300 
affect champions and it's actually going
to<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:13.320> hard<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.590> find<00:01:13.950> someone<00:01:14.250> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
to be really hard to find someone to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.420 
to be really hard to find someone to
stand<00:01:14.610> still<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.119> long<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:16.250> decided<00:01:17.250> to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
stand still for that long I decided to

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.490 
stand still for that long I decided to
check<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.880> work<00:01:18.090> with<00:01:18.270> Corky<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.930> kog'maw<00:01:19.350> as

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
check it work with Corky and kog'maw as

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.320 
check it work with Corky and kog'maw as
well<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.950> these<00:01:20.549> two<00:01:20.790> champions<00:01:21.210> have

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
well and these two champions have

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.480 
well and these two champions have
visibility<00:01:21.720> spells<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:22.530> they<00:01:22.710> do<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:23.009> detect

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
visibility spells but they do not detect

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.580 
visibility spells but they do not detect
invisible<00:01:23.790> units<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.229> doesn't<00:01:25.470> actually

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
invisible units so it doesn't actually

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.249 
invisible units so it doesn't actually
work<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.189> finding<00:01:26.400> Ward's<00:01:26.909> or<00:01:27.180> any<00:01:27.600> visible

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
work on finding Ward's or any visible

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.370 
work on finding Ward's or any visible
invisible<00:01:28.500> champions<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.610> man<00:01:30.170> but<00:01:31.170> on

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
invisible champions for that man but on

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.990 
invisible champions for that man but on
the<00:01:31.500> other<00:01:31.590> hand<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:32.040> decided<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.549> check<00:01:32.579> if<00:01:32.880> I

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
the other hand I decided to check if I

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.660 
the other hand I decided to check if I
work<00:01:33.270> with<00:01:33.570> twin<00:01:33.930> shadows<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.590> does<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.189> once

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
work with twin shadows it does but once

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.690 
work with twin shadows it does but once
again<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.150> only<00:01:36.240> works<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.930> champions<00:01:37.700> last

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
again it only works on champions last

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.100 
again it only works on champions last
but<00:01:38.909> not<00:01:38.939> least<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.390> wanted<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.750> see<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
but not least I wanted to see if you

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.569 
but not least I wanted to see if you
could<00:01:40.200> actually<00:01:40.350> find<00:01:40.680> champions<00:01:41.310> rather

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
could actually find champions rather

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.550 
could actually find champions rather
than<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:41.939> wards<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.540> are<00:01:43.290> standing

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
than just wards that are standing

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.030 
than just wards that are standing
underneath<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:45.020> target<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.229> put<00:01:46.710> vision

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
underneath the target you put vision

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.100 
underneath the target you put vision
spells<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:48.180> actually<00:01:48.299> does<00:01:48.659> work<00:01:48.810> as

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
spells on and it actually does work as

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.840 
spells on and it actually does work as
you<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.380> see<00:01:49.590> i'm<00:01:49.770> i've<00:01:50.009> just<00:01:50.250> found<00:01:50.399> teemo

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.789 
you can see i'm i've just found teemo
underneath<00:01:51.240> looks<00:01:51.479> by<00:01:52.079> using<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.530> vision

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
underneath looks by using the vision

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.440 
underneath looks by using the vision
spell<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.159> looks<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:54.060> that's<00:01:54.210> really

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
spell on looks so that's really

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.170 
spell on looks so that's really
interesting<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.520> that's<00:01:56.729> pretty<00:01:57.030> much

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
interesting so that's pretty much

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.420 
interesting so that's pretty much
everything<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.960> reality<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.770> extremely

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
everything in reality this is extremely

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.389 
everything in reality this is extremely
hard<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.759> do<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.570> actual<00:02:01.469> normal<00:02:02.009> game<00:02:02.219> or

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
hard to do in a actual normal game or

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.910 
hard to do in a actual normal game or
ranked<00:02:02.610> game<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:04.439> always<00:02:04.560> try

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
ranked game and but you can always try

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.600 
ranked game and but you can always try
it<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.159> mean<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.969> might<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:07.110> might<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.680> screw

up<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.819> little<00:02:09.060> bit<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:09.810> you're<00:02:09.989> trying<00:02:10.200> to

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
solely focus on that in the game you're

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.610

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
