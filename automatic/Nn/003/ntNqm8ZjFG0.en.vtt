at such a high level I think it's an

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.350 
at such a high level I think it's an
emphasis<00:00:33.040> on<00:00:33.160> teaching<00:00:33.370> the<00:00:33.640> fundamentals<00:00:33.790> I

I<00:00:53.630> don't<00:00:54.630> know<00:00:54.720> I<00:00:54.750> think<00:00:54.870> we've<00:00:55.650> had<00:00:56.210> some

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.790 
I don't know I think we've had some
success<00:00:57.750> which<00:00:58.170> were<00:00:58.290> proud<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.740> think

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
success which were proud of I think

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.050 
success which were proud of I think
winning<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.250> state<00:00:59.430> championships

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
winning the state championships

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.610 
winning the state championships
obviously<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> culmination<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.410> great

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
obviously is the culmination of great

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.290 
obviously is the culmination of great
things<00:01:01.890> we've<00:01:02.100> also<00:01:02.250> had<00:01:02.520> teams<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.970> have

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
things we've also had teams that have

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.070 
things we've also had teams that have
really<00:01:04.229> achieved<00:01:04.410> my<00:01:05.360> 2014<00:01:06.360> got<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.870> state

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
really achieved my 2014 got to the state

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.380 
really achieved my 2014 got to the state
final<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.310> was<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> team<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.910> that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
final and and that was a team that that

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.660 
final and and that was a team that that
really<00:01:09.810> wasn't<00:01:10.740> an<00:01:11.010> incredibly<00:01:11.430> talented

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
really wasn't an incredibly talented

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.340 
really wasn't an incredibly talented
team<00:01:12.120> it<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.900> did<00:01:13.050> it<00:01:13.170> soo

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
team it just really did it soo

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.410 
team it just really did it soo
perseverance<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.280> grit<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.910> I<00:01:15.060> think

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
perseverance and grit and I think

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.450 
perseverance and grit and I think
probably<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.900> 2007<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:16.979> had<00:01:17.070> won<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> state

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
probably in 2007 we had won the state

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.450 
probably in 2007 we had won the state
title<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.900> 2006<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.440> lost<00:01:19.619> our<00:01:19.830> top<00:01:20.040> seven

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
title in 2006 we lost our top seven

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.490 
title in 2006 we lost our top seven
players<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.119> came<00:01:21.300> back<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.720> with<00:01:21.840> 28<00:01:22.320> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
players and we came back in with 28 and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.710 
players and we came back in with 28 and
three<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.009> i<00:01:23.369> think<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.759> team<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.390> over

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
three and i think that team really over

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.120 
three and i think that team really over
to<00:01:24.780> chief<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.080> whatever<00:01:25.290> at<00:01:25.410> any<00:01:25.590> time<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.979> get

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
to chief so whatever at any time you get

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.680 
to chief so whatever at any time you get
the<00:01:26.250> team<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.640> over<00:01:26.940> cheap<00:01:27.210> i<00:01:27.360> think<00:01:27.540> that's

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
the team to over cheap i think that's

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.380 
the team to over cheap i think that's
when<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.990> feel<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.440> festival<00:01:29.390> absolutely
