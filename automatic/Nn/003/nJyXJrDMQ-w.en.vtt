00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.450 

so<00:00:01.380> as<00:00:01.530> I<00:00:01.680> already<00:00:01.709> mentioned<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.310> general

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
so as I already mentioned the general

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.710 
so as I already mentioned the general
form<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.060> complex<00:00:03.300> number<00:00:05.359> the<00:00:06.359> general

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
form of a complex number the general

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.379 
form of a complex number the general
form<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.820> plus<00:00:08.820> B<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:10.400> this<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.610> number<00:00:12.030> plus

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
form is a plus B I this is a number plus

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.360 
form is a plus B I this is a number plus
some<00:00:12.750> number<00:00:12.929> times<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.710> thing<00:00:14.250> that

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
some number times that thing that

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.859 
some number times that thing that
mathematicians<00:00:15.120> made<00:00:15.299> up<00:00:15.420> called<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.870> okay<00:00:17.869> so

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
mathematicians made up called I okay so

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.080 
mathematicians made up called I okay so
let's<00:00:19.080> do<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> couple<00:00:19.890> problems<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.730> see<00:00:20.970> where

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
let's do a couple problems and see where

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.000 
let's do a couple problems and see where
we<00:00:21.210> can<00:00:21.240> go<00:00:21.510> let's<00:00:22.080> say<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.380> had<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> complex

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
we can go let's say we had a complex

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.109 
we can go let's say we had a complex
number<00:00:23.250> 3<00:00:24.210> plus<00:00:24.630> 2i<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.830> we're<00:00:26.760> going<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> add

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
number 3 plus 2i and we're going to add

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.460 
number 3 plus 2i and we're going to add
it<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.330> another<00:00:27.539> complex<00:00:28.140> number<00:00:28.289> negative<00:00:29.150> 5

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
it to another complex number negative 5

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.280 
it to another complex number negative 5
plus<00:00:31.579> 4i<00:00:33.110> and<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.200> was<00:00:34.320> going<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.500> add<00:00:34.620> those<00:00:34.920> two

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
plus 4i and I was going to add those two

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.510 
plus 4i and I was going to add those two
complex<00:00:37.290> numbers<00:00:37.350> together<00:00:37.710> how<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.460> do

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
complex numbers together how can I do

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.959 
complex numbers together how can I do
that<00:00:39.559> well

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
that well

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.280 
that well

remember if you have I'm giving you a
sub<00:00:43.860> example<00:00:44.309> here<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.550> illustrate<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:45.059> I'm

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
sub example here to illustrate what I'm

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.979 
sub example here to illustrate what I'm
talking<00:00:45.390> about<00:00:45.450> if<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.289> 2x<00:00:47.149> plus<00:00:48.149> y<00:00:48.539> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
talking about if you have 2x plus y and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.779 
talking about if you have 2x plus y and
you're<00:00:49.260> gonna<00:00:49.379> add<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.539> 3x<00:00:51.539> plus<00:00:52.410> y<00:00:52.890> how

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
you're gonna add that to 3x plus y how

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.549 
you're gonna add that to 3x plus y how
could<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.210> well<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.260> should<00:00:55.440> know

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
could you do that well you should know

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.819 
could you do that well you should know
how<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.180> you<00:00:57.180> add<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.899> terms<00:00:57.930> 2x

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
how to do that you add the like terms 2x

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.729 
how to do that you add the like terms 2x
plus<00:00:59.250> 3x<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.940> 5x<00:01:00.890> y<00:01:01.890> plus<00:01:02.250> y<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:03.239> 2y<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:04.530> know

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
plus 3x is 5x y plus y is 2y you know

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.410 
plus 3x is 5x y plus y is 2y you know
from<00:01:05.129> your<00:01:05.220> algebra<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.880> can't<00:01:06.119> do

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
from your algebra that you can't do

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.700 
from your algebra that you can't do
anything<00:01:06.630> more<00:01:06.810> with<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.229> because<00:01:07.590> you've

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
anything more with this because you've

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.679 
anything more with this because you've
got<00:01:07.860> some<00:01:08.250> multiple<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.880> X<00:01:09.060> some<00:01:09.330> multiple<00:01:09.630> of

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
got some multiple of X some multiple of

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.359 
got some multiple of X some multiple of
Y<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.350> can't<00:01:10.590> add<00:01:10.830> those<00:01:11.040> anymore

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
Y and you just can't add those anymore

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.020 
Y and you just can't add those anymore
they're<00:01:11.549> different<00:01:11.760> things<00:01:12.119> okay<00:01:13.939> what<00:01:14.939> I'm

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
they're different things okay what I'm

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.980 
they're different things okay what I'm
trying<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> point<00:01:15.420> out<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
trying to point out to you is the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.770 
trying to point out to you is the
complex<00:01:16.560> numbers<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.040> no<00:01:17.640> different<00:01:18.210> than<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
complex numbers is no different than the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.200 
complex numbers is no different than the
knowledge<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.409> already<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
knowledge you already have this is a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.469 
knowledge you already have this is a
like<00:01:21.509> term<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.220> this<00:01:23.220> 2i<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.150> like

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
like term with this this 2i is a like

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.830 
like term with this this 2i is a like
term<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.259> 4i<00:01:25.549> so<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.030> context<00:01:27.810> you

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
term with the 4i so in that context you

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.840 
term with the 4i so in that context you
can<00:01:28.049> kind<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.439> treat<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.829> eye<00:01:28.860> almost<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:29.820> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
can kind of treat the eye almost like a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.390 
can kind of treat the eye almost like a
variable<00:01:30.240> almost<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:32.070> when<00:01:32.189> you're<00:01:32.280> adding

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
variable almost so when you're adding

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.590 
variable almost so when you're adding
complex<00:01:32.970> numbers<00:01:33.270> 3<00:01:34.280> plus<00:01:35.280> negative<00:01:35.880> 5<00:01:36.299> is

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
complex numbers 3 plus negative 5 is

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.670 
complex numbers 3 plus negative 5 is
going<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.780> be<00:01:36.840> negative<00:01:37.320> 2<00:01:38.930> plus<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
going to be negative 2 plus this is a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.880 
going to be negative 2 plus this is a
light<00:01:40.920> term<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.490> 2<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> plus<00:01:42.479> 4<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.990> 6<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
light term with this 2 I plus 4 is 6 I

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.210 
light term with this 2 I plus 4 is 6 I
and<00:01:44.630> that's<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.840> answer<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.799> problem

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and that's the answer to that problem

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.429 
and that's the answer to that problem
and<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.939> normally<00:01:48.270> write<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.689> real<00:01:49.170> part

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
and you normally write the real part

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.050 
and you normally write the real part
first<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> imaginary<00:01:50.009> part<00:01:50.579> second<00:01:50.939> just

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
first and the imaginary part second just

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.300 
first and the imaginary part second just
like<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.329> have<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:51.600> okay<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.100> when<00:01:53.189> you're

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
like we have it here okay so when you're

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.679 
like we have it here okay so when you're
adding<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.729> add<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.939> real<00:01:54.090> part<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.540> get<00:01:54.659> a

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
adding you add the real part you get a

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.090 
adding you add the real part you get a
number<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.110> add<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.380> imaginary<00:01:55.500> part<00:01:55.979> you

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
number you add the imaginary part you

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.080 
number you add the imaginary part you
get<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.219> number<00:01:56.399> ok<00:01:57.350> let's<00:01:58.350> do<00:01:58.500> another<00:01:58.590> one

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
get a number ok let's do another one

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:07.249 
get a number ok let's do another one
let's<00:02:00.090> say<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.540> have<00:02:01.700> 7<00:02:02.700> minus<00:02:03.890> 3<00:02:04.890> minus<00:02:05.100> 7i<00:02:06.259> so

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
let's say we have 7 minus 3 minus 7i so

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.650 
let's say we have 7 minus 3 minus 7i so
this<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.710> number<00:02:07.860> seven<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:09.479> is

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
this is just a number seven and this is

this is just a number seven and this is
a<00:02:09.690> complex<00:02:10.170> number<00:02:10.289> 3<00:02:10.800> minus<00:02:11.099> 7i<00:02:11.520> one<00:02:12.180> thing<00:02:12.330> I

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
a complex number 3 minus 7i one thing I

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.250 
a complex number 3 minus 7i one thing I
want<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.629> point<00:02:12.810> out<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.110> you

you have you've ever known up until now
has<00:02:24.900> always<00:02:25.200> been<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:26.489> number<00:02:26.849> plus<00:02:26.970> zero<00:02:27.629> i

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
has always been that number plus zero i

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.270 
has always been that number plus zero i
if<00:02:28.140> we're<00:02:28.290> talking<00:02:28.500> about<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.680> fraction<00:02:29.099> it's

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
if we're talking about a fraction it's

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.330 
if we're talking about a fraction it's
3/4<00:02:29.970> plus<00:02:30.450> zero<00:02:31.019> i<00:02:31.319> if<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:31.890> doesn't<00:02:32.129> have<00:02:32.220> an

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
3/4 plus zero i if it doesn't have an

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.940 
3/4 plus zero i if it doesn't have an
imaginary<00:02:32.760> part<00:02:33.120> which<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.140> all<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> numbers

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
imaginary part which is all the numbers

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.119 
imaginary part which is all the numbers
up<00:02:35.040> until<00:02:35.280> now<00:02:35.400> we've<00:02:35.610> known<00:02:36.950> they<00:02:37.950> have<00:02:38.099> a

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
up until now we've known they have a

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.280 
up until now we've known they have a
zero<00:02:38.459> i<00:02:38.489> tacked<00:02:38.879> on<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.239> end<00:02:39.329> so<00:02:39.659> this<00:02:40.109> is

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
zero i tacked on to the end so this is

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.550 
zero i tacked on to the end so this is
just<00:02:40.409> 7<00:02:40.769> plus<00:02:40.950> 0<00:02:40.980> i<00:02:41.359> so<00:02:42.359> in<00:02:42.569> order<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:43.019> add<00:02:43.200> this

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
just 7 plus 0 i so in order to add this

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.080 
just 7 plus 0 i so in order to add this
these<00:02:43.859> complex<00:02:44.250> numbers<00:02:44.519> i've<00:02:44.640> got<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:44.939> add

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
these complex numbers i've got to add

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.319 
these complex numbers i've got to add
like<00:02:45.390> terms<00:02:46.310> this<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.519> real<00:02:47.760> number<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.269> is

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
like terms this is a real number this is

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.440 
like terms this is a real number this is
a<00:02:48.450> real<00:02:48.659> number<00:02:48.780> i<00:02:48.930> can<00:02:49.140> add<00:02:49.290> them<00:02:49.409> together

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
a real number i can add them together

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.599 
a real number i can add them together
but<00:02:51.450> before<00:02:51.720> we<00:02:51.840> do<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.019> i<00:02:52.440> want<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:53.220> simplify

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
but before we do that i want to simplify

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.069 
but before we do that i want to simplify
this<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.909> little<00:02:54.000> bit<00:02:54.209> i<00:02:54.329> want<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.599> distribute

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
this a little bit i want to distribute

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.449 
this a little bit i want to distribute
this<00:02:55.200> negative<00:02:55.500> one<00:02:55.950> here<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.370> i<00:02:56.400> have

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
this negative one here that i have

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.839 
this negative one here that i have
sitting<00:02:56.849> out<00:02:57.090> kind<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:57.989> in<00:02:58.170> like<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.129> so<00:02:59.730> i'm

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
sitting out kind of in like this so i'm

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.379 
sitting out kind of in like this so i'm
gonna<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.150> 7<00:03:00.870> minus<00:03:01.560> 3<00:03:02.190> negative<00:03:02.370> 1<00:03:02.849> times<00:03:03.150> 3

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
gonna have 7 minus 3 negative 1 times 3

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:08.390 
gonna have 7 minus 3 negative 1 times 3
negative<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:04.049> negative<00:03:04.230> 3<00:03:04.909> plus<00:03:06.319> 7i<00:03:07.400> negative

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
negative is negative 3 plus 7i negative

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.539 
negative is negative 3 plus 7i negative
1<00:03:08.609> times<00:03:09.030> negative<00:03:09.180> 7i<00:03:09.810> giving<00:03:10.109> me<00:03:10.170> positive

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
1 times negative 7i giving me positive

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.770 
1 times negative 7i giving me positive
7i<00:03:11.549> and<00:03:12.829> then<00:03:13.829> finally<00:03:14.340> i<00:03:14.489> just<00:03:14.579> add<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.629> real

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
7i and then finally i just add the real

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.589 
7i and then finally i just add the real
numbers<00:03:16.049> together<00:03:16.319> 7<00:03:16.680> minus<00:03:16.980> 3<00:03:17.489> gives<00:03:18.090> me<00:03:18.150> 4

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
numbers together 7 minus 3 gives me 4

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.430 
numbers together 7 minus 3 gives me 4
and<00:03:18.930> then<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.739> still<00:03:19.949> have<00:03:20.069> my<00:03:20.250> plus<00:03:20.569> 7i<00:03:21.569> left

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
and then I still have my plus 7i left

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.949 
and then I still have my plus 7i left
over<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:24.030> can't<00:03:24.269> do<00:03:24.389> anything<00:03:24.569> more<00:03:24.720> with

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
over and I can't do anything more with

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.449 
over and I can't do anything more with
this<00:03:25.079> because<00:03:25.349> now<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.530> have<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.739> real<00:03:26.010> part<00:03:26.280> I

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
this because now I have a real part I

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.420 
this because now I have a real part I
have<00:03:27.000> an<00:03:27.090> imaginary<00:03:27.599> part<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.109> I<00:03:28.530> can't<00:03:28.829> I

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
have an imaginary part and I can't I

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.009 
have an imaginary part and I can't I
can't<00:03:29.849> add<00:03:29.970> them<00:03:30.090> anymore<00:03:30.269> so<00:03:30.419> this<00:03:30.750> would<00:03:30.930> be

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
can't add them anymore so this would be

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.129 
can't add them anymore so this would be
the<00:03:31.109> answer<00:03:32.150> ok<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:33.449> you<00:03:33.540> can<00:03:33.629> see<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:33.959> stuff

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
the answer ok so you can see this stuff

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.420 
the answer ok so you can see this stuff
isn't<00:03:34.290> really<00:03:34.470> hard<00:03:34.769> you<00:03:34.919> have<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.069> complex

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
isn't really hard you have a complex

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.770 
isn't really hard you have a complex
number<00:03:35.549> and<00:03:35.819> you<00:03:35.910> just<00:03:36.030> add<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.329> real<00:03:36.480> part<00:03:36.690> to

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
number and you just add the real part to

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.410 
number and you just add the real part to
add<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.019> imaginary<00:03:37.139> parts
