 the results of that 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.829
 it is like a big sport for us 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.090

 achieve our 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.299
 motorists processed exactly 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.509
 civilian cars as if their 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:47.939
 civilian maternity just bring 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:50.130
 What does this product say? 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.409
 please a few words about the results 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.090
 that's what let's say that's processed 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.069
 this car for example and what 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.439
 the result of the site is therefore tires themselves 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:03.060
 perfectly understand that he is the only one 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.819
 car as if walking to frame processed 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.049
 Wagner company's products in this machine 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:11.340
 we took it against close all the friction and 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:14.940
 let's say so when she 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.400
 let's go moves that is we left 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.840
 definitely fuel consumption meaning we 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.970
 we have on frame 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.070
 big let's say and drive more on 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.890
 them kilometers we are the most important we left 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.400
 on certain tasks which is 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.070
 we will lose less attention to the car after 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.530
 each race race that is does not understand 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.720
 those boxes all transmission cars 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.569
 which we always have before 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.489
 We were present now with Valera just 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.489

00:02:49.609 --> 00:03:01.790
 albert a few words then go 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:10.010

 friction in the engine of the cow 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.349
 recovery gears 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:25.049
