in<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:01.020> tutorial<00:00:01.260> we're<00:00:01.709> going<00:00:01.740> to<00:00:01.920> be

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
in this tutorial we're going to be

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.730 
in this tutorial we're going to be
looking<00:00:02.159> at<00:00:02.610> creating<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.419> simple<00:00:03.899> biped

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
looking at creating a simple biped

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.540 
looking at creating a simple biped
character<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.490> rigging<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:05.970> rigging<00:00:06.960> means

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
character and rigging it rigging means

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.570 
character and rigging it rigging means
attaching<00:00:08.550> our<00:00:08.670> geometry<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.440> biped<00:00:10.920> so

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
attaching our geometry to the biped so

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.629 
attaching our geometry to the biped so
that<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.820> can<00:00:11.969> be<00:00:12.090> animated<00:00:12.740> usually<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.980> full

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
that it can be animated usually a full

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.300 
that it can be animated usually a full
character<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.360> modeled<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.900> then<00:00:16.440> wreaked<00:00:17.100> on

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
character is modeled and then wreaked on

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.210 
character is modeled and then wreaked on
to<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.850> biped<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:19.260> our<00:00:19.410> case<00:00:19.619> though<00:00:19.859> which<00:00:20.070> is

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
to the biped in our case though which is

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.830 
to the biped in our case though which is
going<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.460> take<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.699> simpler<00:00:21.150> approach<00:00:21.300> and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
going to take a simpler approach and

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.830 
going to take a simpler approach and
produce<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.710> simple<00:00:23.189> character<00:00:23.550> by<00:00:24.240> simply

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
produce a simple character by simply

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.830 
produce a simple character by simply
attaching<00:00:25.350> some<00:00:25.560> geometry<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> biped<00:00:27.000> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
attaching some geometry to the biped the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.570 
attaching some geometry to the biped the
first<00:00:28.109> step<00:00:28.380> will<00:00:28.560> be<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.680> create<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.160> biped

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
first step will be to create the biped

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.610 
first step will be to create the biped
so<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.119> go<00:00:30.300> into<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:31.260> create<00:00:31.830> mode<00:00:32.340> click<00:00:33.239> on

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
so we go into the create mode click on

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.160 
so we go into the create mode click on
systems<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.890> then<00:00:35.550> select<00:00:36.000> biped<00:00:36.899> for<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
systems and then select biped for the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.369 
systems and then select biped for the
option<00:00:37.469> type<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.010> then<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:39.000> simple<00:00:39.989> click<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
option type and then a simple click and

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.100 
option type and then a simple click and
drag<00:00:40.770> will<00:00:41.340> create<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> suitable<00:00:42.180> biped<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:42.960> us

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
drag will create a suitable biped for us

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.860 
drag will create a suitable biped for us
to<00:00:43.350> rig<00:00:43.620> I've<00:00:44.579> already<00:00:44.850> done<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:45.660> and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
to rig I've already done that here and

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.029 
to rig I've already done that here and
I've<00:00:46.110> also<00:00:46.260> modeled<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.690> simple<00:00:48.690> head<00:00:49.649> shape

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
I've also modeled a simple head shape

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.420 
I've also modeled a simple head shape
which<00:00:51.030> I've<00:00:51.329> placed<00:00:51.750> over<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.949> top<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
which I've placed over the top of the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.020 
which I've placed over the top of the
skull<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.000> biped<00:00:58.280> once<00:00:59.280> we've<00:00:59.550> created

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
skull on the biped once we've created

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.299 
skull on the biped once we've created
the<00:01:00.329> geometry<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.260> just<00:01:01.469> need<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.980> use<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the geometry we just need to use a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.570 
the geometry we just need to use a
modifier<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.510> attach<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.350> geometry<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
modifier to attach that geometry to the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.480 
modifier to attach that geometry to the
appropriate<00:01:05.970> part<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> biped<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.250> that

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
appropriate part of the biped to do that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.910 
appropriate part of the biped to do that
we<00:01:09.030> apply<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.570> modifier<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.530> need<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.770> go

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
we apply a modifier so we need to go

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.030 
we apply a modifier so we need to go
into<00:01:11.100> modify<00:01:12.030> mode<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:13.650> from<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
into modify mode and then from the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.420 
into modify mode and then from the
modifier<00:01:14.460> list<00:01:14.490> pick<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.570> physique<00:01:16.530> modifier

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
modifier list pick a physique modifier

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.020 
modifier list pick a physique modifier
and<00:01:17.759> apply<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.520> head<00:01:20.520> shape<00:01:20.820> that

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
and apply that to the head shape that

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.120 
and apply that to the head shape that
we've<00:01:21.150> got<00:01:21.360> there<00:01:21.740> once<00:01:22.740> we've<00:01:22.890> got<00:01:22.920> that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
we've got there once we've got that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.969 
we've got there once we've got that
sorted<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.909> go<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.420> click<00:01:24.960> under<00:01:25.350> physique<00:01:25.740> we

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
sorted we go and click under physique we

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.789 
sorted we go and click under physique we
click<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.490> attach<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.479> node<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.560> see

the keyboard to pick the object and then

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.310 
the keyboard to pick the object and then
we'll<00:01:36.630> select<00:01:37.520> bit<00:01:38.520> 01<00:01:39.090> head<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.630> my<00:01:39.810> case<00:01:40.079> and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
we'll select bit 01 head in my case and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.020 
we'll select bit 01 head in my case and
then<00:01:40.979> click<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.549> pick<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:43.700> initialize<00:01:44.700> and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
then click on pick and initialize and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.859 
then click on pick and initialize and
that<00:01:45.659> will<00:01:45.840> attach<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.890> head<00:01:47.159> shape<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
that will attach the head shape to the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.410 
that will attach the head shape to the
head<00:01:51.619> okay<00:01:52.619> now<00:01:52.890> I've<00:01:53.159> gone<00:01:53.369> ahead<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.909> added

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
head okay now I've gone ahead and added

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.639 
head okay now I've gone ahead and added
some<00:01:55.130> geometry<00:01:56.130> I've<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:56.939> created<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.899> simple

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
some geometry I've just created a simple

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.760 
some geometry I've just created a simple
cylinder<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.549> torso<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.299> put<00:02:01.259> some<00:02:01.409> boxes

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
cylinder for torso and put some boxes

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.260 
cylinder for torso and put some boxes
shapes<00:02:02.009> over<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> hands<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:02.969> feet<00:02:03.210> just

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
shapes over the hands and the feet just

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.850 
shapes over the hands and the feet just
so<00:02:03.630> we've<00:02:03.780> got<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.110> bit<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.320> geometry

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
so we've got a little bit of geometry

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.850 
so we've got a little bit of geometry
and<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.100> can<00:02:05.280> see<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:06.119> character<00:02:06.570> dance<00:02:06.860> I'll

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
and you can see the character dance I'll

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.089 
and you can see the character dance I'll
expect<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.509> you'll<00:02:09.560> do<00:02:10.560> something<00:02:10.920> slightly

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
expect that you'll do something slightly

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.619 
expect that you'll do something slightly
more<00:02:11.370> creative<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:11.940> elaborate<00:02:12.330> than<00:02:12.480> this

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
more creative and elaborate than this

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:12.990 
more creative and elaborate than this
when

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
when

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.150 
when
get<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.540> do<00:02:13.660> your<00:02:13.930> work<00:02:14.140> but<00:02:14.620> I'm<00:02:14.770> just<00:02:14.950> wanting

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
get to do your work but I'm just wanting

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.590 
get to do your work but I'm just wanting
to<00:02:15.190> demonstrate<00:02:15.760> how<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:15.940> do<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.330> at<00:02:16.510> this

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
to demonstrate how to do this at this

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.290 
to demonstrate how to do this at this
stage<00:02:17.100> now<00:02:18.100> we're<00:02:18.460> going<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.700> actually<00:02:18.820> do<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
stage now we're going to actually do the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.980 
stage now we're going to actually do the
animation<00:02:19.420> by<00:02:20.110> loading<00:02:20.920> some<00:02:21.580> motion<00:02:22.540> capture

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
animation by loading some motion capture

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.970 
animation by loading some motion capture
files<00:02:23.290> these<00:02:24.130> come<00:02:24.580> with<00:02:24.660> there's<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.890> group<00:02:26.890> of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
files these come with there's a group of

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.400 
files these come with there's a group of
these<00:02:27.100> come<00:02:27.370> with<00:02:27.400> Autodesk<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.290> can

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
these come with Autodesk and you can

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.810 
these come with Autodesk and you can
also<00:02:29.530> download<00:02:29.830> them<00:02:30.160> off<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.370> net<00:02:30.610> and

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
also download them off the net and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.900 
also download them off the net and
further<00:02:31.540> from<00:02:31.660> different<00:02:32.110> places<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:33.340> file

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
further from different places the file

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.600 
further from different places the file
format<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.510> will<00:02:34.630> be<00:02:34.780> using<00:02:35.020> will<00:02:35.380> be<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.100> bit

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
format that will be using will be a bit

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.040 
format that will be using will be a bit
VIP<00:02:37.180> format<00:02:37.990> and<00:02:38.230> we<00:02:39.130> just<00:02:39.310> need<00:02:39.490> to<00:02:40.020> use<00:02:41.020> the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
VIP format and we just need to use the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.180 
VIP format and we just need to use the
motion<00:02:41.970> section<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.150> Autodesk<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:44.260> import

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
motion section of Autodesk to import

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.670 
motion section of Autodesk to import
those<00:02:45.459> files<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.870> make<00:02:47.200> our<00:02:47.440> little

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
those files and make our little

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.580 
those files and make our little
character<00:02:48.100> do<00:02:48.730> some<00:02:48.970> moving<00:02:49.270> around<00:02:49.690> so<00:02:50.470> the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
character do some moving around so the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.090 
character do some moving around so the
first<00:02:50.770> thing<00:02:50.860> we<00:02:51.070> need<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.250> do<00:02:51.489> is<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:52.239> select

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
first thing we need to do is to select

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.120 
first thing we need to do is to select
the<00:02:54.959> biped<00:02:55.959> so<00:02:56.650> if<00:02:57.070> I<00:02:58.110> click<00:02:59.110> in<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.650> character

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
the biped so if I click in the character

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.220 
the biped so if I click in the character
and<00:03:00.280> press<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.820> H<00:03:01.480> key<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:03.550> select<00:03:04.330> bit<00:03:04.720> o<00:03:04.959> 1

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
and press the H key and select bit o 1

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.800 
and press the H key and select bit o 1
which<00:03:05.470> is<00:03:05.590> my<00:03:05.739> biped<00:03:06.220> character<00:03:06.760> it'll<00:03:07.540> select

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
which is my biped character it'll select

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.960 
which is my biped character it'll select
that<00:03:08.050> character<00:03:08.560> now<00:03:09.010> over<00:03:09.520> on<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.730> right<00:03:09.940> of

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
that character now over on the right of

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.250 
that character now over on the right of
the<00:03:10.330> screen<00:03:10.450> I'll<00:03:10.900> click<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:12.190> motion<00:03:13.260> icon

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
the screen I'll click the motion icon

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.580 
the screen I'll click the motion icon
and<00:03:15.100> that<00:03:15.340> gives<00:03:15.520> me<00:03:15.610> my<00:03:15.820> motion<00:03:16.350> panel<00:03:17.350> here

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
and that gives me my motion panel here

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.289 
and that gives me my motion panel here
to<00:03:17.860> control<00:03:18.280> motion<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.880> we're<00:03:19.030> going<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.180> use

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
to control motion and we're going to use

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.860 
to control motion and we're going to use
the<00:03:19.450> motion<00:03:19.870> mixer<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.980> create<00:03:21.459> these<00:03:21.730> so<00:03:22.480> I'll

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
the motion mixer to create these so I'll

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.729 
the motion mixer to create these so I'll
click<00:03:23.140> on<00:03:23.519> mixer<00:03:24.519> and<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.930> mixer<00:03:26.230> panel<00:03:26.560> comes

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
click on mixer and the mixer panel comes

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.229 
click on mixer and the mixer panel comes
up<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.220> can<00:03:28.120> then<00:03:28.360> just<00:03:28.630> import<00:03:29.260> different

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
up I can then just import different

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.870 
up I can then just import different
motions<00:03:31.239> into<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.440> mixer<00:03:32.799> so<00:03:33.580> that<00:03:33.760> my

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
motions into the mixer so that my

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.590 
motions into the mixer so that my
character<00:03:34.060> will<00:03:34.510> move<00:03:35.970> one<00:03:36.970> thing<00:03:37.209> I<00:03:37.299> want<00:03:37.540> to

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
character will move one thing I want to

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.789 
character will move one thing I want to
do<00:03:37.780> though<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.049> I'm<00:03:38.290> going<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:38.470> be<00:03:38.620> adding

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
do though is I'm going to be adding

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.620 
do though is I'm going to be adding
quite<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.310> number<00:03:39.580> of<00:03:39.700> dance<00:03:40.030> steps<00:03:40.420> and

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
quite a number of dance steps and

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.620 
quite a number of dance steps and
different<00:03:40.959> motions<00:03:41.410> so<00:03:42.299> that<00:03:43.299> could<00:03:43.480> actually

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
different motions so that could actually

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.690 
different motions so that could actually
look<00:03:43.900> quite<00:03:44.079> odd<00:03:44.380> if<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.769> just<00:03:45.220> run<00:03:45.430> them<00:03:45.549> one

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
look quite odd if you just run them one

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.100 
look quite odd if you just run them one
after<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:45.970> other<00:03:46.090> because<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.660> character

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
after the other because the character

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.039 
after the other because the character
jerks<00:03:47.890> are<00:03:48.400> naturally<00:03:49.120> between<00:03:49.510> motions

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
jerks are naturally between motions

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.620 
jerks are naturally between motions
jumping<00:03:50.620> from<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.489> end<00:03:51.640> of<00:03:51.790> one<00:03:51.970> motion<00:03:52.209> to

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
jumping from the end of one motion to

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.770 
jumping from the end of one motion to
the<00:03:52.660> start<00:03:53.019> of<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.200> next<00:03:53.350> so<00:03:54.130> I'd<00:03:54.280> like

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
the start of the next so I'd like

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.930 
the start of the next so I'd like
Autodesk<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:56.140> put<00:03:56.320> in<00:03:56.440> some<00:03:56.470> nice<00:03:56.940> transitions

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
Autodesk to put in some nice transitions

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.420 
Autodesk to put in some nice transitions
so<00:03:58.570> that<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:59.049> character<00:03:59.650> moves<00:03:59.920> smoothly

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
so that the character moves smoothly

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.000 
so that the character moves smoothly
from<00:04:00.940> motion<00:04:01.390> to<00:04:01.510> motion<00:04:01.900> so<00:04:02.590> this<00:04:02.769> first

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
from motion to motion so this first

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.490 
from motion to motion so this first
track<00:04:03.519> here<00:04:03.910> which<00:04:04.630> we're<00:04:05.140> going<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.380> be<00:04:05.440> using

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
track here which we're going to be using

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.440 
track here which we're going to be using
to<00:04:05.890> add<00:04:06.040> emotions<00:04:06.370> I'll<00:04:06.760> actually<00:04:07.090> change

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
to add emotions I'll actually change

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.380 
to add emotions I'll actually change
that<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:08.440> a<00:04:08.470> transitions<00:04:09.430> track<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:10.030> right

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
that to a transitions track so right

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.000 
that to a transitions track so right
click<00:04:10.870> on<00:04:11.019> that<00:04:11.769> track<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:13.200> click<00:04:14.200> on<00:04:14.380> convert

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
click on that track and click on convert

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.180 
click on that track and click on convert
to<00:04:15.370> transition<00:04:16.329> track<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:16.870> that<00:04:16.919> will<00:04:17.919> create

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
to transition track and that will create

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.670 
to transition track and that will create
a<00:04:18.690> transition<00:04:19.690> track<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:20.079> we<00:04:20.169> can<00:04:20.320> make<00:04:20.470> some

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
a transition track that we can make some

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.950 
a transition track that we can make some
transitions<00:04:21.310> with<00:04:21.489> now<00:04:22.210> let's<00:04:22.539> just<00:04:22.750> get<00:04:22.900> a

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
transitions with now let's just get a

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.390 
transitions with now let's just get a
few<00:04:23.169> motions<00:04:23.620> happening<00:04:24.010> here<00:04:24.250> I'll

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
few motions happening here I'll

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.290 
few motions happening here I'll
right-click<00:04:25.270> again

browse to yours probably and we'll just
select<00:04:43.430> a<00:04:43.819> motion<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.960> put<00:04:45.110> in<00:04:45.259> there<00:04:45.440> and

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
select a motion to put in there and

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.700 
select a motion to put in there and
click<00:04:45.740> open<00:04:46.069> and<00:04:46.400> put<00:04:47.389> that<00:04:47.569> one<00:04:47.780> in<00:04:48.050> place

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
click open and put that one in place

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.740 
click open and put that one in place
there<00:04:49.069> now<00:04:49.669> if<00:04:49.940> I<00:04:50.000> want<00:04:50.150> to<00:04:50.180> add<00:04:50.300> another<00:04:50.419> one

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
there now if I want to add another one

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.170 
there now if I want to add another one
afterwards<00:04:51.759> new<00:04:52.759> clip<00:04:53.060> from<00:04:53.659> files<00:04:54.849> I'm<00:04:55.849> just

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
afterwards new clip from files I'm just

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.749 
afterwards new clip from files I'm just
picking<00:04:56.360> them<00:04:56.509> at<00:04:56.599> random<00:04:56.750> here<00:04:57.199> catwalk<00:04:57.759> open

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
picking them at random here catwalk open

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:02.770 
picking them at random here catwalk open
and<00:04:59.169> it<00:05:00.169> will<00:05:00.349> add<00:05:00.620> catwalk<00:05:01.280> in<00:05:01.580> plus<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.539> little

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
and it will add catwalk in plus a little

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.070 
and it will add catwalk in plus a little
transition<00:05:03.379> here<00:05:03.919> which<00:05:04.580> we<00:05:05.180> can<00:05:05.419> which<00:05:05.900> will

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
transition here which we can which will

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.339 
transition here which we can which will
cause<00:05:06.379> a<00:05:06.409> smooth<00:05:06.919> motion<00:05:07.219> between<00:05:07.580> them<00:05:08.349> it's

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
cause a smooth motion between them it's

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:15.430 
cause a smooth motion between them it's
bugging<00:05:09.710> another<00:05:09.949> one<00:05:12.669> dance<00:05:13.669> hot<00:05:13.969> one<00:05:14.440> open

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
bugging another one dance hot one open

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.540 
bugging another one dance hot one open
and<00:05:16.300> that<00:05:17.300> adds<00:05:17.479> that<00:05:17.719> in<00:05:17.930> there<00:05:18.169> as<00:05:18.289> well<00:05:18.550> so

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
and that adds that in there as well so

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.279 
and that adds that in there as well so
I've<00:05:19.639> got<00:05:19.819> three<00:05:20.150> motions<00:05:20.659> here<00:05:20.990> with

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
I've got three motions here with

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.040 
I've got three motions here with
transitions<00:05:21.919> and<00:05:22.159> that<00:05:22.610> gives<00:05:22.849> me<00:05:23.210> a<00:05:23.479> total

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
transitions and that gives me a total

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.270 
transitions and that gives me a total
length<00:05:24.500> animation<00:05:25.219> of<00:05:25.340> about<00:05:25.669> 640<00:05:27.280> or

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
length animation of about 640 or

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.019 
length animation of about 640 or
thereabouts--<00:05:28.969> so<00:05:29.719> I<00:05:30.400> can<00:05:31.400> leave<00:05:31.610> that<00:05:31.819> now

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:32.029 
thereabouts-- so I can leave that now

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.480 
thereabouts-- so I can leave that now
minimize<00:05:32.659> that<00:05:32.930> I<00:05:33.169> just<00:05:34.009> need<00:05:34.159> to<00:05:34.190> make<00:05:34.430> sure

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
minimize that I just need to make sure

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.129 
minimize that I just need to make sure
that<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:36.430> length<00:05:37.430> of<00:05:37.669> my<00:05:37.729> innovation<00:05:38.449> matches

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
that the length of my innovation matches

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.529 
that the length of my innovation matches
the<00:05:39.289> length<00:05:39.529> of<00:05:39.740> my<00:05:39.800> emotions<00:05:40.460> so<00:05:40.940> if<00:05:41.300> I<00:05:41.479> click

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
the length of my emotions so if I click

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:46.450 
the length of my emotions so if I click
on<00:05:41.990> here<00:05:42.889> and<00:05:43.060> change<00:05:44.060> the<00:05:44.690> end<00:05:45.199> time<00:05:45.620> so<00:05:46.279> that

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
on here and change the end time so that

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:53.670 
on here and change the end time so that
it<00:05:46.580> matches<00:05:46.759> the<00:05:50.680> length<00:05:51.680> of<00:05:51.800> my<00:05:51.860> animation

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
it matches the length of my animation

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.589 
it matches the length of my animation
they<00:05:54.680> look<00:05:54.919> a<00:05:55.009> little<00:05:55.099> bit<00:05:55.310> better<00:05:55.520> okay<00:05:56.389> as

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
they look a little bit better okay as

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:58.330 
they look a little bit better okay as
you<00:05:56.750> can<00:05:56.840> see<00:05:56.960> my<00:05:57.080> characters<00:05:57.620> sitting<00:05:58.159> there

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
you can see my characters sitting there

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.540 
you can see my characters sitting there
ready<00:05:58.819> to<00:05:58.879> move<00:05:59.330> I'll<00:06:00.050> just<00:06:00.349> move<00:06:01.129> back<00:06:01.190> a<00:06:01.460> bit

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
ready to move I'll just move back a bit

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.450 
ready to move I'll just move back a bit
so<00:06:01.940> we<00:06:02.060> can<00:06:02.090> see<00:06:02.240> it<00:06:02.659> better<00:06:02.810> and<00:06:03.110> play<00:06:03.979> the

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
so we can see it better and play the

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.930 
so we can see it better and play the
motion<00:06:05.919> you<00:06:06.919> can<00:06:07.069> see<00:06:07.250> my<00:06:07.370> character<00:06:07.789> going

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
motion you can see my character going

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.339 
motion you can see my character going
through<00:06:08.150> all<00:06:08.360> the<00:06:08.479> motions<00:06:08.629> with<00:06:09.110> nice

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
through all the motions with nice

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:25.420 
through all the motions with nice
transitions

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:32.390 

okay<00:06:26.430> that'll<00:06:26.910> do<00:06:28.880> okay<00:06:29.880> so<00:06:30.320> this<00:06:31.320> is<00:06:31.770> the

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
okay that'll do okay so this is the

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
okay that'll do okay so this is the
final<00:06:33.030> result<00:06:33.680> I've<00:06:34.680> put<00:06:35.520> a<00:06:35.550> hide<00:06:35.880> on<00:06:36.360> the

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
final result I've put a hide on the

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.250 
final result I've put a hide on the
biped<00:06:37.230> so<00:06:38.220> all<00:06:38.370> you<00:06:38.490> can<00:06:38.520> see<00:06:38.820> is<00:06:38.850> the<00:06:39.260> pieces

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
biped so all you can see is the pieces

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.100 
biped so all you can see is the pieces
of<00:06:40.410> geometry<00:06:40.680> that<00:06:41.130> I've<00:06:41.220> created<00:06:41.400> and

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
of geometry that I've created and

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.470 
of geometry that I've created and
rendered<00:06:43.110> that<00:06:43.260> out<00:06:43.440> as<00:06:43.560> an<00:06:43.650> animation<00:06:44.480> it's

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.480 
rendered that out as an animation it's

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.450 
rendered that out as an animation it's
pretty<00:06:45.750> crude<00:06:46.050> but<00:06:46.590> really<00:06:47.430> just

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
pretty crude but really just

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.850 
pretty crude but really just
illustrating<00:06:48.150> a<00:06:48.210> point<00:06:48.240> for<00:06:48.720> you<00:06:48.870> I<00:06:49.020> hope<00:06:49.650> that

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
illustrating a point for you I hope that

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.530 
illustrating a point for you I hope that
you<00:06:50.040> will<00:06:50.190> come<00:06:50.400> up<00:06:50.520> with<00:06:50.550> a<00:06:50.790> much<00:06:51.240> more

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 
you will come up with a much more

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.090 
you will come up with a much more
interesting<00:06:52.170> little<00:06:52.350> character<00:06:52.830> than<00:06:52.980> this

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
interesting little character than this

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.450 
interesting little character than this
and<00:06:53.630> also<00:06:54.630> of<00:06:54.960> course<00:06:55.200> you<00:06:55.770> will<00:06:55.950> need<00:06:56.160> to<00:06:56.280> put

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 
and also of course you will need to put

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.130 
and also of course you will need to put
in<00:06:56.580> a<00:06:56.610> musical<00:06:57.330> background<00:06:57.780> for<00:06:58.020> the

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:58.140 
in a musical background for the

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.640 
in a musical background for the
character<00:06:58.560> to<00:06:58.740> dance<00:06:58.950> to<00:07:00.050> there<00:07:01.050> are<00:07:01.230> a<00:07:01.260> few

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
character to dance to there are a few

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.090 
character to dance to there are a few
things<00:07:01.950> that<00:07:02.130> can<00:07:02.430> go<00:07:02.460> wrong<00:07:03.560> sometimes<00:07:04.560> for

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 
things that can go wrong sometimes for

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.100 
things that can go wrong sometimes for
instance<00:07:05.460> one<00:07:05.700> body<00:07:05.970> part<00:07:06.180> will<00:07:06.510> pass<00:07:06.720> through

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
instance one body part will pass through

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.920 
instance one body part will pass through
another<00:07:07.560> that<00:07:08.550> can<00:07:08.700> be<00:07:08.820> fixed<00:07:09.090> because<00:07:09.570> you

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930 
another that can be fixed because you

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.780 
another that can be fixed because you
can<00:07:10.140> edit<00:07:10.410> the<00:07:10.680> motion<00:07:11.070> reasonably

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.790 
can edit the motion reasonably

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.850 
can edit the motion reasonably
accurately<00:07:12.210> and<00:07:12.990> move<00:07:13.230> things<00:07:13.470> around<00:07:13.650> a

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
accurately and move things around a

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.860 
accurately and move things around a
little<00:07:13.920> bit<00:07:14.130> so<00:07:14.400> that<00:07:14.430> it<00:07:14.940> doesn't<00:07:15.270> happen<00:07:15.540> but

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:15.870 
little bit so that it doesn't happen but

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.750 
little bit so that it doesn't happen but
if<00:07:16.380> you<00:07:16.560> get<00:07:16.680> into<00:07:16.860> a<00:07:16.950> few<00:07:17.130> problems<00:07:17.220> with<00:07:17.490> that

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:17.760 
if you get into a few problems with that

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.260 
if you get into a few problems with that
then<00:07:18.030> we<00:07:18.660> can<00:07:18.690> do<00:07:18.870> some<00:07:19.050> research<00:07:19.230> and<00:07:20.120> you<00:07:21.120> can

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:21.270 
then we can do some research and you can

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.230 
then we can do some research and you can
find<00:07:21.540> out<00:07:21.720> how<00:07:21.870> to<00:07:21.960> fix<00:07:22.170> that<00:07:23.060> I'll<00:07:24.060> look

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
find out how to fix that I'll look

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.790 
find out how to fix that I'll look
forward<00:07:24.510> to<00:07:24.600> seeing<00:07:24.900> what<00:07:25.230> you<00:07:25.440> can<00:07:25.560> come<00:07:25.740> up

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 
forward to seeing what you can come up

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.010 
forward to seeing what you can come up
with<00:07:26.070> hopefully<00:07:26.490> it's<00:07:26.640> a<00:07:26.850> lot<00:07:27.360> more<00:07:27.390> inspired

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 
with hopefully it's a lot more inspired

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.110 
with hopefully it's a lot more inspired
than this<00:07:28.380> and<00:07:28.740> we'll<00:07:29.580> see<00:07:29.760> here<00:07:29.910> we<00:07:30.000> go

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 
than this and we'll see here we go

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.820 
than this and we'll see here we go
you've<00:07:30.420> got<00:07:30.480> two<00:07:30.870> weeks<00:07:31.050> to<00:07:31.200> complete<00:07:31.410> this

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:31.830 
you've got two weeks to complete this

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.960 
you've got two weeks to complete this
exercise<00:07:32.660> see<00:07:33.660> you<00:07:33.780> later
