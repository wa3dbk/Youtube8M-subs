00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
debate of whether or not he should have

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.820

Facebook Twitter the online gaming that

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.539 
Facebook Twitter the online gaming that
Julis<00:03:20.880> was<00:03:21.090> doing<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.889> that<00:03:22.889> needs<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.250> be<00:03:23.519> a

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
Julis was doing and that needs to be a

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.150 
Julis was doing and that needs to be a
real<00:03:24.480> focus<00:03:24.660> there<00:03:25.200> needs<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.500> be<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.709> healthy

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160

real focus there needs to be a healthy
balance<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:27.350> I<00:03:28.350> think<00:03:28.859> that<00:03:29.450> even<00:03:30.450> though<00:03:30.840> all

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
balance and I think that even though all

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.599 
balance and I think that even though all
of<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.459> was<00:03:32.790> done<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.440> he<00:03:34.440> did<00:03:34.620> say<00:03:34.829> it<00:03:35.010> it

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
of this was done and he did say it it

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.300 
of this was done and he did say it it
took<00:03:35.790> him<00:03:35.970> over<00:03:36.090> 200<00:03:36.630> hours<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:37.200> get<00:03:37.889> all<00:03:38.130> of

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
took him over 200 hours to get all of

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.460 
took him over 200 hours to get all of
his<00:03:38.340> accomplishments<00:03:39.329> done<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.720> really<00:03:40.260> think

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
his accomplishments done I really think

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.699 
his accomplishments done I really think
there<00:03:40.620> needs<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.950> be<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.430> medium<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:43.230> don't

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
there needs to be a medium and I don't

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.920 
there needs to be a medium and I don't
know<00:03:43.920> hopefully<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.030> mother<00:03:45.239> learns<00:03:45.540> from

can really relate to the message that

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.240 
can really relate to the message that
communication<00:04:53.200> is<00:04:53.380> difficult<00:04:53.830> for

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250
