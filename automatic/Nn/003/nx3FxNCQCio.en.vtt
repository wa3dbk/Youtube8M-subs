different<00:01:48.990> about<00:01:49.259> whether<00:01:49.860> or<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.280> frame

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
different about whether or not the frame

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.160 
different about whether or not the frame
rates<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.180> improvement<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.990> so

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
rates that improvement of that so

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.080 
rates that improvement of that so
unfortunately<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.710> can't<00:01:52.950> say<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.520> notice

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
unfortunately I can't say that I notice

any of those things um but you know
there<00:01:56.130> are<00:01:56.159> some<00:01:56.460> stuff<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.210> oh<00:01:57.450> yeah<00:01:57.659> by<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
there are some stuff like oh yeah by the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.020 
there are some stuff like oh yeah by the
way<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.229> did<00:01:58.350> change<00:01:58.590> them<00:01:58.740> stuff<00:01:59.030> for

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
way we did change them stuff for

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.580 
way we did change them stuff for
connectivity<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.810> not

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
connectivity and not

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.539 
connectivity and not
I<00:02:01.649> didn't<00:02:01.890> see<00:02:01.950> anything<00:02:02.070> about<00:02:02.280> framerate

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
I didn't see anything about framerate

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.550 
I didn't see anything about framerate
specifically<00:02:03.119> got<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.479> that's<00:02:04.350> probably

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
specifically got so that's probably

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.139 
specifically got so that's probably
still<00:02:04.799> an<00:02:04.859> issue<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.280> those<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.060> that

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
have an issue i know i do and i think i

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.420 
have an issue i know i do and i think i
have<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.190> decent<00:02:08.429> computer<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.890> anyways<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
have a decent computer so anyways the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.880 
have a decent computer so anyways the
major<00:02:11.760> thing<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.660> probably<00:02:13.170> kind<00:02:13.800> of

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
major thing that is probably kind of

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.009 
major thing that is probably kind of
like<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.099> just<00:02:14.700> you'll<00:02:14.940> notice<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.629> whenever

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
like a just you'll notice it whenever

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.449 
like a just you'll notice it whenever
you<00:02:16.110> see<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.379> pretty<00:02:16.620> significantly<00:02:17.250> is

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
you see it's pretty significantly is

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.990 
you see it's pretty significantly is
that<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.239> skull<00:02:18.750> HUD<00:02:19.200> omen<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.799> now<00:02:20.190> gone<00:02:20.700> from

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
that the skull HUD omen is now gone from

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.970 
that the skull HUD omen is now gone from
system<00:02:21.330> hack<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:22.170> one<00:02:22.349> of<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.530> hands-down

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
system hack so one of the hands-down

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.589 
system hack so one of the hands-down
most<00:02:23.310> annoying<00:02:23.700> things<00:02:23.940> in<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.150> world<00:02:24.330> is

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
most annoying things in the world is

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.869 
most annoying things in the world is
just<00:02:24.690> gone<00:02:25.049> which<00:02:25.739> i<00:02:25.830> think<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.099> good<00:02:26.250> move<00:02:26.700> i

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
just gone which i think is a good move i

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.190 
just gone which i think is a good move i
don't<00:02:27.180> think<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.599> really<00:02:27.629> made<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> lot<00:02:28.170> of

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
don't think it really made a lot of

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.720 
don't think it really made a lot of
sense<00:02:28.319> that<00:02:28.590> there<00:02:28.860> was<00:02:28.980> something<00:02:29.099> like<00:02:29.519> you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
sense that there was something like you

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.059 
sense that there was something like you
are<00:02:29.849> now<00:02:29.879> cripplingly<00:02:30.690> blind<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.769> can't

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
are now cripplingly blind and you can't

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.789 
are now cripplingly blind and you can't
play<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.519> game<00:02:32.700> correctly<00:02:33.019> who<00:02:34.019> knows<00:02:34.200> so

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
play the game correctly who knows so

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.250 
play the game correctly who knows so
that<00:02:34.920> isn't<00:02:35.069> there<00:02:35.569> they<00:02:36.569> also<00:02:36.750> kind<00:02:37.170> of

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
that isn't there they also kind of

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.530 
that isn't there they also kind of
change<00:02:38.010> i<00:02:38.099> think<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.370> score<00:02:38.760> value<00:02:39.180> system

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
change i think the score value system

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.449 
change i think the score value system
and<00:02:39.690> all<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.900> junk<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:41.099> know<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.340> is

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
and all that junk so you know that is

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.860 
and all that junk so you know that is
what<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.730> there<00:02:42.090> are<00:02:42.150> several<00:02:42.360> different

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
what it is there are several different

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.420 
what it is there are several different
exploit<00:02:43.319> issues<00:02:43.769> where<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.010> guess<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.400> could

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
exploit issues where I guess you could

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.699 
exploit issues where I guess you could
have<00:02:44.780> people<00:02:45.780> glitching<00:02:46.110> out<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.230> map<00:02:46.500> and

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
have people glitching out a map and

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.229 
have people glitching out a map and

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
were like yeah I want to step up my game

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.660 
were like yeah I want to step up my game
and<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.590> want<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.859> know<00:03:22.950> kind<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.280> technically

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
and I want to know kind of technically

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.250 
and I want to know kind of technically
what's<00:03:23.880> going<00:03:24.120> on<00:03:24.269> just<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:24.599> I<00:03:24.630> can<00:03:24.750> improve<00:03:25.079> my

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
what's going on just so I can improve my

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.789 
what's going on just so I can improve my
game<00:03:25.519> strategically<00:03:26.519> or<00:03:27.090> whatever<00:03:27.329> else<00:03:27.799> but

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
game strategically or whatever else but

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.339 
game strategically or whatever else but
yeah<00:03:28.950> whenever<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:30.000> bullet<00:03:30.389> travels<00:03:30.840> distance

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
yeah whenever a bullet travels distance

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.740 
yeah whenever a bullet travels distance
it<00:03:31.650> drops<00:03:32.220> off<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.790> damaging<00:03:33.269> it's<00:03:33.569> not<00:03:33.690> that

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
it drops off and damaging it's not that

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.990 
it drops off and damaging it's not that
like<00:03:34.200> your<00:03:34.470> bullet<00:03:34.889> is<00:03:35.069> just<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.880> know

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
like your bullet is just you know

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.789 
like your bullet is just you know
whatever<00:03:36.419> it<00:03:36.720> just<00:03:37.109> feels<00:03:37.290> like<00:03:37.319> causing

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
whatever it just feels like causing

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.979 
whatever it just feels like causing
damage<00:03:38.160> then<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.940> magically<00:03:39.450> will<00:03:39.569> randomly

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
damage then just magically will randomly

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.349 
damage then just magically will randomly
just<00:03:40.200> fluctuating<00:03:40.889> damages<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.669> actually<00:03:41.970> has

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
just fluctuating damages it actually has

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.539 
just fluctuating damages it actually has
like<00:03:42.419> a<00:03:42.630> flat<00:03:43.109> drop-off<00:03:43.829> rate<00:03:44.099> so<00:03:44.280> let's<00:03:44.459> say

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
like a flat drop-off rate so let's say

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.400 
like a flat drop-off rate so let's say
that<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:44.760> do<00:03:44.880> 30<00:03:45.150> damage<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.750> 30<00:03:45.930> meters<00:03:46.260> if

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
that you do 30 damage of 30 meters if

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.000 
that you do 30 damage of 30 meters if
you<00:03:47.209> have<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.239> range<00:03:48.630> increase<00:03:49.079> variant<00:03:49.859> of

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
you have a range increase variant of

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.309 
you have a range increase variant of
your<00:03:50.130> gun<00:03:50.280> maybe<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:51.030> can<00:03:51.180> go<00:03:51.329> there<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.139> may<00:03:52.169> be

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
your gun maybe it can go there it may be

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.440 
your gun maybe it can go there it may be
can<00:03:52.470> do<00:03:52.590> than<00:03:52.769> 30<00:03:53.010> damage<00:03:53.340> at<00:03:53.669> 31<00:03:54.209> meters

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
can do than 30 damage at 31 meters

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.790 
can do than 30 damage at 31 meters
whenever<00:03:55.019> normally<00:03:55.380> would<00:03:55.530> fall<00:03:55.709> off<00:03:55.739> 17

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
whenever normally would fall off 17

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.860 
whenever normally would fall off 17
and<00:03:57.610> that<00:03:57.730> kind<00:03:57.940> of<00:03:57.970> stuff<00:03:58.030> so<00:03:58.270> it<00:03:58.510> can<00:03:58.660> be<00:03:58.780> the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
and that kind of stuff so it can be the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.230 
and that kind of stuff so it can be the
difference<00:03:58.990> between<00:03:59.230> a<00:03:59.770> you<00:04:00.520> know<00:04:00.610> maybe<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:01.000> 2

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
difference between a you know maybe a 2

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.850 
difference between a you know maybe a 2
to<00:04:01.360> the<00:04:01.390> third<00:04:01.720> not<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:02.110> me<00:04:02.350> like<00:04:02.530> a<00:04:02.590> three<00:04:02.770> to

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
to the third not to me like a three to

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.220 
to the third not to me like a three to
four<00:04:03.040> shot<00:04:03.310> he'll<00:04:03.640> if<00:04:04.390> you<00:04:04.510> get<00:04:04.630> nerfed<00:04:04.900> on<00:04:05.140> the

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
four shot he'll if you get nerfed on the

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.440 
four shot he'll if you get nerfed on the
range<00:04:05.500> stuff<00:04:05.860> like<00:04:06.010> but<00:04:06.880> anyways<00:04:07.090> bow

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
range stuff like but anyways bow

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.330 
range stuff like but anyways bow
approximate<00:04:08.170> for<00:04:08.440> just<00:04:08.740> the<00:04:08.890> damage<00:04:09.220> was

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
approximate for just the damage was

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.650 
approximate for just the damage was
reduced<00:04:09.610> so<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:09.850> bowl<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.120> themselves<00:04:10.480> have<00:04:10.630> a

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
reduced so the bowl of themselves have a

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.760 
reduced so the bowl of themselves have a
potential<00:04:11.320> damage<00:04:11.680> that's<00:04:11.860> third<00:04:12.640> time<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:14.590> is

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
potential damage that's third time it is

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.490 
potential damage that's third time it is
loan<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.850> max<00:04:16.090> damage<00:04:16.360> range<00:04:16.720> was<00:04:16.930> decreased

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
loan the max damage range was decreased

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.920 
loan the max damage range was decreased
and<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.769> recoil<00:04:18.340> was<00:04:18.640> adjusted<00:04:19.180> now<00:04:19.570> the

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
and the recoil was adjusted now the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.900 
and the recoil was adjusted now the
range<00:04:20.230> decrease<00:04:20.890> what<00:04:21.190> that<00:04:21.310> means<00:04:21.519> to<00:04:21.670> me<00:04:21.700> the

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
range decrease what that means to me the

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.470 
range decrease what that means to me the
max<00:04:22.150> damage<00:04:22.420> range<00:04:22.780> decrease<00:04:23.350> means<00:04:24.040> that<00:04:24.480> you

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
max damage range decrease means that you

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.780 
max damage range decrease means that you
that<00:04:26.170> last<00:04:26.500> bit<00:04:26.860> like<00:04:27.040> the<00:04:27.160> weakest<00:04:27.580> your

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
that last bit like the weakest your

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.650 
that last bit like the weakest your
bullet<00:04:28.150> can<00:04:28.330> ever<00:04:28.600> become<00:04:29.760> that<00:04:30.760> actual<00:04:31.360> range

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
bullet can ever become that actual range

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.770 
bullet can ever become that actual range
has<00:04:32.020> been<00:04:32.050> reduced<00:04:32.890> now<00:04:33.790> what<00:04:34.240> that<00:04:34.450> should

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
has been reduced now what that should

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.120 
has been reduced now what that should
mean<00:04:35.050> is<00:04:35.380> that<00:04:35.410> overall<00:04:36.120> you're<00:04:37.120> probably

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
mean is that overall you're probably

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.970 
mean is that overall you're probably
looking<00:04:39.130> at<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:40.530> pretty<00:04:42.420> decent<00:04:43.420> ish<00:04:43.980> nerf

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
looking at a pretty decent ish nerf

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.080 
looking at a pretty decent ish nerf
because<00:04:45.250> you're<00:04:45.370> just<00:04:45.430> going<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.670> be<00:04:45.790> sitting

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
because you're just going to be sitting

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.600 
because you're just going to be sitting
there<00:04:46.150> going<00:04:46.270> like<00:04:46.480> all<00:04:47.110> right<00:04:47.500> well<00:04:47.740> if<00:04:48.040> my

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
there going like all right well if my

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.730 
there going like all right well if my
max<00:04:48.850> damage<00:04:49.120> range<00:04:49.540> is<00:04:49.720> decrease<00:04:50.230> that<00:04:50.260> means

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
max damage range is decrease that means

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.710 
max damage range is decrease that means
I<00:04:50.860> should<00:04:50.890> theoretically<00:04:51.310> see<00:04:52.150> that<00:04:52.330> bullet

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
I should theoretically see that bullet

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.180 
I should theoretically see that bullet
drop<00:04:52.930> off<00:04:53.110> happened<00:04:53.500> faster<00:04:53.800> that's<00:04:53.920> what<00:04:54.100> I'm

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
drop off happened faster that's what I'm

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.620 
drop off happened faster that's what I'm
reading<00:04:54.370> it<00:04:54.550> as<00:04:54.700> I<00:04:54.940> could<00:04:55.330> be<00:04:55.450> wrong<00:04:55.570> about

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
reading it as I could be wrong about

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.470 
reading it as I could be wrong about
that's<00:04:56.110> what<00:04:56.200> I<00:04:56.230> think<00:04:56.410> it<00:04:56.500> is<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:57.100> hbr<00:04:57.670> a<00:04:57.820> 3<00:04:58.300> an

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
that's what I think it is the hbr a 3 an

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.390 
that's what I think it is the hbr a 3 an
assault<00:04:58.750> rifle<00:04:58.780> as<00:04:59.230> far<00:04:59.500> as<00:04:59.620> i<00:04:59.710> remember<00:04:59.920> is

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
assault rifle as far as i remember is

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.730 
assault rifle as far as i remember is
going<00:05:01.120> to<00:05:01.330> also<00:05:01.480> have<00:05:01.750> a<00:05:01.810> max<00:05:02.140> damage<00:05:02.380> range

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
going to also have a max damage range

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.679 
going to also have a max damage range
decrease

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:04.689 
decrease

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.329 
decrease
didn't<00:05:05.019> really<00:05:05.229> like<00:05:05.739> it<00:05:05.769> very<00:05:05.979> much<00:05:06.099> in

00:05:06.329 --> 00:05:06.339 
didn't really like it very much in

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:11.009 
didn't really like it very much in
