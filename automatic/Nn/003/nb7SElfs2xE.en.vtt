her and I had my weekly pocket money

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.570 
her and I had my weekly pocket money
modest<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:22.020> sort<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.200> drawn<00:01:22.500> to

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
modest as it was I was sort of drawn to

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.980 
modest as it was I was sort of drawn to
these<00:01:23.580> objects<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.240> seemed<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.630> tell

these objects that seemed to tell

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.230 
these objects that seemed to tell
stories<00:01:25.710> about<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.070> past<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.670> some<00:01:26.939> kind<00:01:27.150> of

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
stories about the past and some kind of

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.249 
stories about the past and some kind of
exciting<00:01:28.080> way<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.860> think<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.689> hunt<00:01:31.020> is

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
exciting way I think that the hunt is

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.679 
exciting way I think that the hunt is
really<00:01:32.009> really<00:01:32.369> exciting<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.240> finding

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
really really exciting it's finding

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.490 
really really exciting it's finding
something<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:35.060> maybe<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.299> merchant<00:01:36.840> has

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
something that maybe the merchant has

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.440 
something that maybe the merchant has
not<00:01:37.740> recognized<00:01:38.369> what<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.820> they<00:01:39.210> haven't

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
not recognized what it is they haven't

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.780 
not recognized what it is they haven't
seen<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.320> label<00:01:40.680> maybe<00:01:40.890> there<00:01:41.100> isn't<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.400> label

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
seen the label maybe there isn't a label

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.270 
seen the label maybe there isn't a label
honestly<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:43.009> sometimes<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> most

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
honestly it's it's sometimes the most

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.030 
honestly it's it's sometimes the most
surprising<00:01:44.670> places<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.810> things<00:01:46.140> crop<00:01:46.350> up<00:01:46.560> you
