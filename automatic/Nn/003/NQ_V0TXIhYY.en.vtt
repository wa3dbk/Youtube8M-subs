00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.770
 could seem important because of one 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.810
 because they invested so much suffering in it 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.680
 because they were quasi initiated, if you will 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.809
 because she was brought the runners 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.169
 For example, I did not understand for a long time 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:19.919
 why the more approved or learning his languages ​​learn vocabulary here 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:20.919
 prohibits 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.409
 from a Jahia of people who make no attempt 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:25.439
 is clear 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.650
 I realize now 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.810
 the more they suffered, both got cards 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.540
 The more energy was invested at that time, knows how to do it 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.780
 the more valuable they had to appear in hindsight otherwise it would be 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.220
 Phoenix unfortunately I had not brought a result but then they say yes 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.100
 in Coburg a language talent 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.520
 they have an explanation for that 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.470
 a completely wrong one 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.860
 and these were the ones who refused to come to where they were 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.000
 somehow through murmurs, the first ones to know that they say God is 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.530
 thanks 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.630
 one to be buried with or without 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.909
 and that's what 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.640
 Parents then do to the children 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.870
 World Cup has been experience Okada seems long then comes the next one 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.190
 Generation Angeles had to do it because you do not have to look through it 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.520
 on Sanders ginge pasture have been initiated 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.440
 Red factor 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.370
 Everybody looks at the Orbis situations where they are stubborn because they initiate 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.800
 Last but not least, where you can be incredibly cool is because of that 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.780
 Having decided to come back to the beginning they remember at the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.470
 you had to write kinetic with 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.300
 and now you have the following 8 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.890
 Students should get optical illusions so should the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.530
 To estimate the length of lines now we come to the famous three groups 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.160
 one the one group should write down what oneself 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.100
 should sign and submit 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.100
 that means this group had to make it public 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.030
 Finally what they thought 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.500
 the second group remember them 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.700
 there he has less earlier has a kind of wax layer then is a plastic 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.390
 about it 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.020
 then press with the founder of the plastic then they see that 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.259
 Schwarzenberg educate them one is way 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.189
 one has thought of this billions 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:11.950
 then they have written down to the ZAK and discussed it here 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:13.109
 then that was gone again 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.259
 that is to say they have written only they have seen it no one else 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.229
 Pauli not quite 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:22.289
 the third group had only thought 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.299
 when the results just move in the head 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.799
 and then resolved to the declared year optical illusion of the citizens 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:29.869
 had moved 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:32.320
 and how now when the results 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.319
 on the 8th 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.669
 dramatic 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:37.569
 each group which 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.259
 had submitted to this elevation 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.989
 were 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.650
 she does not claim to have the insight of the cities with the experimenter 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.210
 on 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.149
 gone into it after always wanting to prove it 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.799
 because they had known each other publicly 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.669
 to their result 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.989
 that was binding for her 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.590
 Thinking about it as we are just lecturing, then write it down 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.199
 write to write with 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.579
 there is the quake to Haiti her 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:04.900
 if there is no other way 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.820
 Little you believe you once wrote even if you have him 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.549
 then or Doris wrote under duress 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.599
 the group that had wiped out the Swedes and 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.599
 was reasonably track but was then convincing 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.699
 and this group has since the 1 how fascinating question to that very different 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.699
 seen as the exciting 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:30.469
 for six years flexibility to do that again with the 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:31.459
 invested 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.779
 Amy wrote 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.459
 and even in public 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.459
 and now they see how flawed a culture is 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.629
 in a spring friendly culture 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.859
 who would not be so dramatic if they had said publicly I hold the 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.009
 a-line much longer 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.219
 with a flawless wipe culture it is rather then has 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.790
 if they expect more to realize that mechanisms expire and that we do 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.759
 just for fear someone could catch on many 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.049
 and they are going towards smart with the management at least every day 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.329
 once make a mistake aware and tell as many people as possible 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.329
 is one of my strategies 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.549
 then she sang 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.549
 that is the mistake in the world 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.370
 Adam Brown Denise to be more afraid of it 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.710
 because the main problem is a mistake is the fear the other markets have one 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.120
 made 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.120
 while closing says thats my second mistake today 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.110
 they were made in the last fourteen times 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.360
 also sit home and tell stories about mistakes 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.389
 with the people you are dealing with more often 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.349
 You can calculate such anxiety 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.840
 So if you put together once a month 15 minutes coffee break 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.370
 and say what saints built last months shit and tell this gate 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.289
 then you will not be afraid of these people the whole month if you 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:57.349
 makes a mistake 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.370
 both talk about it from time to time 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.850
 so they see plenty of heat options against some of the very ones 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.310
 deep 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.229
 17 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:05.900
 Specifying effects says 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.660
 That was then I was not going to say more than we wanted to do as always two 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.160
 Minutes break then enter discussion 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
 Thank you very much 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.819
 but a thicker front 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.770
 where it once burned 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.729
 So there is lonely Neuses 2 Tel 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.729
 the plaintiff was 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.669
 for that the two minutes hit 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.169
 if 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.289
 there is already a message 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:58.639
 they all know all at once 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.639
 Here comes the first microphone in the process 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.740
 yes I have life again 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.490
 Question about these initiation rites 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.870
 I have Kröll so that you read somewhere but photovoltaic or in 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.490
 Prussia 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.849
 To deploy the troupe must be more scared of the yard officer or sergeant 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:20.229
 have everything from the enemy 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.370
 and the ski groups were percent successful in the war 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.199
 Percent the other groups 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.100
 and there my joy to the student I already very important 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:34.249
 So as weed to bit over it discusses hiring tests more difficult 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:37.539
 Attitude Test Woman on Track to Kick IOC confessed 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:40.830
 then he bounced the more heat there was going to carry the company 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.050
 then they are two different things now 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.089
 so living together is not allowed 

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:50.240
 when the troupe is more afraid of its own than the club 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.969
 we have not indexed them 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:54.349
 that's the joke 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:58.949
 because the defense is mandatory we have to move in for a while 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:00.439
 can have 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:04.639
 and then new ones come in we do not have the possibilities six weeks 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.689
 I set and operate suites 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:08.690
 as always, for example 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.789
 here are indexed 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:14.990
 a Meriva is a professional soldier who is in the toughest group 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.550
 it works 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.349
 and how he needs a diet special forces 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:23.259
 This is a very difficult phase we need to do better than Murray puts it in front 

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:25.409
 because it's amazing how the beginning stays 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:27.569
 Achim right or something like that 

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:30.830
 but they do not need a boss to worry about 

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:35.869
 the other is a difficult intervention done because companies or elsewhere 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:41.529
 after guest performances have already taken a group feeling we are 

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:43.009
 which ones 

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:45.919
 and there they were quite different from beginners 

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:50.099
 Group together if they do not know each other long because they emphasize this 

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:50.979
 travels passage
