presentation okay what we did was a

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.660 
presentation okay what we did was a
slice<00:00:40.989> coming<00:00:41.260> technique<00:00:41.710> to<00:00:42.250> make<00:00:42.460> more

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
slice coming technique to make more

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.569 
slice coming technique to make more
volume<00:00:43.149> in<00:00:43.270> the<00:00:43.300> curls<00:00:43.660> now<00:00:44.230> let<00:00:44.920> lose<00:00:45.250> a<00:00:45.280> lot

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
volume in the curls now let lose a lot

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.280 
volume in the curls now let lose a lot
of<00:00:45.610> weight<00:00:45.910> because<00:00:46.360> it's<00:00:46.390> really<00:00:46.540> thick<00:00:47.079> and

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
of weight because it's really thick and

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.620 
of weight because it's really thick and
massive<00:00:47.740> and<00:00:48.280> we<00:00:48.340> want<00:00:48.550> to<00:00:48.670> create<00:00:48.850> more<00:00:49.300> body

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.920 

hey<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.160> see<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> beautiful<00:01:05.700> effect<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.660> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
hey we see the beautiful effect of the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.130 
hey we see the beautiful effect of the
two<00:01:07.590> contrasting<00:01:08.100> colors<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.360> BP<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
two contrasting colors the BP and a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.040 
two contrasting colors the BP and a
little<00:01:10.650> bit<00:01:10.800> RV<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.360> six<00:01:12.600> double-a

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
little bit RV in it and the six double-a

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.590 
little bit RV in it and the six double-a
but<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.770> did<00:01:13.950> we<00:01:14.220> created<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.970> really<00:01:15.390> beautiful

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
but we did we created a really beautiful

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.020 
but we did we created a really beautiful
classic<00:01:16.380> graduation<00:01:16.980> at<00:01:17.100> sites<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> nape

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
classic graduation at sites in the nape

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 
classic graduation at sites in the nape
a<00:01:18.420> little<00:01:19.230> bit<00:01:19.350> asymmetric<00:01:20.100> feeling<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
a little bit asymmetric feeling in the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.820 
a little bit asymmetric feeling in the
back<00:01:20.850> side<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.420> at<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.050> sides<00:01:22.350> here

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
back side and at the sides here

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.560 
back side and at the sides here
underneath<00:01:23.340> there<00:01:23.760> is<00:01:23.820> an<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.540> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
underneath there is an like a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.900 
underneath there is an like a
disconnection<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.530> totally<00:01:25.979> over<00:01:26.400> layer<00:01:26.580> and

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
disconnection a totally over layer and

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.360 
disconnection a totally over layer and
this<00:01:27.570> gives<00:01:27.780> us<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> mobility<00:01:28.620> to<00:01:29.100> create

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
this gives us the mobility to create

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.880 
this gives us the mobility to create
more<00:01:29.610> volume<00:01:29.880> but<00:01:30.300> also<00:01:30.510> we<00:01:31.260> can<00:01:31.290> style<00:01:31.710> there

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
more volume but also we can style there

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.490 
more volume but also we can style there
easily<00:01:32.300> different<00:01:33.300> kind<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.570> directions<00:01:34.110> and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
easily different kind of directions and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.350 
easily different kind of directions and
a<00:01:34.710> beautiful<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.340> lot<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.729> different<00:01:36.090> kind<00:01:36.300> of

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
a beautiful a lot of different kind of

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.570 
a beautiful a lot of different kind of
stylings<00:01:36.840> motions<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> front<00:01:38.369> because

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
stylings motions in the front because

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.150 
stylings motions in the front because
it's<00:01:38.940> a<00:01:39.060> contradiction<00:01:39.810> between<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.560> little

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
it's a contradiction between a little

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.130 
it's a contradiction between a little
bit<00:01:41.310> harder<00:01:41.820> going<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.240> line<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.990> together

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
bit harder going to line and together

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.560 
bit harder going to line and together
makes<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.530> softness<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.160> mobility<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:45.360> is

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
makes you softness and mobility this is

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.370 
makes you softness and mobility this is
study<00:01:46.110> through<00:01:46.700> 2011

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
study through 2011

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.830 
study through 2011
what<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.250> see<00:01:50.430> here<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.729> did<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> also<00:01:51.659> from

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
what you can see here we did a also from

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.709 
what you can see here we did a also from
a<00:01:51.869> contradiction<00:01:52.380> version<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.399> did<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.719> sliding

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
a contradiction version we did a sliding

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.870 
a contradiction version we did a sliding
a<00:01:54.780> little<00:01:54.990> bit<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.170> another<00:01:55.409> cup<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.219> get

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
a little bit of another cup like we get

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760 
a little bit of another cup like we get
a<00:01:56.909> lot<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.210> weight<00:01:57.450> here<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.380> make<00:01:58.619> it

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
a lot of weight here and we make it

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.560 
a lot of weight here and we make it
really<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.220> soft<00:01:59.820> line<00:02:00.119> because<00:02:00.420> it's

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
really really soft line because it's

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.319 
really really soft line because it's
really<00:02:00.720> mess<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.320> hair<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.829> what<00:02:01.979> we<00:02:02.100> did<00:02:02.340> cut

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
really mess of hair and what we did cut

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.980 
really mess of hair and what we did cut
it<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.289> and<00:02:04.729> slice<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.210> way<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
it like this and slice it this way to

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.089 
it like this and slice it this way to
create<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.770> little<00:02:08.340> isometric<00:02:08.880> French<00:02:09.660> and

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
create a little isometric French and

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.550 
create a little isometric French and
pull<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.130> away<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.580> here<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.569> can<00:02:12.750> see<00:02:13.050> it

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
pull it away to here and you can see it

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.100 
pull it away to here and you can see it
looks<00:02:13.769> great<00:02:14.220> on<00:02:14.489> her<00:02:14.610> face<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.330> its<00:02:15.750> really

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
looks great on her face and its really

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.520 
looks great on her face and its really
really<00:02:16.410> nice<00:02:17.330> color<00:02:18.330> what<00:02:18.720> we<00:02:18.840> did<00:02:19.019> was<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.230> one

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
really nice color what we did was a one

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.650 
really nice color what we did was a one
end<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.060> cheap<00:02:21.690> ionic
