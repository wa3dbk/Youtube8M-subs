00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
liaise just because this is one of the

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.189 
liaise just because this is one of the
few<00:00:39.190> level<00:00:39.640> with<00:00:39.790> an<00:00:39.970> entire<00:00:40.449> game<00:00:40.870> that

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
few level with an entire game that

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.829 
few level with an entire game that
doesn't<00:00:42.100> really<00:00:42.699> have<00:00:43.089> a<00:00:43.120> straightforward

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
doesn't really have a straightforward

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:49.340 
doesn't really have a straightforward
layout<00:00:44.710> it's<00:00:45.010> very<00:00:45.519> ah<00:00:46.650> it's<00:00:47.650> more<00:00:47.949> like<00:00:48.159> a<00:00:48.190> I

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
layout it's very ah it's more like a I

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.990 
layout it's very ah it's more like a I
guess<00:00:50.350> you<00:00:50.500> can<00:00:50.680> compare<00:00:51.040> it<00:00:51.220> technically<00:00:51.790> to

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
guess you can compare it technically to

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.320 
guess you can compare it technically to
like<00:00:52.659> Mario<00:00:53.080> 64<00:00:53.769> or<00:00:53.920> something<00:00:54.339> is<00:00:54.489> if<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.210> was

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
like Mario 64 or something is if it was

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.789 
like Mario 64 or something is if it was
like<00:00:55.479> it<00:00:55.629> has<00:00:55.780> a<00:00:55.809> very<00:00:56.040> 3d<00:00:57.040> out<00:00:58.110> layout<00:00:59.110> to<00:00:59.409> it<00:00:59.559> I

00:00:59.789 --> 00:00:59.799 
like it has a very 3d out layout to it I

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:02.820 
like it has a very 3d out layout to it I
don't<00:01:00.760> know<00:01:00.879> it's<00:01:01.360> just<00:01:01.629> not<00:01:02.379> one<00:01:02.619> of<00:01:02.650> my

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
don't know it's just not one of my

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.880 
don't know it's just not one of my
favorites<00:01:03.549> and<00:01:04.030> I<00:01:04.510> think<00:01:05.110> it's<00:01:05.320> kind<00:01:05.680> of<00:01:05.799> a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
favorites and I think it's kind of a

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.270 
favorites and I think it's kind of a
disorganized<00:01:06.340> cluttered<00:01:07.210> level<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:09.130> I<00:01:09.250> think

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
disorganized cluttered level and I think

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.820 
disorganized cluttered level and I think
it's<00:01:09.610> a<00:01:09.700> pain<00:01:10.000> to<00:01:10.270> get<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:12.760> hate<00:01:13.090> it<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:14.740> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
pain to get the coins in my opinion

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.169 
pain to get the coins in my opinion
nevertheless<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:21.189> have<00:01:21.219> to<00:01:21.579> do<00:01:21.729> it
