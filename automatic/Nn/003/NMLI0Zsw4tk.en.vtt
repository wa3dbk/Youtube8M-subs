00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
back of the camera and my eyesight is

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.310 
back of the camera and my eyesight is
there's<00:00:06.690> really<00:00:07.080> not<00:00:07.649> up<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.960> looking<00:00:09.960> at<00:00:10.050> six

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
there's really not up to looking at six

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.419 
there's really not up to looking at six
inches<00:00:10.969> and<00:00:11.990> you<00:00:12.990> know<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.650> anything<00:00:14.130> further

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
inches and you know and anything further

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.829 
inches and you know and anything further
and<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.120> can't<00:00:15.330> really<00:00:15.450> see<00:00:15.630> what<00:00:15.750> you're

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
and you can't really see what you're

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.980 
and you can't really see what you're
composing<00:00:16.170> anyway<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.650> start<00:00:16.920> off<00:00:17.070> with<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> set

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
composing anyway to start off with a set

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.730 
composing anyway to start off with a set
and<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:20.210> kind<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.300> get<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> vague<00:00:21.779> composition

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
and so I kind of get a vague composition

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.089 
and so I kind of get a vague composition
of<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.570> but<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.689> quality<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.410> absolutely
