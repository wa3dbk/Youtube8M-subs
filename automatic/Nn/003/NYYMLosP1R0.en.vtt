and building muscle should you take rest
days<00:00:33.690> how<00:00:33.840> many<00:00:33.989> west<00:00:34.200> state<00:00:34.350> should<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.620> take

your muscles need time to rebuild you
don't<00:00:38.790> build<00:00:38.910> any<00:00:39.239> muscle<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> gym<00:00:39.989> you

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
don't build any muscle in the gym you

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.960 
don't build any muscle in the gym you
get<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> pump<00:00:40.890> blood<00:00:41.220> flows<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.610> muscle<00:00:41.910> you

get a pump blood flows to muscle you

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.950 
get a pump blood flows to muscle you
look<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.150> little<00:00:42.239> bit<00:00:42.420> bigger<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:42.720> you're<00:00:42.870> not

the<00:00:44.309> gym<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.670> breaking<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.210> muscle<00:00:45.629> down

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
the gym is breaking the muscle down

signal in the body that you are not

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.900 
signal in the body that you are not
strong<00:00:50.040> enough<00:00:50.160> that's<00:00:50.610> what<00:00:50.760> you're<00:00:50.879> doing

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
strong enough that's what you're doing

strong enough that's what you're doing
the<00:00:51.150> gym<00:00:51.330> you're<00:00:51.540> convincing<00:00:52.050> your<00:00:52.170> body<00:00:52.379> that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the gym you're convincing your body that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.899 
the gym you're convincing your body that
you're<00:00:52.680> not<00:00:52.800> strong<00:00:53.070> enough<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.670> when<00:00:53.850> it

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
you're not strong enough so that when it

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.640 
you're not strong enough so that when it
rebuilds<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.629> muscle<00:00:54.960> over<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.290> next<00:00:55.500> few

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
rebuilds that muscle over the next few

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.200 
rebuilds that muscle over the next few
days<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.250> builds<00:00:56.519> it<00:00:56.670> back<00:00:56.790> a<00:00:56.820> little<00:00:56.940> bit

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
days it builds it back a little bit

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.729 
days it builds it back a little bit
stronger<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.570> little<00:00:57.659> bit<00:00:57.839> larger<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.409> little

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
stronger a little bit larger a little

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.439 
stronger a little bit larger a little
bit<00:00:58.830> better<00:00:58.979> that's<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.670> plan<00:00:59.790> so<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.239> need

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
bit better that's the plan so you need

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.390 
bit better that's the plan so you need
to<00:01:00.570> take<00:01:00.659> rest<00:01:00.900> days<00:01:01.080> between<00:01:01.409> your<00:01:01.920> workouts

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
to take rest days between your workouts

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.020 
to take rest days between your workouts
either<00:01:03.089> that<00:01:03.180> or<00:01:03.589> split<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.159> many<00:01:05.670> body<00:01:05.940> parts

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
either that or split so many body parts

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.210 
either that or split so many body parts
up<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:07.110> you're<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.500> hitting<00:01:07.710> them<00:01:07.890> anyway

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
up that you're not hitting them anyway

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.219 
up that you're not hitting them anyway
for<00:01:08.520> instance<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:08.940> you<00:01:09.060> do<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.450> day<00:01:09.900> where<00:01:10.200> you

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
for instance if you do a day where you

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.990 
for instance if you do a day where you
work<00:01:10.500> only<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.890> triceps<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.670> then<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.970> next

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
work only on triceps and then the next

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.210 
work only on triceps and then the next
day<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.360> work<00:01:12.600> only<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.140> biases<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.920> then<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
day you work only on biases and then the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.100 
day you work only on biases and then the
day<00:01:14.369> after<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.150> work<00:01:15.299> only<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.750> chest

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
day after that you work only on chest

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.719 
day after that you work only on chest
and<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.530> day<00:01:16.740> after<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.190> work<00:01:17.310> only<00:01:17.549> on

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
and the day after that you work only on

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.920 
and the day after that you work only on
shoulders<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.299> day<00:01:18.420> after<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.659> you

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
shoulders in the day after that you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.990 
shoulders in the day after that you
could<00:01:19.170> get<00:01:19.320> away<00:01:19.440> with<00:01:19.760> theoretically<00:01:20.760> not

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
could get away with theoretically not

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.820 
could get away with theoretically not
doing<00:01:21.180> any<00:01:21.299> rest<00:01:21.510> days<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:22.260> the<00:01:22.409> problem<00:01:22.740> with

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
doing any rest days but the problem with

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.130 
doing any rest days but the problem with
that<00:01:23.010> would<00:01:23.250> be<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:23.670> you're<00:01:24.539> training<00:01:24.750> well

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
that would be if you're training well

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.749 
that would be if you're training well
and<00:01:25.500> you're<00:01:25.859> a<00:01:25.920> good<00:01:26.070> regime<00:01:26.399> you're<00:01:26.579> going<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
and you're a good regime you're going to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.219 
and you're a good regime you're going to
be<00:01:26.820> doing<00:01:26.909> compound<00:01:27.390> movements<00:01:27.840> compound

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
be doing compound movements compound

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.660 
be doing compound movements compound
movements<00:01:28.649> are<00:01:28.740> movements<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.340> recruit

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
movements are movements that recruit

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.459 
movements are movements that recruit
multiple<00:01:30.509> muscle<00:01:30.810> groups<00:01:30.840> for<00:01:31.079> instance<00:01:31.380> a

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
multiple muscle groups for instance a

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.529 
multiple muscle groups for instance a
chest<00:01:31.710> press<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.399> do<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> chest<00:01:32.789> press<00:01:32.969> it<00:01:33.359> gets

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
chest press you do a chest press it gets

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:34.910 
chest press you do a chest press it gets
a<00:01:33.570> little<00:01:33.689> bit<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> shoulder<00:01:34.289> gets<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> upper

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
a little bit the shoulder gets the upper

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.190 
a little bit the shoulder gets the upper
chest<00:01:35.340> gets<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.149> chest<00:01:36.390> they're<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:37.049> main

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
chest gets a chest they're the main

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.090 
chest gets a chest they're the main
chest<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.850> also<00:01:38.850> gets<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.719> triceps<00:01:40.200> yeah<00:01:40.560> so

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
chest and also gets the triceps yeah so

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.330 
chest and also gets the triceps yeah so
if<00:01:41.340> you're<00:01:41.549> doing<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.469> good<00:01:43.469> workout<00:01:43.979> regime

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
if you're doing a good workout regime

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.740 
if you're doing a good workout regime
with<00:01:44.520> compound<00:01:44.969> movements<00:01:45.420> you're<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.689> to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
with compound movements you're going to

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.819 
with compound movements you're going to
be<00:01:45.810> hitting<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.049> lot<00:01:46.109> of<00:01:46.170> these<00:01:46.289> muscle<00:01:46.619> groups

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
be hitting a lot of these muscle groups

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.080 
be hitting a lot of these muscle groups
on<00:01:47.009> different<00:01:47.399> days<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.850> really

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
on different days so it's really

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.599 
on different days so it's really
difficult<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.810> split<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.859> body<00:01:50.039> into<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.429> many

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
difficult to split the body into so many
