00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.869
 hi here I am again to talk to you 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.050
 of a garment that is in all 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.930
 cabinets or at least you should see it the 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.150
 blazer the american suit jacket 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.829
 well there are many ways to call it 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.960
 but in the end you know what I'm 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.850
 talking about not this type of jackets 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.370
 when we think of the blazer in the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.339
 classic suit jacket we think of 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.440
 you are on the left and it is true that 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.780
 are the most classic of a button of the 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.600
 buttons and so on different types of 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.539
 flap but this is the right too 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.329
 could be considered blazer jackets 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.829
 they are not exactly but depending on 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.660
 your style may you like more 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.030
 these media and these could 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.320
 consider an intermediate I what I'm going to 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.210
 do in this video is to teach the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.010
 different options each 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.910
 it is important to have a jacket 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.729
 these can serve or if it's from this 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.090
 type to take seriously a 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.340
 whole and if it's this kind to give it 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.100
 seriousness of a set and vice versa 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.130
 any garment can interact with 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.450
 them and change the image 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.450
 same let's see it 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.299
 let's go with our most classic American 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.040
 three ideas is in this case I have eaten 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.610
 with some pants very jeans 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.130
 informal the 100 gain seriousness the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.530
 jacket loses it and then everything is in 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.479
 what add-ons we add with some 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.659
 t-shirts is fine they could also be 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.090
 some shoes is less sport and a 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.640
 bag a bag following the colors 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.789
 today I say the same as a bag breaking the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.750
 colors that depends on your taste 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:59.490
 but this would be the most informal style 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.530
 this would of course be the most formal if 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.670
 we go to pants of the same color as 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.810
 the American but even here we could 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.890
 give a touch not an informal touch with 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.250
 some boots of this type and a bag 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:21.500
 funny or go to all the black that 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.650
 It would be a very classic style very serious 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.380
 and because a skirt is not intermediate or 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.140
 some pants 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.030
 to dress an intermediate but that 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.870
 It would look great with little shoes 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.780
 low within the style of the skirt and a 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.860
 bag that gave a touch of color 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.450
 same jacket different accessories 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.450
 the image changes completely 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.400
 I fix you I propose this jacket is 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:58.219
 secret has a classic form the form 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.560
 it is however the colors the 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.420
 combination that has been made with them a 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.180
 pain could be considered a 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.950
 intermediate and jacket classic shape but 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.569
 combination of colors not here you see 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.120
 depends on what we combine it with 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.969
 image can be much crazier or much 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.250
 less with this black style is more serious 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.590
 some shoes and a bag in white and 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.930
 black can give a picture can 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.299
 take the jacket off madness but 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.530
 fix for example here with these 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:32.120
 palazzo pants sandals a 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.459
 handbag 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.810
 that were more fashion more breakers 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:41.959
 well this jacket wins in that aspect and 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.030
 here good can be a style if 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.209
 You want a little more casual for that 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.159
 some red jeans that contrast with the 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.799
 jacket here what will depend on what 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.180
 color be the jacket but good in this 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.890
 case we are talking about a jacket 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.799
 white and black because I like white and 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.900
 black shoes the same color as 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.470
 pants to lengthen the figure and a 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.200
 bag with a touch that follows the line of 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.790
 the jacket is an intermediate jacket 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.349
 remember you but a different bit and 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.269
 now let's go with the third example 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.030
 which may be the jacket that most 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.370
 moves away as to form of what is a 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.780
 classic blazer but that we can take out 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.780
 also much match 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:30.490
 fix this is the last idea that you 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.280
 we are talking about a jacket does not let 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.990
 to be a jacket but you see 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.440
 we're even talking about buttons a 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.000
 asymmetric zipper in short a tad 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.100
 different but maybe our style 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.750
 lace with this jacket so I 'm going 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.320
 to give ideas it is also true that this 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.410
 jacket allows us maybe good some 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.550
 try a little different fijaros 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.740
 here 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.930
 these are very special but with 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.539
 this jacket is going very well 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.120
 Now that we have to accompany them or 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:05.229
 well with some shoes also different 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.690
 a bit extreme or we can lower the 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.460
 image with some high boots always a 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.949
 handbag 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.810
 vertically because we have to lengthen 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.389
 our image we have put a 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.950
 pants a little short better lengthen 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.740
 our image 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:24.010
 this air a little more romantic with 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.630
 a little retro skirt of prints 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.680
 that this season are going to take a lot 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.979
 and here I give you two options 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.530
 fix this type of sneakers that could 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.600
 be an idea with a bag inside the 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.430
 line of the colors of the skirt 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.430
 but good 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.860
 fun and we put on and give them has 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:48.160
 a little more lady with sandals from 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.850
 heel and a bag a little softer 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.460
 and finally this other idea a bag that 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.190
 break 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.750
 in color but fails to follow 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.020
 the blue line of the jacket 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.020
 but we are going to a wide pants and 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.849
 a few high -heeled lounge shoes 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.610
 the possibilities that a jacket has 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.380
 of a suit a blazer everything will depend on 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.819
 which one you choose which one is 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.430
 the one that best suits our style 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:16.949
 but surely for sure there is one that 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.370
 fits with you and the one you're going to 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:24.740
 to be able to get a lot of safe match 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.740
 come cheer until the next
