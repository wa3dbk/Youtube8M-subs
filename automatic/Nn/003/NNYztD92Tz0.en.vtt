00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
and I wanted to have one of those

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.540 
and I wanted to have one of those
because<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.930> was<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> bit<00:00:46.320> big<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:47.070> big<00:00:47.220> heavy

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
interesting about this little slider

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.289 
interesting about this little slider
next<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> very<00:01:11.580> low<00:01:11.760> price<00:01:11.970> plan<00:01:12.180> of

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
next to the very low price plan of

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.980 
next to the very low price plan of
course<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:13.650> rail<00:01:14.520> which<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.390> made

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
course so we have the rail which is made

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.590 
course so we have the rail which is made
of<00:01:16.109> aluminum<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.770> looks<00:01:17.070> good<00:01:17.369> at<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.729> up

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
of aluminum that looks good at this up

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.990 
of aluminum that looks good at this up
to<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:18.960> bandits<00:01:19.350> pretty<00:01:19.799> nice<00:01:20.070> quality<00:01:20.549> pretty

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
to be bandits pretty nice quality pretty

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.410 
to be bandits pretty nice quality pretty
think<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.229> very<00:01:22.710> light<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.219> my<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:24.000> carry

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
think it's very light in my I can carry

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.099 
think it's very light in my I can carry
it<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.750> maybe<00:01:25.320> two<00:01:25.590> fingers<00:01:25.979> maybe<00:01:26.990> maybe<00:01:27.990> I

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
it with maybe two fingers maybe maybe I

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:32.419 
it with maybe two fingers maybe maybe I
can<00:01:28.380> use<00:01:28.590> my<00:01:28.649> small<00:01:29.310> my<00:01:29.759> pinky<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.469> really

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
can use my small my pinky so it's really

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.630 
can use my small my pinky so it's really
light<00:01:32.670> slider<00:01:32.939> very<00:01:33.390> nice<00:01:33.600> um<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
light slider very nice um you have the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.990 
light slider very nice um you have the
slab<00:01:35.850> hear<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.289> slap<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.649> bearing<00:01:38.399> based<00:01:38.640> so

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
slab hear the slap is bearing based so

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.599 
slab hear the slap is bearing based so
you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.329> also<00:01:39.539> adjust<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.200> friction<00:01:40.770> through

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
you can also adjust the friction through

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.289 
you can also adjust the friction through
these<00:01:41.820> allen<00:01:42.509> screws<00:01:42.810> pretty<00:01:43.229> nice<00:01:44.299> slice

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
these allen screws pretty nice slice

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.060 
these allen screws pretty nice slice
pretty<00:01:45.960> good<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> slider<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.770> course<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
pretty good on the slider of course and

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.590 
pretty good on the slider of course and
make<00:01:47.189> some<00:01:47.399> nice<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.909> don't<00:01:47.999> think<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.539> is

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
make some nice but I don't think this is

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.770 
make some nice but I don't think this is
a<00:01:48.689> big<00:01:48.899> problem<00:01:49.109> actually<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:50.479> with<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.630> red

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
a big problem actually so with the red

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.779 
a big problem actually so with the red
screw<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.409> secure<00:01:52.859> the<00:01:53.159> slats<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.670> it

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
screw you can secure the slats so it

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.760 
screw you can secure the slats so it
won't<00:01:54.030> move<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> slab<00:01:54.719> on<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.560> slider

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
won't move on the slab on the slider

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.969 
won't move on the slab on the slider
it's<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.429> nice<00:01:57.390> feature<00:01:57.630> what<00:01:58.319> you<00:01:58.499> don't<00:01:58.710> get

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it's a nice feature what you don't get

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.149 
it's a nice feature what you don't get
is<00:01:59.039> Emma<00:01:59.729> head<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.020> use<00:02:01.319> a<00:02:01.350> ball<00:02:01.590> at<00:02:01.740> my<00:02:01.890> OB

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
sliding rail pretty nice so we don't

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.500 
sliding rail pretty nice so we don't
need<00:03:54.430> any<00:03:54.820> extra<00:03:55.709> accessories<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:57.510> be

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
need any extra accessories to be

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.780 
need any extra accessories to be
constructed<00:03:59.109> we<00:03:59.290> can<00:03:59.470> also<00:03:59.680> do<00:04:00.070> everything

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
constructed we can also do everything

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.849 
constructed we can also do everything
with<00:04:01.000> what<00:04:01.540> chicks<00:04:01.870> with<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.319> slider<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.769> we

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
with what chicks with the slider and we

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.979 
with what chicks with the slider and we
also<00:04:03.040> get<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.400> nice<00:04:03.640> back<00:04:03.910> with<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.780> name

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
also get a nice back with the name

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.229 
also get a nice back with the name
stitched<00:04:05.380> in<00:04:05.650> there<00:04:05.890> with<00:04:06.609> a<00:04:06.640> shoulder<00:04:06.880> strap

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
stitched in there with a shoulder strap

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.479 
stitched in there with a shoulder strap
this<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:07.930> really<00:04:08.170> nice<00:04:08.350> for<00:04:08.530> traveling<00:04:08.950> so<00:04:09.370> the

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
this is really nice for traveling so the

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.770 
this is really nice for traveling so the
length<00:04:09.670> of<00:04:09.790> my<00:04:09.850> slider<00:04:10.239> here<00:04:10.510> is<00:04:10.600> 80

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
length of my slider here is 80

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.630 
length of my slider here is 80
centimeters<00:04:11.319> for<00:04:11.859> me<00:04:11.980> this<00:04:12.100> is<00:04:12.160> perfect

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
centimeters for me this is perfect

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.150 
centimeters for me this is perfect
because<00:04:12.730> it's<00:04:13.030> a<00:04:13.090> good<00:04:13.239> compromise<00:04:13.600> between

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
because it's a good compromise between

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.759 
because it's a good compromise between
how<00:04:15.160> much<00:04:15.819> you<00:04:16.600> can<00:04:16.750> travel<00:04:16.959> with<00:04:17.079> the<00:04:17.350> camera

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
how much you can travel with the camera

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.099 
how much you can travel with the camera
but<00:04:18.010> also<00:04:18.190> how<00:04:18.700> light<00:04:18.940> you<00:04:19.090> can<00:04:19.209> travel<00:04:19.479> when

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
but also how light you can travel when

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.050 
but also how light you can travel when
you<00:04:20.350> get<00:04:20.560> with<00:04:20.859> this<00:04:21.010> on<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.280> bus<00:04:21.430> or<00:04:21.760> on<00:04:21.789> the

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
you get with this on the bus or on the

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.080 
you get with this on the bus or on the
train<00:04:22.180> and<00:04:22.510> with<00:04:23.470> this<00:04:23.650> 80<00:04:24.400> centimeter<00:04:24.789> slider

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
train and with this 80 centimeter slider

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.510 
train and with this 80 centimeter slider
I<00:04:25.539> think<00:04:25.990> this<00:04:26.080> is<00:04:26.140> a<00:04:26.260> perfect<00:04:26.470> value<00:04:26.979> to<00:04:27.340> get

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
I think this is a perfect value to get

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.820 
I think this is a perfect value to get
good<00:04:27.940> shots<00:04:28.180> but<00:04:28.479> also<00:04:28.659> travel<00:04:29.289> light<00:04:29.440> so<00:04:29.710> when

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
good shots but also travel light so when

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.990 
good shots but also travel light so when
I

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
I

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.360 
I
like<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.240> camera<00:04:30.570> from<00:04:30.720> left<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:30.930> right<00:04:31.020> here

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
like the camera from left to right here

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.980 
like the camera from left to right here
you<00:04:32.370> may<00:04:32.520> notice<00:04:32.910> that<00:04:33.180> there's<00:04:33.540> a<00:04:33.630> slight

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
you may notice that there's a slight

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.840 
you may notice that there's a slight
wobble<00:04:34.260> when<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.770> weight<00:04:34.920> changes<00:04:35.430> decide

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
wobble when the weight changes decide

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.640 
wobble when the weight changes decide
however<00:04:36.690> this<00:04:36.960> is<00:04:37.110> not<00:04:37.200> because<00:04:37.470> of<00:04:37.500> the

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
however this is not because of the

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.050 
however this is not because of the
slider<00:04:37.860> this<00:04:38.160> is<00:04:38.310> because<00:04:38.610> of<00:04:38.730> my<00:04:38.850> really

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
slider this is because of my really

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.870 
slider this is because of my really
shitty<00:04:39.480> tripod<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.410> know<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:41.160> how<00:04:41.370> tripod

when<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:55.920> notice<00:04:56.100> this<00:04:56.520> during<00:04:57.030> this<00:04:57.180> review

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
when you notice this during this review

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.690 
when you notice this during this review
and<00:04:57.930> it's<00:04:58.650> not<00:04:58.830> because<00:04:58.890> of<00:04:59.100> this<00:04:59.250> letter<00:04:59.430> it's

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
and it's not because of this letter it's

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.610 
and it's not because of this letter it's
only<00:05:00.060> because<00:05:00.180> of<00:05:00.360> my<00:05:00.480> tripod<00:05:00.660> and<00:05:01.110> now<00:05:01.410> we're

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
only because of my tripod and now we're

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.830 
only because of my tripod and now we're
you<00:05:01.740> know<00:05:01.890> that<00:05:02.130> let's<00:05:02.820> watch<00:05:03.060> some<00:05:03.450> assemble

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
you know that let's watch some assemble

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.390 
you know that let's watch some assemble
footage<00:05:04.110> i<00:05:04.260> shot<00:05:04.290> with<00:05:04.680> my<00:05:04.800> Blackmagic<00:05:05.280> Cinema

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
footage i shot with my Blackmagic Cinema

00:05:05.400 --> 00:06:04.959 
footage i shot with my Blackmagic Cinema
Camera

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:04.969 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:06.850 

you

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
you

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.730 
you
you

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.080 

so<00:06:13.740> I<00:06:13.770> think<00:06:13.919> the<00:06:14.250> results<00:06:14.550> are<00:06:14.610> pretty<00:06:14.759> sweet

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
so I think the results are pretty sweet

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.640 
so I think the results are pretty sweet
and<00:06:15.240> always<00:06:15.330> keep<00:06:15.690> in<00:06:15.840> mind<00:06:16.020> that<00:06:16.110> i'm<00:06:16.350> not<00:06:16.410> a

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
and always keep in mind that i'm not a

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.370 
and always keep in mind that i'm not a
DP<00:06:17.160> I'm<00:06:17.610> more<00:06:17.940> of<00:06:18.090> a<00:06:18.180> post-production<00:06:18.569> guys<00:06:19.110> so

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
DP I'm more of a post-production guys so

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.230 
DP I'm more of a post-production guys so
your<00:06:19.620> results<00:06:20.099> may<00:06:20.130> vary<00:06:20.250> and<00:06:20.669> may<00:06:20.880> be<00:06:20.940> much

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
your results may vary and may be much

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.330 
your results may vary and may be much
better<00:06:21.479> than<00:06:21.870> mine<00:06:22.139> of<00:06:22.349> course<00:06:22.380> however<00:06:23.099> you

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
better than mine of course however you

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.710 
better than mine of course however you
may<00:06:23.520> have<00:06:23.639> noticed<00:06:24.000> this<00:06:24.060> little<00:06:24.120> wobbling

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
may have noticed this little wobbling

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.510 
may have noticed this little wobbling
during<00:06:25.199> the<00:06:25.289> shots<00:06:25.530> so<00:06:26.039> this<00:06:26.220> is<00:06:26.340> really

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
during the shots so this is really

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.100 
during the shots so this is really
entirely<00:06:26.849> because<00:06:27.120> of<00:06:27.360> my<00:06:27.449> tripod<00:06:27.690> and<00:06:27.990> not

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
entirely because of my tripod and not

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.960 
entirely because of my tripod and not
because<00:06:28.800> of<00:06:28.830> the<00:06:29.009> slider<00:06:29.220> because<00:06:29.400> of<00:06:29.580> psycho

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
because of the slider because of psycho
