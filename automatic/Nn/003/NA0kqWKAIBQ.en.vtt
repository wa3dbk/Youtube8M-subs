00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.680
 great advice to everyone with a bodybuilder not 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.660
 buy Chinese alarms which 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.030
 Of course, connecting is not very easy 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.690
 leaving just one chip in 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.120
 wiring 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.150
 take car alarms and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.619
 cut their wiring in order to exclude 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.650
 quickly on and off, and the hijacking of the scooter they 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:29.400
 as it usually happens well 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.440
 all models have open bottom 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.630
 space where you can put your hand and 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.050
 get to the bottom 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:46.530
 wiring thief 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:49.760
 can put a hand off the lock 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.760
 ignition and let the scooter already 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.760
 start up 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:05.230
 turn off us off china didn't pull out 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.230
 and the scooter is now sweet start up 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.920
 chase him 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.470
 also 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:27.820
 hijack a scooter just 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:31.030
 pulled the chip alarm turned off 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:36.640
 alarm unit all scooter also 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:40.830
 start without key no key 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.830
 live is weak 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.710
 I break the helmsman 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.470
 column for 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.860
 but 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.860
 j 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:07.100
 so great advice if you take a trip 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:11.730
 such an alarm then be sure and 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.360
 staple the chips either with ties or the best 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.060
 case, shake everything completely with electrical tape 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:24.290
 in order to exclude 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.290
 easy shutdown don't hijack your scooter 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.560
 on the other hand it certainly makes it easier and 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.930
 the very problem behind scooter vodka 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.110
 If you lose the key, pull out any 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:42.390
 chips and break the lock if you do not mind 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:47.160
 go home but it also helps the monitor lizard 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:50.180
 drive a scooter to the Chinese here is something 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.180
 and did not provide 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.460
 and 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.720
 and 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:28.220
 and also on some models the switch 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:32.360
 worth available in here on the frame shoved 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:37.900

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.900
 field to stuck his hand here to him 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.560
 This is a black-white wire so-called gu 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:57.000
 link until he stuck a scooter 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:04:01.019
 start it worth pulling out a bite 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.709
 cut and key for winding scooters 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.709
