00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
the stage because there's no point in

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.149 
the stage because there's no point in
going<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.019> better<00:02:48.139> option<00:02:48.349> on<00:02:48.650> stage<00:02:48.919> if<00:02:49.069> you

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
going the better option on stage if you

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.289 
going the better option on stage if you
never<00:02:49.310> make<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.669> stage<00:02:49.849> in<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.030> first<00:02:50.180> place

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
never make the stage in the first place

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.210 
never make the stage in the first place
yeah<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:50.989> you<00:02:51.169> saw<00:02:51.319> it<00:02:51.349> do<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.709> do<00:02:51.829> that<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.010> lot

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
yeah and you saw it do you do that a lot

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.740 
yeah and you saw it do you do that a lot
of<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:52.430> like<00:02:52.609> every<00:02:52.819> time<00:02:52.939> that<00:02:53.120> he<00:02:53.239> had<00:02:53.419> angel

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
of you like every time that he had angel

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.119 
of you like every time that he had angel
in<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.870> air<00:02:54.049> he<00:02:54.349> would<00:02:54.470> go<00:02:54.590> for<00:02:54.739> that<00:02:54.769> up<00:02:54.950> be

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
in the air he would go for that up be

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.009 
in the air he would go for that up be
and<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.609> think<00:02:55.639> it<00:02:55.939> was<00:02:56.060> kind<00:02:56.269> of<00:02:56.359> surprising<00:02:56.780> at

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
and I think it was kind of surprising at

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.059 
and I think it was kind of surprising at
first<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.379> it's<00:02:57.469> like<00:02:57.590> okay<00:02:57.829> this<00:02:58.010> is

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
first and it's like okay this is

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.099 
first and it's like okay this is
actually<00:02:58.489> pretty<00:02:58.669> good<00:02:58.909> and<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.480> could<00:02:59.959> be<00:02:59.989> a

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
actually pretty good and it could be a

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.750 
actually pretty good and it could be a
kill<00:03:00.319> option<00:03:00.650> but<00:03:00.799> once<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.129> get<00:03:01.250> used<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.609> it
