rule<00:01:50.159> change<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.990> cards<00:01:51.990> were<00:01:52.079> so

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
rule change this really is cards were so

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.170 
rule change this really is cards were so
broken<00:01:52.770> before<00:01:52.920> because<00:01:53.549> they<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:53.909> had<00:01:54.090> this

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
broken before because they just had this

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.350 
broken before because they just had this
priority<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:55.200> dark<00:01:55.439> armed<00:01:55.890> was<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.759> mean<00:01:57.149> he

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
priority like dark armed was I mean he

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.859 
priority like dark armed was I mean he
came<00:01:57.600> down<00:01:57.840> he<00:01:58.049> hit<00:01:58.229> board<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:59.210> he<00:02:00.210> popped<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
came down he hit board and he popped a

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.830 
came down he hit board and he popped a
card<00:02:01.110> if<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> popped<00:02:01.979> your<00:02:02.100> monster<00:02:02.579> then<00:02:02.840> he

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
card if you popped your monster then he

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.410 
card if you popped your monster then he
got<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.020> +1<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.920> you

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
got a +1 and you

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.149 
got a +1 and you
anything<00:02:05.689> a<00:02:05.720> few<00:02:06.110> bottles<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.560> judgement

like<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.319> real<00:02:27.500> change<00:02:27.800> but<00:02:28.610> as<00:02:28.850> I've<00:02:29.209> been

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
like the real change but as I've been

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.180 
like the real change but as I've been
saying<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.989> doesn't<00:02:30.470> go<00:02:30.709> on<00:02:30.800> affecting<00:02:31.130> the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
saying it doesn't go on affecting the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.990 
saying it doesn't go on affecting the
TCG<00:02:32.080> for<00:02:33.080> who<00:02:33.500> knows<00:02:33.680> how<00:02:33.739> long<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.940> think

TCG for who knows how long and I think

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.290 
TCG for who knows how long and I think
this<00:02:35.239> is<00:02:35.300> very<00:02:35.769> dumb<00:02:36.769> aan<00:02:37.130> KU<00:02:37.519> nominees<00:02:37.819> part<00:02:38.060> I

in the TCG that's freaking stupid ok our
metas<00:02:55.130> are<00:02:55.220> already<00:02:55.640> pretty<00:02:56.150> different

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
metas are already pretty different

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.150 
metas are already pretty different
because<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.110> competitive<00:02:57.560> play<00:02:57.709> set<00:02:57.980> up

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
because of the competitive play set up

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.580 
because of the competitive play set up
but<00:02:58.880> now<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.090> change<00:02:59.510> them<00:02:59.720> even<00:02:59.930> more<00:02:59.959> is<00:03:00.410> just

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
but now to change them even more is just

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.620 
but now to change them even more is just
ridiculous<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.459> don't<00:03:01.970> like<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:02.330> at<00:03:02.510> all

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
ridiculous I don't like this at all

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.750 
ridiculous I don't like this at all
especially<00:03:03.380> when<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.590> comes<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.830> worlds<00:03:04.370> if<00:03:04.519> we

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
especially when it comes to worlds if we

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.460 
especially when it comes to worlds if we
don't<00:03:05.120> have<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.630> rule<00:03:05.810> change<00:03:05.840> by<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.260> end

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
don't have the rule change by the end

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.009 
don't have the rule change by the end
then<00:03:07.340> world's<00:03:07.760> just<00:03:07.910> gets<00:03:08.090> all<00:03:08.269> screwed<00:03:08.540> up<00:03:08.750> I

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
then world's just gets all screwed up I

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.190 
then world's just gets all screwed up I
mean<00:03:09.380> think<00:03:09.590> about<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.890> ocg<00:03:10.310> players<00:03:10.549> there

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
mean think about the ocg players there

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.289 
mean think about the ocg players there
and<00:03:12.200> then<00:03:12.410> they're<00:03:12.920> going<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.459> mean<00:03:14.150> they

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
and then they're going to I mean they

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.240 
and then they're going to I mean they
don't<00:03:14.420> have<00:03:14.570> priority<00:03:15.290> there<00:03:15.530> but<00:03:16.160> then

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
don't have priority there but then

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.920 
don't have priority there but then
they're<00:03:16.370> going<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.549> go<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.700> rural<00:03:16.970> worlds<00:03:17.780> and

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
they're going to go to rural worlds and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.210 
they're going to go to rural worlds and
now<00:03:17.989> they<00:03:18.140> have<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.500> they've<00:03:18.920> been<00:03:19.040> playing

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220

expected<00:05:30.730> to<00:05:30.880> get<00:05:31.060> it<00:05:31.440> and<00:05:32.440> nothing<00:05:32.980> in<00:05:33.130> the

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
expected to get it and nothing in the

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.310 
expected to get it and nothing in the
letter<00:05:33.460> said<00:05:33.880> that<00:05:34.360> we<00:05:34.570> were<00:05:34.720> never<00:05:35.050> going<00:05:35.230> to

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
letter said that we were never going to

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.370 
letter said that we were never going to
get<00:05:35.470> this<00:05:35.650> so<00:05:36.550> I'm<00:05:36.640> hoping<00:05:36.970> we<00:05:37.120> do<00:05:37.300> get<00:05:37.480> it<00:05:37.630> to

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
get this so I'm hoping we do get it to

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.510 
get this so I'm hoping we do get it to
level<00:05:38.560> out<00:05:38.770> our<00:05:38.890> Medes<00:05:39.220> again<00:05:39.900> maybe<00:05:40.900> we<00:05:41.140> won't

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
level out our Medes again maybe we won't

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.130 
level out our Medes again maybe we won't
but<00:05:42.520> that<00:05:42.820> would<00:05:42.910> be<00:05:42.940> really<00:05:43.210> stupid<00:05:43.630> and

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
but that would be really stupid and

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.860 
but that would be really stupid and
ignorant<00:05:44.470> on<00:05:44.890> Coon<00:05:45.100> amies<00:05:45.340> part<00:05:45.580> and<00:05:45.820> you<00:05:46.690> can

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
ignorant on Coon amies part and you can

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.540 
ignorant on Coon amies part and you can
probably<00:05:47.290> tell<00:05:47.470> i'm<00:05:47.770> already<00:05:47.980> irritated<00:05:48.220> with

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
probably tell i'm already irritated with

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.420 
probably tell i'm already irritated with
them<00:05:48.730> i<00:05:49.360> don't<00:05:49.510> really<00:05:50.260> enjoy<00:05:50.500> how<00:05:50.950> this<00:05:51.250> stuff

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
them i don't really enjoy how this stuff

them i don't really enjoy how this stuff
works<00:05:51.490> out<00:05:51.880> especially<00:05:52.620> when<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.710> ocg<00:05:54.070> TCG

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
works out especially when the ocg TCG

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.010 
works out especially when the ocg TCG
are<00:05:54.700> already<00:05:54.970> pretty<00:05:55.150> drastically<00:05:55.600> different

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
are already pretty drastically different

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.350 
are already pretty drastically different
do<00:05:56.170> the<00:05:56.350> competitiveness<00:05:56.890> of<00:05:57.100> the<00:05:57.430> ocg<00:05:58.150> brush

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
do the competitiveness of the ocg brush

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.240 
do the competitiveness of the ocg brush
TCG<00:05:59.160> but<00:06:00.390> like<00:06:01.390> I<00:06:01.510> said<00:06:01.570> God's<00:06:01.900> this<00:06:02.890> rolling

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
TCG but like I said God's this rolling

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.910 
TCG but like I said God's this rolling
is<00:06:03.370> pretty<00:06:03.670> big<00:06:03.850> I<00:06:04.120> think<00:06:04.390> and<00:06:04.660> it<00:06:05.560> really

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
is pretty big I think and it really

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.280 
is pretty big I think and it really
points<00:06:06.190> to<00:06:06.400> why<00:06:06.670> book<00:06:06.940> a<00:06:07.030> moon<00:06:07.240> went<00:06:07.840> to<00:06:07.990> one<00:06:08.260> I

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
points to why book a moon went to one I

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.050 
points to why book a moon went to one I
think<00:06:08.500> more<00:06:09.250> than<00:06:09.280> they<00:06:09.550> exceed<00:06:09.850> some

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
think more than they exceed some

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.840 
think more than they exceed some

really blurry you can barely see the

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.620 
really blurry you can barely see the
words<00:06:23.650> so<00:06:24.190> I<00:06:24.220> thought<00:06:24.700> it<00:06:24.850> was<00:06:24.940> just<00:06:25.000> stupid<00:06:25.360> to

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
words so I thought it was just stupid to

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.540 
words so I thought it was just stupid to
do<00:06:25.750> that<00:06:25.780> but<00:06:26.350> I<00:06:26.410> will<00:06:26.500> try<00:06:26.830> to<00:06:26.920> post<00:06:27.100> links<00:06:27.490> in

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.900 
this rule comes into effect in TCG it
will<00:06:57.200> change<00:06:57.440> the<00:06:57.650> game<00:06:57.830> it<00:06:58.130> makes<00:06:58.670> some

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:58.910
