that<00:00:23.510> somehow<00:00:23.840> scare<00:00:24.530> everybody<00:00:24.920> I<00:00:25.130> know<00:00:25.250> when

I first knitted started knitting I

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.460 
I first knitted started knitting I
thought<00:00:27.860> how<00:00:28.640> does<00:00:29.060> that<00:00:29.300> work<00:00:29.600> how<00:00:30.050> are<00:00:30.410> you

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
going to keep your work on those needles

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.569 
going to keep your work on those needles
and<00:00:32.539> what<00:00:32.689> is<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:32.989> purpose<00:00:33.230> well<00:00:34.129> the<00:00:34.250> purpose

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
and what is the purpose well the purpose

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.819 
and what is the purpose well the purpose
of<00:00:34.699> double<00:00:35.030> point<00:00:35.270> needles<00:00:35.570> is<00:00:36.020> to<00:00:36.500> allow<00:00:36.769> you

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
of double point needles is to allow you

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.520 
of double point needles is to allow you
to<00:00:37.190> work<00:00:37.339> a<00:00:37.460> smaller<00:00:37.789> circumference<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:39.109> any

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
to work a smaller circumference and any

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.569 
to work a smaller circumference and any
kind<00:00:39.769> of<00:00:39.920> a<00:00:40.010> piece<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:41.269> top<00:00:41.479> of<00:00:41.629> a<00:00:41.719> hat<00:00:42.579> it's

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
kind of a piece the top of a hat it's

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.660 
kind of a piece the top of a hat it's
just<00:00:43.909> once<00:00:44.239> your<00:00:44.889> circular<00:00:45.889> needles<00:00:46.249> become

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
just once your circular needles become

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.000 
just once your circular needles become
too<00:00:46.969> tight<00:00:47.329> because<00:00:47.839> you're<00:00:48.199> reducing<00:00:48.800> by

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
too tight because you're reducing by

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.279 
too tight because you're reducing by
decreasing<00:00:49.489> your<00:00:49.670> stitches<00:00:50.269> the<00:00:50.960> double

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
decreasing your stitches the double

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.349 
decreasing your stitches the double
points<00:00:51.589> allow<00:00:51.829> you<00:00:51.889> to<00:00:52.159> work<00:00:52.309> a<00:00:52.429> smaller<00:00:52.760> bit

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
points allow you to work a smaller bit

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.840 
points allow you to work a smaller bit
so<00:00:54.229> today<00:00:54.979> I<00:00:55.010> did<00:00:55.549> pre<00:00:55.850> cast<00:00:56.120> on<00:00:57.039> and<00:00:58.039> I<00:00:58.459> debated

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
so today I did pre cast on and I debated

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.869 
so today I did pre cast on and I debated
it<00:00:59.059> if<00:00:59.149> I<00:00:59.299> should<00:00:59.539> do<00:00:59.690> that<00:00:59.719> or<00:01:00.049> not<00:01:00.229> but<00:01:00.260> I<00:01:01.249> like

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
it if I should do that or not but I like

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.000 
it if I should do that or not but I like
to<00:01:02.089> cast<00:01:02.299> on<00:01:02.600> all<00:01:02.929> my<00:01:03.109> stitches<00:01:03.530> onto<00:01:03.709> one

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
to cast on all my stitches onto one

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.580 
to cast on all my stitches onto one
double<00:01:04.400> point<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:05.000> then<00:01:05.540> slip<00:01:05.930> them<00:01:06.140> over<00:01:06.440> to

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
double point and then slip them over to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.460 
double point and then slip them over to
the<00:01:06.710> other<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:08.000> minimum<00:01:08.570> most<00:01:08.810> sets<00:01:09.140> come

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
the other to the minimum most sets come

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.640 
the other to the minimum most sets come
with<00:01:09.680> five<00:01:09.980> some<00:01:11.020> companies<00:01:12.020> are<00:01:12.200> starting<00:01:12.440> to

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
with five some companies are starting to

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.430 
with five some companies are starting to
create<00:01:13.160> sets<00:01:13.820> with<00:01:14.090> six<00:01:14.480> needles<00:01:14.930> in<00:01:15.110> case<00:01:15.290> you

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
create sets with six needles in case you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.100 
create sets with six needles in case you
break<00:01:15.590> one<00:01:15.830> and<00:01:16.040> lose<00:01:16.190> one<00:01:16.460> but<00:01:17.330> most<00:01:17.690> of<00:01:17.990> the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
break one and lose one but most of the

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.440 
break one and lose one but most of the
double<00:01:18.350> points<00:01:18.740> out<00:01:18.950> there<00:01:19.310> come<00:01:19.550> in<00:01:19.730> sets<00:01:20.330> of

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
double points out there come in sets of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.700 
double points out there come in sets of
five<00:01:20.750> and<00:01:21.080> that's<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:23.450> can<00:01:23.660> use<00:01:23.870> three<00:01:24.350> to

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
five and that's you can use three to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.650 
five and that's you can use three to
work<00:01:24.920> from<00:01:25.160> or<00:01:25.430> four<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.150> then<00:01:26.240> you<00:01:26.390> always

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
work from or four and then you always

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.290 
work from or four and then you always
have<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:26.870> fifth<00:01:27.260> needle<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.700> thing<00:01:28.940> that<00:01:29.120> I<00:01:29.150> did

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
have a fifth needle the thing that I did

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.060 
have a fifth needle the thing that I did
initially<00:01:29.840> when<00:01:30.230> i<00:01:30.260> first<00:01:30.350> started<00:01:30.920> working

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
initially when i first started working

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.800 
initially when i first started working
with<00:01:31.310> my<00:01:31.490> double<00:01:31.790> points<00:01:32.090> was<00:01:32.240> I<00:01:32.390> was<00:01:32.570> always

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
with my double points was I was always

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.850 
with my double points was I was always
forgetting<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:34.060> work<00:01:35.060> on<00:01:35.270> from<00:01:36.200> one<00:01:36.380> needle<00:01:36.710> to

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
forgetting to work on from one needle to

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.530 
forgetting to work on from one needle to
the<00:01:36.980> next<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.400> I'd<00:01:37.580> end<00:01:37.730> up<00:01:37.820> with<00:01:37.970> two<00:01:38.180> needles

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
the next and I'd end up with two needles

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.140 
the next and I'd end up with two needles
and<00:01:38.810> that<00:01:39.320> didn't<00:01:39.590> work<00:01:39.710> at<00:01:39.890> all<00:01:40.010> so<00:01:40.760> you<00:01:40.850> can

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
and that didn't work at all so you can

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.300 
and that didn't work at all so you can
see<00:01:41.390> I've<00:01:41.780> got<00:01:41.840> just<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.410> basic<00:01:42.620> a<00:01:42.950> number<00:01:43.220> of

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
see I've got just a basic a number of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.870 
see I've got just a basic a number of
stitches<00:01:43.520> two<00:01:44.000> four<00:01:44.270> six<00:01:44.570> on<00:01:44.810> each<00:01:44.840> needle

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
stitches two four six on each needle

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.030 
stitches two four six on each needle
I've<00:01:46.880> just<00:01:46.940> pre<00:01:47.480> casted<00:01:48.050> them<00:01:48.230> on<00:01:48.380> like<00:01:48.590> I<00:01:48.740> say

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
I've just pre casted them on like I say

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.850 
I've just pre casted them on like I say
I<00:01:49.400> like<00:01:50.180> to<00:01:50.390> cast<00:01:50.630> them<00:01:50.930> on<00:01:51.080> ahead<00:01:51.380> of<00:01:51.530> time<00:01:51.830> and

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
I like to cast them on ahead of time and

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.760 
I like to cast them on ahead of time and
slip<00:01:52.520> them<00:01:52.730> so<00:01:53.570> this<00:01:53.780> is<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.140> part<00:01:54.409> that<00:01:54.500> gets

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
slip them so this is the part that gets

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.810 
slip them so this is the part that gets
everybody<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.340> little<00:01:55.520> twitterpated<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:57.820> you

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
everybody a little twitterpated and you

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.940 
everybody a little twitterpated and you
want<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.270> twist<00:01:59.540> them<00:01:59.810> around<00:01:59.870> so<00:02:00.440> all<00:02:00.650> your

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
want to twist them around so all your

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.670 
want to twist them around so all your
stitches<00:02:01.190> are<00:02:01.940> going<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.570> same<00:02:02.810> direction<00:02:02.840> if

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
stitches are going the same direction if

work and then you can see my purl bumps

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:17.930 
work and then you can see my purl bumps
so<00:02:16.609> that<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:16.999> the<00:02:17.030> inside<00:02:17.569> of<00:02:17.629> my

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
work in theory so you want to make sure

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.150 
work in theory so you want to make sure
when<00:02:21.960> you're<00:02:22.080> getting<00:02:22.230> ready<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.590> join<00:02:22.950> these

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
all in a circle and go around and around

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.830 
all in a circle and go around and around
that<00:02:25.590> your<00:02:26.430> work<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.880> all<00:02:27.150> pointing<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> same

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
that your work is all pointing the same

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.520 
that your work is all pointing the same
direction<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:30.360> can<00:02:30.540> see<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.080> I'm<00:02:31.260> pretty

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
direction and you can see and I'm pretty

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.290 
direction and you can see and I'm pretty
experienced<00:02:32.100> with<00:02:32.220> double<00:02:32.820> points<00:02:33.090> but<00:02:33.210> you

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
experienced with double points but you

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.050 
experienced with double points but you
can<00:02:33.450> see<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.840> can<00:02:33.960> be<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.140> little<00:02:34.350> tricky<00:02:34.470> with

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
can see it can be a little tricky with

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.240 
can see it can be a little tricky with
these<00:02:36.060> first<00:02:36.360> few<00:02:36.870> stitches<00:02:37.380> because<00:02:37.740> they're

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
these first few stitches because they're

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.610 
these first few stitches because they're
floppy<00:02:38.760> they<00:02:39.510> don't<00:02:39.690> have<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.900> lot<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.140> fabric

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
floppy they don't have a lot of fabric

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.910 
floppy they don't have a lot of fabric
on<00:02:40.800> them<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:42.720> hold<00:02:42.960> them<00:02:43.230> but<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.530> can<00:02:43.680> see

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
on them to hold them but you can see

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.370 
on them to hold them but you can see
that<00:02:44.280> I've<00:02:44.640> pulled<00:02:44.970> them<00:02:45.180> all<00:02:45.390> down<00:02:45.720> going<00:02:46.260> the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
that I've pulled them all down going the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.690

we alternate the needles each needle

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.950 
we alternate the needles each needle
becomes<00:05:52.280> the<00:05:53.280> next<00:05:53.670> right<00:05:54.120> hand<00:05:54.420> needle<00:05:54.660> to
