00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.619
 san giuseppe 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.109

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.810
 provides the ingredients are those 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.119
 just changing the form and the way 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.360
 in which it is tinged so I have already prepared 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:39.840

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.780

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.030
 its bases in this way and then serve the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.379
 I'm video to do the rest 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.140
 if you want me to see exactly how me 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.309
 I will prepare this interpol being always 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.309
 this liquid almost the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.250
 you need the mixture as a pastry cooker 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.530
 base percent always there I left the 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.870
 link as I said before about cherries 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.760
 candied or for lerici touched and 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.020
 plenty of oil to tighten further if 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.040
 you also want sugar at the time 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.100
 when not to see first 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.220
 preparations of the squares of parchment paper 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.920
 so don't make the imprecision proofs of 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.930
 all the furious paper is now worth it for 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.450
 un sac Ã  poche unfortunately that the 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.250
 little puppy that now though you 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.070
 you had to worship big and have it 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.399
 challenges with the compound of mine for the 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.399
 donuts 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.909
 now let's go to make the shape of the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.909
 zeppole on parchment paper 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.130
 he told me if you have a spout 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.220
 the bigger the better 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:33.000
 now let's gently fry the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:35.280
 our car after a few seconds 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.310
 we should go and try to take away the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.310
 reality want now let's see how 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.820
 we see a second head 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.550
 not now 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.599
 need tweezers if you have 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.599
 that sky that will fall to remove 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.599
 so 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.430
 you turn around 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.640

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.950
 on the other side because they are not found 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.370
 without undermining this I am going to also say that 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.370

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.069
 here they are, the others are still 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.560

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.910

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.519

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.830

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.650

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.430

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.269

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.099
 not happy if we go to put also 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:05:01.880

00:04:43.099 --> 00:05:06.590
