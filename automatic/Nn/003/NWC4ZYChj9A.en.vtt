00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
so I am not actually expecting for him

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.780 
so I am not actually expecting for him
to<00:00:31.650> switch<00:00:31.920> out<00:00:32.099> because<00:00:32.399> for<00:00:32.610> what<00:00:32.759> I

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
to switch out because for what I

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.549 
to switch out because for what I
remember<00:00:33.210> Abby<00:00:33.390> pumps<00:00:33.750> can't<00:00:33.960> really<00:00:34.230> hurt

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
remember Abby pumps can't really hurt

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.990 
remember Abby pumps can't really hurt
cracks<00:00:34.980> her<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.160> any<00:00:35.399> way<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.610> could<00:00:35.790> always

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
cracks her in any way I could always

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.270 
cracks her in any way I could always
just<00:00:36.210> recover<00:00:36.510> after<00:00:36.630> damage<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.739> I'm<00:00:38.010> going

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
just recover after damage so I'm going

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.190 
just recover after damage so I'm going
for<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.579> toxic<00:00:38.969> plume<00:00:39.120> predicting<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.899> switch

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
for the toxic plume predicting a switch

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.139 
for the toxic plume predicting a switch
but<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.590> actually<00:00:40.860> also<00:00:41.280> forgot<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> fact<00:00:42.059> that

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
but I actually also forgot the fact that

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.540 
but I actually also forgot the fact that
the<00:00:42.300> mb<00:00:42.570> pumps<00:00:42.809> carry<00:00:43.050> taunt<00:00:43.530> because<00:00:44.399> it's

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the mb pumps carry taunt because it's

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.069 
the mb pumps carry taunt because it's
been<00:00:44.670> such<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> long<00:00:45.059> time<00:00:45.420> since<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.719> had<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> you

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
battle or actually faced ambipom in

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.150 
battle or actually faced ambipom in
general<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.350> completely<00:00:49.829> forgot<00:00:50.100> about

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160

going to u-turn as i go for the
earthquake<00:00:57.270> which<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> really<00:00:57.780> nice

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
prediction on his part and now if only I

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.510 
prediction on his part and now if only I
wasn't<00:01:01.320> taunted<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.949> would<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.160> gone<00:01:02.250> for<00:01:02.309> the

amount<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.070> HP<00:01:32.220> because<00:01:32.670> they<00:01:32.790> could<00:01:32.939> easily

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
amount of HP because they could easily

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.990 
amount of HP because they could easily
sweep<00:01:33.570> any<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.170> team<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:35.000> so

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
sweep any you you team like that so

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.399 
sweep any you you team like that so
you're<00:01:36.270> luckily<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.689> managed<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> break<00:01:37.229> that

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
you're luckily I managed to break that

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.380 
you're luckily I managed to break that
thing<00:01:37.560> sub<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.250> now<00:01:38.850> I'm<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.060> going<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.270> go

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
thing sub and now I'm just going to go

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.300 
thing sub and now I'm just going to go
for<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.600> Aquajet<00:01:40.140> before<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.860> thing<00:01:41.040> kills

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
for the Aquajet before this thing kills

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.740 
for the Aquajet before this thing kills
me<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.729> these<00:01:42.030> things<00:01:42.240> don't<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
me because these things don't have the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.240 
me because these things don't have the
best<00:01:42.899> defenses<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.439> might<00:01:43.740> as<00:01:43.799> well<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:44.040> do<00:01:44.159> as

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
best defenses I might as well just do as

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.069 
best defenses I might as well just do as
much<00:01:44.490> time<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.149> possibly<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.840> today

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
much time as I can possibly do today

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.960 
much time as I can possibly do today
miss<00:01:46.200> Maggie's<00:01:46.560> while<00:01:46.710> I'm<00:01:46.829> at<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.280> i'ma<00:01:47.939> go

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970

for<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.240> Aquajet<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:48.810> he<00:01:48.899> predicts<00:01:49.259> that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
for the Aquajet but he predicts that

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.670 
for the Aquajet but he predicts that
again<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.070> goes<00:01:50.189> into<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> zoom<00:01:51.030> real<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.680> it

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
again it goes into a zoom real and it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.980 
again it goes into a zoom real and it
did<00:01:52.860> practically<00:01:53.460> no<00:01:53.729> damage<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.390> plus<00:01:54.720> left

did practically no damage and plus left
or<00:01:55.170> which<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.439> almost<00:01:55.649> as<00:01:55.920> as<00:01:56.159> if<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.640> did

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
or which is almost as as if I did

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.550 
or which is almost as as if I did
nothing<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.479> I'm<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.170> switch<00:01:58.320> out<00:01:58.439> as

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
nothing so I'm going to switch out as

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.990 
nothing so I'm going to switch out as
well<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:58.860> into<00:01:59.040> my<00:01:59.130> defensive<00:01:59.579> wall<00:01:59.729> cracks

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
how to take anything this thing throws

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.170 
how to take anything this thing throws
at<00:02:01.530> me<00:02:01.560> which<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.979> an<00:02:02.130> aqua<00:02:02.520> jet<00:02:02.549> which<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.939> good

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
at me which is an aqua jet which is good

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.230 
at me which is an aqua jet which is good
because<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.479> get<00:02:03.689> HP<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.890> I'm<00:02:05.790> pretty<00:02:06.060> sure

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
because I get HP now and I'm pretty sure

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.760 
because I get HP now and I'm pretty sure
he's<00:02:06.270> predicting<00:02:06.840> me<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.020> go<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.320> toxic

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
he's predicting me to go for the toxic

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.440 
he's predicting me to go for the toxic
because<00:02:07.920> he<00:02:08.459> knows<00:02:08.640> i'm<00:02:08.849> probably<00:02:09.149> going<00:02:09.360> to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
because he knows i'm probably going to

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.029 
because he knows i'm probably going to
predict<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.959> switch<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.349> go<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.619> toxic

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
predict the switch and go for the toxic

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.540 
predict the switch and go for the toxic
so<00:02:11.160> i'm<00:02:11.280> actually<00:02:11.430> expecting<00:02:12.060> some

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
so i'm actually expecting some

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.330 
so i'm actually expecting some
thing<00:02:12.700> like<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:13.060> steel<00:02:13.510> or<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:14.620> poison-type

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
thing like a steel or a poison-type

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.740 
thing like a steel or a poison-type
pokemon<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.820> come<00:02:15.970> in<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.270> I'm<00:02:16.390> gonna<00:02:16.510> go<00:02:16.600> for

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
pokemon to come in so I'm gonna go for

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.210 
pokemon to come in so I'm gonna go for
the<00:02:16.810> earthquake<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.320> do<00:02:17.470> damage<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.100> that

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
the earthquake to do damage to that

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.010 
the earthquake to do damage to that
switching<00:02:19.000> but<00:02:19.240> it's<00:02:19.480> actually<00:02:19.630> just<00:02:19.930> a

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
switching but it's actually just a

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.560 
switching but it's actually just a
ambipom<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:21.490> am<00:02:21.640> going<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:21.880> do<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.000> pretty

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
ambipom and I am going to do a pretty

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.850 
ambipom and I am going to do a pretty
good<00:02:22.690> amount<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.080> damage<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.500> ambipom

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
good amount of damage to this ambipom

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.040 
good amount of damage to this ambipom
and<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:25.240> might<00:02:25.390> as<00:02:25.480> well<00:02:25.510> just<00:02:25.720> go<00:02:25.840> for<00:02:25.930> another

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
and I might as well just go for another

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.140 
and I might as well just go for another
one<00:02:26.290> hopefully<00:02:26.620> just<00:02:26.980> take<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.310> out<00:02:27.430> since

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
one hopefully just take it out since

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.280 
one hopefully just take it out since
that<00:02:28.240> Miss<00:02:28.420> make<00:02:28.570> is<00:02:28.690> this<00:02:28.810> out<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.080> way<00:02:29.140> so

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
that Miss make is this out of the way so

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.200 
that Miss make is this out of the way so
I'm<00:02:29.890> just<00:02:30.130> stay<00:02:30.250> n<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.580> equal<00:02:30.850> for<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.060> fake

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
I'm just stay n is equal for the fake

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.480 
I'm just stay n is equal for the fake
out<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.680> he's<00:02:32.680> probably<00:02:32.950> not<00:02:33.190> going<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.400> go

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
out and he's probably not going to go

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.890 
out and he's probably not going to go
for<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.700> ta's<00:02:33.940> he's<00:02:34.210> probably<00:02:34.420> just<00:02:34.570> gonna<00:02:34.750> go

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
for the ta's he's probably just gonna go

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.850 
for the ta's he's probably just gonna go
for<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.080> uterine<00:02:35.410> because<00:02:35.560> it's<00:02:35.710> really

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
for the uterine because it's really

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.160 
for the uterine because it's really
dangerous<00:02:36.160> at<00:02:36.910> this<00:02:37.060> point<00:02:37.390> for<00:02:37.690> him<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.020> go

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
dangerous at this point for him to go

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.410 
dangerous at this point for him to go
for<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.070> taan<00:02:39.280> so<00:02:39.490> I'm<00:02:39.670> actually<00:02:39.820> expecting<00:02:40.330> a

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
for the taan so I'm actually expecting a

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.850 
for the taan so I'm actually expecting a
u-turn<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.900> I'm<00:02:41.020> gonna<00:02:41.140> go<00:02:41.290> into<00:02:41.470> Sharpedo

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
u-turn and I'm gonna go into Sharpedo

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.130 
u-turn and I'm gonna go into Sharpedo
expecting<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.520> and<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:43.300> combination<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:43.960> my

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
expecting that and a combination of my

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.200 
expecting that and a combination of my
ability<00:02:44.560> rufskin<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.220> life<00:02:45.490> orb<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.880> is<00:02:46.000> going

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
ability rufskin and life orb it is going

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.000 
ability rufskin and life orb it is going
to<00:02:46.270> be<00:02:46.300> enough<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.780> take<00:02:46.960> it<00:02:47.080> out<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.530> is

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
to be enough to take it out so that is

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.220 
to be enough to take it out so that is
good<00:02:48.190> for<00:02:48.250> me<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.520> took<00:02:48.670> out<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.150> scouting<00:02:49.660> /

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
good for me I took out the scouting /

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.190 
good for me I took out the scouting /
faking<00:02:50.830> out<00:02:50.980> ambipom<00:02:51.370> out<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.820> way<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.200> ya

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
the bullet punch hoping I could get into

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.820 
the bullet punch hoping I could get into
kylo<00:03:01.240> Ren's<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.720> where<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.140> can't<00:03:02.410> set<00:03:02.620> up<00:03:02.710> any

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
kylo Ren's to where it can't set up any

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.140 
kylo Ren's to where it can't set up any
more<00:03:03.040> substitutes<00:03:03.610> so<00:03:03.790> that's<00:03:03.940> what<00:03:04.060> I'm

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
more substitutes so that's what I'm

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.480 
more substitutes so that's what I'm
hoping<00:03:04.240> but<00:03:04.630> sadly<00:03:05.590> enough<00:03:05.710> that<00:03:05.980> isn't<00:03:06.280> that

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
hoping but sadly enough that isn't that

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.160 
hoping but sadly enough that isn't that
is<00:03:06.610> not<00:03:06.730> enough<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.300> it's<00:03:07.540> got<00:03:07.720> actually

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
is not enough and it's got actually

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.510 
is not enough and it's got actually
going<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.380> set<00:03:08.500> up<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.680> sub<00:03:08.890> but<00:03:09.070> it<00:03:09.250> really

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
going to set up a sub but it really

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.250 
going to set up a sub but it really
isn't<00:03:09.730> as<00:03:10.000> dangerous<00:03:10.210> anymore<00:03:10.630> at<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:11.110> low

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
isn't as dangerous anymore at that low

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.410 
isn't as dangerous anymore at that low
of<00:03:11.410> HP<00:03:11.800> because<00:03:12.190> after<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.730> break<00:03:12.910> its<00:03:13.060> up<00:03:13.270> is

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
going to survive due to pretty good

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.140 
going to survive due to pretty good
natural<00:03:26.320> defense<00:03:26.770> and<00:03:27.730> then<00:03:27.820> I'm<00:03:27.910> just<00:03:27.970> going

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
natural defense and then I'm just going

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.370 
natural defense and then I'm just going
to<00:03:28.239> go<00:03:28.300> for<00:03:28.450> another<00:03:28.540> bullet<00:03:28.989> punch<00:03:29.110> because<00:03:29.260> i

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
to go for another bullet punch because i

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.900 
to go for another bullet punch because i
don't<00:03:29.560> have<00:03:29.620> pursue<00:03:29.980> on<00:03:30.130> this<00:03:30.250> thing<00:03:30.459> but<00:03:30.489> i

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
don't have pursue on this thing but i

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.670 
don't have pursue on this thing but i
guess<00:03:31.150> he<00:03:31.270> just<00:03:31.380> sacrificed<00:03:32.380> his<00:03:32.500> miss

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
guess he just sacrificed his miss

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.990 
guess he just sacrificed his miss
Maggie's<00:03:33.010> because<00:03:33.190> he<00:03:33.310> probably<00:03:33.520> knows<00:03:33.760> it's

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
Maggie's because he probably knows it's

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.390 
Maggie's because he probably knows it's
not<00:03:34.060> much<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.989> third<00:03:35.170> anymore<00:03:35.590> so<00:03:35.860> yeah<00:03:36.190> I

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
not much of a third anymore so yeah I

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.150 
not much of a third anymore so yeah I
guess<00:03:36.640> he<00:03:36.790> laid<00:03:36.940> his<00:03:37.030> mismagius<00:03:37.420> died<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.830> I

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
guess he laid his mismagius died and I

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.800 
guess he laid his mismagius died and I
was<00:03:39.190> just<00:03:39.430> gonna<00:03:39.520> bring<00:03:39.790> him<00:03:39.940> back<00:03:39.970> as<00:03:40.480> rumor

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
was just gonna bring him back as rumor

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.690 
was just gonna bring him back as rumor
oh<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.140> I'm<00:03:41.500> kind<00:03:42.160> of<00:03:42.190> fearing<00:03:42.520> he<00:03:42.610> might

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
oh and I'm kind of fearing he might

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.340 
oh and I'm kind of fearing he might
predict<00:03:43.000> my<00:03:43.150> cracks<00:03:43.660> are<00:03:43.810> switching<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:44.230> go

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
predict my cracks are switching and go

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.660 
predict my cracks are switching and go
for<00:03:44.530> focus<00:03:44.860> punch<00:03:45.040> because<00:03:45.190> i'm<00:03:45.370> actually

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
for focus punch because i'm actually

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.740 
for focus punch because i'm actually
expecting<00:03:46.150> this<00:03:46.239> thing<00:03:46.300> to<00:03:46.420> be<00:03:46.600> that

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
expecting this thing to be that

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.210 
expecting this thing to be that
substitute<00:03:47.200> focus<00:03:47.500> puncher<00:03:47.800> because<00:03:47.950> i<00:03:47.980> saw

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
substitute focus puncher because i saw

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.979 
substitute focus puncher because i saw
leftovers<00:03:48.970> and<00:03:49.090> it's<00:03:49.239> not<00:03:49.360> choice<00:03:49.570> planet<00:03:49.900> so

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
leftovers and it's not choice planet so

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.210 
leftovers and it's not choice planet so
that's<00:03:50.140> what<00:03:50.290> i<00:03:50.320> was<00:03:50.410> thinking<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:50.920> our<00:03:51.070> i'm

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
that's what i was thinking so our i'm

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.890 
that's what i was thinking so our i'm
going<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.430> bring<00:03:51.520> in<00:03:51.700> this<00:03:52.390> thing<00:03:52.600> on<00:03:52.750> the

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
going to bring in this thing on the

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.740 
going to bring in this thing on the
predicted<00:03:53.700> focus<00:03:54.700> punch<00:03:54.880> or<00:03:55.030> substitute<00:03:55.540> but

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
predicted focus punch or substitute but

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.000 
predicted focus punch or substitute but
inside<00:03:56.110> just<00:03:56.260> one<00:03:56.410> for<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.680> straight<00:03:56.890> up

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
inside just one for the straight up

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.540 
inside just one for the straight up
aquajet<00:03:57.580> and<00:03:58.510> here<00:03:58.780> i<00:03:58.959> was<00:03:59.830> pretty<00:04:00.220> sure<00:04:00.400> this

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
aquajet and here i was pretty sure this

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.979 
aquajet and here i was pretty sure this
team<00:04:00.730> was<00:04:00.790> going<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:01.000> switch<00:04:01.300> out<00:04:01.510> fearing<00:04:01.900> my

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
these things but apparently I didn't

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
it's a over half and

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.390 
it's a over half and
barely<00:04:25.810> did<00:04:25.990> have<00:04:26.199> but<00:04:26.499> I<00:04:26.530> I<00:04:26.889> went<00:04:27.219> for<00:04:27.340> a

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
barely did have but I I went for a

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.040 
barely did have but I I went for a
ballsy<00:04:27.819> move<00:04:27.849> in<00:04:28.060> with<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.240> psychic<00:04:28.629> anyways

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050

ballsy move in with a psychic anyways
but<00:04:29.289> there<00:04:29.979> was<00:04:30.069> not<00:04:30.189> the<00:04:30.310> smartest<00:04:30.669> move<00:04:30.879> but

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
but there was not the smartest move but

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.929 
but there was not the smartest move but
luckily<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.689> I<00:04:32.050> think<00:04:32.680> I<00:04:32.740> got<00:04:32.919> max<00:04:33.370> damage<00:04:33.610> or

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:33.939 
luckily it I think I got max damage or

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.119 
luckily it I think I got max damage or
something<00:04:34.270> like<00:04:34.360> that<00:04:34.419> so<00:04:34.599> luckily<00:04:35.229> it<00:04:35.949> did

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:36.129 
something like that so luckily it did

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:37.499 
something like that so luckily it did
turn<00:04:36.279> out<00:04:36.400> pretty<00:04:36.610> well<00:04:36.759> for<00:04:36.909> me<00:04:37.120> but<00:04:37.300> I<00:04:37.330> was

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
turn out pretty well for me but I was

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.209 
turn out pretty well for me but I was
not<00:04:37.659> the<00:04:37.779> smartest<00:04:37.900> move<00:04:38.259> I<00:04:38.590> could<00:04:39.009> have<00:04:39.099> done

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:39.219 
not the smartest move I could have done

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:42.119 
not the smartest move I could have done
but<00:04:39.490> yeah<00:04:39.969> now<00:04:40.240> here<00:04:40.419> is<00:04:40.539> in<00:04:40.659> an<00:04:40.749> alakazam<00:04:41.129> this

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:42.129 
but yeah now here is in an alakazam this

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:43.679 
but yeah now here is in an alakazam this
thing<00:04:42.279> is<00:04:42.400> actually<00:04:42.580> capable<00:04:42.939> of<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.389> leaky

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:43.689 
thing is actually capable of to leaky

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.589

owning<00:04:44.189> my<00:04:45.189> pokemon<00:04:45.639> over<00:04:45.819> if<00:04:46.180> it<00:04:46.300> goes<00:04:46.449> for

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
owning my pokemon over if it goes for

owning my pokemon over if it goes for
the<00:04:46.659> correct<00:04:46.990> move<00:04:47.139> so<00:04:47.379> I<00:04:47.409> might<00:04:47.560> as<00:04:47.620> well<00:04:47.710> just

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
the correct move so I might as well just

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.309 
the correct move so I might as well just
in<00:04:48.129> my<00:04:48.219> executor<00:04:48.729> stay<00:04:48.969> and<00:04:49.300> die<00:04:49.449> so<00:04:50.110> i<00:04:50.169> can

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
in my executor stay and die so i can

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.890 
in my executor stay and die so i can
safely<00:04:50.499> bring<00:04:50.830> in<00:04:50.979> my<00:04:51.330> my<00:04:52.330> hitmontop<00:04:52.659> to

that is still not enough it survives
with<00:05:42.009> a<00:05:42.069> little<00:05:42.430> bit<00:05:42.550> of<00:05:42.580> HP<00:05:43.000> and<00:05:43.240> it's<00:05:43.389> going

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
to be able to finish me off with a flare

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.240 
to be able to finish me off with a flare
blitz<00:05:45.330> but<00:05:46.330> luckily<00:05:46.569> for<00:05:46.870> me<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.409> recoil<00:05:48.069> is

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
blitz but luckily for me the recoil is

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.409 
blitz but luckily for me the recoil is
going<00:05:48.490> to<00:05:48.550> be<00:05:48.639> enough<00:05:48.819> to<00:05:48.939> finish<00:05:49.089> off<00:05:49.300> the

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
going to be enough to finish off the

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.809 
going to be enough to finish off the
Blaziken<00:05:50.050> as<00:05:50.169> well<00:05:50.379> and<00:05:50.680> now<00:05:51.129> he's<00:05:51.430> down<00:05:51.610> to

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
Blaziken as well and now he's down to

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.510 
Blaziken as well and now he's down to
his<00:05:51.849> last<00:05:52.719> two<00:05:53.110> Pokemon<00:05:53.589> and<00:05:53.830> I<00:05:53.889> still<00:05:54.399> have

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
his last two Pokemon and I still have

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.889 
his last two Pokemon and I still have
two<00:05:54.639> more<00:05:54.789> of<00:05:54.879> my<00:05:54.969> own<00:05:55.120> so<00:05:55.330> now<00:05:55.659> it's<00:05:55.810> the

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:55.899 
two more of my own so now it's the

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:57.240 
two more of my own so now it's the
perfect<00:05:56.050> chance<00:05:56.319> to<00:05:56.439> bring<00:05:56.649> in<00:05:56.800> my<00:05:56.889> leg<00:05:57.039> game

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
perfect chance to bring in my leg game

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.939 
perfect chance to bring in my leg game
sweep<00:05:57.490> in<00:05:57.610> my<00:05:57.729> right<00:05:57.879> failure<00:05:58.680> it<00:05:59.680> brings<00:05:59.860> the

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
sweep in my right failure it brings the

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.110 
sweep in my right failure it brings the
register<00:06:00.370> which<00:06:00.520> is<00:06:00.610> pretty<00:06:00.729> good<00:06:00.819> for<00:06:00.939> me

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
register which is pretty good for me

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.100 
register which is pretty good for me
because<00:06:01.210> I<00:06:01.360> could<00:06:01.509> just<00:06:01.659> set<00:06:01.750> up<00:06:01.839> a<00:06:01.930> rock

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
because I could just set up a rock

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.570 
because I could just set up a rock
polish<00:06:02.439> and<00:06:02.649> this<00:06:02.860> thing<00:06:02.979> probably<00:06:03.129> can't<00:06:03.460> do

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
polish and this thing probably can't do

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.639 
polish and this thing probably can't do
too<00:06:03.789> much<00:06:03.819> to<00:06:04.180> me<00:06:04.300> and<00:06:04.509> luckily<00:06:05.349> it<00:06:05.560> doesn't

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:05.649 
too much to me and luckily it doesn't

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:08.070 
too much to me and luckily it doesn't
have<00:06:05.979> like<00:06:06.219> a<00:06:06.250> ice<00:06:06.610> punch<00:06:06.939> or<00:06:07.240> iron<00:06:07.750> head<00:06:07.960> it

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
have like a ice punch or iron head it

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.269 
have like a ice punch or iron head it
just<00:06:08.110> goes<00:06:08.469> for<00:06:08.589> assessment<00:06:08.979> tasks<00:06:09.159> was

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
just goes for assessment tasks was

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:12.300 
just goes for assessment tasks was

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:23.529 
tube so I just set up another one just

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:25.200 
tube so I just set up another one just
to<00:06:23.680> be<00:06:23.770> safe<00:06:23.919> because<00:06:24.099> this<00:06:24.370> this<00:06:25.149> thing

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
to be safe because this this thing

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.230 
to be safe because this this thing
basically<00:06:25.569> can't<00:06:26.020> do<00:06:26.080> anything<00:06:26.319> so<00:06:26.710> since<00:06:27.699> I

basically can't do anything so since I

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.700 
basically can't do anything so since I
got<00:06:28.479> nothing<00:06:28.719> else<00:06:28.779> to<00:06:28.870> do<00:06:29.080> my<00:06:29.319> other

attacking move astonish I'm gonna go for

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:32.999 
attacking move astonish I'm gonna go for
the<00:06:31.210> reversal<00:06:31.629> anyways<00:06:31.960> and<00:06:32.259> it<00:06:32.500> doesn't<00:06:32.680> do

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:33.009 
the reversal anyways and it doesn't do

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:33.620 
the reversal anyways and it doesn't do
anything

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
i'm just gonna go for the endure so my

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.860 
i'm just gonna go for the endure so my
reversal<00:06:43.560> could<00:06:43.710> be<00:06:43.830> as<00:06:43.950> much<00:06:44.220> as<00:06:44.780> powered<00:06:45.780> up

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
reversal could be as much as powered up

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.210 
reversal could be as much as powered up
as<00:06:45.990> i<00:06:46.110> can<00:06:46.350> because<00:06:46.530> i'm<00:06:46.680> gonna<00:06:46.860> need<00:06:47.040> all<00:06:47.070> the

brings me down to 1 hp obviously now in
the<00:06:55.740> moment<00:06:55.860> of<00:06:56.070> truth<00:06:56.130> if<00:06:56.520> I<00:06:56.580> could<00:06:56.760> take<00:06:56.880> it

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
the moment of truth if I could take it

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.640 
the moment of truth if I could take it
out<00:06:57.150> with<00:06:57.330> one<00:06:57.690> reversal<00:06:58.230> I'm<00:06:58.380> pretty<00:06:58.620> much

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
out with one reversal I'm pretty much

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.950 
out with one reversal I'm pretty much
