00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.720
 and then program staff and play us 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.019
 is here now with nothing less nothing 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.360
 Oh my God, of course we're here with caution. 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.980
 Mohd 18 good face first of all a 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.209
 title to cut off consider the 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.610
 This interview people 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.770
 the thing a study how it gives the climate 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.200
 here from fortress hell how is it 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.150
 it's hot but it's good the face is hot 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.980
 too much 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.520
 I suffered a little cause of size 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.859
 then and from the beard until I came prepared 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.829
 for a little bit more business 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:37.120
 Cold but it 's cool, it's good I lived 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.030
 here a while ago i 'm me 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.190
 getting used to an expensive thing like that 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.589
 started this story I'll do it already 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.230
 videos on the internet as is 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.940
 that this took already made videos in the 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.550
 internet and play video games 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.100
 so I said why not make videos from 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.210
 videogame and bonbon because I think 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.699
 initially because it already had an audience 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.519
 who was with me then it was kind of 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.670
 one more project but it's going really well 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.890
 know who has a legal audience o 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.200
 People like to charge a lot when I get 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.120
 do is send many scenes to 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.280
 to participate is that I have a collection 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.650
 of the best scenes so great 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.490
 thousands of scenes in the queue are 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.010
 very cool 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.170
 and what is the game that is played here remembered 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.860
 which should follow the 10 and knock that was 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.330
 that disappointment sleeping dogs is not 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.130
 lose the team than it was more or less 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.860
 my mandate my biggest disappointment was 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.360
 with the center producing our scent 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.610
 too bad I thought it was going to be a lot 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.200
 of textiles between producers of 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.020
 truth us if you could choose 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.970
 three games 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.430
 Yes, indeed, it is difficult all the time. 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.800
 we do any console but which ones 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.020
 would such first place my game 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.300
 all time favorite of the ex pm 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.520
 I'm very fond of max payne from the whole series. 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.010
 the 3 I thought it was up to the others 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.590
 two then the first pm in 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.300
 second place with bf 30 was 3 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.390
 because I'm also very much a fan of the b 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.890
 in a field and 13 had one such point of 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.110
 Turn in my life where thou turned 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.290
 profession playing bf3 because of the channel 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.069
 I do not like games and the third one 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.650
 is the most relevant 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.909
 game counter strike training I started 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.269
 playing that story I think in 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:22.519
 99 and it was the first kick I got to 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.810
 I have not played since 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:28.459
 strange very owl lan houses going 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.409
 So many people may think it's 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.510
 easy to keep making these videos in the 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.819
 internet but it's really easy 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.650
 For that thing I 'm going to get here. 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.900
 record a video and it will steal is easy 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.629
 that way if it was easy everyone 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.829
 doing the pumping is not 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:47.620
 All have a technical job 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.639
 behind making a video that is is 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.889
 interesting to bring entertainment 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.949
 play videogame everybody knows understood 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:56.750
 then record the same gameplay can 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:58.730
 seems easy, but if you can make a 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.739
 narration that causes the person to stop 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.079
 and the sixth 10 minutes knows she's ten 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.790
 minutes of her day and that this in times 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.849
 Ten minutes of internet is an eternity 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.409
 then it is not easy or even easy if 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.689
 It was so easy so I would not talk to 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:15.049
 the videos I did every day but it's 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:17.540
 really gives real work is a 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.729
 question that I wanted to know what you 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.790
 think this audience is more connected to games 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:24.109
 you think or do you think they 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.540
 so demanding that this selection is not 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.209
 half impassive essences if you think 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.709
 that they have this good activity to 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.079
 this kind of thing is seen a 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.639
 person playing video game giving a guess 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.620
 say so 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.780
 It's a community that I did what I 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.699
 I realized it's very close, it's a galley. 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.919
 very understanding and a galley who 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.569
 different from my main channel if I 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.519
 Talk to the people, I can not make a video. 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.500
 of the personal week scold me in the universe 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.590
 there is a community a bit 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.090
 more united a nice guys and for 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.969
 other side they also know how to be very 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.799
 Very demanding critic is sometimes 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:00.199
 sometimes I get face-to-face charges 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:04.430
 you is not true gamer is not 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:06.259
 I know it means because I wanted to know 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.239
 What this means is that the channel is the 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:10.099
 dude started playing mpdft these days 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.199
 I play video games before birth. 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.060
 and then some accuse me of not following 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.829
 true that I there on youtube to steal 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.620
 the place of other gamers 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.150
 but overall it's very cool it's an audience 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.979
 that I've come to know since I 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.479
 I created a game channel that does not do 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.690
 I do not know for almost a year. 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.540
 and I learned to like it, it's cool 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.070
 and you can live today, too. 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.890
 can see only with youtube videos 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.250
 or have any income is behind as is 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.580
 what is 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.440
 can not exist 5 this is also true of 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.200
 according to the audience, it is logical but 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.990
 a gal that the game including that is 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.120
 exclusively gay method if you subscribe 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.040
 and you any game that you know 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.300
 from youtube that has you some 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.680
 an equal number of subscribers 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.240
 probably lives on it 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.530
 there is no such need to have 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.870
 reconcile things on youtube 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.480
 fortunately this structure is the youtube 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.520
 and networks give this structure so that 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.270
 each one of them can dedicate themselves and 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.090
 his profession 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.220
 and with this story of you living 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.930
 doing something you like and still 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.150
 Over and make money from it is 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.500
 cool, it's not just glamor 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.530
 if you look you in theory and speech 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.450
 man the guy wins to play video games 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.100
 But it 's not just glamor, it's all there. 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.990
 that difficulty that we spoke of 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.970
 if you make a cool video do a 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.770
 easy videogame making a video is easy 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.540
 make a video that people watch and 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.860
 them to return to you the next it 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.770
 requires some talent 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.690
 so it's not all are flowers but he 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.100
 It's very good, very cool, me too. 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.990
 could not complain about this kind of 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.350
 that he would be absurd is very 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.360
 Well, it's cool, that's all. 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.340
 I really wanted to thank the interview 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.730
 You 're giving in to us and a lot to 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.650
 to win is to catch you then it is 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:51.270
 Thank you very much sometimes as I said 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.710
 Look at recording. I'm very much a fan of Caution. 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.200

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.270

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.340
 Congratulations, continue to make your videos. 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.850
 kind of a bad word because it's giving 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.110
 so working in the fight be 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.220
 original as you always have been 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.220
