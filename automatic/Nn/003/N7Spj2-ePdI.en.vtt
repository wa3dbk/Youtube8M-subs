00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
16 decks so it's actually pretty low for

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.229 
16 decks so it's actually pretty low for
a<00:02:28.390> dragon<00:02:28.660> sword<00:02:29.050> just<00:02:29.800> nice<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.280> get<00:02:31.150> an

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.949 
we got the gold tracer now my favorite
which<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.269> a<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.830> falchion<00:02:42.250> moveset<00:02:42.959> very

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
which is a the falchion moveset very

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.670 
which is a the falchion moveset very
fast<00:02:44.290> as<00:02:44.680> some<00:02:45.519> good<00:02:45.730> range<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.330> has<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.170> really

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
fast as some good range and has a really

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.850 
fast as some good range and has a really
sweet<00:02:47.950> r2<00:02:48.870> which<00:02:49.870> is<00:02:50.019> really<00:02:50.290> really<00:02:50.500> risky

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
sweet r2 which is really really risky

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.490 
sweet r2 which is really really risky
though<00:02:51.280> because<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:52.180> doesn't<00:02:52.480> like<00:02:52.600> it

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
though because it doesn't like it

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.229 
though because it doesn't like it
doesn't<00:02:53.830> swing<00:02:54.069> in<00:02:54.190> an<00:02:54.310> arc<00:02:54.549> to<00:02:55.000> stop

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
doesn't swing in an arc to stop

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.750 
doesn't swing in an arc to stop
backstabbed<00:02:55.860> like<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.010> normal<00:02:57.280> swing<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.610> do

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
backstabbed like the normal swing to do

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.440 
backstabbed like the normal swing to do
it's<00:02:58.690> just<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:59.019> straightforward<00:02:59.319> attack<00:03:00.450> she's

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
it's just a straightforward attack she's

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.789 
it's just a straightforward attack she's
probably<00:03:01.690> really<00:03:01.930> prone<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.319> backside<00:03:02.709> but

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
probably really prone to backside but

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:03.720 
probably really prone to backside but
I'm<00:03:02.860> pretty<00:03:03.069> sure<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.280> can<00:03:03.400> change<00:03:03.610> the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
I'm pretty sure you can change the

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.539 
I'm pretty sure you can change the
direction<00:03:04.319> no<00:03:05.319> no<00:03:05.590> no<00:03:05.709> you<00:03:05.769> can't<00:03:06.069> I<00:03:06.280> was

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
direction no no no you can't I was

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.670 
direction no no no you can't I was
hoping<00:03:06.790> you'd<00:03:07.000> change<00:03:07.060> direction<00:03:07.540> as<00:03:07.930> you

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
hoping you'd change direction as you

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.940 
hoping you'd change direction as you
swing<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.010> but<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:10.810> first<00:03:11.049> swing<00:03:11.349> designates

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
swing it but the first swing designates

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.979 
swing it but the first swing designates
the<00:03:12.130> full<00:03:12.310> direction<00:03:12.730> it's<00:03:13.600> actually<00:03:13.959> a

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
the full direction it's actually a

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.580 
the full direction it's actually a
really<00:03:14.170> risky<00:03:14.410> tag<00:03:14.859> maybe<00:03:15.549> a<00:03:15.670> good<00:03:15.850> wake<00:03:16.030> up

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
really risky tag maybe a good wake up

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.120 
really risky tag maybe a good wake up
really<00:03:17.590> good<00:03:17.799> wakeup<00:03:18.250> um<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:20.739> also<00:03:20.890> has<00:03:21.100> a

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
really good wakeup um it also has a

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.849 
really good wakeup um it also has a
really<00:03:21.370> cool<00:03:21.579> one-handed<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:23.290> that's<00:03:23.739> a

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
really cool one-handed that that's a

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.340 
really cool one-handed that that's a
really<00:03:24.069> really<00:03:24.459> good

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
really really good

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.400 
really really good
one-handed<00:03:26.350> r2<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.850> head<00:03:28.030> as<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:28.900> double

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
one-handed r2 and a head as a double

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.390 
one-handed r2 and a head as a double
spin

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.830 

and<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:36.580> even<00:03:36.610> follows<00:03:37.240> up<00:03:37.420> with<00:03:37.450> another

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
and it even follows up with another

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.680 
and it even follows up with another
three<00:03:38.170> at<00:03:38.290> combo<00:03:38.650> like<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:40.060> does<00:03:40.270> that<00:03:40.480> and

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
three at combo like it does that and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.370 
three at combo like it does that and
then<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:40.960> does<00:03:41.460> the<00:03:42.460> three-hitter<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:44.230> also

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
then it does the three-hitter it also

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.230 
then it does the three-hitter it also
makes<00:03:44.680> for<00:03:44.860> an<00:03:44.920> amazing<00:03:45.040> offhand<00:03:45.850> one<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.150> the

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
makes for an amazing offhand one of the

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.120 
makes for an amazing offhand one of the
first<00:03:46.480> really<00:03:46.990> good<00:03:47.110> off<00:03:47.290> hands<00:03:48.750> cuz<00:03:49.750> watch

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
first really good off hands cuz watch

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.040 
first really good off hands cuz watch
you<00:03:51.130> throw<00:03:51.310> out<00:03:51.370> in<00:03:51.460> the<00:03:51.520> off<00:03:51.640> hand<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:52.480> it

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
you throw out in the off hand and it

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.270 
you throw out in the off hand and it
gets<00:03:53.200> all<00:03:53.350> those<00:03:53.560> cool<00:03:53.830> move<00:03:54.040> sets<00:03:56.280> it's

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
gets all those cool move sets it's

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.970 
gets all those cool move sets it's
probably<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:58.000> first<00:03:58.210> viable<00:03:58.750> off<00:03:59.080> hand<00:03:59.380> it

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
probably the first viable off hand it

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.920 
probably the first viable off hand it
doesn't<00:04:00.370> have<00:04:00.520> a<00:04:00.550> block<00:04:00.940> or<00:04:01.240> a<00:04:01.270> pairing<00:04:01.720> it

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
doesn't have a block or a pairing it

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.500 
doesn't have a block or a pairing it
just<00:04:02.200> has<00:04:02.320> a<00:04:02.350> tax<00:04:02.940> like<00:04:03.940> see<00:04:04.120> there's<00:04:04.330> the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
twice and are going to the other three

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.830 
twice and are going to the other three
attack<00:04:11.670> no<00:04:12.670> it<00:04:12.850> doesn't<00:04:13.210> alright<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:13.480> pretty

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.789 
sure the r2 is the other three attacks
you<00:04:15.610> can<00:04:15.730> start<00:04:15.970> out<00:04:16.060> with<00:04:16.180> either<00:04:16.270> one<00:04:16.799> yeah
