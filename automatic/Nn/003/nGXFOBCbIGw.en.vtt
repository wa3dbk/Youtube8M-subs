00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.810 
method now I have a video link in my
full<00:01:57.600> review<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.110> shows<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.770> method<00:01:59.729> that

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
full review that shows the method that

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.429 
full review that shows the method that
they<00:01:59.969> talk<00:02:00.180> about<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.600> hinge<00:02:00.899> method<00:02:01.320> that

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
they talk about this hinge method that

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.520 
they talk about this hinge method that
you<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.710> use<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.070> totally<00:02:02.430> up<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
you can use it's totally up to you the

you can use it's totally up to you the
flexible<00:02:04.530> glass<00:02:04.710> has<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> hardness<00:02:05.909> rating<00:02:06.180> of

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
flexible glass has a hardness rating of

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.960 
flexible glass has a hardness rating of
9<00:02:06.659> h<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.380> measures<00:02:07.860> at<00:02:08.069> point<00:02:08.459> 12

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
9 h and this measures at point 12

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.570 
9 h and this measures at point 12
millimeters<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:10.050> thickness<00:02:10.129> so<00:02:11.129> it's<00:02:11.310> quite

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
millimeters in thickness so it's quite

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.400 
millimeters in thickness so it's quite
thinner<00:02:12.000> as<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.270> can<00:02:12.540> see

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
thinner as you can see

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.900 
thinner as you can see
let<00:02:13.710> me<00:02:13.770> grab<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.130> other<00:02:14.280> one<00:02:14.370> back<00:02:14.640> here

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
let me grab the other one back here

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.550 
let me grab the other one back here
quite<00:02:15.450> thinner<00:02:15.780> than<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.140> tempered<00:02:16.530> glass

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
quite thinner than the tempered glass

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.830 
quite thinner than the tempered glass
one<00:02:17.070> as<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.340> can<00:02:17.490> see<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.420> course<00:02:18.660> it's

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
one as you can see and of course it's

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.440 
one as you can see and of course it's
flexible<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.650> can<00:02:19.890> take<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.430> bend<00:02:21.240> it

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
flexible so you can take it and bend it

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.870 
flexible so you can take it and bend it
unlike<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.950> can<00:02:23.220> with<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.490> tempered<00:02:23.850> glass

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
unlike you can with the tempered glass

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.260 
unlike you can with the tempered glass
so<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:25.110> only<00:02:25.320> have<00:02:25.530> one<00:02:25.830> actual<00:02:26.280> s5<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.030> what<00:02:27.150> I'm

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
so I only have one actual s5 so what I'm

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.390 
so I only have one actual s5 so what I'm
going<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.420> do<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.690> install<00:02:27.870> one<00:02:28.440> come<00:02:29.070> back<00:02:29.220> and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
going to do is install one come back and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.830 
going to do is install one come back and
show<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.610> how<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.940> looks<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.480> then<00:02:30.600> come<00:02:30.810> back

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
show you how it looks and then come back

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.420 
show you how it looks and then come back
and<00:02:30.960> install<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.560> other<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.040> show<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.310> how

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
and install the other and show you how

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.900 
and install the other and show you how
it<00:02:32.700> looks<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.690> will<00:02:33.990> be<00:02:34.020> right<00:02:34.290> back<00:02:34.910> alright

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
it looks so I will be right back alright

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.000 
it looks so I will be right back alright
so<00:02:36.090> up<00:02:36.300> first<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.840> premium<00:02:37.380> tempered

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
so up first is the premium tempered

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.940 
so up first is the premium tempered
glass<00:02:38.040> from<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.940> loom<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:40.260> feels<00:02:40.680> amazing

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
glass from I loom and it feels amazing

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.100 
glass from I loom and it feels amazing
the<00:02:41.730> best<00:02:41.940> part<00:02:42.240> about<00:02:42.300> i<00:02:42.480> think<00:02:42.690> these

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
the best part about i think these

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.630 
the best part about i think these
Greenshields<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.070> way<00:02:44.190> they<00:02:44.340> feel<00:02:44.580> on
