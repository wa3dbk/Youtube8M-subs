00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:14.209
 our recipe today is to arrange 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:17.449
 condensed milk and looks like the recipe you 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.939
 You will need a gelatin envelope. 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.780
 tasteless 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:27.289
 a glass of coconut milk a can of 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:30.490
 condensed milk and a box of cream 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.559
 of milk with 200 degrees 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.469
 Here I am going to start dissolving the gelatin 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.290
 a little pack in the water 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.700
 here according to manufacturer's instruction 5 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.520
 spoons of water 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.340
 we shake it a little bit and it will lead to 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.079
 Microwave for 15 seconds 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.200
 Then you can do it in a water bath. 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:56.930
 if you do not have microwave tests are 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:01:00.379
 certinho in one package label 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.960
 mexidinha here just to traverse so Tim and 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.329
 I'll book 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.340
 now I'll start with coconut milk 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:12.830
 or throw all of it here in the blender 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:17.780
 I will also put the condensed milk 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:23.350
 all here at once the gelatin that the 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.350
 listen and I'll knock a little 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.850
 O 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.090
 now I add the cream box of 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.090
 milk for use 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:44.270
 I'm just going to give you a quick beat 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.270
 here just to incorporate right 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.420
 this way it is a descent with water 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.330
 okay for when we go misinformation 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.340
 It can not be dry but it is a 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.250
 normal plastic form 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.840
 I put it in the fridge for at least 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.400
 four hours 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:12.300
 and here is only to misinform and decorate with 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:15.050
 plum in syrup is both our delicacy 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.050
 condensed milk 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:41.320
 oh
