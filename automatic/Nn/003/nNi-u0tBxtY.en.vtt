hey<00:00:00.570> we're<00:00:00.780> just<00:00:00.810> gonna<00:00:01.020> go<00:00:01.199> into<00:00:01.560> actually

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
hey we're just gonna go into actually

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.560 
hey we're just gonna go into actually
using<00:00:02.220> your<00:00:02.250> hologram<00:00:02.879> now<00:00:03.030> this<00:00:03.240> is<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.389> part

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
using your hologram now this is the part

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.140 
using your hologram now this is the part
you've<00:00:03.780> been<00:00:04.020> waiting<00:00:04.319> for<00:00:04.589> it

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.150 
you've been waiting for it

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.440 
you've been waiting for it
hopefully<00:00:06.150> you<00:00:06.870> have<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.890> plug<00:00:08.849> in<00:00:09.000> here<00:00:09.210> so<00:00:09.420> he

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
hopefully you have a plug in here so he

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.000 
hopefully you have a plug in here so he
gets<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.750> lot<00:00:09.809> easier<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.260> use<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.650> can<00:00:10.679> plug

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
gets a lot easier to use you can plug

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.839 
gets a lot easier to use you can plug
all<00:00:11.190> three<00:00:11.490> chords<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:12.000> here<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:13.110> two

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
all three chords in here the two

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.620 
all three chords in here the two
ultrasonic<00:00:14.849> fighters<00:00:15.240> as<00:00:15.480> well<00:00:16.260> as<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> fan

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
ultrasonic fighters as well as the fan

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.390 
ultrasonic fighters as well as the fan
and<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:19.170> really<00:00:19.410> easy<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.680> turn<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.310> off

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
and it's really easy to turn on and off

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.200 
and it's really easy to turn on and off
that<00:00:20.640> way<00:00:22.039> hopefully<00:00:23.039> your<00:00:23.250> hologram<00:00:23.640> looks

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
that way hopefully your hologram looks

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.750 
that way hopefully your hologram looks
somewhat<00:00:24.570> like<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.930> one<00:00:25.170> here<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:26.460> doesn't

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
somewhat like this one here it doesn't

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.150 
somewhat like this one here it doesn't
have<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.029> be<00:00:27.210> exact<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.529> general<00:00:29.070> idea

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
have to be exact but the general idea

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.810 
have to be exact but the general idea
and<00:00:29.519> concept<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.210> same<00:00:30.859> now<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.130> your<00:00:32.189> water

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
and concept the same now for your water

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.520 
and concept the same now for your water
hole<00:00:33.120> where<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.360> can<00:00:33.510> use<00:00:33.630> any<00:00:33.870> regular

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
hole where you can use any regular

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.100 
hole where you can use any regular
kitchen<00:00:34.739> container<00:00:35.579> I'm<00:00:36.480> using<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.930> right

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
kitchen container I'm using this right

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.350 
kitchen container I'm using this right
here<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.649> really<00:00:37.800> easy<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.280> holds<00:00:38.610> hologram

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
here it's really easy it holds hologram

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.360 
here it's really easy it holds hologram
nicely<00:00:39.800> helps<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.890> stand<00:00:41.100> up<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:43.219> now<00:00:44.219> what

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
nicely helps it stand up to now what

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.950 
nicely helps it stand up to now what
you're<00:00:44.489> gonna<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.270> you're<00:00:45.420> gonna<00:00:45.480> fill<00:00:45.840> it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
you're gonna do is you're gonna fill it

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.160 
you're gonna do is you're gonna fill it
with<00:00:45.989> water<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.160> want<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.180> fill<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.480> so

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
with water and you want to fill it so

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.830 
with water and you want to fill it so
that<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.829> ultrasonic<00:00:50.489> loggers<00:00:50.879> are<00:00:51.090> slightly

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
that the ultrasonic loggers are slightly

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.670 
that the ultrasonic loggers are slightly
below<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.770> water<00:00:52.920> surface<00:00:54.379> you<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.530> always

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
below the water surface you can always

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.900 
below the water surface you can always
just<00:00:56.610> test<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.940> out<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.180> you're<00:00:57.300> not<00:00:57.420> sure<00:00:58.910> it's

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
just test it out if you're not sure it's

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.060 
just test it out if you're not sure it's
not<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> big<00:01:00.539> deal<00:01:00.780> if<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.649> put<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> little

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
not that a big deal if you put a little

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.149 
not that a big deal if you put a little
too<00:01:02.190> much<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.730> got<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.940> pour<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.210> out

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
too much in and you got to pour it out

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.170 
too much in and you got to pour it out
generally<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.250> want<00:01:05.369> them<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.729> run<00:01:05.909> though

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
generally you want them to run though

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.780 
generally you want them to run though
with<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.869> water<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.070> don't<00:01:08.189> want<00:01:08.369> them<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.640> be

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
with in water you don't want them to be

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.770 
with in water you don't want them to be
above<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.299> water<00:01:10.490> now<00:01:11.490> once<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.909> have<00:01:12.420> put<00:01:12.689> it

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
above the water now once you have put it

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.780 
above the water now once you have put it
in<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.990> water<00:01:13.110> like<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.490> test<00:01:14.670> it

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
in the water like that you can test it

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.219 
in the water like that you can test it
out<00:01:14.909> I'm<00:01:15.330> gonna<00:01:15.450> turn<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.750> power<00:01:15.930> here

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
out I'm gonna turn on the power here

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.380 
out I'm gonna turn on the power here
takes<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.040> second<00:01:17.369> for<00:01:17.400> all<00:01:17.820> three<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.180> them<00:01:18.270> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
takes a second for all three of them to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.709 
takes a second for all three of them to
turn<00:01:18.509> on

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.880 

now<00:01:26.719> one<00:01:26.930> of<00:01:26.960> my<00:01:27.020> favorite<00:01:27.079> parts<00:01:27.530> about<00:01:27.590> this

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
now one of my favorite parts about this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.190 
now one of my favorite parts about this
design<00:01:28.189> is<00:01:28.640> right<00:01:29.270> now<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.479> hologram<00:01:29.960> is

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
design is right now the hologram is

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.550 
design is right now the hologram is
running<00:01:30.560> this<00:01:31.070> particle<00:01:31.640> system<00:01:31.729> is<00:01:32.119> going<00:01:32.560> if

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
running this particle system is going if

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.590 
running this particle system is going if
you<00:01:33.710> put<00:01:33.860> your<00:01:33.979> hand<00:01:34.189> above<00:01:34.460> it<00:01:34.610> you<00:01:35.270> can<00:01:35.450> feel

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
you put your hand above it you can feel

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.359 
you put your hand above it you can feel
the<00:01:35.810> air<00:01:35.960> coming<00:01:36.259> out<00:01:36.469> with<00:01:36.679> with<00:01:37.189> the

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
the air coming out with with the

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.940 
the air coming out with with the
ultrasonic<00:01:38.060> fog<00:01:38.270> basically<00:01:38.840> but<00:01:39.590> you<00:01:39.740> can't

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
ultrasonic fog basically but you can't

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.179 
ultrasonic fog basically but you can't
really<00:01:40.069> see<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:41.350> now<00:01:42.350> if<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.619> chose<00:01:42.829> to<00:01:42.860> get

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
really see it now if you chose to get

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.789 
really see it now if you chose to get
this<00:01:43.840> mini<00:01:44.840> projector<00:01:45.079> here<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:45.770> I

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
this mini projector here that I

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.789 
this mini projector here that I
recommend<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:46.369> in<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.549> parts<00:01:46.850> list<00:01:47.799> comes

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
recommend it in the parts list comes

in the back here now adjusting it is
probably<00:02:08.450> one<00:02:08.690> of<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:09.099> the<00:02:10.099> biggest<00:02:10.280> things

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
probably one of the the biggest things

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.160 
probably one of the the biggest things
you'll<00:02:10.670> have<00:02:10.789> to<00:02:10.880> do<00:02:11.060> here<00:02:11.329> you<00:02:11.930> have<00:02:12.019> to<00:02:12.140> just

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
you'll have to do here you have to just

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:21.309 
you'll have to do here you have to just
afore<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.709> right<00:02:12.890> angle<00:02:20.049> good<00:02:21.049> as<00:02:21.200> the

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
afore the right angle good as the

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.410 
afore the right angle good as the
classic<00:02:21.799> one<00:02:22.010> that's<00:02:22.280> used<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.180> pretty<00:02:23.360> much

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
classic one that's used in pretty much

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.300 
classic one that's used in pretty much
all<00:02:23.599> hologram<00:02:24.019> demonstrations<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.920> Princess

all hologram demonstrations the Princess
Leia<00:02:25.340> image<00:02:26.030> here

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.150 

here<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:39.030> going<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.450> be<00:02:39.660> basically<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.470> very

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
here is going to be basically a very

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.830 
here is going to be basically a very
simple<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.950> while<00:02:44.190> we're<00:02:44.340> looking<00:02:44.490> at<00:02:44.760> just

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
simple and while we're looking at just

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.140 
simple and while we're looking at just
right<00:02:45.840> above<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:47.610> if<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:47.880> move<00:02:48.030> the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
right above it and if you move the

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.450 
right above it and if you move the
camera<00:02:48.450> over<00:02:48.480> here<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:48.990> can<00:02:49.250> see<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.340> not

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
camera over here and you can see it not

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:58.430 
camera over here and you can see it not
quite<00:02:50.670> as<00:02:50.760> well<00:02:51.620> over<00:02:52.620> here<00:02:57.050> and<00:02:58.050> now<00:02:58.290> we're

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
quite as well over here and now we're

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.660 
quite as well over here and now we're
gonna<00:02:58.530> have<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.070> up<00:02:59.160> here<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.430> move<00:02:59.550> the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
gonna have it up here and move the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.430 
gonna have it up here and move the
projector<00:03:00.150> around<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.960> show<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.170> what<00:03:01.380> it

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
projector around to show you what it

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:11.640 
projector around to show you what it
looks<00:03:01.590> like

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.990 

so<00:03:12.610> it's<00:03:12.730> not<00:03:12.849> a<00:03:12.909> full<00:03:13.530> 360-degree<00:03:15.000> 3d

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
so it's not a full 360-degree 3d

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.210 
so it's not a full 360-degree 3d
hologram<00:03:16.450> at<00:03:16.690> this<00:03:17.019> point<00:03:17.319> it's<00:03:17.650> more<00:03:17.799> like<00:03:18.190> a

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
hologram at this point it's more like a

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.640 
hologram at this point it's more like a
flat<00:03:18.810> projected<00:03:19.810> screen<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:20.200> particles<00:03:20.560> in

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
flat projected screen of particles in

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.089 
flat projected screen of particles in
midair<00:03:21.989> let's<00:03:22.989> do<00:03:23.319> a<00:03:23.379> couple<00:03:23.500> other<00:03:23.650> pictures

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
midair let's do a couple other pictures

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:37.380 
midair let's do a couple other pictures
here<00:03:27.750> do<00:03:28.750> this<00:03:28.930> nice<00:03:29.200> looking<00:03:29.769> color

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.930 

this<00:03:38.020> is<00:03:38.170> actually<00:03:38.500> with<00:03:38.620> with<00:03:39.460> lights<00:03:39.730> on

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
this is actually with with lights on

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.300 
this is actually with with lights on
here<00:03:40.270> this<00:03:41.020> is<00:03:41.260> one<00:03:41.650> of<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.830> lowest<00:03:42.160> power

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
here this is one of the lowest power

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.920 
here this is one of the lowest power
projectors<00:03:42.910> out<00:03:43.060> there<00:03:43.330> that<00:03:43.510> higher<00:03:43.690> power

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
projectors out there that higher power

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.830 
projectors out there that higher power
projector<00:03:44.580> will<00:03:45.580> be<00:03:45.730> even<00:03:46.120> better<00:03:46.510> with

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
projector will be even better with

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.210 
projector will be even better with
lights<00:03:47.110> on<00:03:47.319> I'm<00:03:47.709> going<00:03:47.800> to<00:03:47.890> turn<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.069> lights

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
lights on I'm going to turn the lights

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.550 
lights on I'm going to turn the lights
off<00:03:48.370> here<00:03:50.490> this<00:03:51.490> projector<00:03:52.000> has<00:03:52.209> I<00:03:52.450> believe<00:03:52.560> 17

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
off here this projector has I believe 17

off here this projector has I believe 17
lumens<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.459> I've<00:03:55.150> used<00:03:55.480> projectors<00:03:55.900> we'll

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
lumens and I've used projectors we'll

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.500 
lumens and I've used projectors we'll
have<00:03:56.140> two<00:03:56.230> forty-five<00:03:56.650> hundred<00:03:56.680> lumens<00:03:57.510> as

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
have two forty-five hundred lumens as

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.199 
have two forty-five hundred lumens as
you<00:03:58.630> can<00:03:58.780> see<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:01.330> image<00:04:01.540> here<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:04.000> lights

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
you can see the image here the lights

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.900 
you can see the image here the lights
off

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.330 

try<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.570> red<00:04:09.750> car

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.729 

and<00:04:13.730> one<00:04:14.270> of<00:04:14.300> things<00:04:14.540> about<00:04:14.630> filming<00:04:15.200> your

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
and one of things about filming your

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.319 
and one of things about filming your
hologram<00:04:16.070> if<00:04:16.220> you<00:04:16.310> want<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.579> film<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.150> show

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
hologram if you want to film it to show

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.640 
hologram if you want to film it to show
off<00:04:17.359> with<00:04:17.570> your<00:04:17.720> friends<00:04:18.109> and<00:04:18.230> family<00:04:18.560> and

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
off with your friends and family and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.470 
off with your friends and family and
everything<00:04:18.859> it's<00:04:19.579> not<00:04:19.730> gonna<00:04:19.880> come<00:04:20.120> in<00:04:20.269> quite

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
everything it's not gonna come in quite

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.050 
everything it's not gonna come in quite
as<00:04:20.660> well<00:04:20.870> with<00:04:21.139> the<00:04:21.530> camera<00:04:23.080> as<00:04:24.730> it<00:04:25.730> will<00:04:25.910> in

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
as well with the camera as it will in

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.690 
as well with the camera as it will in
person<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:28.370> reason<00:04:28.730> for<00:04:28.880> that<00:04:30.040> is<00:04:31.040> just

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
person the reason for that is just

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.200 
person the reason for that is just
because<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:33.740> camera<00:04:34.430> most<00:04:34.639> cameras<00:04:35.000> aren't

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
because the camera most cameras aren't

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.140 
because the camera most cameras aren't
able<00:04:35.480> to<00:04:35.770> manually<00:04:36.770> focus<00:04:36.889> properly<00:04:37.700> on<00:04:37.970> the

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
able to manually focus properly on the

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.010 
able to manually focus properly on the
hologram<00:04:40.330> they're<00:04:41.330> just<00:04:41.480> focus<00:04:41.810> on<00:04:41.900> the

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
hologram they're just focus on the

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.860 
hologram they're just focus on the
object<00:04:42.200> behind<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.860> hologram<00:04:43.570> so<00:04:44.570> now<00:04:44.690> we're

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
object behind the hologram so now we're

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.750 
object behind the hologram so now we're
we're<00:04:45.380> doing<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:45.770> at<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.040> front<00:04:46.190> part<00:04:46.520> of<00:04:46.610> it

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
we're doing it at the front part of it

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.830 
we're doing it at the front part of it
here<00:04:47.320> it<00:04:48.320> doesn't<00:04:48.860> show<00:04:49.040> up<00:04:49.130> nearly<00:04:49.340> as<00:04:49.550> well

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.060 

what's<00:04:53.840> all<00:04:53.990> I<00:04:54.080> can<00:04:54.290> see<00:04:54.410> a<00:04:54.440> little<00:04:54.680> bit<00:04:54.830> but

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
what's all I can see a little bit but

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.750 
what's all I can see a little bit but
it's<00:04:55.250> essentially<00:04:56.000> a<00:04:56.030> rear<00:04:56.479> I<00:04:56.919> hope<00:04:57.919> you<00:04:58.160> enjoy

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
it's essentially a rear I hope you enjoy

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.290 
it's essentially a rear I hope you enjoy
your<00:04:59.389> hologram<00:04:59.900> send<00:05:00.680> me<00:05:00.830> video<00:05:01.250> pictures<00:05:01.910> ask

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
your hologram send me video pictures ask

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.620 
your hologram send me video pictures ask
any<00:05:02.540> questions<00:05:02.900> you<00:05:02.960> have<00:05:03.050> about<00:05:03.200> it
