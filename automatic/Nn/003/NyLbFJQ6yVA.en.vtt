00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.390
 how about friends there in I almost hope you 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.490
 are enjoying their breakfast and that 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.469
 they believe in the Malibu coast in 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.690
 california discover what a 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.330
 alleged giant underwater entrance of 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.190
 UFOs and to explain us about this 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.109
 find accompanies us live the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.550
 researcher daniel muñoz very good 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.400
 days my dear friend as the worker 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.830
 is so much and he has already seen the news of 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.109
 these recent recent and just finish 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.999
 to be discovered hey, very interesting 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.470
 of this network situation my dear friend 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.270
 really this is super 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.309
 interesting but rather of what 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.430
 treats this supposed underground entrance 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.590
 as this thing have actually been 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.390
 observing for many years there in 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.609
 all this that is best known by the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.079
 theme of the artists has also been 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.969
 turned of course a site of 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.859
 UFO watching and that show you 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.469
 these images that have a lot to do 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.000
 with all this good that discovers you of 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.100
 a very interesting way because 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.809
 they begin to see irregularities through 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.730
 of this system google is now at 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.250
 reach of all and began to occur 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.390
 already has underwater research and 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.940
 all 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.750
 we are seeing there that you like to be 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.010
 measuring about a thousand more or 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.190
 less than two inches wide 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:21.270
 long and it has an entry of 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:24.360
 approximately 650 feet out there and that 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.950
 it would be like an entrance in which there 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.130
 they are watching the animation that is very 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.570
 interesting as a kind of 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.270
 amphitheater in which you can 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.950
 perfectly a kind of style in 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.210
 which have been interviewed books 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.310
 men because it is affirmed that it can be 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.470
 of men because right there I was 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.570
 I think of them they have been watching since 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.450
 many years ago I from small to 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.160
 the US was talking about this but now 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.080
 entering this circumstance of what 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.880
 called the extraterrestrial world for sure 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.009
 it is completely associated with the fact that 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.590
 these called 2000 objects 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.960
 Unidentified submarines could 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.369
 enter in these kinds of places and that 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.560
 could connect with many places 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.659
 because it either started to do 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.359
 radiometric research 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.920
 geological systems and realize 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.840
 that nothing more like a little ticket 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.849
 superficial a clear bonfire if they are not 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.890
 truly caves that go through 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.900
 below the continent and that you can 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.120
 connect other places even there 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.400
 same as that of the east coast of the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.720
 united states but also to others 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.030
 places of the world as it happens in 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.819
 South America with the famous cave of 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:32.310
 the stems has gone up those of them by the 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.660
 which I think is in Ecuador is not in 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.780
 this city but there is another kind of 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.750
 underground finds 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.090
 and it is just this from the cave of the 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.920
 stems because amazing because no 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.819
 it's just a topic that has to do 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.830
 with extraterrestrials and does not trust 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.020
 present and based on the one inside 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.959
 the cave of the stems there precisely 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.030
 in Ecuador it could not be found 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.640
 only then if this cave they are 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.280
 kilometers and kilometers of canicross 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.800
 entered English and Japanese two teams 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.430
 but you have found this kind of 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.050
 structures that effectively 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.940
 would correspond to civilizations that do not 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.670
 they are precisely the human size but 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.620
 that some three months greater is to say beings 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.239
 living that had new 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.060
 constructions like you four 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.190
 meters to go from the characters of 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.200
 the little ones and these who are watching 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.420
 there they are in what could be considered 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.040
 as ventilation systems is fine 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.470
 interesting what's down there and 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.430
 they found not only these and the 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.150
 plates 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.890
 wrote that they had written so many 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.530
 stories of different hypotheses 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.290
 ministrations and what do I have to say 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.880
 were these findings notarized in a 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.340
 Notary public in the city ​​of 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.530
 guayaquil and then in cuenca had 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.700
 the opportunity to read 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.160
 Millan librarians from visited this cave 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.840
 from the point of the nation and I was 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.940
 there because I do not know if you know once 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.560
 we looked at him and he could put 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.990
 extraterrestrial about the null was something 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.050
 that was always censored because this 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.670
 dream of the cave because precisely he 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.920
 he started having contact with these 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.130
 these search revealed them but there is a 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.109
 book that is called is like this is easy trans 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.540
 is going to put on my page the space 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.090
 alternative so that everyone does not have and 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.860
 there he tells how in his contact he 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.620
 they said the secret was below 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.900
 the earth all the secret of the UFOs 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.970
 it was intra-terrestrial and the entrance without 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.710
 treat your most famous ones because they are these 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.800
 that we are seeing there in Peru what 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.460
 they are the peoples 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.020
 and also in everything that is good is 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.030
 assumes that there are generations 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.949
 aliens from the dike now that I 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.870
 I'm going back to ecuador that the active king 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.400
 many things that I could see almost 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.460
 surely we will be able to go around there 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:54.409
 things that we can bring 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.729
 surely many thanks 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.129
 dear friend this topic I believe that 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.050
 will have to give still much more 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.729
 but thanks for bringing us I 'm sending you a 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.289
 great hug to mexico and that there 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.449
 cattle gives me more color bust already vibrates 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.860
 mexico and if you can and now we change 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.190
 a little terno and let's go to the 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.190
 music
