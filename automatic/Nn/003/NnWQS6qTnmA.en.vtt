00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:02.950 
with the defense I didn't Goshen there
because<00:05:02.090> they<00:05:02.180> needed<00:05:02.360> to<00:05:02.449> wait<00:05:02.630> offense<00:05:02.870> and

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
because they needed to wait offense and

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.930 
because they needed to wait offense and
if<00:05:03.050> i<00:05:03.139> open<00:05:03.259> up<00:05:03.500> guys<00:05:03.949> stealing<00:05:04.340> big<00:05:04.550> ocean<00:05:04.669> for

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
if i open up guys stealing big ocean for

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.420 
if i open up guys stealing big ocean for
850<00:05:05.389> bucks<00:05:05.599> obviously<00:05:06.380> is<00:05:06.680> average<00:05:07.039> price<00:05:07.280> at

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
850 bucks obviously is average price at

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.040 
850 bucks obviously is average price at
that<00:05:07.550> time<00:05:07.759> was<00:05:07.880> 105<00:05:08.270> k<00:05:08.539> and<00:05:08.690> i<00:05:08.720> got<00:05:08.840> him<00:05:08.930> for

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
that time was 105 k and i got him for

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.200 
that time was 105 k and i got him for
850<00:05:09.740> so<00:05:09.949> that<00:05:10.370> was<00:05:10.460> really<00:05:10.490> lucky<00:05:10.820> i<00:05:10.970> think<00:05:11.150> he

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
850 so that was really lucky i think he

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.430 
850 so that was really lucky i think he
still<00:05:11.300> had<00:05:11.419> 45<00:05:11.750> minutes<00:05:11.930> left<00:05:12.020> on<00:05:12.139> him<00:05:12.259> so

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
still had 45 minutes left on him so

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.170 
still had 45 minutes left on him so
