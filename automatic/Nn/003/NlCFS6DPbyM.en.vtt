00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.339
 greetings to all who accompany 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.289
 and continuing the series on 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.369
 leather that I started already some 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.380
 weeks, right? 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.789
 showing a series of products to be 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.230
 to make with the leather 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.810
 I will not teach braiding. 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.509
 mystery of three strands is that braid here 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.369
 Oh you can see the braid she starts 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.410
 here and end here 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.180
 What's different about this braid is 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.059
 that the three children are embedded here 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.829
 in the middle of the trail is a massive pyre 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.309
 with masses, I can see if we have 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.020
 less so it is a single satire is not 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.329
 three pieces of leather only one strip 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.699
 with a braid in the middle I think this is the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.899
 correct setting to call this 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:54.120
 braid this braid to be used there 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.789
 on bag handle or flip site 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.800
 bracelets bracelets and everything else 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.210
 I wear it very much like no bracelet. 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.739
 I put it on my bench to sell like 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.960

 né besides the price you can make a 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.130
 very good price because it is a braid that 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.810
 arouse the attention that this case has 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.210
 I finished my braid I put a 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.340
 push button at each end 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.960
 if you have br br it will be difficult to 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.640
 these pushbuttons then makes a 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.930
 hole in each part a line is the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.730
 person else here 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.680

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.750
 seed or if you want to invest a 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.580
 take a dressmaker down and ask 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.040
 so that it applies the buttons here 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.750

 where wine is thus made there 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.390
 It's okay, let's start here to achieve a 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:06.860

 the braid mystery of three already finished 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.599
 I have to do now is to give a 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.220
 O pulled that which is to actually leave 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:32.130
 all the way to the braid with the same tightness 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.739
 let's say with the same distance 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.959
 between each point is to leave the braid 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.419
 really pretty uniform 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.450
 otherwise it will be tightened on one side 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:44.609
 and will be very loose from the other and this 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.919

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.849
 product on your bankroll is to make a 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.549
 none of this 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:55.530
 It's cool for the child to really be 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:58.680
 Even way to do this is to open the 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.790
 block that all over again and accepting 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.790

 understood I'll do it here again 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.420
 braid then due to ac2 filmed on a 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.549
 another and that tumble I give that is 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.810
 fundamental for this work then it has 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.240
 who pay close attention to the moments 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.260
 in which it is given when the water 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.750

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.360
 I'll come here, this end inside. 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:38.560

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:48.390
 Ok let's go there one two three 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:59.050
 again one two three 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:06.960
 seeing here I'll come back again 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.960
 there is no secret to one two three 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:19.419
 again one two three 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:27.400
 I'll turn again to do the last 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:29.980
 series here a two three or turn 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.360
 again to complete now ends 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:38.340
 then making the other three a two 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.669
 three and I finish finishing the work here 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.590
 rock 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.360
 Then the braid is ready. I realize that 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.040
 here it is open it is closed 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.650
 so now we have to do that 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.800
 work to open it and tighten 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.800
 again 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.120
 in this way 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:06.120
 now you can see whoever you want 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.770

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.380
 pressure whoever wants to do something else

 phishing type feel free to 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.410
 generally concluded this work is already 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.690
 really a button 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.280
 the bracelet is already here completed then 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.390
 it's not how you see I put 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.920
 depressed buttons here and 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.810
 We have done here our work right here 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.640

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:32.460
 bracelets like purse strap is that it was 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.460
