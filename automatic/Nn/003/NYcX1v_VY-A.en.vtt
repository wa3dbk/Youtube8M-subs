ends<00:00:14.610> when<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.000> hair<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.179> wet<00:00:15.299> we<00:00:15.929> blow-dried

this<00:00:16.560> into<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.920> hair<00:00:17.070> once<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.430> hair<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.699> dry

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
this into the hair once the hair is dry

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.710 
this into the hair once the hair is dry
we<00:00:18.720> take<00:00:18.930> large<00:00:19.140> sections<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:21.000> using<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
we take large sections and using the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.670 
we take large sections and using the
largest<00:00:21.990> Tom<00:00:22.350> wrapping<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.609> hair<00:00:23.789> around

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
largest Tom wrapping the hair around

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.160 
largest Tom wrapping the hair around
just<00:00:25.680> holding<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.189> about<00:00:26.279> 10<00:00:26.550> seconds

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
just holding it for about 10 seconds

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.660 
just holding it for about 10 seconds
what<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.320> does<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.680> gives<00:00:28.890> us<00:00:29.010> movement<00:00:29.550> and

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
what this does is gives us movement and

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.849 
what this does is gives us movement and
softness<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.990> makes<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.349> lot<00:00:31.410> easier<00:00:31.470> to

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
softness and makes it a lot easier to

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.100 
softness and makes it a lot easier to
create<00:00:32.070> afraid<00:00:32.600> step<00:00:33.600> 2

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110
