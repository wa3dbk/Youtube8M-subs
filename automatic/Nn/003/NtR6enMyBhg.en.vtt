 I did not post videos but I 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.269
 I would like to talk about the flow of 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.060

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.890

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.659
 sponsors 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:35.050

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.230
 and because I'm going to talk a lot of people to me 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.970
 ask how your flow is because 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.520
 there are many marriages many essays 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.880
 how do we do to deliver 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.350
 material to separate to wait for 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.990
 have a backup of all this 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.170
 Good, I'll start by counting how I 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.810
 I've been a photographer since the day of the bride. 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.719
 or photographing everything is not too many cards 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.479
 of personal memory for many cards 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:23.499

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.499
 I need to photograph in 21 more 

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:37.960
 It's a good question, how am I? 

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:40.780

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.159

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.869
 external 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:52.749

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.969

 Of course the photos are also the cards 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.580
 even ending the event she starts to 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.200

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.780
 this walkway goes to where passes 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.269
 macbook and also to thank earth 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.459

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.069
 people have already two physical markets beyond 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.650
 of campus cards on wedding day 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.030
 after this is done then we come home 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.680
 I'll go home when I get home. 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.980
 loading the cards a server has 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.080
 one more server at home as well passed 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.730
 Monday unloads all 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.130
 photos via card I pick up all the cards and 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.500
 goes back one by one to the 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.260
 fan because I do that will not 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.049
 unintentionally at night 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.390
 We forgot to swipe the card and then 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.670
 to go without that last card goes 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.750
 lose those photos because how come 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.790
 I make my flow 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.560
 after I went through server to 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.110
 My wife starts deleting the photos. 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.390
 that we did not like it because it's me 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.579
 I do not know you but I click well and 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.340
 makes about 1500 two thousand photos per 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.500
 marriage only when I give all this 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.850
 because you have to select 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.070
 deliver a lot of similar photos 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.170
 for the customer or bad facts then 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.950
 Select I liked your good photos 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:28.239
 delivers a range of 800 photos to 1200 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.859
 photos by marriage but even after 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.200
 she deleted the sources we start to 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.959
 editing after all the photos are 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.870
 edited, they are exported in jpeg without 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.079
 resize the photos 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.739
 we record a DVD and use the debtor 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:47.920
 error at the moment we recorded on dvd and 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:53.650
 then we keep in cases like this all the 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.000
 cases are numbered staff are two 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.760
 dvd data 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.989
 they are numbered 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:06.659
 and all dvds and have a code is 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.599
 all dvds have an on and off code 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:12.450
 has a code and the two are numbered 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:16.769
 When I need to find the one thing. 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.440
 that I look where I'm going I'll get the 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.530

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.000
 I simply have a file can 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.990
 use google docs or you can use 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.770
 own excel 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.560

 for what to be easy after 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:03.900
 location beyond jpeg edited on dvd 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.320
 I also keep the jp ii edited in my 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.410
 server and ross raw on my server 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.180
 depending on the marriage is depending 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.610
 than I 'm backing up your 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.150
 client lives very far from here and occurs 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.479
 only seeing the photos by mail I 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:25.349
 I keep the route is very hard and said no 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.910

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:30.630

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.800
 Yes, I get the format cards. 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.289
 I do not format cards before having a 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.150
 dvd recorded with the photos in high since 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.580
 so you do not risk losing your photos 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.340
 really what happens some disaster 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.110
 something I'll have the photos on 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.789
 greeting card yet 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.440
 another detail I like to keep in 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.750
 two different locations 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.750
 I have two servers at home that are 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.610
 the mirror of the other guard also the dvd 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.970
 in my parents' house to not have 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:02.280
 This is not my personal flow problem. 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.670

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.800
 capturing already backing up on time 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.530
 we'll do it when that space 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.090
 that I explained that we delivered 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.370
 finally to the customer a little 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.510
 pretty dumb as a little duck to 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.790
 show you 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.620
 the delivery a cap a picture of the couple 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.850
 and direct printing would not be with 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.230
 the couple's photo 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.090
 that's it folks i hope they have 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.930
 liked the video was worth it 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.930
 A hug to everyone
