00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
hey guys this is George or blender bug

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.710 
hey guys this is George or blender bug
and<00:00:03.360> i'm<00:00:04.230> here<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.680> show<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:04.920> how<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.279> use

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
and i'm here to show you how to use

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.970 
and i'm here to show you how to use
alpha<00:00:06.720> textures<00:00:07.290> in<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.560> blender<00:00:07.740> game

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
alpha textures in the blender game

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.850 
alpha textures in the blender game
engine<00:00:10.219> for<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.340> tutorial<00:00:11.460> will<00:00:11.849> be<00:00:11.969> using

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
engine for this tutorial will be using

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.880 
engine for this tutorial will be using
blender<00:00:14.389> 2.58<00:00:15.389> because<00:00:16.199> it's<00:00:16.500> now<00:00:16.619> considered

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
blender 2.58 because it's now considered

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.540 
blender 2.58 because it's now considered
stable<00:00:18.560> I<00:00:20.359> mean<00:00:21.470> well<00:00:22.470> I'd<00:00:22.920> be<00:00:23.160> using<00:00:23.460> it

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
stable I mean well I'd be using it

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.880 
stable I mean well I'd be using it
anyway<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:24.119> don't<00:00:24.689> know<00:00:24.840> why<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:24.990> said<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.350> all

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
anyway I don't know why I said that all

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.120 
anyway I don't know why I said that all
right<00:00:26.070> um<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.910> we<00:00:27.779> got<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.109> make<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.500> outside

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
right um so we got to make this outside

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.420 
right um so we got to make this outside
part<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.609> these<00:00:29.849> inside<00:00:30.359> parts<00:00:31.430> transparent

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
part and these inside parts transparent

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.370 
part and these inside parts transparent
so<00:00:32.640> easiest<00:00:33.570> way<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.719> do<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.050> use<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
so easiest way to do that is use the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.430 
so easiest way to do that is use the
fuzzy<00:00:34.980> selection<00:00:35.430> tool<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.320> click<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
fuzzy selection tool and click the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.750 
fuzzy selection tool and click the
outside<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.040> shift-click<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.840> inside<00:00:39.840> parts

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
outside and shift-click the inside parts

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:48.380 
outside and shift-click the inside parts
um<00:00:41.930> right<00:00:42.930> click<00:00:43.670> layer<00:00:46.520> transparency<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
um right click layer transparency and

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.139 
um right click layer transparency and
add<00:00:48.719> alpha<00:00:48.989> channel<00:00:49.489> after<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.610> after<00:00:51.059> you

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
add alpha channel after you after you

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.850 
add alpha channel after you after you
add<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.449> alpha<00:00:51.780> channel<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.559> click

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
add the alpha channel you can click

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.700 
add the alpha channel you can click
delete<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:54.270> will<00:00:54.420> create<00:00:55.289> an<00:00:55.440> alpha

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
delete and it will create an alpha

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.790 
delete and it will create an alpha
channel<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:57.210> parts<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.050> selected<00:01:00.800> now

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
channel on the parts you selected now

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.799 
channel on the parts you selected now
you<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:02.010> save<00:01:02.309> now<00:01:03.090> originally<00:01:03.239> when<00:01:03.780> I

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
you can save now originally when I

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.240 
you can save now originally when I
downloaded<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.850> picture<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.720> was<00:01:07.350> saved<00:01:08.040> as

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
downloaded this picture it was saved as

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.149 
downloaded this picture it was saved as
a<00:01:08.280> JPEG<00:01:08.760> format<00:01:09.170> but<00:01:10.170> unfortunately<00:01:10.799> blender

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
a JPEG format but unfortunately blender

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.200 
a JPEG format but unfortunately blender
doesn't<00:01:11.549> support<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.920> transparent

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
doesn't support that for transparent

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.550 
doesn't support that for transparent
planes<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.750> we're<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.259> change

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
planes so we're going to have to change

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:31.590 
planes so we're going to have to change
it<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.860> PNG<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:21.920> then<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.310> save

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.660 

alright<00:01:32.600> so<00:01:32.900> from<00:01:33.290> here<00:01:36.280> let's<00:01:37.280> just<00:01:37.370> delete

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
alright so from here let's just delete

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.110 
alright so from here let's just delete
that<00:01:37.820> cube<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:39.070> make<00:01:40.070> a<00:01:40.100> plane<00:01:40.520> because<00:01:40.730> we

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
that cube and make a plane because we

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.970 
that cube and make a plane because we
want<00:01:42.190> just<00:01:43.190> because<00:01:44.180> we<00:01:44.360> want<00:01:44.540> a<00:01:44.600> plane<00:01:44.980> I'm

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
want just because we want a plane I'm

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.760 
want just because we want a plane I'm
going<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.280> have<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.520> another<00:01:47.480> window<00:01:47.930> here<00:01:48.200> just

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
going to have a another window here just

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.220 
going to have a another window here just
for<00:01:49.010> a<00:01:49.070> UV<00:01:49.880> image<00:01:50.330> editor<00:01:52.510> going<00:01:53.510> going<00:01:53.990> in

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
for a UV image editor going going in

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.340 
for a UV image editor going going in
clicking<00:01:54.710> tab<00:01:54.980> to<00:01:55.550> edit<00:01:55.940> mode<00:01:56.090> control<00:01:56.690> e<00:01:57.110> to

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
clicking tab to edit mode control e to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.900 
clicking tab to edit mode control e to
mark<00:01:57.620> seam<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.450> unwrap<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.850> now<00:02:01.850> we

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
mark seam and you to unwrap and now we

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.400 
mark seam and you to unwrap and now we
can<00:02:02.150> open<00:02:02.330> up<00:02:02.570> an<00:02:02.750> image<00:02:03.020> in<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.530> editor<00:02:04.240> go<00:02:05.240> to

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
can open up an image in the editor go to

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.730 
can open up an image in the editor go to
where<00:02:06.410> you<00:02:06.560> saved<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.340> open<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.209> up<00:02:08.740> now

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
where you saved it and open it up now

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.230 
where you saved it and open it up now
you<00:02:09.800> can<00:02:09.950> see<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:11.440> it's<00:02:12.440> still<00:02:12.800> green<00:02:13.240> but

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
you can see that it's still green but

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.130 
you can see that it's still green but
the<00:02:14.510> PNG<00:02:14.900> file<00:02:15.260> format<00:02:15.680> actually<00:02:16.070> saved<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.580> as

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the PNG file format actually saved it as

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.180 
the PNG file format actually saved it as
transparent<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.620> don't<00:02:18.830> have<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.040> worry

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
transparent so you don't have to worry

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.040 
transparent so you don't have to worry
about<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.490> we<00:02:19.580> just<00:02:19.610> have<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.030> activate<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
about it we just have to activate the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.350 
about it we just have to activate the
transparent<00:02:21.680> mode<00:02:21.800> so<00:02:22.400> while<00:02:22.820> you're<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.120> edit

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
transparent mode so while you're in edit

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.600 
transparent mode so while you're in edit
mode<00:02:23.390> with<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.900> face<00:02:24.170> selected<00:02:24.680> go<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.310> object

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
mode with a face selected go to object

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.640 
mode with a face selected go to object
data<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:28.000> make<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.180> two<00:02:29.630> sided<00:02:29.959> in<00:02:30.260> the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
data and make it two sided in the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.090 
data and make it two sided in the
texture<00:02:31.040> face<00:02:31.250> options<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:32.740> don't<00:02:33.740> have<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.980> do

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
texture face options I don't have to do

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.199 
texture face options I don't have to do
that<00:02:34.130> but<00:02:34.750> not<00:02:35.750> for<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.230> hell<00:02:36.350> of<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:36.530> and

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
that but not for the hell of it and

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.090 
that but not for the hell of it and
instead<00:02:38.209> of<00:02:38.360> OPEC<00:02:38.959> transparency<00:02:39.739> you<00:02:39.890> need<00:02:40.010> to

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
instead of OPEC transparency you need to

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.360 
instead of OPEC transparency you need to
change<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.489> to<00:02:40.610> alpha<00:02:41.350> this<00:02:42.350> way<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.890> alphas

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
change it to alpha this way the alphas

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.540 
change it to alpha this way the alphas
are<00:02:43.670> activated<00:02:44.420> then<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.690> can<00:02:44.840> actually<00:02:44.989> see

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
are activated then you can actually see

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.870 
are activated then you can actually see
