00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.810
 good afternoon dear knife lovers 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.880
 Today I am especially glad to show you the knife 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:15.889
 from the knife strip Alexey 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.889
 Fedotov because the knife is this exclusive 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:30.170
 knife picker ie manufacturer 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:36.000
 stick and need Anton Lapin means here 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:38.520
 stabilized tree need it up 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.430
 need leather not with wood like you already 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.970
 You can see here we can not wooden 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.970
 leather up 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.940
 free belt hanger 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:06.740
 and this knife handle well, we'll get to 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:11.060
 Don't wait for so long 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:16.270
 Fenichka steel brand h12mf 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.270
 and the surface of the blade is polished 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:34.039
 Bolster knife is made of titanium further 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.039
 elk horn comes with an ornament 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.980
 and here on the handle is the same tree as on 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.980
 sheath 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.570
 pi 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.980
 But with such a cleaner done it 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.500
 always very comfortable such cleaners we 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.400
 We do not only on Khimki but also on 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:10.899
 other knives are not at all of course but on 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:14.200
 some he under the little finger here here 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.630
 the little finger goes very well and if the knife 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.370
 somewhere vodka a convenient Totskiy 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:26.290
 at the expense of this is the crust of my hand. 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.540
 such a volume is kind of plump here but not 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.620
 I will say that under a big hand, well, in general, not 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:38.070
 under a small normal hand like me. 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.070
 that's not subtle say how thin 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.880
 the knife is securely fixed in the sheath due to 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.320
 skin due to the fact that the skin is tight 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:56.470
 fits here the handle and here's the job 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.400
 individual work manual therefore everything 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:04.290
 here it is reliably similar to good 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.290
 thank you for your attention thank you
