 hello culeros today I will do my first video telling him that he will try the one of mc5 or 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:11.380
 better known as the weak maerker and 5 good in the end I played the first 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.429
 to the room but in my pc good that is not the theme 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.119
 the theme is that of mc5 in the end he found information about this title and I have 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.039
 bad news for the 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:29.320
 they are jersey xd xd xd since you leave juas juas jajajajaj xd hahaha good this was 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.179
 what I found on a page 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.760
 I hope you enjoy it that way Capcom confirmed it in an interesting 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.440
 interview that famitsu made the renowned Japanese magazine makes 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.810
 days 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.400
 according to tells us hiroyuki kobayashi 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.300
 producer of the fourth installment of this saga and the original game in addition to 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.370
 resident evil 4 this decision has not been taken lightly by 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.120
 capcom 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.010
 because in principle we had other plans 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.789
 but a generous visit from Microsoft a few weeks ago has made us change 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.910
 to look like so the game will finally be exclusive to xbox 360 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.110
 also kobayashi gives us information about the game the game 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.960
 is still too early in its development so it does not 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.260
 I can give you great information 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.150
 but if I can tell you that I have seen the success of including a new 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.310
 protagonist as January in the previous installment 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.670
 in this delivery there will also be a totally new protagonist of the one who 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.789
 I can only tell you at the moment that you will have white hair and a raincoat 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.680
 red 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.840
 I can also tell you that we have thought about many new features of which 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.450
 one of them was that the new weapons that you will find throughout the game 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.830
 they will not be included in it 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.610
 but that the moment arrived in the adventure 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.300
 you will be chosen between buying them in the bazaar xbox live as content 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.590
 additional to use them or on the contrary do not decide is to buy them so 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.030
 that the adventure will be even more difficult, which will mean a new experience 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.290
 for the players and that surely will like capcom has confirmed that the game 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.439
 will appear in early 2010 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.120
 let's hope they show a trailer about it in the next e3 of this year 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:29.829
 well I also have information that many fans have asked for the weak maerker 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.489
 and 4 but only with dante to what cap with responded with a game called 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.329
 devrim to iker and 4 dantÃ©s recombine 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.209
 well I do not know how true this shit is 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.439
 Finally until the next and I do not leave without first giving you a mention of the good ones 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.090
 the recontra sons of his fucking mother the probes 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.180
 according to which is dismissed 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.829
