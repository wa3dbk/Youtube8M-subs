00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.850
 these techniques so much our reaction 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.600
 after this albi match to play anyway 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.280
 we 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.720
 the first goal hurt us but a 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.270
 a lot of sleep we managed to come back 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.860
 in the party with a stunt 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.420
 after that it is true that we were 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.640
 we're tired we tried to give 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.140
 until the end but that's it 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.390
 however, what is important despite the beautiful 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.869
 penalty that swings towards holds after 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.500
 it's the experience here in front of the goal 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.820
 it does not give and mark but we have 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.909
 all given we made pleasure to 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.909
 spectators 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.770
 but it's up in the air of us 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.119
 this deal neither entrepreneurs seek 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.470
 the counters to zero while a 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.500
 qualification in pain facing the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.350
 payment what the analysis on this market 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.020
 well you have very well summarized 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.340
 qualification in pain 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.200
 I think we had started the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.770
 match we had opened the scoring and then 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.000
 then I think we lacked 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.560
 sobriety of rigor and then as I 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.049
 knew that demon's soul your team 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.729
 dynamic 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.770
 when I played I think they 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.880
 had to lose me 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.390
 jostled by year 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.950
 match after his first goal that's what 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.650
 I told my players to make a 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.540
 lack of marking at this level then 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.640
 that lenient treatment not practically 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.210
 previous 18 m so we relaunched the 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.400
 match and then my cinema I fight it 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.819
 misses a penalty 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.950
 we are not immune 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.130
 we 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.630
 a feat the opponent 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.590
 a well- constructed situation of 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.960
 the opponent and then after we scored 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.500
 manager and after we got back into 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.960
 the difficulty accordingly who to whom 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.030
 brought back clemenceau to 3 2 and then 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.570
 before scoring on a counter report 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.220
 to the contaminated we were less good in 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.540
 game that last week which took 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.090
 qualified while last week 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.700
 in the league 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.940
 the snake 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.150
 two situations and 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.860
 not marked 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.090
 we'll say any contract is filled even 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.420
 if I would have liked it to have been 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.530
 way in 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.440
 the 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.300
 so we alexandre head the coach of the 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.980
 clemenceau sees a loss 4-2 a 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.959
 unfortunately and like times you 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.860
 have believed today facing chasselay 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.660
 yeah we believed 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.770
 up to a quarter 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.850
 of end time and that second goal 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.260
 we cash but overall I 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.910
 am I am very satisfied with the 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.980
 performance of my players who have 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.740
 produced beautiful things tonight etc have 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.960
 competed at least 70 minutes with a 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.050
 team of four divisions that we 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.570
 was making four divisions so that's 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.730
 it really is really good and 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.010
 then chastel relaunch us in the match 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.240
 in the last seven minutes to 3.2 or 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.280
 we played our va-tout and then we 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.610
 take a back cons but it's not 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.230
 serious 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.459
 the most impressive is that either 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.170
 presented to had almost done 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.910
 equal with this team it's really 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.959
 over the last quarter of an hour that's it 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.450
 the difference is physically 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.010
 that saint light is logical me I 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.170
 am pleasantly surprised at the first 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.030
 half time of my players because in 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.590
 this in a similar context with a lot 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.270
 of world with known players in front 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.470
 it's a team of cfa we do not know 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.120
 how eire players 3 can 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.110
 react to face so I had a little bit 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.520
 fear of 2 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.770
 precisely that they are afraid to play and 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.670
 then I felt totally liberated and we 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.630
 saw really beautiful things tonight 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.360
 sidney govou so play chasing 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.580
 this win difficult to film and 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:34.610
 Clement are today out of France 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:36.140
 this line is superior it's a match 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.470
 who will still do good for the 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.670
 championship to do today on 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.860
 is not very excited in the league 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.800
 so if we can mobilize a more than 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.340
 Pretentious trust good end of first 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.340
 championship game
