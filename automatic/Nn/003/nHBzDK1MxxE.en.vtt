three will just be a simple video test
showing<00:00:37.090> their<00:00:37.239> capability<00:00:37.930> so<00:00:38.620> this<00:00:38.859> one<00:00:39.039> is

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
showing their capability so this one is

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.660 
showing their capability so this one is
the<00:00:39.579> S<00:00:39.820> 930<00:00:40.719> and<00:00:41.019> from<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.980> title<00:00:42.370> you<00:00:42.489> can

this one has a lot of interesting
features<00:00:48.309> in<00:00:48.429> it<00:00:48.550> that<00:00:48.730> I<00:00:48.760> haven't<00:00:49.359> actually

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
features in it that I haven't actually

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.810 
features in it that I haven't actually
used<00:00:49.780> in<00:00:50.289> a<00:00:50.440> point-and-shoot<00:00:50.980> or<00:00:51.219> any<00:00:51.399> camera

used in a point-and-shoot or any camera
before<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:53.079> one's<00:00:53.320> got<00:00:53.589> an<00:00:53.739> 18<00:00:54.219> x<00:00:54.579> oom<00:00:54.940> you

before this one's got an 18 x oom you

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.209 
before this one's got an 18 x oom you
know<00:00:55.629> pointing<00:00:56.079> tubes<00:00:56.289> tend<00:00:56.589> to<00:00:56.679> have<00:00:56.829> really

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
know pointing tubes tend to have really

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.160 
know pointing tubes tend to have really
big<00:00:57.339> zooms<00:00:57.640> but<00:00:57.910> 18<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.570> they<00:00:58.629> should<00:00:58.809> go<00:00:58.899> into

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
big zooms but 18 and they should go into

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.069 
big zooms but 18 and they should go into
the<00:00:59.289> hyper<00:00:59.530> zoom<00:00:59.890> range<00:01:00.159> is<00:01:00.609> quite<00:01:00.940> large<00:01:01.239> 16

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
the hyper zoom range is quite large 16

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
this one so let's open it up and have a

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.540 
this one so let's open it up and have a
look<00:01:17.680> inside<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:18.070> box<00:01:19.830> okay<00:01:20.830> so<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:21.100> start<00:01:21.400> off

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
look inside the box okay so to start off

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.730 
look inside the box okay so to start off
from<00:01:21.790> the<00:01:21.940> top<00:01:22.180> down<00:01:22.420> we've<00:01:23.200> got<00:01:23.500> the

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
from the top down we've got the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.600 
from the top down we've got the
reference<00:01:24.460> manual<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.930> book<00:01:26.860> which<00:01:27.250> is

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
reference manual the book which is

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.120 
reference manual the book which is
pretty<00:01:28.330> big<00:01:28.510> for<00:01:28.570> a<00:01:28.870> book<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:29.710> know<00:01:29.890> for<00:01:30.100> a

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
pretty big for a book you know for a

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.940 
pretty big for a book you know for a
camera<00:01:30.550> point-and-shoot<00:01:30.970> camera<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:32.680> as<00:01:32.800> I

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
camera point-and-shoot camera but as I

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.830 
camera point-and-shoot camera but as I
said<00:01:33.160> maybe<00:01:33.910> point-and-shoot<00:01:34.540> but<00:01:34.690> it's

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
said maybe point-and-shoot but it's

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.300 
said maybe point-and-shoot but it's
obviously<00:01:35.170> fought<00:01:35.440> quite<00:01:35.770> complex

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
obviously fought quite complex

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.250 
obviously fought quite complex
considering<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.180> amount<00:01:37.450> of<00:01:37.720> different

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
considering the amount of different

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.830 
considering the amount of different
features<00:01:38.650> it<00:01:38.800> has<00:01:38.950> built<00:01:39.250> into<00:01:39.430> this<00:01:39.670> one<00:01:39.880> then

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
features it has built into this one then

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.840 
features it has built into this one then
taking<00:01:41.230> a<00:01:41.290> look<00:01:41.410> in<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.650> front<00:01:41.890> these<00:01:42.580> things

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
taking a look in the front these things

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.610 
taking a look in the front these things
are<00:01:42.970> always<00:01:43.150> so<00:01:43.420> artfully<00:01:43.960> packed<00:01:44.290> I<00:01:44.440> can

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
are always so artfully packed I can

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.410 
are always so artfully packed I can
never<00:01:44.830> pack<00:01:45.100> them<00:01:45.280> properly<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.910> send<00:01:46.270> them

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
never pack them properly to send them

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.210 
never pack them properly to send them
back<00:01:46.920> okay

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
back okay

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.690 
back okay
so<00:01:48.580> it's<00:01:48.940> small<00:01:49.540> but<00:01:50.080> it's<00:01:50.710> got<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:51.100> decent

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
so it's small but it's got a decent

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.250 
so it's small but it's got a decent
amount<00:01:51.970> of<00:01:52.210> weight<00:01:52.360> in<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:52.660> I<00:01:52.690> really<00:01:52.990> like<00:01:53.110> the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
amount of weight in it I really like the

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.950 
amount of weight in it I really like the
feel<00:01:53.500> of<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.770> camera<00:01:54.160> else<00:01:55.120> of<00:01:55.510> course<00:01:55.570> we've

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
feel of the camera else of course we've

going to go through and set all the
features<00:02:37.970> but<00:02:39.160> okay<00:02:40.160> first<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.610> all<00:02:40.730> it's

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
features but okay first of all it's

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.650 
features but okay first of all it's
quite<00:02:42.200> responsive<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:44.030> know<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.270> time<00:02:44.480> it

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
quite responsive you know the time it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.070 
quite responsive you know the time it
takes<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.989> initially<00:02:45.769> turn<00:02:46.040> on<00:02:46.310> is<00:02:46.780> quite<00:02:47.780> good

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
takes to initially turn on is quite good

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.070 
takes to initially turn on is quite good
the<00:02:48.739> zoom<00:02:49.040> yeah<00:02:49.670> really<00:02:50.269> quite<00:02:50.510> good<00:02:50.720> list<00:02:50.870> but

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
the zoom yeah really quite good list but

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.960 
the zoom yeah really quite good list but
it<00:02:51.200> certainly<00:02:51.410> starts<00:02:52.220> up<00:02:52.370> very<00:02:52.610> quickly<00:02:52.850> and

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
it certainly starts up very quickly and

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.740 
it certainly starts up very quickly and
as<00:02:53.450> i<00:02:53.480> zoom<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:54.769> focus<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:55.760> picking<00:02:56.120> up<00:02:56.269> really

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
as i zoom the focus is picking up really

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.229 
as i zoom the focus is picking up really
quickly<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.769> zoom<00:02:58.010> range<00:02:58.220> on<00:02:58.489> this<00:02:58.670> is<00:02:58.850> really

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
quickly the zoom range on this is really

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.440 
quickly the zoom range on this is really
good<00:02:59.450> so<00:02:59.720> be<00:02:59.959> sure<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.200> show<00:03:00.590> some<00:03:01.040> examples<00:03:01.550> of

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
good so be sure to show some examples of

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.009 
good so be sure to show some examples of
it<00:03:02.480> at<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.739> long<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.280> short<00:03:04.340> end<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.900> this

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
it at the long and the short end so this

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.130 
it at the long and the short end so this
one's<00:03:06.260> got<00:03:06.380> HDMI<00:03:07.100> out<00:03:07.400> as<00:03:07.730> well<00:03:07.940> as<00:03:08.150> USB<00:03:08.870> and

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
one's got HDMI out as well as USB and

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.949 
one's got HDMI out as well as USB and
it's<00:03:09.980> got<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.250> nice<00:03:10.459> rubberized<00:03:11.000> texture<00:03:11.569> to<00:03:11.840> it

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
it's got a nice rubberized texture to it

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.840 
it's got a nice rubberized texture to it
there<00:03:12.200> won't<00:03:12.290> be<00:03:12.500> everyone's<00:03:12.980> preference<00:03:13.580> but

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
there won't be everyone's preference but

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.340 
there won't be everyone's preference but
it<00:03:14.150> does<00:03:14.420> feel<00:03:14.810> weighty

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
it does feel weighty

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.220 
it does feel weighty
and<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:16.580> rubberized<00:03:16.850> texture<00:03:17.329> whether<00:03:18.079> or

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
and the rubberized texture whether or

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.690 
and the rubberized texture whether or
not<00:03:18.320> it's<00:03:18.500> true<00:03:18.650> gives<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.190> feeling<00:03:19.430> that

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
not it's true gives the feeling that

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.729 
not it's true gives the feeling that
you're<00:03:19.820> not<00:03:19.850> so<00:03:20.120> likely<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.600> drop<00:03:20.780> it<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.110> on

using<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.170> flash<00:03:57.410> you<00:03:57.620> can<00:03:57.769> see<00:03:58.010> it's<00:03:58.220> totally

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
using the flash you can see it's totally

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.310 
using the flash you can see it's totally
black<00:03:59.060> and<00:03:59.299> out<00:03:59.420> of<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.540> background<00:03:59.780> that's<00:04:00.200> a

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
black and out of the background that's a

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.920 
black and out of the background that's a
really<00:04:00.590> fantastic<00:04:00.829> result<00:04:01.700> from<00:04:02.299> a<00:04:02.480> distance

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
really fantastic result from a distance

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.630 
really fantastic result from a distance
like<00:04:03.140> that<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.680> flash<00:04:03.950> must<00:04:04.190> be<00:04:04.370> quite

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
like that the flash must be quite

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.360 
like that the flash must be quite
powerful<00:04:04.910> and<00:04:05.420> check<00:04:06.260> out<00:04:06.440> that<00:04:06.470> blur<00:04:06.920> on<00:04:07.190> the

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
powerful and check out that blur on the

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.360 
powerful and check out that blur on the
zoom<00:04:07.579> shot<00:04:07.880> nose<00:04:08.560> okay<00:04:09.560> so<00:04:09.620> I've<00:04:09.859> got<00:04:09.890> some

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
zoom shot nose okay so I've got some

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.000 
zoom shot nose okay so I've got some
specs<00:04:10.760> to<00:04:11.000> run<00:04:11.180> through<00:04:11.420> here<00:04:11.660> for<00:04:11.959> you<00:04:12.140> as

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
specs to run through here for you as

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.670 
specs to run through here for you as
well<00:04:13.220> as<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.430> GPS<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:14.299> 3d<00:04:14.690> photo<00:04:15.019> shooting<00:04:15.560> as

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
well as the GPS and 3d photo shooting as

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.580 
well as the GPS and 3d photo shooting as
I<00:04:15.829> mentioned<00:04:16.310> it's<00:04:17.180> about<00:04:17.269> 60<00:04:17.720> million<00:04:17.959> pixels

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
I mentioned it's about 60 million pixels

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.149 
I mentioned it's about 60 million pixels
it's<00:04:19.310> got<00:04:19.729> a<00:04:21.370> 12.3<00:04:22.370> of<00:04:22.820> an<00:04:23.300> inch<00:04:23.590> CMOS<00:04:24.590> sensor

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159 
it's got a 12.3 of an inch CMOS sensor

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:27.040 
it's got a 12.3 of an inch CMOS sensor
so<00:04:25.430> one<00:04:25.640> over<00:04:25.750> 2.3

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
so one over 2.3

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.210 
so one over 2.3
18<00:04:27.830> times<00:04:28.099> nickle<00:04:28.639> 4.5<00:04:29.569> 281<00:04:30.169> mil<00:04:30.590> which<00:04:30.800> is<00:04:31.039> the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
18 times nickle 4.5 281 mil which is the

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.869 
18 times nickle 4.5 281 mil which is the
equivalent<00:04:31.789> of<00:04:32.199> 25<00:04:33.199> to<00:04:33.650> 450<00:04:34.280> which<00:04:34.430> is<00:04:34.580> just<00:04:34.789> a

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:34.879 
equivalent of 25 to 450 which is just a

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.379 
equivalent of 25 to 450 which is just a
huge<00:04:35.240> range<00:04:35.539> 3.5<00:04:36.379> to<00:04:36.560> 5.9<00:04:37.159> closest<00:04:37.849> focus

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
huge range 3.5 to 5.9 closest focus

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.559 
huge range 3.5 to 5.9 closest focus
range<00:04:38.599> is<00:04:39.080> from<00:04:39.379> 50<00:04:40.250> centimeters<00:04:40.970> but<00:04:41.240> it<00:04:41.389> has

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569 
range is from 50 centimeters but it has

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.839 
range is from 50 centimeters but it has
a<00:04:41.599> macro<00:04:42.139> mode<00:04:42.409> that<00:04:43.069> will<00:04:43.220> let<00:04:43.340> you<00:04:43.490> go<00:04:43.639> all

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
a macro mode that will let you go all

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
allow it to go they reckon it gets about

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.300 
allow it to go they reckon it gets about
200<00:05:21.440> shots<00:05:21.469> with<00:05:21.889> that<00:05:22.069> ena<00:05:22.550> yell<00:05:22.819> 12<00:05:23.810> and<00:05:24.310> it

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
200 shots with that ena yell 12 and it

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.490 
200 shots with that ena yell 12 and it
despite<00:05:26.060> you<00:05:26.389> know<00:05:26.419> I<00:05:26.539> feel<00:05:26.930> like<00:05:27.289> that's

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
despite you know I feel like that's

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.520 
despite you know I feel like that's
fairly<00:05:27.830> not<00:05:28.430> chunky<00:05:28.699> but<00:05:29.349> reasonably<00:05:30.349> well

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
fairly not chunky but reasonably well

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.640 
fairly not chunky but reasonably well
weighted<00:05:30.979> it's<00:05:31.460> a<00:05:31.789> nice<00:05:32.300> and<00:05:32.539> light<00:05:32.659> 215<00:05:33.620> grams

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
weighted it's a nice and light 215 grams

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.850 
weighted it's a nice and light 215 grams
of<00:05:34.219> course<00:05:34.490> for<00:05:35.319> point-and-shoot<00:05:36.319> maybe<00:05:36.650> that

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
of course for point-and-shoot maybe that

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.219 
of course for point-and-shoot maybe that
isn't<00:05:37.009> as<00:05:37.280> light<00:05:37.520> as<00:05:37.729> some<00:05:37.940> of<00:05:38.090> them<00:05:38.240> so<00:05:38.930> anyway

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
isn't as light as some of them so anyway

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.959 
isn't as light as some of them so anyway
I'm<00:05:39.919> really<00:05:40.250> looking<00:05:40.490> forward<00:05:40.699> to<00:05:40.789> getting

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:40.969 
I'm really looking forward to getting

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:42.189 
I'm really looking forward to getting
out<00:05:41.090> and<00:05:41.270> playing<00:05:41.479> with<00:05:41.659> this<00:05:41.750> one<00:05:41.960> learning

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
out and playing with this one learning

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:45.070 
out and playing with this one learning
about<00:05:42.529> the<00:05:42.770> 3d<00:05:43.159> photo<00:05:43.490> features<00:05:44.090> and<00:05:44.270> I'm

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
about the 3d photo features and I'm

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.709 
about the 3d photo features and I'm
surprised<00:05:45.560> by<00:05:45.830> some<00:05:46.250> of<00:05:46.370> the<00:05:46.520> bokeh<00:05:47.360> it<00:05:47.509> can

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:47.719 
surprised by some of the bokeh it can

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.230 
surprised by some of the bokeh it can
create<00:05:48.110> on<00:05:48.440> that<00:05:48.710> one<00:05:48.889> sample<00:05:49.219> shot<00:05:49.580> I<00:05:49.610> tested

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
create on that one sample shot I tested

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.559 
create on that one sample shot I tested
so<00:05:50.840> yeah<00:05:51.229> in<00:05:51.469> part<00:05:52.099> 2<00:05:52.340> I'll<00:05:52.849> have<00:05:53.029> lots<00:05:53.240> of<00:05:53.360> test

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 
so yeah in part 2 I'll have lots of test

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:55.930 
so yeah in part 2 I'll have lots of test
shots<00:05:53.659> and<00:05:54.080> hands<00:05:54.409> on<00:05:54.529> experience<00:05:54.580> to<00:05:55.580> share

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
shots and hands on experience to share

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.580 
shots and hands on experience to share
with<00:05:56.120> you<00:05:56.270> before<00:05:56.389> I<00:05:56.599> return<00:05:56.990> it<00:05:57.139> to<00:05:57.259> nakhon

with you before I return it to nakhon

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.519
