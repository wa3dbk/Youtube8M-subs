00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
Elite v2 but I heard it was really

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.410 
Elite v2 but I heard it was really
really<00:00:29.039> good<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.279> did<00:00:29.550> play<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> demo<00:00:30.060> for<00:00:30.390> that

I<00:00:30.840> thought<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.710> was<00:00:31.800> alright<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.219> didn't<00:00:32.640> think

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
I thought it was alright I didn't think

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.580

it<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> best<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.510> thought<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> combat<00:00:34.290> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
it was the best I thought the combat and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.290 
it was the best I thought the combat and
the<00:00:34.680> gameplay<00:00:35.070> overall<00:00:35.730> was<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> little<00:00:36.180> bit

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
the gameplay overall was a little bit

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.780 
the gameplay overall was a little bit
clunky<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:37.100> you<00:00:38.100> know<00:00:38.219> like<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.460> said<00:00:38.640> I've

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
clunky but you know like I said I've

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.229 
clunky but you know like I said I've
never<00:00:38.879> really<00:00:39.180> gotten<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.649> game

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
it's probably like aluminum just because

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.209 
it's probably like aluminum just because
it's<00:04:22.409> very<00:04:23.300> light<00:04:24.300> but<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.289> here<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.800> is<00:04:25.890> sniper

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:26.219

do have my PlayStation 4 on and that's

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:34.369 
do have my PlayStation 4 on and that's
probably<00:04:33.210> like<00:04:33.449> the<00:04:33.629> blue<00:04:33.840> light<00:04:34.110> you<00:04:34.139> guys

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:34.379 
probably like the blue light you guys

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.180 
probably like the blue light you guys
can<00:04:34.620> see<00:04:34.800> there<00:04:35.009> but<00:04:35.879> that's<00:04:36.860> not<00:04:37.860> wanting<00:04:38.159> to

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
can see there but that's not wanting to

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.830 
can see there but that's not wanting to
focus<00:04:38.610> but<00:04:38.819> yeah<00:04:39.000> it<00:04:39.090> does<00:04:39.270> say<00:04:39.449> Sniper<00:04:39.750> Elite

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840

focus but yeah it does say Sniper Elite
3<00:04:40.050> right<00:04:40.470> there<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:40.919> it's<00:04:41.550> just<00:04:41.759> like<00:04:41.909> a<00:04:41.940> laser

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
3 right there and it's just like a laser

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.659 
3 right there and it's just like a laser
pointer<00:04:42.690> I<00:04:42.900> guess<00:04:43.229> so<00:04:44.099> that's<00:04:44.280> pretty<00:04:44.430> cool

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
pointer I guess so that's pretty cool

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.480 
pointer I guess so that's pretty cool
that's<00:04:45.360> that<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:46.080> bullet<00:04:46.650> pointer<00:04:46.979> pen<00:04:47.190> let's

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
that's that the bullet pointer pen let's

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.869 
that's that the bullet pointer pen let's
see<00:04:47.610> if<00:04:47.729> we<00:04:47.849> can<00:04:48.030> focus<00:04:48.870> in<00:04:49.139> one<00:04:49.379> more<00:04:49.560> time

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:49.879 
see if we can focus in one more time

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:54.230 
see if we can focus in one more time
probably<00:04:50.879> not<00:04:52.129> not<00:04:53.129> even<00:04:53.490> going<00:04:53.639> to<00:04:53.669> try<00:04:53.849> there

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
probably not not even going to try there

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.379 
probably not not even going to try there
we<00:04:54.419> go<00:04:54.599> finally<00:04:55.259> Sniper<00:04:55.590> Elite<00:04:55.740> 3<00:04:56.389> Africa
