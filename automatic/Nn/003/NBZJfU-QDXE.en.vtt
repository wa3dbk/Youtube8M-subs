package didn't come with and you can

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.230 
package didn't come with and you can
connect<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.830> wire<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.730> had<00:00:23.910> really

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
connect the wire so it had really

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.519 
connect the wire so it had really
shortened<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.750> wire<00:00:25.050> here<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:26.609> engage<00:00:27.029> these

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
shortened this wire here to engage these

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.490 
shortened this wire here to engage these
you<00:00:28.529> brakes<00:00:29.179> and<00:00:32.329> basically<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.780> comes<00:00:34.110> really

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
you brakes and basically it comes really

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.110 
you brakes and basically it comes really
close<00:00:36.110> when<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.250> kindly<00:00:38.250> engage<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.940> look

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
close when you kindly engage this look

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.630 
close when you kindly engage this look
how<00:00:39.239> close<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.960> right<00:00:40.200> there<00:00:40.640> that's

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
how close that is right there that's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.000 
how close that is right there that's
really<00:00:42.360> close<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.440> doesn't<00:00:43.739> get<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
really close but it doesn't get in the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.700 
really close but it doesn't get in the
way<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.670> plus<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.870> don't<00:00:46.020> really<00:00:46.170> pedal<00:00:46.530> when<00:00:46.680> I

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
way so plus I don't really pedal when I

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.040 
way so plus I don't really pedal when I
break<00:00:46.920> alright<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.149> let's<00:00:48.329> go<00:00:48.450> through<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.870> I

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
this bike is these you brakes that it's

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.850 
this bike is these you brakes that it's
like<00:02:05.119> when<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.149> was<00:02:06.299> installing<00:02:06.780> them<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.680> had

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
like when I was installing them you had

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.650 
like when I was installing them you had
to<00:02:07.979> make<00:02:08.280> sure<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.819> really<00:02:09.239> short<00:02:09.569> this

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
to make sure this is really short this

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.589 
to make sure this is really short this
cable<00:02:10.170> line<00:02:10.349> and

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
cable line and

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.990 
cable line and
I'm<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.319> glad<00:02:13.469> this<00:02:13.890> regional<00:02:14.430> part<00:02:14.700> worked

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
I'm just glad this regional part worked

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.929 
I'm just glad this regional part worked
so<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.930> seems<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.739> hold<00:02:16.890> well<00:02:17.159> but<00:02:17.549> you<00:02:17.730> have<00:02:17.760> to

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
so it seems to hold well but you have to

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.330 
so it seems to hold well but you have to
be<00:02:18.000> very<00:02:18.269> careful<00:02:18.840> when<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.650> pull<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.040> crank

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
be very careful when you pull this crank

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.599 
be very careful when you pull this crank
on<00:02:20.549> you<00:02:20.730> don't<00:02:20.879> want<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.120> have<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.359> rub<00:02:21.569> here<00:02:21.870> so
