it<00:02:43.880> has<00:02:44.060> just<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.680> turn<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:47.630> dirt<00:02:47.950> front<00:02:48.950> top

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
it has just to to turn to dirt front top

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.620 
it has just to to turn to dirt front top
bottom<00:02:50.300> ok<00:02:51.260> not<00:02:51.830> too<00:02:52.130> interesting<00:02:52.640> more

interesting<00:02:53.660> is<00:02:54.410> here<00:02:54.710> the<00:02:55.400> placement<00:02:55.910> of

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
interesting is here the placement of

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.660 
interesting is here the placement of
stairs<00:02:56.800> generally<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:57.830> think<00:02:57.980> there's<00:02:58.430> the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
stairs generally I think there's the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.360 
stairs generally I think there's the
rule<00:02:58.850> that<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.390> turtle<00:02:59.810> tries<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.440> place<00:03:00.800> new

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370

rule that the turtle tries to place new
blocks<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:02.870> they<00:03:03.170> are<00:03:03.200> fitting<00:03:03.980> on

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
blocks in this scenario this means only

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.240 
blocks in this scenario this means only
the<00:03:10.790> term<00:03:11.150> itself<00:03:11.540> is<00:03:11.810> here<00:03:12.050> as<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.170> bloc<00:03:12.470> s

so<00:03:26.540> here<00:03:26.810> it's<00:03:27.050> just<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.710> turtle

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
so here it's just the turtle

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.330 
so here it's just the turtle
although<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.270> this<00:03:31.260> means<00:03:31.530> those<00:03:31.920> three

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
although and this means those three

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.180 
although and this means those three
stairs<00:03:32.700> have<00:03:33.000> placed<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:34.050> they<00:03:34.350> are<00:03:34.560> facing

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
stairs have placed that they are facing

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.690 
stairs have placed that they are facing
or<00:03:35.400> touching<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.540> turtle<00:03:37.280> this<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.430> different

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
or touching the turtle this is different

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.860 
or touching the turtle this is different
if<00:03:39.390> we<00:03:39.570> have<00:03:40.430> blocks<00:03:41.430> at<00:03:41.970> those<00:03:42.390> three

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
if we have blocks at those three

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.820 
if we have blocks at those three
positions<00:03:43.530> on<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.700> green<00:03:44.910> ghoul<00:03:45.150> then<00:03:45.960> the

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
positions on the green ghoul then the

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.540 
positions on the green ghoul then the
stairs<00:03:47.160> are<00:03:47.340> put<00:03:47.640> other<00:03:48.180> way<00:03:48.450> around<00:03:48.750> now<00:03:49.550> are

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
stairs are put other way around now are

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.260 
stairs are put other way around now are
facing<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.210> green<00:03:51.870> ghoul<00:03:52.730> here<00:03:53.730> near<00:03:54.090> you

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
facing the green ghoul here near you

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.980 
facing the green ghoul here near you
it<00:03:55.780> was<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.320> turtle<00:03:57.150> there's<00:03:58.150> one<00:03:58.510> more<00:03:58.720> block

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
it was the turtle there's one more block

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.110 
it was the turtle there's one more block
which<00:03:59.290> is<00:03:59.320> checked<00:03:59.740> for<00:04:00.160> for<00:04:00.400> placement<00:04:00.880> and

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
which is checked for for placement and

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.830 
which is checked for for placement and
this<00:04:01.930> is<00:04:02.050> this<00:04:02.560> one<00:04:02.770> down<00:04:02.980> here<00:04:03.040> if<00:04:03.970> here<00:04:04.690> is<00:04:04.810> a

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
this is this one down here if here is a

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.670 
this is this one down here if here is a
block<00:04:05.110> and<00:04:05.920> also<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:07.000> stair<00:04:07.270> is<00:04:07.420> put<00:04:08.170> in<00:04:08.350> this

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
block and also the stair is put in this

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.500 
block and also the stair is put in this
way<00:04:09.010> like<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.120> is<00:04:10.480> done<00:04:10.720> here<00:04:11.850> so<00:04:12.850> this<00:04:13.090> is<00:04:13.120> for

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
way like it is done here so this is for

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.170 
way like it is done here so this is for
the<00:04:13.540> stairs<00:04:14.080> then<00:04:15.070> let's<00:04:15.460> have<00:04:15.580> a<00:04:15.640> look<00:04:15.820> on<00:04:16.030> the

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
the stairs then let's have a look on the

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.930 
the stairs then let's have a look on the
slaps<00:04:16.570> slaps<00:04:17.170> without<00:04:17.770> any<00:04:17.980> other<00:04:18.220> blocks<00:04:18.520> are

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
slaps slaps without any other blocks are

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.640 
slaps slaps without any other blocks are
placed<00:04:19.510> in<00:04:19.959> this<00:04:20.380> way<00:04:21.600> maybe<00:04:22.600> you<00:04:22.780> guessed<00:04:23.500> it

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
placed in this way maybe you guessed it

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.000 
placed in this way maybe you guessed it
the<00:04:23.890> upper<00:04:24.700> slap<00:04:24.970> is<00:04:25.240> put<00:04:25.930> touching<00:04:26.800> the

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
the upper slap is put touching the

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.500 
the upper slap is put touching the
turtle<00:04:27.400> lower<00:04:27.820> as<00:04:28.180> well<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:29.560> upper<00:04:29.800> half<00:04:30.510> the

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
turtle lower as well the upper half the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.390 
turtle lower as well the upper half the
slab<00:04:31.720> which<00:04:32.140> is<00:04:32.350> put<00:04:32.590> in<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.860> front<00:04:33.160> of<00:04:33.280> the

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
slab which is put in the front of the

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
slab which is put in the front of the
turtle<00:04:33.790> is<00:04:33.940> put<00:04:34.210> on<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.540> lower<00:04:35.050> half<00:04:36.420> what

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
turtle is put on the lower half what

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.020 
turtle is put on the lower half what
changes<00:04:37.930> if<00:04:38.260> we<00:04:38.590> have<00:04:38.680> got<00:04:38.890> blocks<00:04:39.400> already

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
changes if we have got blocks already

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.860 
changes if we have got blocks already
existing<00:04:42.330> then<00:04:43.560> well<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.830> green<00:04:45.100> blocks

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
existing then well the green blocks

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.430 
existing then well the green blocks
makes<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:47.020> difference<00:04:48.450> this<00:04:49.450> one<00:04:49.660> is<00:04:49.780> then<00:04:50.050> the

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
makes a difference this one is then the

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.770 
makes a difference this one is then the
slaps<00:04:51.070> are<00:04:51.280> now<00:04:51.580> touching<00:04:51.970> their<00:04:52.360> the<00:04:52.510> green

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
slaps are now touching their the green

placing slaps front of the turtle

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.840 
placing slaps front of the turtle
