00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 good 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.290
 Hi, I'm Fernando MuÃ±oz and in this 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.000
 tutorial I'll show you how to do 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.880
 this is custom for a cube 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.469
 of 3 x 3 good in the description of 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.080
 video is the link to download the 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.180
 template that I will be using that 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.330
 you already have the boxes marked for a 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.090
 normal size cube 3 x 3 so 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.050
 well we proceed to open the template in 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.900
 an image editor 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.050
 along with six images that are what 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.870
 let's use for each of the faces 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.649
 what we are going to do is accommodate the and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.230
 then putting them behind the image at 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.210
 be the transparent template for 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.940
 the cuts are visible 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.850
 sorry the cutting lines and this 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.300
 way we are going to be able to cut them from 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.670
 suitable size once printed 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.410
 on paper, derive it from vinyl or 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.600
 material that we have decided to use 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.260
 for this since we have the images 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:06.140
 accommodated as we need we are going to 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.140
 save the document as an image 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.550
 and proceed with the next step 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.920
 and well now we open power point and what 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.300
 what we are going to do is import the image 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.580
 that we already edited and saved 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.930
 and the image will rotate this 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.290
 way 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.030
 we see that there is space left for 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.990
 and put it 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.880
 again or print 2 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.880
 sets of different stickers 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.310
 this importing the power point is just 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.520
 to make sure that when it comes to 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.020
 print the size is correct and not 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.179
 they are bigger and smaller 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.399
 and good to finish we're going to 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:00.310
 print on paper of another adherible 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.250
 vinyl or any other material that is 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.229
 can adhere to the cube in the event that 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.410
 print them on paper and I recommend using 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.750
 plastic self-adhesive on top or varnish 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.299
 of nails like Gabrielle ever 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.190
 recommended in order to protect him because 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.099
 After all is paper and is very 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.160
 fragile and then you can not use both 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.720
 cube that would be all thanks for watching and 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.340
 I remind you that in the description of 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.849
 video is the link to download the 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.849
 template
