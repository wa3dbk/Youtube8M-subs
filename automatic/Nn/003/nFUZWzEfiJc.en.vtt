miracle neither win he really needs to
get<00:01:48.270> some<00:01:48.299> lurkers<00:01:48.750> out<00:01:48.899> perhaps<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:50.159> some

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
get some lurkers out perhaps and do some

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.580 
get some lurkers out perhaps and do some
kind<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.670> crazy<00:01:51.360> move<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.720> mean<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.930> guess<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.560> of

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
kind of crazy move I mean I guess one of

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.960 
kind of crazy move I mean I guess one of
the<00:01:52.740> things<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.040> could<00:01:53.189> turn<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.520> game<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.820> if

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
the things I could turn the game is if

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.580 
the things I could turn the game is if
he<00:01:54.060> destroys<00:01:54.240> all<00:01:54.810> those<00:01:55.020> medical<00:01:55.290> means<00:01:55.470> was

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
he destroys all those medical means was

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.889 
he destroys all those medical means was
with<00:01:56.280> hold<00:01:56.490> position<00:01:57.180> lurkers<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.659> something

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
with hold position lurkers or something

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.050 
with hold position lurkers or something
like<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.020> stop<00:01:58.409> lurkers<00:01:58.829> or<00:01:59.670> if<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.850> manage

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
like that stop lurkers or if you manage

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.060 
like that stop lurkers or if you manage
to<00:02:00.090> pop<00:02:00.360> some<00:02:00.540> amazing<00:02:01.020> mule<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.590> crass<00:02:01.890> but

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
to pop some amazing mule is crass but

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.990 
to pop some amazing mule is crass but
really<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.340> don't<00:02:02.549> think<00:02:02.670> anything<00:02:02.969> is

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
really I don't think anything is

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.490 
really I don't think anything is

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
expansions around the map and now he's

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.369 
expansions around the map and now he's
trying<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.459> pop<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.330> expansion<00:02:09.810> again<00:02:10.259> at

Scouts well and I do believe he is

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.340 
Scouts well and I do believe he is
a quite<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.370> good<00:02:14.640> quite<00:02:15.390> good<00:02:15.420> on<00:02:15.600> his<00:02:15.900> recon

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
a quite a good quite good on his recon

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.510 
a quite a good quite good on his recon
he<00:02:16.590> will<00:02:16.710> be<00:02:16.800> able<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> spot<00:02:17.130> them<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.430> just

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
he will be able to spot them and just

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.890 
he will be able to spot them and just
eliminate<00:02:18.030> them<00:02:18.180> one<00:02:18.210> I'm<00:02:18.390> white<00:02:18.540> one<00:02:18.720> because

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
eliminate them one I'm white one because

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.570 
eliminate them one I'm white one because
uh<00:02:19.080> she<00:02:19.590> just<00:02:19.740> really<00:02:20.040> doesn't<00:02:20.160> have<00:02:20.340> much<00:02:20.400> of

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
uh she just really doesn't have much of

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.850 
uh she just really doesn't have much of
an<00:02:20.760> army<00:02:21.000> right<00:02:21.150> now<00:02:21.300> he's<00:02:22.290> actually<00:02:22.470> choosing

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
an army right now he's actually choosing

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.310 
an army right now he's actually choosing
to<00:02:22.950> get<00:02:23.070> musics<00:02:23.520> first<00:02:23.730> perhaps<00:02:24.630> now<00:02:24.990> that<00:02:25.020> he

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
to get musics first perhaps now that he

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.630 
to get musics first perhaps now that he
doesn't<00:02:25.530> have<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.680> protect<00:02:26.010> his<00:02:26.190> six-month

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
expansion because was killed newest yeah

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.680

he<00:02:29.730> didn't<00:02:29.940> need<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.090> build<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.390> lurkers

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
he didn't need to build the lurkers

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.330 
he didn't need to build the lurkers
first<00:02:30.900> actually<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.410> was<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.680> smart<00:02:31.860> move<00:02:32.040> not

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
first actually that was a smart move not

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.430 
first actually that was a smart move not
to<00:02:32.820> go<00:02:32.940> for<00:02:33.120> lurkers<00:02:33.390> because<00:02:33.690> lurkers<00:02:34.200> are<00:02:34.410> a

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
to go for lurkers because lurkers are a

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:14.819 
this is too little too late i really

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:16.339 
this is too little too late i really
like<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.060> fact<00:05:15.210> that<00:05:15.360> my<00:05:15.630> did<00:05:15.930> go<00:05:16.110> for<00:05:16.259> that

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
like the fact that my did go for that

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.170 
like the fact that my did go for that
dropship<00:05:16.800> lot<00:05:17.190> of<00:05:17.280> turns<00:05:17.460> do<00:05:17.669> not<00:05:17.849> go<00:05:18.000> four

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
dropship lot of turns do not go four

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.270 
dropship lot of turns do not go four
dropships<00:05:18.409> against<00:05:19.409> zerg<00:05:19.590> players<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.130> I

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
dropships against zerg players and I

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.860 
dropships against zerg players and I
feel<00:05:20.430> that<00:05:20.550> it's<00:05:20.729> a<00:05:20.819> big<00:05:21.060> loss<00:05:21.300> in<00:05:21.599> mobility

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
feel that it's a big loss in mobility

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.110 
feel that it's a big loss in mobility
and<00:05:22.259> in<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:23.039> element<00:05:23.400> of<00:05:23.430> surprise<00:05:23.490> like<00:05:23.970> in

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
and in the element of surprise like in

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.120 
and in the element of surprise like in
is<00:05:24.780> in<00:05:24.930> this<00:05:25.050> drop<00:05:25.319> right<00:05:25.530> now<00:05:25.650> was<00:05:25.830> just<00:05:26.039> a

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
is in this drop right now was just a

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.430 
is in this drop right now was just a
very<00:05:26.310> well<00:05:26.819> time<00:05:27.060> to<00:05:27.240> drop<00:05:27.449> even<00:05:28.080> if<00:05:28.199> the<00:05:28.289> game

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
very well time to drop even if the game

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.740 
very well time to drop even if the game
had<00:05:28.470> been<00:05:28.650> closer<00:05:29.009> right<00:05:29.280> now<00:05:29.430> say<00:05:30.270> that<00:05:30.449> mine

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
had been closer right now say that mine

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.839 
had been closer right now say that mine
hadn't<00:05:31.440> destroyed<00:05:31.770> GG<00:05:32.070> plays<00:05:32.250> second

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
hadn't destroyed GG plays second

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:34.370 
hadn't destroyed GG plays second
expansion<00:05:33.090> this<00:05:33.690> drop<00:05:33.930> would<00:05:34.110> have<00:05:34.199> turned

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
expansion this drop would have turned

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.659 
expansion this drop would have turned
the<00:05:34.500> tables<00:05:34.800> around<00:05:34.889> I<00:05:35.099> feel<00:05:35.219> and<00:05:35.430> looks<00:05:35.580> like

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
the tables around I feel and looks like

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.399 
the tables around I feel and looks like
mine's<00:05:36.240> going<00:05:36.509> for<00:05:36.690> another<00:05:36.810> drop<00:05:37.110> here<00:05:37.289> in

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
mine's going for another drop here in

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:38.899 
mine's going for another drop here in
the<00:05:37.469> main<00:05:37.590> I<00:05:37.740> really<00:05:38.250> like<00:05:38.370> mines<00:05:38.580> play<00:05:38.789> in

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
the main I really like mines play in

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.760 
the main I really like mines play in
this<00:05:39.000> game<00:05:39.150> she<00:05:39.810> plays<00:05:40.050> just<00:05:40.199> looking<00:05:40.469> glum

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
this game she plays just looking glum

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.260 
this game she plays just looking glum
Lee<00:05:40.919> and<00:05:41.099> looks<00:05:41.310> like<00:05:41.430> I'm<00:05:41.550> actually<00:05:41.759> it<00:05:41.940> was<00:05:42.240> a

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
Lee and looks like I'm actually it was a

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.080 
Lee and looks like I'm actually it was a
drop<00:05:42.509> at<00:05:42.719> the<00:05:42.870> natural<00:05:43.800> expansion<00:05:44.009> I<00:05:44.280> think<00:05:44.520> or

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
drop at the natural expansion I think or

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.249 
drop at the natural expansion I think or
perhaps<00:05:45.419> it<00:05:45.630> was<00:05:45.690> in<00:05:45.780> the<00:05:45.840> main<00:05:45.960> I'm<00:05:46.050> not<00:05:46.169> sure

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
perhaps it was in the main I'm not sure

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:48.649 
perhaps it was in the main I'm not sure
exactly<00:05:46.650> where<00:05:46.830> it<00:05:46.889> was<00:05:46.949> but<00:05:47.490> I<00:05:47.550> really<00:05:47.940> yeah

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
it was actually one the expansions um

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.350 
it was actually one the expansions um
really<00:05:50.550> at<00:05:50.669> this<00:05:50.759> point<00:05:50.849> it<00:05:51.090> really<00:05:51.120> doesn't

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
really at this point it really doesn't

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.399 
really at this point it really doesn't

meanwhile<00:06:05.520> GG<00:06:05.880> play<00:06:06.030> bringing<00:06:06.449> up<00:06:06.539> for

meanwhile GG play bringing up for
lurkers<00:06:07.319> to<00:06:07.469> try<00:06:08.039> to<00:06:08.099> break<00:06:08.400> through<00:06:08.639> the

lurkers to try to break through the

lurkers to try to break through the
metric<00:06:09.599> expansion<00:06:09.690> here<00:06:09.960> but<00:06:10.080> that's

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
metric expansion here but that's

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.749 
metric expansion here but that's
definitely<00:06:10.500> not<00:06:10.770> giving<00:06:10.979> enough<00:06:11.039> against<00:06:11.400> a

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
definitely not giving enough against a

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.330 
definitely not giving enough against a
bunker<00:06:12.389> and<00:06:12.690> and<00:06:13.020> marines<00:06:13.740> up<00:06:13.979> there<00:06:14.159> and

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
looks like them the Marines are just

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.270 
looks like them the Marines are just
executing<00:06:16.319> these<00:06:16.380> drones<00:06:16.650> as<00:06:16.800> deep<00:06:16.949> as<00:06:17.099> the
