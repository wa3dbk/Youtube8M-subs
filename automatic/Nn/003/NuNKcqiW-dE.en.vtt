00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.659
 already then where you are yellow rose 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.620
 I ask to lose weight but I left 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.860
 great ladies and gentlemen welcome in 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.510
 a new fashion for 1.7 point 10 this 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.430
 here and there trésor mode as I like it 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.570
 fuck what the wife should do 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.310
 he was not 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.050
 change the generation of the world e 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.789
 makes it a little more interesting a 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.740
 a little more adventurous because in fact 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.800
 you will find around the world of 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.420
 structures including this one here is one of the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.720
 are basically the remains 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.270
 of someone this man is dead and there 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.030
 they left a basket binger gentlemen 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.079
 inside there is a good loot but things don't 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.050
 they ended up here 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.760
 in fact this type of provision 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.579
 of the skeleton could indicate that 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.289
 below is the hideout you see that not 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.539
 there is the party like before that is the 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:59.170
 hiding a basket be careful 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:01.750
 because you always have to fear the worst 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:08.140
 let us arm ourselves with torches look at us 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:10.210
 let's go down this sand carefully 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.430
 as you can see here we have a mock 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.320
 stoner of skeletons then caspiterina 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.189
 if we threw ourselves down they broke the 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.040
 ass and here we have the treasure e 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.840
 look at the good things of God 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.210
 rexton iron stuff in diamond stuff 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.659
 obsidian a diamond a truncated staircase e 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.060
 which is a key pull of the gift tnt is 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.880
 very cool but there are other structures 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.189
 this time in fact it generates in the world a 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.890
 nice bit of facilities that all have a 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.530
 what to do with the adventurous succeeding in 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.369
 enter inside maybe we'll be worthy 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.070
 of a treasure 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.460
 but we must be careful because 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.219
 probably these places hide 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.399
 pitfalls 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:57.850
 here is a bob spooner we have gentlemen 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.670

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.860
 you can't open it unless we have it 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.990
 of the keys the big keys can 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.119
 fortunately we have the craft 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.390

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:14.620

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.240
