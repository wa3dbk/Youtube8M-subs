so<00:06:38.130> here's<00:06:38.460> a<00:06:38.520> final<00:06:38.700> result<00:06:39.060> that<00:06:39.990> Baltimore

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
so here's a final result that Baltimore

gal<00:06:40.620> lactose-free<00:06:41.310> rice<00:06:41.910> pudding<00:06:42.360> so<00:06:43.110> I<00:06:43.140> have

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
gal lactose-free rice pudding so I have

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.880 
gal lactose-free rice pudding so I have
the<00:06:43.530> original<00:06:43.860> right<00:06:44.730> over<00:06:44.910> there

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:45.890 
the original right over there

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:51.950 
the original right over there
so<00:06:46.890> it<00:06:47.460> has<00:06:47.720> 160<00:06:48.720> grams<00:06:49.050> of<00:06:49.350> carbs<00:06:50.360> 17<00:06:51.360> gram<00:06:51.630> of

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
so it has 160 grams of carbs 17 gram of

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.140 
so it has 160 grams of carbs 17 gram of
protein<00:06:53.240> 26<00:06:54.240> of<00:06:54.420> fat<00:06:54.810> and<00:06:55.290> in<00:06:56.130> those<00:06:56.340> 1c<00:06:56.820> of

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.150 
protein 26 of fat and in those 1c of

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.630 
protein 26 of fat and in those 1c of
carbs<00:06:57.480> there<00:06:57.660> is<00:06:57.780> 85<00:06:58.260> of<00:06:58.470> sugar<00:06:58.680> so<00:06:59.280> I<00:06:59.310> guess

00:06:59.630 --> 00:06:59.640 
carbs there is 85 of sugar so I guess

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.880 
carbs there is 85 of sugar so I guess
you<00:06:59.790> can<00:06:59.880> have<00:06:59.910> like<00:07:00.150> two<00:07:00.330> portions<00:07:00.810> in<00:07:01.110> that

calories and you can reduce sugar by

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.050 
calories and you can reduce sugar by
having<00:07:13.230> less<00:07:13.410> money<00:07:13.650> and<00:07:13.980> more<00:07:14.160> sweeteners<00:07:14.730> or
