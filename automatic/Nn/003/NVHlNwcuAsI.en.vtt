double<00:00:10.809> decks<00:00:10.990> in<00:00:11.410> London<00:00:11.769> is<00:00:11.980> a<00:00:12.010> very

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519 
double decks in London is a very

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.790 
double decks in London is a very
important<00:00:13.030> thing<00:00:13.210> for<00:00:13.389> us<00:00:13.450> to<00:00:13.570> do<00:00:13.809> following

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:14.800 
important thing for us to do following

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.339 
important thing for us to do following
from<00:00:14.980> our<00:00:15.370> launch<00:00:15.580> is<00:00:15.790> across<00:00:16.090> Europe<00:00:16.509> also<00:00:17.079> to

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:17.349 
from our launch is across Europe also to

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.979 
from our launch is across Europe also to
launch<00:00:17.529> in<00:00:17.800> in<00:00:18.039> London<00:00:18.279> City<00:00:18.720> with<00:00:19.720> the<00:00:19.839> red

00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:19.989 
launch in in London City with the red

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.019 
launch in in London City with the red
double<00:00:20.470> decks<00:00:20.650> as<00:00:20.980> really<00:00:21.310> an<00:00:21.369> icon<00:00:21.730> for<00:00:21.909> us

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
double decks as really an icon for us

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.239 
double decks as really an icon for us
and<00:00:22.269> a<00:00:22.359> very<00:00:22.390> important<00:00:23.079> step<00:00:23.289> in<00:00:23.890> the<00:00:24.009> launch

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:24.249 
and a very important step in the launch

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.399 
and a very important step in the launch
of<00:00:24.369> our<00:00:24.460> hybrid<00:00:24.909> technology<00:00:25.449> when<00:00:26.079> you<00:00:26.109> look

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:26.409 
of our hybrid technology when you look

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.439 
of our hybrid technology when you look
at<00:00:26.560> the<00:00:26.710> potential<00:00:27.159> for<00:00:27.429> hybrid<00:00:27.970> buses<00:00:28.179> in

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
at the potential for hybrid buses in

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.950 
at the potential for hybrid buses in
London<00:00:28.839> I<00:00:29.079> think<00:00:29.679> there<00:00:29.859> are<00:00:29.890> two<00:00:30.159> big<00:00:30.669> things

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
London I think there are two big things

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.810 
London I think there are two big things
one<00:00:31.960> is<00:00:32.140> that<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.650> sheer<00:00:32.860> number<00:00:33.220> of<00:00:33.340> buses<00:00:33.640> in

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
one is that the sheer number of buses in

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.390 
one is that the sheer number of buses in
London<00:00:34.270> 7,000<00:00:35.140> it's<00:00:35.290> a<00:00:35.410> very<00:00:35.620> large<00:00:35.890> vehicle

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
London 7,000 it's a very large vehicle

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.400 
London 7,000 it's a very large vehicle
park<00:00:36.670> but<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:37.570> other<00:00:37.690> important<00:00:38.200> thing<00:00:38.380> is

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
park but the other important thing is

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.740 
park but the other important thing is
that<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:39.100> mayor<00:00:39.340> and<00:00:39.670> Transport<00:00:40.570> for<00:00:40.630> London

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
that the mayor and Transport for London

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.780 
that the mayor and Transport for London
have<00:00:41.230> very<00:00:41.500> clear<00:00:42.070> and<00:00:42.370> committed

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
have very clear and committed

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.300 
have very clear and committed
environmental<00:00:43.510> agenda<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:44.230> hybrid<00:00:45.100> buses

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
environmental agenda and hybrid buses

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.480 
environmental agenda and hybrid buses
fit<00:00:45.730> beautifully<00:00:46.270> into<00:00:46.540> that<00:00:50.370> after<00:00:51.370> an

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 
fit beautifully into that after an

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.670 
fit beautifully into that after an
initial<00:00:51.730> period<00:00:52.329> of<00:00:52.630> training<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.230> drivers

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
initial period of training the drivers

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.800 
initial period of training the drivers
are<00:00:53.920> coping<00:00:54.850> with<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:55.060> vehicle<00:00:55.420> very<00:00:55.540> well

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
are coping with the vehicle very well

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.380 
are coping with the vehicle very well
and<00:00:56.650> it<00:00:56.800> really<00:00:57.010> enjoying<00:00:57.400> being<00:00:57.820> part<00:00:58.090> of<00:00:58.270> the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
and it really enjoying being part of the

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.540 
and it really enjoying being part of the
project<00:00:58.890> we're<00:00:59.890> getting<00:01:00.070> some<00:01:00.220> great<00:01:00.310> results

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
project we're getting some great results

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.100 
project we're getting some great results
out<00:01:00.910> of<00:01:00.940> it<00:01:01.120> at<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.270> moment

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.890 

it's<00:01:06.590> really<00:01:06.830> nice<00:01:07.070> drive<00:01:07.880> smooth<00:01:08.300> it's

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
it's really nice drive smooth it's

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.800 
it's really nice drive smooth it's
comfortable<00:01:10.150> compare<00:01:11.150> it<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.360> other<00:01:11.480> buses

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
comfortable compare it to other buses

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.680 
comfortable compare it to other buses
it's<00:01:12.170> very<00:01:12.680> similar<00:01:13.150> you<00:01:14.150> don't<00:01:14.360> have<00:01:14.540> to

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
it's very similar you don't have to

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.820 
it's very similar you don't have to
adjust<00:01:14.960> you<00:01:15.140> have<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.470> adjust<00:01:15.710> yourself

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
adjust you have to adjust yourself

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.770 
adjust you have to adjust yourself
everything's<00:01:16.670> in<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:16.910> same<00:01:16.970> sort<00:01:17.330> of<00:01:17.360> places

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
everything's in the same sort of places

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.840 
everything's in the same sort of places
you<00:01:17.810> know<00:01:18.740> it's<00:01:18.890> really<00:01:19.280> not<00:01:19.490> supposed<00:01:19.670> to

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
you know it's really not supposed to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.910 
you know it's really not supposed to
drive<00:01:20.090> we<00:01:20.870> are<00:01:20.900> comparing<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:21.890> our

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
drive we are comparing to our
