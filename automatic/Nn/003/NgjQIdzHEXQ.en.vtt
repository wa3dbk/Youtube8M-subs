similar<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.800> strap<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:49.129> I<00:00:50.129> didn't<00:00:51.059> know

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
similar to this strap and I didn't know

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.740 
similar to this strap and I didn't know
that<00:00:51.180> at<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.600> time<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:52.969> with<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.239> being<00:00:54.600> said

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
that at the time so with that being said

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.880 
that at the time so with that being said
I<00:00:55.199> didn't<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:55.860> care<00:00:56.340> much<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:57.140> that<00:00:58.940> setup

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
I didn't really care much for that setup

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.509 
I didn't really care much for that setup
so<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.920> ended<00:01:02.309> up<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.640> with<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.210> route<00:01:03.539> here

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
so I ended up going with this route here

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.340 
so I ended up going with this route here
that<00:01:05.519> was<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> 16<00:01:06.210> inch<00:01:06.420> strap<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.049> went<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
that was a 16 inch strap so I went to

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.050 
that was a 16 inch strap so I went to
salvage<00:01:07.740> yard<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.189> looked<00:01:08.460> at<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.670> bunch<00:01:08.850> of

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
salvage yard and looked at a bunch of

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.740 
salvage yard and looked at a bunch of
tailgate<00:01:09.990> cables<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:12.119> see<00:01:12.390> what

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.120 

applications<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.930> could<00:01:16.110> use<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.770> would<00:01:16.920> get

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
applications I could use that would get

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.859 
applications I could use that would get
me<00:01:17.250> somewhere<00:01:17.610> within<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.119> realm<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.450> 16

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
realized that if you took this little

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.240 
realized that if you took this little
clip<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.290> made<00:01:49.560> off<00:01:50.180> my<00:01:51.180> chair<00:01:51.860> he<00:01:52.860> took<00:01:53.070> that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
clip I made off my chair he took that

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.340 
clip I made off my chair he took that
off<00:01:53.460> he<00:01:53.820> could<00:01:54.000> just<00:01:54.180> lift<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.600> up<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.170> then

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
off he could just lift this up and then

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.690 
off he could just lift this up and then
Oh

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
Oh

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.190 
Oh
and<00:01:56.710> that<00:01:57.710> would<00:01:57.860> undo<00:01:58.130> that<00:01:58.369> strap<00:01:58.960> that's<00:01:59.960> to

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
and that would undo that strap that's to

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.960 
and that would undo that strap that's to
make<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:00.740> can<00:02:01.009> take<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.310> tailgate<00:02:01.820> off

with<00:02:02.180> no<00:02:02.270> tools<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:03.380> know<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.770> normal<00:02:03.979> 45<00:02:04.970> it

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
with no tools you know the normal 45 it

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.320

and lift it up on one side and pull it
out<00:02:08.539> on<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.780> other<00:02:08.869> side<00:02:08.989> that's<00:02:09.410> why<00:02:09.590> they<00:02:09.770> do

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
out on the other side that's why they do

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.410 
out on the other side that's why they do
that<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.610> some<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.300> applications

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
application that I had there by these

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.930 
application that I had there by these
straps<00:02:23.390> off<00:02:23.600> up<00:02:23.840> didn't<00:02:24.110> have<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.550> so<00:02:25.550> I<00:02:25.610> made

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
straps off up didn't have that so I made

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.759 
straps off up didn't have that so I made
my<00:02:26.150> own<00:02:26.180> little<00:02:26.330> deal<00:02:26.780> because<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.620> was

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
my own little deal because it was

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.809 
my own little deal because it was
wanting<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:29.739> when<00:02:30.739> you're<00:02:31.040> shutting<00:02:31.519> it<00:02:31.610> was

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
wanting to when you're shutting it was

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.330 
wanting to when you're shutting it was
going<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.330> push<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.380> up<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.650> little<00:02:33.739> bit<00:02:34.040> it

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
going to push it up a little bit it

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.830 
going to push it up a little bit it
wasn't<00:02:34.700> coming<00:02:34.880> off<00:02:35.060> but<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.510> was<00:02:35.600> getting

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
wasn't coming off but it was getting

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.270 
wasn't coming off but it was getting
pushed<00:02:36.170> up<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.500> little<00:02:36.680> bit<00:02:36.799> I<00:02:36.830> didn't<00:02:37.130> like

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
pushed up a little bit I didn't like

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.199 
pushed up a little bit I didn't like
that<00:02:37.549> so<00:02:38.080> that's<00:02:39.080> why<00:02:39.440> I<00:02:39.470> made<00:02:39.739> that<00:02:39.920> little

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
that so that's why I made that little

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.890 
that so that's why I made that little
little<00:02:41.209> clip<00:02:41.450> there<00:02:41.920> but<00:02:43.480> like<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.600> said<00:02:44.660> I

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
little clip there but like I said I

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.110 
little clip there but like I said I
bought<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.230> striker<00:02:45.590> plate<00:02:46.040> for<00:02:46.400> it<00:02:46.519> which

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
bought the striker plate for it which

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.670 
bought the striker plate for it which
gave<00:02:47.330> me<00:02:47.390> these<00:02:47.690> parts<00:02:48.080> here<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.500> then<00:02:48.590> I

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
gave me these parts here and then I

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.009 
gave me these parts here and then I
welded<00:02:48.920> in<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.280> insides<00:02:50.209> of<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.540> stake

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
welded in the insides of the stake

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.009 
welded in the insides of the stake
pocket<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:52.810> mount<00:02:53.810> with<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:55.030> then<00:02:56.030> down<00:02:56.510> here

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
pocket to mount with and then down here

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.650 
pocket to mount with and then down here
I<00:02:57.130> heavily<00:02:58.130> modified<00:02:58.489> this<00:02:58.910> down<00:02:59.150> here<00:02:59.420> this

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
I heavily modified this down here this

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.080 
I heavily modified this down here this
was<00:02:59.900> actually<00:03:00.109> probably<00:03:00.709> another<00:03:01.459> inch<00:03:01.910> or

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
was actually probably another inch or

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.259 
was actually probably another inch or
two<00:03:02.329> inch<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:02.989> a<00:03:03.019> half<00:03:03.049> longer<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:04.700> strap<00:03:05.030> was

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
two inch and a half longer the strap was

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.550 
two inch and a half longer the strap was
I<00:03:05.570> cut<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:05.959> off<00:03:06.109> and<00:03:07.070> then<00:03:07.220> I<00:03:07.250> welded<00:03:08.290> see<00:03:09.290> a

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
I cut it off and then I welded see a

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.449 
I cut it off and then I welded see a
little<00:03:10.400> tab<00:03:10.700> on<00:03:11.060> there<00:03:11.299> and<00:03:11.570> that<00:03:11.750> little<00:03:11.900> tab

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
little tab on there and that little tab

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.099 
little tab on there and that little tab
and<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.549> look<00:03:13.730> at<00:03:13.880> you<00:03:14.000> know<00:03:14.030> gate<00:03:14.329> up<00:03:14.510> hits<00:03:14.930> on

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
and you look at you know gate up hits on

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.819 
and you look at you know gate up hits on
a<00:03:15.140> striker<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:16.880> prevents<00:03:17.329> it<00:03:17.450> from<00:03:17.829> this

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
a striker and that prevents it from this

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.080 
a striker and that prevents it from this
part<00:03:19.160> of<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.340> from<00:03:19.609> running<00:03:19.760> into<00:03:20.000> the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
part of it from running into the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.949 
part of it from running into the
tailgate<00:03:21.220> so<00:03:22.299> and<00:03:23.299> then<00:03:23.450> these<00:03:23.660> are<00:03:23.810> the

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
tailgate so and then these are the

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.400 
tailgate so and then these are the
little<00:03:24.079> nylon<00:03:24.320> plungers<00:03:25.190> and<00:03:25.959> like<00:03:26.959> I<00:03:27.049> said<00:03:27.290> it

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
little nylon plungers and like I said it

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.289 
little nylon plungers and like I said it
works<00:03:27.560> pretty<00:03:27.859> good<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.190> little<00:03:28.609> little<00:03:29.060> high

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
works pretty good a little little high

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.990 
works pretty good a little little high
price<00:03:29.720> for<00:03:30.109> what<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.290> get<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.620> think<00:03:30.799> but<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.820> I

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
price for what you get I think but and I

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.150 
price for what you get I think but and I
didn't<00:03:32.239> really<00:03:32.420> like<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:32.900> straps<00:03:33.470> they<00:03:33.799> sent

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
didn't really like the straps they sent

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.280 
didn't really like the straps they sent
so<00:03:34.820> this<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.180> what<00:03:35.420> we<00:03:35.570> ended<00:03:35.750> up<00:03:35.870> going<00:03:36.109> with

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
so this is what we ended up going with

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.910 
so this is what we ended up going with
and<00:03:36.769> it<00:03:36.859> it<00:03:37.850> works<00:03:38.060> really<00:03:38.329> well<00:03:41.709> like<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.859> said

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
and it it works really well like I said

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.220 
and it it works really well like I said
I<00:03:43.130> wasn't<00:03:43.430> too<00:03:43.670> concerned<00:03:43.910> about<00:03:44.390> this<00:03:44.840> part

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
I wasn't too concerned about this part

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.890 
I wasn't too concerned about this part
of<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.440> deal<00:03:45.620> because<00:03:46.600> you<00:03:47.600> got<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.870> have

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
of the deal because you got to have

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.809 
of the deal because you got to have
tools<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:48.500> get<00:03:48.620> this<00:03:48.769> tailgate<00:03:49.069> off<00:03:49.370> anyway

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
tools to get this tailgate off anyway

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.170 
tools to get this tailgate off anyway
it's<00:03:50.030> not<00:03:50.150> only<00:03:50.269> meals<00:03:50.600> where<00:03:50.840> you<00:03:50.959> can<00:03:51.109> just

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
it's not only meals where you can just

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.789 
it's not only meals where you can just
release<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.389> cables<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:53.959> pull<00:03:54.350> a<00:03:54.380> tailgate

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
release the cables and pull a tailgate

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.830 
release the cables and pull a tailgate
off<00:03:54.980> so<00:03:55.280> I<00:03:55.519> wasn't<00:03:55.940> too<00:03:56.090> worried<00:03:56.389> about<00:03:56.450> it

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
off so I wasn't too worried about it

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.970 
off so I wasn't too worried about it
it<00:03:57.530> works<00:03:57.829> good

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
it works good

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.250 
it works good
I<00:04:00.120> don't<00:04:01.120> think<00:04:01.180> anybody<00:04:01.629> ever<00:04:01.720> sit<00:04:02.019> on<00:04:02.050> this

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
I don't think anybody ever sit on this

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.710 
I don't think anybody ever sit on this
tailgate<00:04:02.530> but<00:04:02.980> now<00:04:03.190> if<00:04:03.400> they<00:04:03.580> do<00:04:03.640> they<00:04:04.209> at

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
tailgate but now if they do they at

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.289 
tailgate but now if they do they at
least<00:04:04.870> have<00:04:05.110> a<00:04:05.140> chance<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:05.799> holding<00:04:05.950> up

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
least have a chance of it holding up

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.330 
least have a chance of it holding up
I<00:04:07.409> think<00:04:08.409> these<00:04:08.680> deals<00:04:09.069> here<00:04:09.580> I<00:04:11.099> did<00:04:12.099> some

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
I think these deals here I did some

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.059 
I think these deals here I did some
reviews<00:04:12.730> or<00:04:13.090> looked<00:04:13.720> up<00:04:13.870> some<00:04:14.110> reviews<00:04:14.560> on<00:04:14.799> the

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
reviews or looked up some reviews on the

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.729 
reviews or looked up some reviews on the
internet<00:04:15.370> about<00:04:15.580> this<00:04:15.849> this<00:04:16.359> deal<00:04:17.019> and<00:04:17.380> that

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
internet about this this deal and that

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.439 
internet about this this deal and that
was<00:04:17.919> what<00:04:18.100> their<00:04:18.280> main<00:04:18.459> complaint<00:04:19.389> was<00:04:21.449> the

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
was what their main complaint was the

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.770 
was what their main complaint was the
straps<00:04:23.760> people<00:04:24.760> I<00:04:24.820> would<00:04:25.000> never<00:04:25.180> probably<00:04:25.630> try

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
straps people I would never probably try

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.420 
straps people I would never probably try
to<00:04:25.810> sit<00:04:26.080> on<00:04:26.199> a<00:04:26.229> tailgate<00:04:26.740> but<00:04:26.919> was<00:04:27.040> held<00:04:27.280> up

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
to sit on a tailgate but was held up

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.189 
to sit on a tailgate but was held up
with<00:04:27.610> just<00:04:27.820> this<00:04:28.030> but<00:04:28.389> some<00:04:28.600> people<00:04:28.870> I<00:04:28.960> guess

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
with just this but some people I guess

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.560 
with just this but some people I guess
were<00:04:29.410> and<00:04:29.650> they<00:04:29.740> were<00:04:30.060> they<00:04:31.060> were<00:04:31.090> sagging<00:04:33.570> and

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
were and they were they were sagging and

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.750 
were and they were they were sagging and
I<00:04:35.470> think<00:04:35.800> that<00:04:35.979> looks<00:04:36.190> like<00:04:36.580> when<00:04:36.699> it

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
I think that looks like when it

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.520 
I think that looks like when it
starts<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.120> sag<00:04:37.389> that's<00:04:37.690> why<00:04:37.870> when<00:04:38.110> I<00:04:38.139> went

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
starts to sag that's why when I went

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.640 
starts to sag that's why when I went
ahead<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:38.860> set<00:04:39.039> this<00:04:39.220> this<00:04:40.440> stepped-up<00:04:41.500> I

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
ahead and set this this stepped-up I

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.890 
ahead and set this this stepped-up I
left<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.370> tailgate<00:04:43.090> up<00:04:43.240> two<00:04:43.479> degrees

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
left the tailgate up two degrees

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.210 
left the tailgate up two degrees
positive<00:04:45.060> because<00:04:46.560> eventually<00:04:47.560> it'll<00:04:47.919> sag

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
positive because eventually it'll sag

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.170 
positive because eventually it'll sag
down<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:50.320> best<00:04:51.130> case<00:04:51.370> scenario<00:04:51.789> is<00:04:51.970> it'll

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
down and the best case scenario is it'll

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.000 
down and the best case scenario is it'll
sag<00:04:52.419> down<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:52.780> level<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.289> then<00:04:53.470> it'll<00:04:53.650> stop

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
sag down the level and then it'll stop

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.580 
sag down the level and then it'll stop
there<00:04:54.340> if<00:04:54.970> it<00:04:55.180> goes<00:04:55.360> past<00:04:55.630> level<00:04:56.110> I<00:04:56.169> think<00:04:56.440> that

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
there if it goes past level I think that

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.650 
there if it goes past level I think that
looks<00:04:56.800> like<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.610> then<00:04:58.030> I'll<00:04:58.180> deal<00:04:58.630> with

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
looks like and then I'll deal with

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.140 
looks like and then I'll deal with
that<00:04:58.840> so<00:04:59.350> I<00:04:59.380> always<00:04:59.590> said<00:04:59.919> everything<00:05:00.250> up<00:05:00.400> two

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
that so I always said everything up two

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.260 
that so I always said everything up two
degrees<00:05:01.979> because<00:05:02.979> gravity<00:05:03.460> has<00:05:03.699> its<00:05:03.910> effects

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
degrees because gravity has its effects

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.460 
degrees because gravity has its effects
on<00:05:04.450> everything<00:05:05.729> and<00:05:06.729> it<00:05:07.120> I<00:05:07.450> said<00:05:08.020> it<00:05:08.110> does<00:05:08.260> it

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
on everything and it I said it does it

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.339 
on everything and it I said it does it
real<00:05:08.740> good<00:05:08.919> and<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.970> stays<00:05:10.180> off<00:05:10.389> the<00:05:10.419> paint<00:05:10.870> but

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
real good and it stays off the paint but

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.409 
real good and it stays off the paint but
in<00:05:11.500> this<00:05:11.680> area<00:05:12.039> here<00:05:12.340> if<00:05:12.430> it<00:05:12.610> was<00:05:12.849> ever<00:05:13.090> to<00:05:13.270> get

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
in this area here if it was ever to get

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:14.969 
in this area here if it was ever to get
close<00:05:13.720> to<00:05:13.900> that<00:05:14.080> I<00:05:14.110> could<00:05:14.289> just<00:05:14.560> come<00:05:14.770> in<00:05:14.889> here

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
close to that I could just come in here

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.290 
close to that I could just come in here
and<00:05:15.039> put<00:05:15.220> a<00:05:15.250> little<00:05:15.310> rubber<00:05:15.550> bumper<00:05:16.060> in<00:05:16.180> this

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
and put a little rubber bumper in this

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.060 
and put a little rubber bumper in this
area<00:05:16.630> here<00:05:16.900> or<00:05:17.080> I<00:05:17.800> can<00:05:18.160> buy<00:05:19.860> some<00:05:20.860> of<00:05:20.979> this

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
area here or I can buy some of this

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.159 
area here or I can buy some of this
clear<00:05:21.460> over<00:05:21.729> like<00:05:21.940> stuff<00:05:22.270> like<00:05:22.300> what<00:05:22.750> they<00:05:22.900> put

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
clear over like stuff like what they put

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.719 
clear over like stuff like what they put
on<00:05:23.760> wheel<00:05:24.760> wells<00:05:25.060> just<00:05:26.099> sticks<00:05:27.099> on<00:05:27.280> there<00:05:27.460> and

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
on wheel wells just sticks on there and

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.629 
on wheel wells just sticks on there and
it<00:05:28.210> protects<00:05:29.139> the<00:05:29.289> areas<00:05:29.800> that<00:05:29.979> are<00:05:30.190> usually

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
it protects the areas that are usually

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.290 
it protects the areas that are usually
beat<00:05:30.880> up<00:05:31.150> with<00:05:31.720> rock<00:05:32.349> chips<00:05:32.740> and<00:05:33.300> prevents

beat up with rock chips and prevents

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.900 
beat up with rock chips and prevents
that<00:05:34.419> from<00:05:34.479> happening<00:05:34.630> I<00:05:35.260> could<00:05:35.470> probably<00:05:35.910> cut

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
that from happening I could probably cut

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.640 
that from happening I could probably cut
me<00:05:37.090> a<00:05:37.120> little<00:05:37.180> square<00:05:37.780> or<00:05:38.050> something<00:05:38.380> I<00:05:40.650> don't

turned out now I can get rid of the

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.350 
turned out now I can get rid of the
tailgate<00:05:57.099> chains<00:05:57.460> I'll<00:05:57.699> go<00:05:57.880> ahead<00:05:58.180> and

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
tailgate chains I'll go ahead and

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.409 
tailgate chains I'll go ahead and
continue<00:05:59.050> on<00:05:59.080> and<00:05:59.260> cut<00:05:59.740> this<00:05:59.979> off<00:06:00.250> and<00:06:00.669> I'm

continue on and cut this off and I'm
gonna<00:06:01.889> extend<00:06:02.889> this<00:06:03.070> beat<00:06:03.400> here<00:06:03.789> on<00:06:04.060> around

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
gonna extend this beat here on around

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.540 
gonna extend this beat here on around
here<00:06:04.810> and<00:06:04.930> around<00:06:05.229> and<00:06:05.740> then<00:06:05.919> return<00:06:06.250> it<00:06:06.370> back

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
here and around and then return it back

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.820 
here and around and then return it back
in

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
in

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.090 
in
there<00:06:07.540> this'll<00:06:08.540> all<00:06:08.630> go<00:06:08.660> away<00:06:09.050> and<00:06:09.710> then<00:06:09.980> I'll

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
there this'll all go away and then I'll

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.310 
there this'll all go away and then I'll
cut<00:06:10.340> this<00:06:10.550> off<00:06:10.850> and<00:06:11.270> remove<00:06:11.630> all<00:06:11.810> that<00:06:12.020> stuff

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
cut this off and remove all that stuff

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.510 
cut this off and remove all that stuff
and<00:06:12.530> that'll<00:06:12.710> clean<00:06:12.890> up<00:06:13.040> the<00:06:13.190> rear<00:06:13.400> of<00:06:13.430> the
