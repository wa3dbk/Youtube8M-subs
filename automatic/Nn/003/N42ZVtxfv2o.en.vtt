00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
this thing his feels like it's spread of

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.330 
this thing his feels like it's spread of
fairway<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:01.260> I'm<00:01:01.530> just<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> do<00:01:02.039> my<00:01:02.070> best

and if it pops it pops when they're all
out<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.100> maybe<00:01:08.460> outer<00:01:10.610> go<00:01:11.610> through<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> soil

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
out on maybe outer go through the soil

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.289 
out on maybe outer go through the soil
and<00:01:12.799> pry<00:01:13.799> them<00:01:14.070> out<00:01:14.189> pull<00:01:14.700> them<00:01:14.880> out<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.240> bit

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
and pry them out pull them out a bit

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.399

no<00:01:30.360> he's<00:01:30.540> another<00:01:30.810> little<00:01:31.140> chute<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:32.240> can<00:01:33.240> get

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
no he's another little chute I can get

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.350 
no he's another little chute I can get
that<00:01:33.780> out<00:01:34.820> go<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.970> way

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.200 

a<00:01:40.780> little<00:01:41.780> chute<00:01:42.050> I<00:01:42.380> might<00:01:43.190> put<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:43.700> in<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:43.940> pot

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
a little chute I might put that in a pot

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.760 
a little chute I might put that in a pot
because<00:01:45.730> obviously<00:01:46.730> these<00:01:47.180> things<00:01:47.770> spread

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
because obviously these things spread

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.660 
because obviously these things spread
and<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:51.020> can<00:01:51.380> give<00:01:51.560> him<00:01:51.620> away<00:01:51.800> to<00:01:51.950> people<00:01:52.310> all

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
and I can give him away to people all

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.210 
and I can give him away to people all
look<00:01:52.850> at<00:01:52.970> that<00:01:53.120> way<00:01:53.240> this<00:01:54.170> one<00:01:54.380> is<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.530> offshoot

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
look at that way this one is a offshoot

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.800 
look at that way this one is a offshoot
so<00:01:56.210> I<00:01:56.240> only<00:01:56.420> planted<00:01:56.780> one<00:01:57.460> last<00:01:58.460> well<00:01:59.150> when<00:01:59.660> was

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
so I only planted one last well when was

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.870 
so I only planted one last well when was
it<00:01:59.870> ended<00:02:00.530> last<00:02:00.650> year<00:02:01.240> something<00:02:03.430> but<00:02:04.430> in<00:02:04.700> the

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
it ended last year something but in the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.490 
it ended last year something but in the
process<00:02:05.060> of<00:02:05.390> ripping<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:05.810> out<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:06.020> first<00:02:06.200> time

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
process of ripping it out the first time

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.260 
process of ripping it out the first time
like<00:02:06.680> obviously<00:02:07.040> left<00:02:07.280> roots<00:02:07.580> behind<00:02:07.790> so

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
like obviously left roots behind so

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.790 
like obviously left roots behind so
there's<00:02:08.479> another<00:02:08.780> one<00:02:09.229> that's<00:02:09.410> nice<00:02:09.649> and

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
there's another one that's nice and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.080 
there's another one that's nice and
thick<00:02:11.380> another<00:02:12.380> one<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.620> can<00:02:13.750> give<00:02:14.750> away<00:02:16.090> and

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
thick another one I can give away and

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.630 
thick another one I can give away and
all<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:17.390> left<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:18.440> was<00:02:18.739> one<00:02:19.010> tiny<00:02:19.340> little

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
all I left on this was one tiny little

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.440 
all I left on this was one tiny little
piece<00:02:20.060> at<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.270> top<00:02:21.730> now<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:22.880> bad<00:02:23.120> has<00:02:23.270> had

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
piece at the top now this bad has had

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.729 
piece at the top now this bad has had
the<00:02:23.630> heaps<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.459> horse<00:02:25.459> poo<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.850> it<00:02:26.560> because<00:02:27.560> I

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
the heaps of horse poo in it because I

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.729 
the heaps of horse poo in it because I
was<00:02:27.890> preparing<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.520> for<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.760> onions<00:02:29.709> so<00:02:30.709> I

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
was preparing it for the onions so I

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.729 
was preparing it for the onions so I
think<00:02:30.890> this<00:02:31.370> thing<00:02:31.670> has<00:02:32.170> maybe<00:02:33.170> spread<00:02:33.560> its

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
think this thing has maybe spread its

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.960 
think this thing has maybe spread its
roots<00:02:34.010> forever<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.720> off<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.400> go<00:02:37.400> suck<00:02:37.670> up<00:02:37.820> the

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
roots forever and off to go suck up the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.330 
roots forever and off to go suck up the
horse<00:02:38.150> poo<00:02:38.420> bit<00:02:38.860> all<00:02:39.860> right<00:02:39.980> I'm<00:02:40.070> going<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.220> put

and just stick that tiny little oops one

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.030 
and just stick that tiny little oops one
inch<00:04:35.990> piece<00:04:36.350> in<00:04:36.710> a<00:04:37.250> pot<00:04:37.850> this<00:04:38.420> time<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:39.040> it'll

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
inch piece in a pot this time and it'll

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.540 
inch piece in a pot this time and it'll
grow<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:40.900> it'll<00:04:41.900> multiply<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:43.010> it'll<00:04:43.340> grow

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
grow and it'll multiply and it'll grow

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.120 
grow and it'll multiply and it'll grow
and<00:04:43.820> i'll<00:04:44.120> multiply<00:04:44.680> ice<00:04:45.680> we've<00:04:45.830> got<00:04:45.920> a<00:04:45.950> heater

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
and i'll multiply ice we've got a heater

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.770 
and i'll multiply ice we've got a heater
of<00:04:46.220> other<00:04:46.370> little<00:04:46.520> sticks<00:04:46.880> so<00:04:48.550> that's<00:04:49.550> good

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
of other little sticks so that's good

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.530 
of other little sticks so that's good
nine<00:04:50.780> is<00:04:50.930> another<00:04:51.460> medium<00:04:52.460> size<00:04:53.140> as<00:04:54.140> well<00:04:55.540> so

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
nine is another medium size as well so

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.659 
nine is another medium size as well so
let's<00:04:57.050> go<00:04:57.280> make<00:04:58.280> some<00:04:58.780> horseradish<00:04:59.780> cream

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
let's go make some horseradish cream

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.820 
let's go make some horseradish cream
hopefully<00:05:01.669> when<00:05:02.570> I<00:05:02.600> fill<00:05:02.870> this<00:05:03.020> hole<00:05:03.230> and<00:05:03.440> I

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
hopefully when I fill this hole and I

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.920 
hopefully when I fill this hole and I
can<00:05:04.130> get<00:05:04.250> all<00:05:04.280> these<00:05:04.550> tiny<00:05:04.880> little<00:05:05.030> bits<00:05:05.450> these

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
can get all these tiny little bits these

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.320 
can get all these tiny little bits these
are<00:05:06.110> white<00:05:06.350> roots<00:05:06.860> so<00:05:07.370> I<00:05:07.400> can<00:05:07.640> kind<00:05:07.790> of<00:05:07.970> pick

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
are white roots so I can kind of pick

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.430 
are white roots so I can kind of pick
them<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:09.500> if<00:05:10.430> I<00:05:10.580> can<00:05:10.730> get<00:05:10.850> all<00:05:10.910> them<00:05:11.150> out<00:05:11.330> or<00:05:12.320> as

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
them and if I can get all them out or as

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.610 
them and if I can get all them out or as
many<00:05:12.560> as<00:05:12.710> I<00:05:12.860> can<00:05:12.919> out<00:05:13.340> and<00:05:14.050> fill<00:05:15.050> this<00:05:15.200> hole<00:05:15.410> in

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
many as I can out and fill this hole in

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.810 
many as I can out and fill this hole in
hopefully<00:05:15.860> those<00:05:16.250> ones<00:05:16.550> that<00:05:16.640> are<00:05:16.790> really

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
hopefully those ones that are really

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.200 
hopefully those ones that are really
really<00:05:17.390> deep<00:05:17.660> down<00:05:17.930> and<00:05:18.520> will<00:05:19.520> be<00:05:19.610> too<00:05:19.790> deep<00:05:20.030> to

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
really deep down and will be too deep to

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.070 
really deep down and will be too deep to
sprout<00:05:20.510> back<00:05:20.690> up<00:05:20.870> but<00:05:22.090> seeing<00:05:23.090> how
