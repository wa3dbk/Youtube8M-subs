 Y 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.980
 hello friends i 'm andrÃ© claude and this is 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.350
 my first video and I want to tell you about a 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.450
 topic that has caught my attention 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.000
 a few weeks ago I was investigating 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.710
 about UFO sightings and I 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.080
 I found something that apparently has been 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.900
 in my opinion one of the things more 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.350
 amazing about the UFO subject in the 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.290
 April 4, 1561 in Nuremberg Germany 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.270
 when the only vehicles they knew 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.700
 they were boats powered by the 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.769
 wind based on human strength or means 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.379
 of transport using animal traction 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.980
 the people of the time did not have 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.260
 no knowledge about air travel 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.720
 airplanes or spacecraft so they 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.879
 it would be extremely difficult to 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.790
 understand and explain that anything 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.020
 heavier than the air could fly 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.300
 then what impression would they have had 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.280
 the people of the time when looking at a 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.409
 sky full of flying vehicles 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.570
 different designs fighting in a 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.270
 battle in the sky right on top of his 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.579
 city they saw large objects and 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.860
 cylindrical and released inside 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.690
 same other flying objects in shape 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.270
 of smaller spheres 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.910
 some were in the form of dishes and others 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.190
 they were cross-shaped and they all looked like 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.590
 fly independently through the 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.810
 skies of Nuremberg and the victims of 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.710
 so colossal battle they crashed in 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.480
 their houses and fields in this case we know 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.640
 really what they thought because 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.950
 the events were witnessed 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.500
 by half the city and disclosed in 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.120
 local newspaper the gazette of Nuremberg 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.210
 told the story of a terrible 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.580
 appearance at dawn came to describe 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.640
 cylindrical shapes from which they came 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.100
 black spheres red orange and blue 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.650
 white that came out of it between 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.030
 spheres other objects crossed 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.460
 with the color of blood 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.070
 the frightening spectacle said the 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.070
 newspaper was witnessed by numerous 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.530
 men and women here I present you a 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.340
 abstract of the press article of 4 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.220
 April of 1500 61 of about 3 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.830
 in the extension from time to time 4 in 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.260
 a square many remained isolated 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.120
 and between these spheres one could have 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.170
 a series of crosses the color of the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.900
 blood 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.630
 then you could see two large tubes in 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.110
 which small and large tubes were 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.330
 three spheres including four plus all 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.760
 these elements began to fight one 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.040
 against the other at the time when 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.900
 dawned one could see many balls 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.580
 big blacks that moved to great 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.790
 speed in the air towards the sun 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.470
 then they made half turns 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.900
 beating one against the other as if 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.940
 they were fighting a great battle 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.459
 number of them became red and 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.440
 Indian women after that were consumed and 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.810
 they became extinct in a thick cloud of 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.810
 smoke gazette of the city of nuremberg 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.209
 the cylindrical forms for example 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.880
 they were certainly substantial and 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.769
 possibly of metal construction already 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.860
 that the eyewitnesses- what 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.840
 they described as barrels of cannons 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.180
 neither were objects floating gently 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.430
 in the breeze the description of the 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.560
 spheres clearly states that they 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.380
 they were throwing themselves on top of each other 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.390
 the newspaper also reported that almost as 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.299
 soon as the objects arrived 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.890
 fliers began to fight the fight 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.750
 lasted at least one hour 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.569
 time during which some of the 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.640
 objects were seen catching fire and falling 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.250
 to the land where they disappeared in a 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.650
 Thick cloud of smoke at least one of the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.690
 bigger objects seems to have had 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.970
 an aerodynamic profile since it was 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.340
 described as a huge black spear that 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.220
 he entered the scene and decidedly put 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.650
 end to the battle this object could be 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.290
 a great ship battle cruiser a ship 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.209
 superior of some kind in the conclusion 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.700
 of the battle it was reported that the 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.010
 winners perceived the spheres and the 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.440
 tubes that contained them had flown 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.019
 towards the sun as expected 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.640
 those times the phenomenon was taken 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.400
 like the wrath of god for some 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.260
 unknown transgression the editor of the 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.990
 Nuremberg Gazette dedicated some lines 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.150
 of warning for your readers the 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.030
 fearful of god do not discard these 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.000
 signs even take them to the heart as 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.020
 a warning of its annunciation 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.600
 merciful with shane my god father 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.150
 celestial recompose their lives and 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.760
 faithfully pray to God that he will avoid his 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.610
 anger including the punishment deserved in 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.969
 us so that we can temporarily 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.399
 is 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:51.829
 here and perpetually there live like your 

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:54.979
 Gazette children of the city of Nuremberg 

00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:57.259
 the theorists of the ancient astronauts 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.119
 that analyze the Nuremberg incident 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.399
 with a modern vision they say that 

00:04:59.119 --> 00:05:03.549
 clearly represents aliens in 

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:06.399
 your UFOs ie vehicles 

00:05:03.549 --> 00:05:09.229
 aliens battling in the skies 

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:11.659
 they say that these objects are clearly 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.729
 intelligently controlled them 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:16.459
 point out that the shapes of the objects 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.939
 are all classic UFO designs 

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:22.639
 Cylinder saucers and report spheres 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:24.769
 from the era of tubes emitting balloons 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.319
 adapts to UFO sightings not from 

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:29.749
 bezas emitting small spheres the 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:32.259
 image that I show you below is 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:35.479
 a leaflet in wood made in 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:37.459
 1566 by the laser hang artist in which 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:40.249
 An event that occurred in 

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:43.299
 nuremberg five years before at the time 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:46.969
 of sunrise on April 4, 

00:05:43.299 --> 00:05:49.369
 1561 said representation is preserved in 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:52.700
 the medium collection in the library 

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:54.740
 central central lived tell the tourist 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.540
 theories there are several from which what 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.850
 considered as evidence of a 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.620
 old UFO sighting until those who 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.710
 propose the convergence of several 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.900
 both meteorological phenomena 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.690
 an explanation like the other I think 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.490
 little plausible but if the scene that the 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.680
 village of Nuremberg witnessed in 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.470
 hundreds were not flying machines 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.470
 fighting between them then that was 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.420
 that many detractors say that should 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.430
 have been simply a report 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.270
 Fantasy of a meteor shower 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.130
 but this extends to credibility 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.830
 descriptions like tubes crosses flying 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.410
 barrels of cannon and a gigantic spear 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.900
 are far from the description of a 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.730
 simple meteor shower or any 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.160
 another natural event that one could 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.470
 get and taking into account the number 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.870
 from witnesses to the editors 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.400
 it would be difficult to get away with any 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.190
 description that was extremely 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.380
 imprecise so while some do not 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.600
 can agree exactly with 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.240
 what happened maybe they accept that something 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.490
 strange happened and while we can 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.510
 consider that our familiarity with 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.130
 the technology 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.050
 is destined to be our 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:06.770
 interpretation closer to reality 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:09.140
 that the observers in Nuremberg 1561 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.850
 the truth may be that what happened that 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:14.090
 day is beyond our reach 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:16.250
 as it was for them if the video 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.260
 liked give me thumb up and subscribe to 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.780
 my channel this will help me a lot to 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:24.820
 do more work like that I talk to you 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.820
 andreu and I wish you an excellent day
