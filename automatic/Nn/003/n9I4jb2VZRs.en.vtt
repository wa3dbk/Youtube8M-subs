00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.100 
know it's another guy where we went
behind<00:06:12.789> -<00:06:13.090> an<00:06:13.180> early<00:06:13.419> goal<00:06:13.570> as<00:06:13.810> well<00:06:13.900> it's

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
behind - an early goal as well it's

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.909 
behind - an early goal as well it's
becoming<00:06:14.350> a<00:06:14.470> habit

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
becoming a habit

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.219 
becoming a habit
I<00:06:14.950> thought<00:06:15.669> we<00:06:15.789> sustained<00:06:16.090> pressure<00:06:16.330> the

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
I thought we sustained pressure the

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:18.810 
I thought we sustained pressure the
first<00:06:17.440> couple<00:06:17.800> shifts<00:06:17.950> and<00:06:18.190> I'm<00:06:18.250> really<00:06:18.550> into

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
first couple shifts and I'm really into

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.640 
first couple shifts and I'm really into
defensive<00:06:19.210> area<00:06:19.450> there<00:06:19.630> and<00:06:19.810> obviously

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
defensive area there and obviously

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.320 
defensive area there and obviously
capitalize<00:06:21.130> and<00:06:21.280> face<00:06:21.550> it<00:06:21.700> kinda<00:06:21.910> unit<00:06:22.210> they

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
capitalize and face it kinda unit they

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.670 
capitalize and face it kinda unit they
don't<00:06:22.479> create<00:06:22.690> a<00:06:22.750> lot<00:06:22.930> but<00:06:23.410> they<00:06:23.500> wait<00:06:23.650> for

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
don't create a lot but they wait for

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.080 
don't create a lot but they wait for
teams<00:06:24.010> mistakes<00:06:24.340> and<00:06:24.520> they<00:06:24.610> obviously<00:06:24.700> did

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
teams mistakes and they obviously did

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.879 
teams mistakes and they obviously did
that<00:06:25.210> tonight<00:06:25.479> they<00:06:25.960> went<00:06:26.110> to<00:06:26.320> nil<00:06:26.530> up<00:06:26.650> and

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:26.889 
that tonight they went to nil up and

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.260 
that tonight they went to nil up and
they<00:06:26.950> didn't<00:06:27.220> seem<00:06:27.400> to<00:06:27.550> be<00:06:27.669> a<00:06:27.700> lot<00:06:27.880> of<00:06:28.000> panic

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
they didn't seem to be a lot of panic

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.850 
they didn't seem to be a lot of panic
and<00:06:28.479> then<00:06:28.570> when<00:06:28.720> daddy<00:06:29.050> got<00:06:29.260> that<00:06:29.440> power<00:06:29.620> play

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
and then when daddy got that power play

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.370 
and then when daddy got that power play
goal<00:06:30.100> -<00:06:30.430> one<00:06:30.669> look<00:06:31.450> what<00:06:31.630> we<00:06:31.720> settled<00:06:32.080> the<00:06:32.169> ship

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
goal - one look what we settled the ship

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.440 
goal - one look what we settled the ship
but<00:06:32.800> that<00:06:32.950> third<00:06:33.220> goal<00:06:33.580> seemed<00:06:33.880> to<00:06:34.060> take<00:06:34.330> the

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:34.450 
but that third goal seemed to take the

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.390 
but that third goal seemed to take the
wind<00:06:34.630> out<00:06:34.750> of<00:06:34.810> the<00:06:34.990> sails<00:06:35.169> of<00:06:35.380> me<00:06:35.500> you<00:06:36.250> never
