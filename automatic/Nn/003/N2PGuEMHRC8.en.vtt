and I thought this would make it really
sweet<00:02:59.720> and<00:03:01.270> it<00:03:02.270> does<00:03:02.480> i<00:03:02.630> was<00:03:02.810> i<00:03:03.050> was<00:03:03.200> very

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:16.240 
it thought this would be really sugary
sweet<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:10.550> isn't<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:14.770> thought<00:03:15.770> it<00:03:15.830> just<00:03:16.040> had

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250
