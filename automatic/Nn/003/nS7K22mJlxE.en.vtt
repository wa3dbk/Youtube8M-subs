00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.840
 we get to see our customers 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.929
 especially our all over the world is beaming 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:10.910
 on 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.390
 each of the 15 to be the best 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.939
 who now with this score 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.939
 if every five years 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.880
 the Schorndorf 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.590
 every single day a fight for survival which is the case 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.359
 Zwanziger 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.170
 that he got the chance to see her saying something before the break 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.530
 who makes his life for her is the money 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.180
 if I had to lent for 2009 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.700
 the interesting one 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.570
 in front of the all registers 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.010
 this is excellent 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.010
 you have to have a little money 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.330
 I will never forget that the pirates did not take place 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.240
 The stock exchanges are predominantly in the world of water already so they learn 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.620
 He was guilty but wants to do it 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.040
 one way or another 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.550
 the transmitter 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.390
 the first two teams each fight that is not last one these days 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.500
 another world 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.900
 Bit by bit closer what are you doing here that is called and boys on 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.160
 meet a toboggan run 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
 in addition to life he always wanted 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.620
 Seen in this way, a new version of himself in game is very low 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.840
 but everything has its price Weselsky 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.140
 which the Leyen secured the striker of the world to have been able to 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.420
 Leader is that you yourself 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.920
 because some opportunities 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.810
 maybe it should be possible in another case 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.470
 at a big one 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.470
 half a million for the winner 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.700
 is it worth taking a risk that's what your proposal looks like all my money 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.330
 give us set 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.940
 and sometimes a play role here talk about a lot of money 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.390
 is it worth fighting for? 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.860
 the views of nobody think 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.310
 but I am nobody 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.310
 the only way not so seen that he took me to the boards way 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:10.209
 If you look at these I'm not afraid of you
