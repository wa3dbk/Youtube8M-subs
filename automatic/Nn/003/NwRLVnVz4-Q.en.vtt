00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 what was recorded sold out events-pisa viewers 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.380
 but not just episodes of violence 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.809
 some young people were stopped by the carabinieri at the end of the first half 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.440
 while trying to approach the Sassari area in the reserved area 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.339
 the force of the order due note to intervene at the end of the match for 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.669
 disperse a large group of troublemakers ready to unleash the brawl 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.929
 no dunk appeals were made 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.319
 in declarations of goodwill 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:35.729
 unfortunately there are still too many that the stadium does not go to cheer 

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:37.050
 for your team 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.330
 but to insult the other fans 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
 and possibly passarelli 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.680
 and let's talk about the game that ended without losers or winners 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.530
 very beautiful world game even if competitive interesting mind 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.220
 the inhabitants of Cagliari took the lead at the eighth minute thanks to barozzi 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.220
 which beat finnat a great shot from the edge 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.110
 zola's answer ready 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.299
 that engaged elf with a disagreement on the back ground 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.110
 reel my head or he directs the network to everything easy for nothing 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.960
 no problem even for pinnacle neutralizes a blow without difficulty 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.160
 of what time 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.500
 in closing time and still the very active barozzi to give 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.170
 an impression of the goal but the ball ends up on the outside of the mind 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.430
 at the beginning of shooting 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.620
 media limit is the mediacom poker &amp; quot 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.890
 12th rose again for Cagliari goalkeeper 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.220
 at the seventeenth and valentines face without success the way of 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.240
 old 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.619
 2 episodes disputed in the air of the torres the first to the 20th for a 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.630
 alleged foul 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.090
 the second to the 27th for another alleged knockdown against david 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.090
 but it seems to us that on the two occasions to leave 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.390
 still the torres near the draw to the thirtieth colors but the son of the former 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.540
 federica does not end on the side 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.190
 immediately after he could double Cagliari but a little all the cincischia or 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.210
 under the door xd pm look at how many chances to beat the goalkeeper 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.600
 Sassari and no one, however, manages to take responsibility for the shot 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:24.739
 ah 42nd the color of the walls or look at what they combine before me and 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.509
 the ball chicken escapes from the hands of the goalkeeper who tries to throw a 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.119
 partner 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:31.919
 the valentine 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.919
 save and I am launching maxim-ic 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.900
 close of the sport tare great tito didactics nothing to do 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:48.239
 and so the possibility of improving the ranking vanishes for Italy 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.010
 and at the same time dispel the legend of the last minutes 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.129
 favorable to the tower
