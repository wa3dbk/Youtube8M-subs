00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.130
 when they eat everything we have to electro 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.090
 crafting table 3 and to start we're going to 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.600
 start now 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.630
 we take 3 sugar or sugar cane 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.760
 rather we see it as well as these give 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.160
 3 opel with our 3 paper we make 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.680
 a book like I want I have and now 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.800
 this good postman table that stays 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.160
 no no no better we are not here is very ugly 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.220
 I do not like it that's why I'm going to make a table 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.290
 much better doing 6 crafter then 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.290
 they give us a clear ink and bowl 3 the 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.270
 we took and pronounced it here as you see it is 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.150
 a table of character a different villa 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.430
 when we get closer this opens with 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.610
 this new table lineup that 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.620
 worry about not knowing some crafter 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.980
 let's imagine that we come with a piece of 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.900
 wood and with three of copleston we give 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.390
 Right click Adam wrote and you eat 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.939
 magic all the postmen appear to us 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.549
 everything we are going to do with these two 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:12.310
 things are four things 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.590
 as you see by one make a sword I have 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.920
 done with these months we 're going to 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.920
 do more 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.200
 I do not have to leave it here 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.030
 we can do something else so not 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.780
 we can do nothing else but if we take 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.080
 three of koleston as you see again 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.520
 we can do something something more a sword 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.930
 a shovel and with them perfectly 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.180
 we are not bringing anything else just bring this 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.240
 Postman base the truth is that it serves 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.190
 much in some series of much with 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.710
 many ways or in some way in 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.960
 special not if you do not know the poster 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.869
 you need to enter the forum with this mod 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.560
 you can serve the poster better you do not have 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.450
 what to know but that this tells you 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.400
 he says what he can do good vale 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.009
 I hope that August this little review 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.240
 of this little mod and we are not in the 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.830
 installation of the mod 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.450
 we are in the crafting insert 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.550
 'tablet' 3 for mccarthy we have to 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.500
 go up to three pages in the first 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.900
 page we go down until we arrive and out 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.350
 louds here it is and we leave the most 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.280
 recent client apply you download 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.420
 ok we go to the second link 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.210
 we go down 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.430
 reason for the direct double 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.250
 accept if we want the previous version 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.200
 the version and we have to have we go 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.290
 to minecraft forget was no longer recommended 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.570
 but before we go down a little here I can 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.630
 see previous versions 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.990
 in my case of a recommended 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.270
 once we are here client 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.860
 we click 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.780
 we are talking to accept 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.120
 once we have the three files 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.060
 downloaded we all went to 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.610
 desk for the best handling in the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.610
 desktop we 're going to start users 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.120
 of xp to lose to execute and there 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.820
 we wrote % up the data percent 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.460
 noam and we enter minecraft we enter 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.850

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.290
 once in the archivist winner me time 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.450
 click delete if we open module of 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.760
 we select everything and we pass it to 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.930
 to accept 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:35.120
 we open mime forget and we do the same 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:38.180

 we open the folder that we have minimized 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:47.090
 here we click back and create a 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.170
 new folder and new folder in the 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.409
 name m 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.450
 that way we go enter 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.230
 we will have that folder and what we see 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.940
 what to do is to pass this file here 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.400
 once this is done we have already 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.340
