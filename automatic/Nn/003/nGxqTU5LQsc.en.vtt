00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.040
 1000ps live on the motorcycles 2014 in 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.380
 Dortmund 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.480
 I want to stand here at the suzuki booth 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.490
 jan breckwoldt jan 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.170
 suzuki is again gsx yes if 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.090
 international racing again completely 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.400
 in the front 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.850
 what can the hobby pilot do with you? 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.099
 to experience this year on the race track 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.210
 Of course we have several 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.060
 race track training every year the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.230
 are offered both from the club of 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.279
 us directly as well as from different ones 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.980
 tour operators 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.630
 For example, we have harbor running 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.440
 trainings brand new this year 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.789
 completely on the gsx-r of course 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.370
 brands open but here are the 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.960
 instructors especially on gsx-r too 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.750
 trained and also on the way 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.440
 but we also have the gsx for example 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.480
 r cup that it is a hobby race series for 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.120
 anyone 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.920
 the on eight race tracks this year in 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.150
 Germany and in the near foreign country 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.229
 Austria once Belgium is on the way 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.439
 which is very popular 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.350
 where we have full starter classes and 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.939
 then last but not least, of course, in the middle 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.240
 of the year always the european suzuki 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.070
 not this year in hockenheim 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.229
 but probably in oschersleben 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.750
 but there the information will come soon 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.549
 you can maybe even more precise 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.950
 to say briefly what is it for the cup 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.640
 package and at what cost 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.710
 I calculate 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.040
 we have such a cup motorcycle here 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.150
 stand there or there was from us 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.119
 a complete package 14,990 euros the 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.950
 included the motorcycle itself all 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.960
 died helmet a helmet 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.880
 Parts package and had to quasi only 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.429
 then assembled by a dealer 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.920
 So to speak, that was actually very 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.799
 popular because, of course, at the price of it 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.720
 hardly the motorcycle actually with 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.189
 so covered that was very very good 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.350
 package what we could do what 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.689
 That's why it was very popular 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.940
 also very successful for many years 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.860
 and i have suzuki i think a lot 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.590
 interesting novelty namely the v stream 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.720
 1000 abs i have already driven her and 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.920
 I think you have to drive and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.019
 to stand to understand what that is 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.810
 motorcycle can have which possibilities 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.630
 I am there as a customer that it exactly 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.150
 That's what we mean, we have to 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.900
 That the customer should use the motorcycle 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.430
 run over 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.040
 This is of course with every dealer 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.349
 each of us has a dealer a demo 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.989
 standing ready for a vehicle 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.650
 test drive we will additionally one 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.290
 to organize a small demo road show 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.819
 exclusively with the V 1000 stream the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.220
 will be the whole year round 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.859
 Seasonally in Germany on the way 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.940
 We are at dealer events we 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.299
 but also go to motorcycle 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.920
 meeting places that are known and let 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.120
 or give the possibility that 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.920
 motorcycle test drive 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.920
 Many thanks sir
