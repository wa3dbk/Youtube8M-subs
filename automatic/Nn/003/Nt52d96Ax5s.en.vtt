instance<00:01:01.370> rolling<00:01:01.790> in<00:01:01.880> 15<00:01:02.330> to<00:01:02.570> 20<00:01:02.930> feet<00:01:03.110> of

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
instance rolling in 15 to 20 feet of

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.689 
instance rolling in 15 to 20 feet of
water<00:01:03.380> in<00:01:03.590> some<00:01:03.830> cases<00:01:04.040> we<00:01:04.280> caught<00:01:04.489> him<00:01:04.610> as

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
water in some cases we caught him as

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.280 
water in some cases we caught him as
shallow<00:01:04.910> as<00:01:05.000> 13<00:01:05.420> or<00:01:05.540> 14

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
shallow as 13 or 14

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.830 
shallow as 13 or 14
so<00:01:06.770> really<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.880> planer<00:01:08.090> board<00:01:08.330> is<00:01:08.479> a<00:01:08.750> great

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
so really the planer board is a great

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.870 
so really the planer board is a great
presentation<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:09.979> of<00:01:10.310> course<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.550> spoon<00:01:10.790> has

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
presentation and of course the spoon has

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.280 
presentation and of course the spoon has
been<00:01:11.000> doing<00:01:11.150> a<00:01:11.270> nice<00:01:11.450> job<00:01:11.540> for<00:01:11.930> us<00:01:11.960> as<00:01:12.110> well

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
been doing a nice job for us as well

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.690 
been doing a nice job for us as well
because<00:01:12.380> some<00:01:12.710> non<00:01:12.830> wobble<00:01:13.160> grows<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.520> caught

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
because some non wobble grows and caught

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.370 
because some non wobble grows and caught
someone<00:01:14.060> on<00:01:14.420> spoons<00:01:14.810> if<00:01:14.990> you<00:01:15.080> can<00:01:15.200> caught<00:01:15.350> a

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
someone on spoons if you can caught a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.680 
someone on spoons if you can caught a
couple<00:01:15.560> of<00:01:15.770> them<00:01:15.890> on<00:01:16.070> flat<00:01:16.820> fish<00:01:17.060> but<00:01:17.600> the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
couple of them on flat fish but the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.180 
couple of them on flat fish but the
spoon<00:01:17.900> seems<00:01:18.140> to<00:01:18.229> be<00:01:18.290> heating<00:01:18.590> up<00:01:18.680> now

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
spoon seems to be heating up now

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.940 
spoon seems to be heating up now
now<00:01:19.550> the<00:01:20.060> spoon<00:01:20.360> itself<00:01:20.810> is<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.020> great<00:01:21.320> lure<00:01:21.619> but

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
now the spoon itself is a great lure but

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.859 
now the spoon itself is a great lure but
they<00:01:22.100> have<00:01:22.280> no<00:01:22.550> ability<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:23.090> get<00:01:23.330> down<00:01:23.570> to

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
they have no ability to get down to

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.359 
they have no ability to get down to
depth<00:01:24.140> on<00:01:24.350> their<00:01:24.619> own<00:01:24.770> they<00:01:24.979> have<00:01:25.160> to<00:01:25.280> be

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
depth on their own they have to be

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.830 
depth on their own they have to be
fished<00:01:25.610> in<00:01:25.759> conjunction<00:01:26.090> with<00:01:26.420> something<00:01:26.630> to

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
fished in conjunction with something to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.200 
fished in conjunction with something to
get<00:01:26.930> them<00:01:27.050> down<00:01:27.310> most<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:28.640> know<00:01:28.729> salmon<00:01:29.090> guys

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
get them down most you know salmon guys

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.760 
get them down most you know salmon guys
we<00:01:29.360> push<00:01:29.540> them<00:01:29.630> on<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.810> diving<00:01:30.050> planer<00:01:30.470> well<00:01:30.680> in

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
we push them on a diving planer well in

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.020 
we push them on a diving planer well in
this<00:01:30.890> instance<00:01:31.280> because<00:01:31.399> we're<00:01:31.610> only<00:01:31.759> go<00:01:31.880> into

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
this instance because we're only go into

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.609 
this instance because we're only go into
a<00:01:32.119> short<00:01:32.450> depth<00:01:32.690> and<00:01:33.170> then<00:01:33.259> we<00:01:33.320> need<00:01:33.440> to<00:01:33.470> get

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
a short depth and then we need to get

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.650 
a short depth and then we need to get
down<00:01:33.770> about<00:01:33.890> 10<00:01:34.220> to<00:01:34.310> 12<00:01:34.520> feet<00:01:34.640> we're<00:01:35.360> using<00:01:35.509> a

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
down about 10 to 12 feet we're using a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.990 
down about 10 to 12 feet we're using a
tadpole<00:01:36.020> sinker<00:01:36.740> which<00:01:36.920> is<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.340> diving<00:01:37.610> planner

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
tadpole sinker which is a diving planner

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.730 
tadpole sinker which is a diving planner
made<00:01:38.240> by<00:01:38.360> offshore<00:01:38.570> tackle<00:01:39.200> it's<00:01:39.560> not

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
made by offshore tackle it's not

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.960 
made by offshore tackle it's not
directional<00:01:40.250> it<00:01:40.310> just<00:01:40.490> goes<00:01:40.610> straight<00:01:40.910> down

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
directional it just goes straight down

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.210 
directional it just goes straight down
in<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.390> water<00:01:41.600> but<00:01:42.170> it's<00:01:42.320> enough<00:01:42.740> weight<00:01:42.979> to

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
in the water but it's enough weight to

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.859 
in the water but it's enough weight to
get<00:01:43.340> us<00:01:43.460> down<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:43.850> 10<00:01:44.090> 12<00:01:44.420> foot<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:44.720> we're

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
get us down that 10 12 foot that we're

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.990 
get us down that 10 12 foot that we're
looking<00:01:44.990> for<00:01:45.350> over<00:01:45.619> 15<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.039> 24<00:01:46.399> walk<00:01:46.640> then

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
looking for over 15 to 24 walk then

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.869 
looking for over 15 to 24 walk then
working<00:01:47.180> good<00:01:47.450> for<00:01:47.660> today
