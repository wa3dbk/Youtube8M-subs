00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.949
 primary 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:08.149
 I'll put 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:10.709
 c2 d 15h 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.709

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:24.789
 or kilo 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:29.399
 Let's forget 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.909
 from bh this opinion is 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.519
 it took a little bit 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.139

 on them 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.590
 I wonder why 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.900
 a guy who dies are asphalted 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.900

 one gold and one bronze 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.699
 wait for timing 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.210
 at the meeting

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.779

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:25.559
