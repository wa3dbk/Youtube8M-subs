00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.460

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.940
 very fast five tips can be in the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.410
 research the choice is in the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.320
 research will be very important to 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.720
 you because what the county is to keep 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.730
 away for those who are starting what 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.949
 It is in the polls so well dense 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.890
 more complicated to use and you 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.500
 use posted tapirs that mimic 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.599
 plus the curvature of the eyelash release more 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.870
 Good God, if you wash your eyelashes and your car is too 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.020
 easier to be applied taking into 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.960
 Attention also the band of the eyelashes this 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.899
 is the vase of false eyelashes has a 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.000
 It 's better for you guys to start 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.680
 use because it's easier to 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.510
 More comfortable is invisible Evando 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.579
 elastic or unicorns with you 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.960
 they want to call transparent is more 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.820
 easy to cut in your eyelashes yes 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.760
 this is very very important 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.920
 Take the box band here in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.950
 chair of the box measure with the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.590
 floor and cuts in everything stays in chief 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.180
 only the most important part is played 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.640
 long eyelash 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.500
 union will be easier if they steal from 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.689
 The smallest part I need 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.900
 more dramatic in the hands that go 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.490
 saying is very important 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.920
 other advice I give is put into 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.470
 quality colleges in schools such as 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.020
 kits are rarely the care will not 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.509
 last a long time and I'll be more 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.880
 we have focused on three bets on values 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.229
 quality and only bearers bid 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.360
 contacts go to waterproof glue 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.000
 not only because of the fact that I recommend you 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.909
 in your makeup use braille 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.009
 snow or before or after the application of 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.170
 Too bad it's up to you to prefer 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.570
 but in this way you, besides 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.340
 they stay as sweeping makeup go 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.350
 hide any error that is in the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.259
 justice and will also be able to camouflage 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.719
 the band much better then these five 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.969
 I have it for you and now you want it. 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.649
 knowing clinics is that you 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.210
 we know our concerns when 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.230
 You take care you're not in the searches. 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.090
 Do not forget to leave your 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.890
 comment below hope 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.040

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.040
