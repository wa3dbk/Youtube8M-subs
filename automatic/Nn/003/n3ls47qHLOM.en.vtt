 good here as promised there is the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.150
 castle so I'm not alone with 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.280
 my cameraman but food that 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.200
 mike reid is holding the VCR then 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.880
 you see the castle there just behind 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.289
 look here there is a huge field 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.020
 So here is a path that roof battle 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.560
 hip hop cuckoo this is pascal here is the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.949
 tired time my post voila here is my 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.510
 mate 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.340
 and then to dole that there is a whole 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.289
 choice all h matou task not all h mcl 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.079
 there are some who hold here there was 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.219
 two houses so on a four 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.170
 16th century 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.489
 Well, we were not wrong because 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.899
 I make you rare what we have 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.640
 found our water our first 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:48.570
 find 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:57.030
 so here's the hole we're going to get close and 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:58.890
 we go the mug and halit here that is then 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.270
 a nanou makes an alliance one can 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.399
 call it an alliance a signet ring 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.379
 we do not know where pascal no I think 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.570
 that there so unclear 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.280
 but here is a nice little motive 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.100
 so it's a silver alliance I 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.909
 you clean all that we'll do a little 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.909
 the weight too here 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:30.990
 the gent will start to clean up a little 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.990
 we will do a little point 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.690
 so I hope you will see 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:48.430
 something we do not see anything necessarily 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:50.410
 I'm not pro here is ah yes in time there 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.020
 there is even a second drawing because he 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:57.100
 there was a crown of oversupply and even 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:04.180
 a magnificent crown are all these 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:09.820
 to approach it not too much but 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:15.070
 here we see that it is silver 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:17.650
 if there is not because she looks so 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:21.570
 you can clean matters if we see a 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.570
 punch of times in position 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.340
 here I make you enjoy a little low 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.340
 see what a horror 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.660
 before the cepi normal sense this is in 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:38.459
 necessarily this field we will do it 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:41.680
 completely do not see what with 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.780

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.299
 Voting care fingers here Dockers

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.769
 strong as you go 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.910
 if he's willing then it's totally blurry 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:18.549
 chouÃ¯a still as usual it looks like a 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.940
 good for time stamped you see 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:25.540
 yeah but surely see if the other side 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.980
 this is the he does not want to make the point he 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.959
 is what the tour saw 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.489
