light through his signal so let me show
you<00:02:04.920> guys<00:02:05.659> how<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.869> works

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
you guys how that works

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.449 
you guys how that works
ears<00:02:07.619> are<00:02:08.220> glued<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.720> his<00:02:10.590> head

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
ears are glued to his head

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.699 
ears are glued to his head
which<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.569> really<00:02:13.079> kind<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.439> little

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
which it's really kind of a little

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.949 
which it's really kind of a little
awkward<00:02:14.099> because<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.459> thought<00:02:14.939> maybe<00:02:15.599> when<00:02:15.930> I

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
awkward because I thought maybe when I

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.170 
awkward because I thought maybe when I
opened<00:02:16.379> it<00:02:16.469> in<00:02:16.590> package<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.370> broke<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:18.000> some

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
opened it in package it broke for some

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.550 
opened it in package it broke for some
reason<00:02:18.569> but<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:19.049> think<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.890> came<00:02:20.250> like<00:02:20.549> that<00:02:20.579> so

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
reason but I think it came like that so

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.559 
reason but I think it came like that so
yeah<00:02:22.560> pretty<00:02:23.340> much<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.790> was<00:02:24.090> kind<00:02:24.329> of<00:02:24.359> weird

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
yeah pretty much it was kind of weird

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.599 
yeah pretty much it was kind of weird
because<00:02:24.689> you<00:02:24.930> had<00:02:25.049> to<00:02:25.140> be<00:02:25.260> it's<00:02:25.799> you<00:02:26.280> know<00:02:26.430> if

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
because you had to be it's you know if

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.280 
because you had to be it's you know if
you<00:02:26.700> plan<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:26.939> play<00:02:27.180> around<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.900> figure

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
you plan to play around this is figure

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.170 
you plan to play around this is figure
what<00:02:28.530> not<00:02:28.709> or<00:02:28.980> if<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.489> decide<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.849> want<00:02:30.120> to

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
what not or if you decide to want to

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.030 
what not or if you decide to want to
give<00:02:30.329> it<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.450> when<00:02:30.719> your<00:02:30.900> kids<00:02:32.599> just<00:02:33.599> you<00:02:34.040> mind

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
give it to when your kids just you mind

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.360 
give it to when your kids just you mind
that<00:02:35.730> those<00:02:36.180> years<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.480> my<00:02:36.629> time<00:02:36.870> off<00:02:37.109> lower<00:02:37.920> of

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
that those years of my time off lower of

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.709

his<00:02:38.609> legs<00:02:38.939> they<00:02:39.689> are<00:02:39.959> very<00:02:40.859> heavy<00:02:41.129> and<00:02:41.719> maybe

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
his legs they are very heavy and maybe

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.210 
his legs they are very heavy and maybe
they're<00:02:42.930> heavy<00:02:43.139> because<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.530> lot<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.950> wires

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
they're heavy because a lot of the wires

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.780 
they're heavy because a lot of the wires
from<00:02:44.909> actually<00:02:45.810> bulbs<00:02:46.319> are<00:02:46.739> attached<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.609> his

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
legs maybe in the inside so maybe that's

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.300 
legs maybe in the inside so maybe that's
why<00:02:51.090> they're<00:02:51.329> pretty<00:02:51.540> heavy<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:52.079> yeah<00:02:52.310> the
