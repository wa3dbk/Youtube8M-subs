00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
bit slower than most AK forty-sevens not

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.970 
bit slower than most AK forty-sevens not
really<00:05:34.330> much<00:05:34.450> of<00:05:34.510> a<00:05:34.690> difference<00:05:35.140> then<00:05:35.800> also

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
really much of a difference then also

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.070 
really much of a difference then also
had<00:05:36.250> moderate<00:05:36.580> recoil<00:05:36.850> but<00:05:37.300> again<00:05:37.600> it<00:05:37.780> was<00:05:37.900> an

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
had moderate recoil but again it was an

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.870 
had moderate recoil but again it was an
ak-47<00:05:38.980> which<00:05:39.100> meant<00:05:39.340> that<00:05:39.400> it<00:05:39.580> had<00:05:39.610> that

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
ak-47 which meant that it had that

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.880 
ak-47 which meant that it had that
pretty<00:05:40.180> predictable<00:05:40.600> and<00:05:41.050> manageable<00:05:41.740> recoil

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
pretty predictable and manageable recoil

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.500 
pretty predictable and manageable recoil
so<00:05:44.890> which<00:05:45.100> one<00:05:45.310> of<00:05:45.340> these<00:05:45.520> three<00:05:45.580> weapons<00:05:46.150> that

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
so which one of these three weapons that

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.000 
so which one of these three weapons that
you<00:05:46.660> guys<00:05:46.810> think<00:05:47.110> is<00:05:47.230> the<00:05:47.350> best<00:05:47.560> it<00:05:47.830> could<00:05:47.950> be

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
you guys think is the best it could be

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.380 
you guys think is the best it could be
that<00:05:48.220> maybe<00:05:48.400> you<00:05:48.550> just<00:05:48.700> thought<00:05:48.910> one<00:05:49.150> felt

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
that maybe you just thought one felt

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.120 
that maybe you just thought one felt
better<00:05:49.570> than<00:05:49.750> the<00:05:49.930> other<00:05:50.050> maybe<00:05:50.590> you<00:05:50.770> felt<00:05:51.040> I

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
better than the other maybe you felt I

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.560 
better than the other maybe you felt I
won't<00:05:51.310> was<00:05:51.400> statistically<00:05:52.030> better<00:05:52.180> than<00:05:52.450> the

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
won't was statistically better than the

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.930 
won't was statistically better than the
other<00:05:52.720> or<00:05:53.110> maybe<00:05:53.320> that<00:05:53.500> nostalgia<00:05:54.100> factor<00:05:54.580> is

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
other or maybe that nostalgia factor is

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.580 
other or maybe that nostalgia factor is
what's<00:05:55.150> making<00:05:55.720> you<00:05:56.020> think<00:05:56.230> that<00:05:56.440> one<00:05:56.560> is

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
what's making you think that one is

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.080 
what's making you think that one is
better<00:05:56.710> than<00:05:56.950> the<00:05:57.070> other<00:05:57.250> leave<00:05:57.820> a<00:05:57.850> comment

see some of these comments so which one
of<00:06:11.350> these<00:06:11.500> three<00:06:11.800> weapons<00:06:12.100> was<00:06:12.580> better<00:06:12.880> was<00:06:13.420> it

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
of these three weapons was better was it

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.110 
of these three weapons was better was it
the<00:06:13.660> ak-47<00:06:14.470> from<00:06:14.500> cod4<00:06:14.830> from<00:06:15.670> modern<00:06:15.940> warfare

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
the ak-47 from cod4 from modern warfare

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.420 
the ak-47 from cod4 from modern warfare
2<00:06:16.450> or<00:06:16.660> from<00:06:16.930> modern<00:06:17.170> warfare<00:06:17.380> 3<00:06:17.560> and<00:06:18.010> the

2 or from modern warfare 3 and the

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.690 
2 or from modern warfare 3 and the
answer<00:06:18.730> is<00:06:18.760> the<00:06:19.500> ak-47<00:06:20.500> from<00:06:20.680> modern<00:06:21.430> warfare

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
answer is the ak-47 from modern warfare

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.270 
answer is the ak-47 from modern warfare
3<00:06:21.880> now<00:06:22.840> even<00:06:23.080> though<00:06:23.350> it<00:06:23.470> did<00:06:23.650> have<00:06:23.830> a<00:06:23.860> slower

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
3 now even though it did have a slower

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.950 
3 now even though it did have a slower
rate<00:06:24.370> of<00:06:24.640> fire<00:06:24.850> than<00:06:25.120> the<00:06:25.270> other<00:06:25.480> AK

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
rate of fire than the other AK

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.420 
rate of fire than the other AK
forty-sevens<00:06:25.990> it<00:06:26.710> was<00:06:26.800> not<00:06:27.010> enough<00:06:27.280> to<00:06:27.310> really

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
forty-sevens it was not enough to really

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.670 
forty-sevens it was not enough to really
deteriorate<00:06:28.120> it<00:06:28.270> did<00:06:28.630> more<00:06:28.840> damage<00:06:28.870> had<00:06:29.440> more

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
deteriorate it did more damage had more

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.470 
deteriorate it did more damage had more
of<00:06:29.770> an<00:06:29.830> effective<00:06:30.310> headshot<00:06:30.730> multiplier<00:06:30.880> and

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
of an effective headshot multiplier and

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.860 
of an effective headshot multiplier and
had<00:06:31.870> manageable<00:06:32.410> recoil<00:06:32.950> overhaul<00:06:33.760> the<00:06:33.970> ak-47

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
had manageable recoil overhaul the ak-47

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.600 
had manageable recoil overhaul the ak-47
for<00:06:35.050> modern<00:06:35.320> warfare<00:06:35.500> 3<00:06:35.680> was<00:06:36.040> just<00:06:36.280> better

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
for modern warfare 3 was just better

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.520 
for modern warfare 3 was just better
