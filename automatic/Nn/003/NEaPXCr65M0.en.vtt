they're<00:05:47.280> pearly<00:05:47.640> gates<00:05:47.880> or<00:05:48.150> something<00:05:48.540> but

bit<00:05:54.060> harder<00:05:54.420> to<00:05:54.450> really<00:05:55.050> be<00:05:55.260> able<00:05:55.410> to<00:05:55.500> use<00:05:55.680> it

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
bit harder to really be able to use it

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.610 
bit harder to really be able to use it
for<00:05:56.880> myself<00:05:57.300> with<00:05:57.510> some<00:05:57.660> humbuckers<00:05:58.200> but<00:05:58.410> for
