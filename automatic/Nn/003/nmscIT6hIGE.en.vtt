TRO<00:00:24.660> fast<00:00:24.930> storage<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.590> was<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.070> awesome

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
TRO fast storage it was just so awesome

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.980 
TRO fast storage it was just so awesome
these<00:00:26.820> little<00:00:27.060> bins<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.480> come<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.869> out

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
these little bins that come in and out

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.740 
these little bins that come in and out
were<00:00:28.289> just<00:00:28.680> perfect<00:00:29.220> for<00:00:29.460> storing<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.060> Legos

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
were just perfect for storing the Legos

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.900 
were just perfect for storing the Legos
and<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.560> loved<00:00:31.800> how<00:00:31.980> sturdy<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.579> entire

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
and I just loved how sturdy the entire

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.090 
and I just loved how sturdy the entire
thing<00:00:33.239> was<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.809> thought<00:00:33.989> it'd<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.170> great<00:00:34.380> to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
thing was and I thought it'd be great to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.770 
thing was and I thought it'd be great to
create<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.460> Lego<00:00:35.640> play<00:00:35.940> area<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.570> table

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
create the Lego play area of this table

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.069 
create the Lego play area of this table
I<00:00:37.050> use<00:00:37.320> six<00:00:37.649> Lego<00:00:38.160> base<00:00:38.610> plates<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.239> ton<00:00:40.050> of

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
I use six Lego base plates a ton of

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.940 
I use six Lego base plates a ton of
Krazy<00:00:40.590> Glue<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.960> super<00:00:42.960> sharp<00:00:43.170> scissors<00:00:43.649> and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
Krazy Glue and super sharp scissors and

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.590 
Krazy Glue and super sharp scissors and
a<00:00:44.070> sharpie<00:00:44.489> for<00:00:44.700> marking<00:00:45.030> where<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.239> needed<00:00:45.510> to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
a sharpie for marking where I needed to

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.720 
a sharpie for marking where I needed to
cut<00:00:45.920> when<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.950> first<00:00:47.219> thought<00:00:47.340> about<00:00:47.550> doing

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
cut when I first thought about doing

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.279 
cut when I first thought about doing
this<00:00:47.850> project<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.510> thought<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.840> would<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.050> just

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
this project I thought it would be just

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.200 
this project I thought it would be just
as<00:00:49.410> simple<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.309> gluing<00:00:50.610> down<00:00:50.730> base

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
as simple as just gluing down base

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.090 
as simple as just gluing down base
plates<00:00:51.570> onto<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.170> table<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.710> being

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
plates onto the table and just being

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.700 
plates onto the table and just being
done<00:00:53.340> with<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:54.000> after<00:00:54.690> putting<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.379> few<00:00:55.590> of

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
done with it but after putting a few of

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.010 
done with it but after putting a few of
them<00:00:55.860> together<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.610> actually<00:00:56.730> gluing<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:57.480> of

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
them together and actually gluing one of

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.660 
them together and actually gluing one of
the<00:00:58.140> base<00:00:58.289> plates<00:00:58.590> down<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.219> then<00:00:59.340> gluing<00:00:59.520> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the base plates down and then gluing a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.180 
the base plates down and then gluing a
second<00:01:00.090> one<00:01:00.210> down<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.690> realized<00:01:01.530> when<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.890> tried

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
second one down I realized when I tried

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.920 
second one down I realized when I tried
to<00:01:02.219> use<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> Lego<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> Lego

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
to use a Lego on it that the Lego

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.020 
to use a Lego on it that the Lego
actually<00:01:04.470> wasn't<00:01:04.739> fitting<00:01:05.280> where<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> seams

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
actually wasn't fitting where the seams

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.289 
actually wasn't fitting where the seams
were<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.020> connected<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> two<00:01:07.560> base<00:01:07.920> plates

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.880 

so<00:01:12.299> after<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.630> managed<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.170> rip<00:01:13.380> off<00:01:13.590> had

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
so after I managed to rip off had

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.230 
so after I managed to rip off had
original<00:01:14.310> base<00:01:14.490> plate<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:14.970> had<00:01:15.090> already

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
original base plate that I had already

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.690 
original base plate that I had already
glued<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.960> then<00:01:16.439> took<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.830> time<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.340> put<00:01:17.490> all

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
glued on I then took the time to put all

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.370 
glued on I then took the time to put all
of<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.939> base<00:01:18.090> plates<00:01:18.450> out<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.869> figure<00:01:19.080> out<00:01:19.200> how

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
of the base plates out to figure out how

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.990 
of the base plates out to figure out how
many<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.650> actually<00:01:19.920> needed<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.610> cut<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
many I actually needed to cut up to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.149 
many I actually needed to cut up to
begin<00:01:21.330> with<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.869> then<00:01:22.259> also<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:23.040> of

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
begin with and then also to kind of

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.649 
begin with and then also to kind of
figure<00:01:23.430> out<00:01:23.490> where<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.180> going<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.570> be

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
figure out where I was going to be

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.690 
figure out where I was going to be
placing<00:01:25.229> things<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.799> kind<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.280> checking

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
placing things and kind of just checking

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.569 
placing things and kind of just checking
out<00:01:26.850> where<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.390> needed<00:01:27.750> stuff<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.400> go<00:01:29.400> from

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
out where I needed stuff and go from

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.030 
out where I needed stuff and go from
there

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.290 

after<00:01:34.040> I<00:01:34.100> was<00:01:34.280> happy<00:01:34.610> with<00:01:34.790> where<00:01:34.940> things<00:01:35.150> are

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
after I was happy with where things are

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.700 
after I was happy with where things are
placed<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:35.780> where<00:01:35.960> I<00:01:35.990> was<00:01:36.170> actually<00:01:36.320> going<00:01:36.590> to

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
placed and where I was actually going to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.100 
placed and where I was actually going to
put<00:01:36.980> stuff<00:01:37.280> on<00:01:37.490> top<00:01:37.790> of<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.240> storage<00:01:38.600> unit<00:01:38.930> I

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
put stuff on top of the storage unit I

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.990 
put stuff on top of the storage unit I
then<00:01:39.560> started<00:01:39.890> doing<00:01:40.190> my<00:01:40.310> markings<00:01:40.760> for<00:01:40.940> where

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
then started doing my markings for where

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.450 
then started doing my markings for where
I<00:01:41.180> was<00:01:41.300> going<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.750> cut<00:01:41.960> things<00:01:42.260> I<00:01:42.500> did<00:01:42.980> not<00:01:43.160> put

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
I was going to cut things I did not put

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.400 
I was going to cut things I did not put
the<00:01:43.790> Lego<00:01:44.270> base<00:01:44.600> plates<00:01:44.930> all<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.260> way<00:01:45.350> to

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
the Lego base plates all the way to

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.469 
the Lego base plates all the way to
every<00:01:45.800> end<00:01:45.979> I<00:01:46.280> kind<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:46.729> stopped<00:01:47.000> it<00:01:47.210> where

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
every end I kind of stopped it where

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.690 
every end I kind of stopped it where
these<00:01:48.110> little<00:01:48.350> lines<00:01:48.560> were<00:01:48.830> on<00:01:49.070> top<00:01:49.430> just

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
these little lines were on top just

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.830 
these little lines were on top just
because<00:01:49.880> I<00:01:50.090> thought<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:50.510> looked<00:01:50.600> more

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
because I thought it looked more

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.600 
because I thought it looked more
aesthetically<00:01:51.290> pleasing<00:01:51.350> so<00:01:52.190> I<00:01:52.250> wanted<00:01:52.490> to

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
aesthetically pleasing so I wanted to

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.890 
aesthetically pleasing so I wanted to
make<00:01:52.760> sure<00:01:52.940> that<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.270> had<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.660> right

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
make sure that I had the right

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.660 
make sure that I had the right
measurements<00:01:54.440> on<00:01:54.530> each<00:01:54.710> side<00:01:55.010> so<00:01:55.310> I<00:01:55.340> used<00:01:55.580> my

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
measurements on each side so I used my

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.820 
measurements on each side so I used my
permanent<00:01:56.060> marker<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.930> make<00:01:57.080> marks<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:57.680> where

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
permanent marker to make marks to where

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.230 
permanent marker to make marks to where
I<00:01:57.860> was<00:01:57.979> going<00:01:58.160> to<00:01:58.220> cut<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.700> then<00:01:58.850> I<00:01:58.940> went<00:01:59.060> from

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
I was going to cut and then I went from

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.490 
I was going to cut and then I went from
there<00:02:01.690> now<00:02:02.690> it's<00:02:02.869> really<00:02:02.990> important<00:02:03.440> that

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
there now it's really important that

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.719 
there now it's really important that
when<00:02:03.650> you're<00:02:03.770> cutting<00:02:03.979> your<00:02:04.160> Lego<00:02:04.460> base

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
when you're cutting your Lego base

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:05.980 
when you're cutting your Lego base
plates<00:02:05.030> that<00:02:05.180> you<00:02:05.300> have<00:02:05.450> really<00:02:05.750> sharp

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
plates that you have really sharp

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.749 
plates that you have really sharp
scissors<00:02:06.500> even<00:02:07.100> though<00:02:07.220> they'll<00:02:07.369> get<00:02:07.550> Lego

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
scissors even though they'll get Lego

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.030 
scissors even though they'll get Lego
base<00:02:08.060> plates<00:02:08.390> are<00:02:08.570> pretty<00:02:09.050> soft<00:02:09.440> compared<00:02:09.920> to

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
base plates are pretty soft compared to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.729 
base plates are pretty soft compared to
most<00:02:10.160> plastics<00:02:10.850> they<00:02:11.300> are<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:11.840> plastic<00:02:12.470> and

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
most plastics they are so plastic and

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.130 
most plastics they are so plastic and
you<00:02:12.830> do<00:02:13.070> want<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.459> very<00:02:13.790> clean<00:02:14.239> cut<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.870> an<00:02:14.959> edge

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
you do want a very clean cut of an edge

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.050 
you do want a very clean cut of an edge
so<00:02:15.709> I<00:02:15.739> was<00:02:16.010> really<00:02:16.160> happy<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.550> picked<00:02:16.850> these

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
so I was really happy I picked these

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.640 
so I was really happy I picked these
really<00:02:17.420> super<00:02:17.600> sharp<00:02:17.989> scissors<00:02:18.320> up<00:02:18.470> at

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
really super sharp scissors up at

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.860 
really super sharp scissors up at
OfficeMax<00:02:19.370> before<00:02:19.910> because<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:20.630> don't<00:02:20.810> think

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
OfficeMax before because I don't think

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.540 
OfficeMax before because I don't think
regular<00:02:21.170> scissors<00:02:21.709> would<00:02:21.980> have<00:02:22.070> cut<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.370> and

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
regular scissors would have cut it and

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.949 
regular scissors would have cut it and
it<00:02:22.640> would<00:02:22.760> made<00:02:22.880> it<00:02:23.000> more<00:02:23.150> difficult<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:23.780> then

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
it would made it more difficult and then

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.199 
it would made it more difficult and then
also<00:02:24.140> left<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.680> edges<00:02:25.070> like<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.430> said<00:02:25.700> pretty

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
also left the edges like I said pretty

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.420 
also left the edges like I said pretty
ragged<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:26.959> I<00:02:27.050> wanted<00:02:27.320> a<00:02:27.410> clean<00:02:27.680> edge<00:02:27.890> since

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
ragged and I wanted a clean edge since

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.130 
ragged and I wanted a clean edge since
it<00:02:28.610> was<00:02:28.760> going<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.030> be<00:02:29.180> inside<00:02:29.660> our<00:02:29.690> living

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
it was going to be inside our living

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.170 
it was going to be inside our living
room<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.709> wanted<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.370> look<00:02:31.550> just<00:02:31.850> you

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
room and I wanted it to look just you

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.060 
room and I wanted it to look just you
know<00:02:32.330> really<00:02:32.630> nice<00:02:32.900> for<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.260> kids<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.680> also

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
know really nice for the kids and also

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.060 
know really nice for the kids and also
for<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.610> edges<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.180> fit<00:02:35.450> together<00:02:35.720> nicely

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.590 

after<00:02:40.070> I<00:02:40.340> was<00:02:40.489> done<00:02:40.610> cutting<00:02:40.880> my<00:02:41.060> first<00:02:41.360> piece

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
after I was done cutting my first piece

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.170 
after I was done cutting my first piece
I<00:02:41.780> then<00:02:42.110> decided<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.739> glue<00:02:42.860> down<00:02:43.190> my<00:02:43.430> first

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
I then decided to glue down my first

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.330 
I then decided to glue down my first
base<00:02:44.420> plate<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.900> just<00:02:45.230> get<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.830> ball<00:02:46.070> moving

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
base plate to just get the ball moving

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.770 
base plate to just get the ball moving
on<00:02:46.670> where<00:02:46.940> I<00:02:46.970> was<00:02:47.120> going<00:02:47.299> to<00:02:47.360> place<00:02:47.570> all

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
on where I was going to place all

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.630 
on where I was going to place all
everything<00:02:48.230> else<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.010> grabbed<00:02:49.220> my<00:02:49.250> crazy

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
everything else so I grabbed my crazy

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.880 
everything else so I grabbed my crazy
glue<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.239> I<00:02:50.420> basically<00:02:50.840> just<00:02:50.989> outlined<00:02:51.739> the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
glue and I basically just outlined the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.009 
glue and I basically just outlined the
outside<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.760> square<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.360> then<00:02:53.480> also<00:02:53.690> did

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
outside of the square and then also did

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.960 
outside of the square and then also did
an<00:02:54.140> X<00:02:54.380> in<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.799> middle<00:02:54.830> just<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.430> give<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.670> some

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
an X in the middle just to give it some

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.000 
an X in the middle just to give it some
more<00:02:56.000> security<00:02:56.630> because<00:02:57.470> when<00:02:57.680> you<00:02:57.769> pull<00:02:57.980> up

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
more security because when you pull up

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.009 
more security because when you pull up
Legos<00:02:58.519> off<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:58.970> base<00:02:59.120> plate<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.900> know

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
Legos off of a base plate you know

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.150 
Legos off of a base plate you know
there's<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.290> lot<00:03:00.440> of<00:03:00.470> pressure<00:03:00.739> that<00:03:00.980> comes

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
there's a lot of pressure that comes

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.979 
there's a lot of pressure that comes
from<00:03:01.430> taking<00:03:01.910> one<00:03:02.060> off<00:03:02.239> so<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:02.510> wanted<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.840> make

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
from taking one off so I wanted to make

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.960 
from taking one off so I wanted to make
sure<00:03:03.019> these<00:03:03.350> stuck<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:03.980> we're<00:03:04.430> really<00:03:04.730> really

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
sure these stuck and we're really really

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.789 
sure these stuck and we're really really
really<00:03:05.090> solid<00:03:05.720> for<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:05.959> kids<00:03:06.230> during<00:03:06.560> their

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
really solid for the kids during their

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.890 
really solid for the kids during their
play

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.050 

now<00:03:10.409> I<00:03:10.470> wanted<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.769> do<00:03:11.010> these<00:03:11.220> base<00:03:11.430> plates<00:03:11.670> one

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
now I wanted to do these base plates one

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.880 
now I wanted to do these base plates one
at<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.239> time<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.840> cut<00:03:13.260> them<00:03:13.470> one<00:03:13.650> at<00:03:13.799> a<00:03:13.860> time

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
at a time and cut them one at a time

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.520 
at a time and cut them one at a time
because<00:03:14.640> they<00:03:15.120> were<00:03:15.540> not<00:03:15.720> all<00:03:15.959> shaped<00:03:16.349> the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
because they were not all shaped the

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.470 
because they were not all shaped the
same<00:03:16.769> just<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:17.430> anything<00:03:17.970> that's<00:03:18.150> man-made

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
same just like anything that's man-made

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.809 
same just like anything that's man-made
or<00:03:19.080> even<00:03:19.409> machine<00:03:19.739> made<00:03:19.950> not<00:03:20.220> all<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.610> time

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
or even machine made not all the time

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.520 
or even machine made not all the time
are<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.090> edges<00:03:21.540> going<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.870> be<00:03:21.989> completely

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
are the edges going to be completely

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.619 
are the edges going to be completely
straight<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.159> things<00:03:23.849> like<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.239> stuff

straight and things like that stuff

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.289 
straight and things like that stuff

warps and key wood gets work during

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.869 
warps and key wood gets work during
packaging<00:03:28.049> or<00:03:28.349> whatnot<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.099> I<00:03:29.400> wanted<00:03:29.730> to

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
packaging or whatnot and so I wanted to

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.880 
packaging or whatnot and so I wanted to
make<00:03:30.060> sure<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.480> everything<00:03:30.959> cohesively<00:03:31.530> fit

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
make sure that everything cohesively fit

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.520 
make sure that everything cohesively fit
and<00:03:32.099> that<00:03:32.489> all<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.879> the<00:03:33.150> bumps<00:03:33.659> in<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.319> Lego

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
and that all of the bumps in the Lego

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.530 
and that all of the bumps in the Lego
base<00:03:34.860> plates<00:03:35.220> were<00:03:35.489> going<00:03:35.549> to<00:03:35.760> be<00:03:35.970> perfect

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
base plates were going to be perfect

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.300 
base plates were going to be perfect
together<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.379> that<00:03:37.590> all<00:03:37.799> of<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:38.040> LEGO<00:03:38.220> pieces

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
together so that all of the LEGO pieces

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.789 
together so that all of the LEGO pieces
would<00:03:38.790> fit<00:03:39.030> on<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.390> scenes<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.200> went<00:03:40.530> about

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
would fit on the scenes so I went about

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.890 
would fit on the scenes so I went about
this<00:03:41.190> at<00:03:41.459> one<00:03:41.730> at<00:03:41.879> a<00:03:41.970> time<00:03:42.150> just<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.870> I

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
this at one at a time just so that I

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.270 
this at one at a time just so that I
knew<00:03:43.109> that<00:03:43.260> they<00:03:43.379> would<00:03:43.530> all<00:03:43.709> fit<00:03:43.950> together

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
knew that they would all fit together

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.099 
knew that they would all fit together
correctly<00:03:44.519> instead<00:03:45.269> of<00:03:45.390> cutting<00:03:45.599> everything

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
correctly instead of cutting everything

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.190 
correctly instead of cutting everything
at<00:03:46.230> once<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.650> laying<00:03:47.129> it<00:03:47.280> all<00:03:47.400> out<00:03:48.140> now<00:03:49.140> to

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
at once and laying it all out now to

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.990 
at once and laying it all out now to
make<00:03:49.590> sure<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:50.010> all<00:03:50.160> of<00:03:50.190> my<00:03:50.459> seams<00:03:50.760> were

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
make sure that all of my seams were

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.180 
make sure that all of my seams were
going<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.209> be<00:03:51.420> flawless<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.319> that<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.799> Legos

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
going to be flawless and that the Legos

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.970 
going to be flawless and that the Legos
would<00:03:53.430> still<00:03:53.700> be<00:03:53.849> able<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.329> fit<00:03:55.049> with<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.769> two

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
would still be able to fit with the two

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.430 
would still be able to fit with the two
plates<00:03:56.340> put<00:03:56.730> together<00:03:56.909> I<00:03:57.420> did<00:03:58.019> make<00:03:58.230> sure<00:03:58.260> to

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
plates put together I did make sure to

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.979 
plates put together I did make sure to
keep<00:03:58.769> some<00:03:59.069> Legos<00:03:59.640> on<00:03:59.819> hand<00:04:00.269> of<00:04:00.510> course<00:04:00.780> we're

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
keep some Legos on hand of course we're

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.080 
keep some Legos on hand of course we're
surrounded<00:04:01.260> by<00:04:01.590> them<00:04:01.829> just<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.579> immediately

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
surrounded by them just to immediately

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.809 
surrounded by them just to immediately
put<00:04:03.510> onto<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:04.530> seams<00:04:04.859> just<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.430> make<00:04:05.640> sure

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
put onto the seams just to make sure

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.520 
put onto the seams just to make sure
that<00:04:06.030> they<00:04:06.180> were<00:04:06.239> fitting<00:04:06.690> before<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.290> glue

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
that they were fitting before the glue

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.740 
that they were fitting before the glue
dried<00:04:07.859> so<00:04:08.340> immediately<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:08.849> set<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.239> down<00:04:09.420> and

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
dried so immediately I set it down and

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.110 
dried so immediately I set it down and
then<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:09.900> put<00:04:10.200> another<00:04:10.230> Lego<00:04:10.859> across<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.909> seam

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
then I put another Lego across the seam

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.000 
then I put another Lego across the seam
just<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.690> make<00:04:12.870> sure<00:04:13.019> not<00:04:13.200> only<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.739> fit

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
just to make sure not only that it fit

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.979 
just to make sure not only that it fit
but<00:04:14.459> also<00:04:14.609> to<00:04:14.819> kind<00:04:15.060> of<00:04:15.120> lock<00:04:15.329> it<00:04:15.510> into<00:04:15.660> place

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
but also to kind of lock it into place

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.750 
but also to kind of lock it into place
and<00:04:16.019> so<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.440> could<00:04:16.650> still<00:04:16.889> kind<00:04:17.039> of<00:04:17.160> maneuver<00:04:17.639> it

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
and so I could still kind of maneuver it

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.000 
and so I could still kind of maneuver it
to<00:04:18.120> where<00:04:18.299> it<00:04:18.419> needed<00:04:18.599> to<00:04:18.720> be<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:19.229> found<00:04:19.620> out<00:04:19.829> the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
to where it needed to be I found out the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.890 
to where it needed to be I found out the
hard<00:04:20.160> way<00:04:20.280> like<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:20.760> said<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.510> just<00:04:21.539> by

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
hard way like I said that just by

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.480 
hard way like I said that just by
plopping<00:04:22.320> them<00:04:22.470> down<00:04:22.740> does<00:04:23.039> not<00:04:23.220> mean<00:04:23.460> that

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
plopping them down does not mean that

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.610 
plopping them down does not mean that
they<00:04:23.880> will<00:04:24.090> immediately<00:04:24.419> fit<00:04:24.930> even<00:04:25.320> if<00:04:25.440> their

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
they will immediately fit even if their

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.050 
they will immediately fit even if their
lines<00:04:25.889> are<00:04:26.099> straight<00:04:26.400> and<00:04:26.610> they're<00:04:26.910> up

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
lines are straight and they're up

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.730 
lines are straight and they're up
against<00:04:27.510> each<00:04:27.630> other<00:04:27.780> they're<00:04:28.169> all<00:04:28.410> made

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
against each other they're all made

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.650 
against each other they're all made
slightly<00:04:29.340> different<00:04:29.789> so<00:04:30.120> this<00:04:30.270> is<00:04:30.419> really

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
slightly different so this is really

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.270 
slightly different so this is really
important<00:04:31.050> that<00:04:31.169> you<00:04:31.289> do<00:04:31.440> this<00:04:31.590> or<00:04:31.889> your<00:04:32.039> seams

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
important that you do this or your seams

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.560 
important that you do this or your seams
are<00:04:32.460> going<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.639> be<00:04:32.760> uneven<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.270> then<00:04:33.450> the

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
are going to be uneven and then the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.750 
are going to be uneven and then the
Legos<00:04:33.930> will<00:04:34.200> not<00:04:34.380> stick<00:04:34.770> when<00:04:35.130> they<00:04:35.280> go<00:04:35.400> over

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
Legos will not stick when they go over

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.010 
Legos will not stick when they go over
there<00:04:35.910> which<00:04:36.060> will<00:04:36.240> make<00:04:36.389> a<00:04:36.419> very<00:04:36.690> frustrating

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
there which will make a very frustrating

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.680 
there which will make a very frustrating
play<00:04:37.590> for<00:04:38.130> a<00:04:38.160> five-year-old<00:04:39.060> six-year-old

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.890 

now<00:05:07.370> before<00:05:07.699> putting<00:05:07.970> my<00:05:08.090> finishing<00:05:08.389> pieces

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
now before putting my finishing pieces

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.990 
now before putting my finishing pieces
on<00:05:09.050> and<00:05:09.380> finishing<00:05:09.860> cutting<00:05:10.220> all<00:05:10.370> of<00:05:10.400> my<00:05:10.729> Lego

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
on and finishing cutting all of my Lego

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.089 
on and finishing cutting all of my Lego
base<00:05:11.300> plates<00:05:11.660> I<00:05:11.870> did<00:05:12.319> go<00:05:12.500> back<00:05:12.710> to<00:05:12.740> make<00:05:13.069> sure

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
base plates I did go back to make sure

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.059 
base plates I did go back to make sure
that<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:13.729> corners<00:05:14.270> all<00:05:14.479> connected<00:05:15.199> well<00:05:15.740> and

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069 
that the corners all connected well and

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:17.710 
that the corners all connected well and
that<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.280> Legos<00:05:16.610> could<00:05:16.789> fit<00:05:16.970> on<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.330> corners

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
that the Legos could fit on the corners

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.900 
that the Legos could fit on the corners
as<00:05:17.930> well<00:05:18.199> because<00:05:18.800> not<00:05:19.099> only<00:05:19.130> do<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.639> seams

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
as well because not only do the seams

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.939 
as well because not only do the seams
matter<00:05:20.240> but<00:05:20.570> then<00:05:20.720> where<00:05:20.960> all<00:05:21.139> four<00:05:21.620> of<00:05:21.680> the

matter but then where all four of the
base<00:05:22.130> plates<00:05:22.460> connect<00:05:22.880> matter<00:05:23.210> just<00:05:23.570> as<00:05:23.720> much

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
base plates connect matter just as much

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.320 
base plates connect matter just as much
so<00:05:24.530> I<00:05:24.560> would<00:05:24.800> place<00:05:25.039> a<00:05:25.220> Lego<00:05:25.639> piece<00:05:25.759> on<00:05:26.180> each

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
so I would place a Lego piece on each

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.060 
so I would place a Lego piece on each
corner<00:05:26.750> just<00:05:26.990> to<00:05:27.080> make<00:05:27.289> sure<00:05:27.440> that<00:05:27.650> they<00:05:27.830> fit

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
corner just to make sure that they fit

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:47.119 
corner just to make sure that they fit
properly

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:47.129 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:06:34.439 

you

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:34.449 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:38.050 

and<00:06:35.770> then<00:06:36.770> once<00:06:37.009> you're<00:06:37.190> done<00:06:37.220> gluing<00:06:37.669> all<00:06:37.940> of

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
and then once you're done gluing all of

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.670 
and then once you're done gluing all of
your<00:06:38.150> base<00:06:38.330> plates<00:06:38.599> on<00:06:38.810> you're<00:06:39.080> finished<00:06:39.409> now

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
your base plates on you're finished now

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.950 
your base plates on you're finished now
you<00:06:40.580> can<00:06:40.759> leave<00:06:40.880> your<00:06:41.000> Lego<00:06:41.330> table<00:06:41.690> like<00:06:41.810> this

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
you can leave your Lego table like this

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.510 
you can leave your Lego table like this
and<00:06:42.259> have<00:06:42.349> your<00:06:42.500> kids<00:06:42.680> stand<00:06:42.740> around<00:06:43.130> and<00:06:43.310> play

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
and have your kids stand around and play

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.249 
and have your kids stand around and play
with<00:06:43.699> it<00:06:43.729> but<00:06:44.150> John<00:06:44.479> and<00:06:44.539> I<00:06:44.750> would<00:06:44.990> add<00:06:45.229> a

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:45.259 
with it but John and I would add a

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:46.719 
with it but John and I would add a
little<00:06:45.380> bit<00:06:45.680> of<00:06:45.710> an<00:06:45.860> extra<00:06:46.069> touch<00:06:46.340> to<00:06:46.370> the

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
little bit of an extra touch to the

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:48.339 
little bit of an extra touch to the
table<00:06:47.090> and<00:06:47.300> give<00:06:47.419> an<00:06:47.509> option<00:06:47.810> for<00:06:47.930> the<00:06:48.020> kids<00:06:48.199> to

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:48.349 
table and give an option for the kids to

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:50.439 
table and give an option for the kids to
sit<00:06:48.530> so<00:06:48.800> we<00:06:48.889> picked<00:06:49.099> up<00:06:49.280> these<00:06:49.430> Mamet<00:06:50.120> stools

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
at ikea that had these ticket covers as

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.820 
at ikea that had these ticket covers as
well<00:06:53.479> I<00:06:53.720> probably<00:06:54.080> just<00:06:54.349> butchered<00:06:54.680> both

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.860 
well I probably just butchered both
those<00:06:55.039> names<00:06:55.310> they<00:06:55.789> are<00:06:55.940> sold<00:06:56.210> separately<00:06:56.690> but

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:56.870

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
they're both super affordable and I just

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.370 
they're both super affordable and I just
thought<00:06:59.240> they<00:06:59.419> look<00:06:59.599> really<00:06:59.840> cute<00:07:00.110> with<00:07:00.259> the

Duplo blocks they do fit on these Lego

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:15.999 
Duplo blocks they do fit on these Lego
base<00:07:14.750> plates<00:07:15.110> so<00:07:15.349> that's<00:07:15.590> what's<00:07:15.830> really

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:16.009 
base plates so that's what's really

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:17.379 
base plates so that's what's really
great<00:07:16.280> is<00:07:16.460> even<00:07:16.729> if<00:07:16.820> you<00:07:16.909> have<00:07:16.940> a<00:07:17.060> smaller

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:17.389 
great is even if you have a smaller

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:19.240 
great is even if you have a smaller
child<00:07:17.630> you<00:07:18.110> can<00:07:18.289> still<00:07:18.560> make<00:07:18.740> this<00:07:18.919> and<00:07:19.130> have

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.250 
child you can still make this and have

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.010 
child you can still make this and have
them<00:07:19.370> use<00:07:19.520> it<00:07:19.550> for<00:07:19.880> the<00:07:20.090> larger<00:07:20.449> Legos<00:07:20.810> and

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:21.020 
them use it for the larger Legos and

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.300 
them use it for the larger Legos and
then<00:07:21.169> move<00:07:21.319> on<00:07:21.440> to<00:07:21.469> the<00:07:21.590> smaller<00:07:21.919> ones<00:07:22.130> when

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:22.310 
then move on to the smaller ones when

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.189 
then move on to the smaller ones when
they<00:07:22.430> get<00:07:22.580> older<00:07:22.849> so<00:07:23.060> there<00:07:23.900> you<00:07:23.990> have<00:07:24.020> it

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:24.199 
they get older so there you have it

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:26.409 
they get older so there you have it
there's<00:07:24.590> our<00:07:24.770> new<00:07:25.039> Lego<00:07:25.340> table<00:07:25.639> slash<00:07:26.090> Lego
