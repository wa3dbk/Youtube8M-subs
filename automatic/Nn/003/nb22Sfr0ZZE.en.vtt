00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:48.880
 is the product that I am going to give you my 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:51.040
 first impression so it is no longer what 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.020
 I open and I want to try it together with 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.760
 you to see how it works for me 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.470
 me this is that during the day I'm going to 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.480
 be telling them more or less if 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.520
 It works if I like it if I do not like it if 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.520
 hard so come with me 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.520
 I can not open 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.810
 here ready 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.600
 it is the color 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.990
 I'm going to put a sample here in my 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.990
 hand 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.670
 very pretty 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.840
 that's what 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.710
 and I'm going to try to see how I 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.420
 it works to me 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.420
 so I'll put a shout 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.869
 because I'm waiting for it to be 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.869
 dry to see this 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.210
 3 feels a little 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.450
 sticky but I like the color is very 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.450
 strong 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.659
 you have to be very careful when 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.659
 put it on because it dries very fast 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.530
 salts of the line can stay there 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.530
 all day we will see yes yes yes it lasts but 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.980
 here you can see how they are 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.180
 the brochita is very pretty 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.330
 now it's two in twenty of the 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.700
 late that's how I'm going during the day 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.060
 to be saying how it works see you 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.060
 right now 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.830
 hello how are you this 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:21.440
 Well, I come to tell you more or less how 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:24.140
 goes the product is 425 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.190
 after four hours that's how it is 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.190
 You are viewing the product 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.260
 can you see what 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.780
 can you see what 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.780
 here has disappeared 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.599
 and obviously I already ate a lot 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:57.340
 water this I realized that I do not know 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:59.470
 transferred to my glass not smudge anything 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.019
 and when I was eating like that is that 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.209
 I think that's very good that it 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.330
 it stays on your lips it stays but 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.000
 obviously here in this part he left 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.430
 wearing a lot and what not you from 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.780
 that like it's falling with a 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:20.100
 not very nice bits of 5 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.100
 stars I would give him 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:29.270
 3 because I feel super dry lips and 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.020
 I have not left 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:36.220
 to those who do not think about walking 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:40.900
 I do not like this as it looks, I did not put 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:44.620
 nothing none at all I put on I'm going to 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.720
 put this place text 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.780
 to see if the appearance is improved because 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.800
 if it looks very dry you definitely have 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.129
 what to use a le for 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.789
 increasing for the lips with this 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:02.639
 product because it dries and dries 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:05.939
 so it is that 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.909
 I would recommend using or not this is that 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:12.499
 I'm going to put this to see if it improves the 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:12.499
 appearance of times it looks better 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.660
 it looks a little better like that 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.780
 you definitely have to use 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.730
 one for bread is a moisturizer for 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.960
 lips 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.000
 so it's a good product because if 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.540
 you want her to stay still has 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.170
 enough all day so you know if 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.170
 have some smell 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.910
 smells 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.390
 as a painting 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.010
 but the smell goes away but if you take and the 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:06.800
 of the fences is when you can smell it 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.320
 but if not then do not worry do not smell 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.720
 very out 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.720
 only if you approach but it's 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.350
 is 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:22.720
 a little easy to put but difficult to 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.660
 can you keep on the line because if 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.850
 you leave the line 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.800
 is going to stay there still if it is that 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:32.870
 you have to be very careful about that 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:37.560
 is that the brush is very thin this 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:39.950
 I liked it but you have to use a 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:44.170
 up because if not 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.170
 you're not going to be happy two days is going 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:52.610
 it's going to look dry it's awkward to bring them 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:55.550
 without that, you see 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:58.120
 I liked it but let me know if you 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.219
 you tried if you liked it if you did not like it 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:04.310
 this but it 's here I 'm going to leave it 

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:07.759
 because it was already four hours and it just did not look 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:10.370
 very well so I already imagine in the 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:10.729
 night how would it look like it would exceed very 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.400
 wrong 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:15.080
