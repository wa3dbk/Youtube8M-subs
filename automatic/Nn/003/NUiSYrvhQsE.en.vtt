weight<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:25.140> gonna<00:00:25.230> build<00:00:25.619> some<00:00:25.920> strength

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
weight it's gonna build some strength

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.769 
weight it's gonna build some strength
but<00:00:26.550> it's<00:00:26.670> also<00:00:26.789> gonna<00:00:27.090> build<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.480> ton<00:00:27.750> of

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
but it's also gonna build a ton of

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.189 
but it's also gonna build a ton of
confidence<00:00:28.460> we've<00:00:29.460> had<00:00:29.670> many<00:00:29.970> lifters<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.840> the

confidence we've had many lifters in the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.130 
confidence we've had many lifters in the
past<00:00:31.520> do<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> weight<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.120> they<00:00:33.300> fear<00:00:33.690> let's

and<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.620> a<00:00:40.620> way<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.129> get<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> way<00:00:42.360> to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and so on and a way to get that a way to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.779 
and so on and a way to get that a way to
get<00:00:42.690> them<00:00:42.899> out<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> their<00:00:43.230> own<00:00:43.350> head<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.950> to

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
get them out of their own head is to

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.600 
get them out of their own head is to
basically<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.780> them<00:00:46.140> get<00:00:47.129> up<00:00:47.280> something

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
basically have them get up something

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.819 
basically have them get up something
like<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.120> reverse<00:00:48.420> bend<00:00:48.780> every<00:00:49.320> once<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
like this a reverse bend every once in a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.080 
like this a reverse bend every once in a
while<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.160> got<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.370> throw<00:00:50.579> yourself<00:00:50.969> an

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
while you got to throw yourself an

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.479 
while you got to throw yourself an
underhand<00:00:51.510> pitch<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.110> hit<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.860> solon<00:00:53.280> bitch

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
underhand pitch and hit that solon bitch

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.729 
underhand pitch and hit that solon bitch
out<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> park<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.600> that's<00:00:55.230> exactly<00:00:55.590> what

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
out the park and so that's exactly what

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.290 
out the park and so that's exactly what
we're<00:00:55.920> doing<00:00:56.070> here<00:00:56.430> with<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> reverse<00:00:56.969> band

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
we're doing here with the reverse band

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.849 
we're doing here with the reverse band
squats<00:00:57.690> making<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> squat<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> little<00:00:58.620> bit

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
squats making the squat a little bit

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.889 
squats making the squat a little bit
easier<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.430> little<00:00:59.850> bit<00:01:00.030> more<00:01:00.210> manageable<00:01:00.480> from

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
easier a little bit more manageable from

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.180 
easier a little bit more manageable from
the<00:01:01.050> bottom<00:01:01.440> weights<00:01:01.649> are<00:01:01.829> lighter<00:01:01.859> at<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the bottom weights are lighter at the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.219 
the bottom weights are lighter at the
bottom<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.760> they're<00:01:03.210> heavier<00:01:03.660> at<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> top

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
bottom and they're heavier at the top

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.950 
bottom and they're heavier at the top
you're<00:01:05.040> gonna<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.909> able<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.119> handle<00:01:06.479> anywhere

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you're gonna be able to handle anywhere

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.250 
you're gonna be able to handle anywhere
between<00:01:07.110> five<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.680> ten<00:01:07.890> percent<00:01:08.040> over<00:01:09.260> what

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
between five to ten percent over what

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.030 
between five to ten percent over what
your<00:01:10.380> max<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:11.030> obviously<00:01:12.030> really<00:01:12.479> really

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
your max is obviously really really

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.770 
your max is obviously really really
tremendously<00:01:14.040> depends<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.670> how<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
tremendously depends on how you have the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.840 
tremendously depends on how you have the
band<00:01:16.049> set<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:16.770> used<00:01:16.979> mini<00:01:17.340> bands<00:01:17.640> on

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
band set up but we used mini bands on

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.149 
band set up but we used mini bands on
this<00:01:18.000> day<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.930> smallest<00:01:19.259> type<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.830> band<00:01:20.040> that

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
this day the smallest type of band that

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.580 
this day the smallest type of band that
they<00:01:20.340> make<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.659> just<00:01:21.810> had<00:01:21.960> them<00:01:22.080> double<00:01:22.500> to

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
they make and we just had them double to

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.740 
they make and we just had them double to
overtop<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.340> mono<00:01:23.939> lift<00:01:24.240> there<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.600> at<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
overtop of the mono lift there so at the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.140 
overtop of the mono lift there so at the
bottom<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.979> know<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.250> giving<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.670> maybe

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
bottom you know it's giving you maybe

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.080 
bottom you know it's giving you maybe
seventy<00:01:27.689> pounds<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.939> somewhere<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.000> that
