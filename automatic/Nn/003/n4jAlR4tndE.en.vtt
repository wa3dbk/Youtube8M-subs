batteries<00:01:01.649> lithium<00:01:02.489> ion<00:01:03.000> batteries<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:05.299> if

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
batteries lithium ion batteries so if

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.880 
batteries lithium ion batteries so if
the<00:01:06.540> package<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.990> damaged<00:01:07.470> they're<00:01:07.799> not

supposed<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.280> transfer<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.390> little

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
supposed to transfer it so I'm a little

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.179 
supposed to transfer it so I'm a little
concerned<00:01:09.810> because<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.799> see<00:01:10.920> there's

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
concerned because as you can see there's

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.100 
concerned because as you can see there's
a<00:01:11.490> little<00:01:11.520> indentation<00:01:11.970> there's<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.570> corner

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
a little indentation there's a corner

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.370 
a little indentation there's a corner
junt<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:14.030> I'm<00:01:15.030> hoping<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.049> lithium

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
junt so I'm hoping that the lithium

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.410 
junt so I'm hoping that the lithium
batteries<00:01:16.799> don't<00:01:16.950> become<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> problem<00:01:17.610> here

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
batteries don't become a problem here

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.270 
batteries don't become a problem here

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.550 
might be the same same charger but it's
not<00:04:25.460> it's<00:04:26.240> not<00:04:26.390> that's<00:04:26.630> too<00:04:26.870> bad<00:04:26.990> because<00:04:27.230> i

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
not it's not that's too bad because i

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.000 
not it's not that's too bad because i
would<00:04:28.130> have<00:04:28.220> almost<00:04:28.400> gotten<00:04:28.910> recharger<00:04:30.010> $89

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
would have almost gotten recharger $89

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.730 
would have almost gotten recharger $89
new<00:04:31.220> would<00:04:32.150> have<00:04:32.240> reduced<00:04:32.360> the<00:04:33.050> laptop<00:04:33.470> costs

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
new would have reduced the laptop costs

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.360 
new would have reduced the laptop costs
to<00:04:34.250> four<00:04:34.490> hundred<00:04:34.610> ninety<00:04:35.740> dollars<00:04:36.740> for<00:04:37.160> free

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
to four hundred ninety dollars for free

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.800 
to four hundred ninety dollars for free
so<00:04:37.940> this<00:04:38.120> has<00:04:38.390> this<00:04:38.930> has<00:04:39.169> the<00:04:39.710> safety<00:04:40.100> mark

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
so this has this has the safety mark

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.620 
so this has this has the safety mark
which<00:04:41.810> is<00:04:41.990> something<00:04:42.230> you<00:04:42.410> really<00:04:42.740> want<00:04:43.090> in<00:04:44.090> in

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
which is something you really want in in

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.590 
which is something you really want in in
all<00:04:44.810> adapters<00:04:45.320> actually<00:04:45.770> is<00:04:45.919> a<00:04:46.880> good<00:04:47.300> safety

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
all adapters actually is a good safety

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:55.719 
all adapters actually is a good safety
mark<00:04:51.729> slippers<00:04:52.729> were<00:04:52.880> a<00:04:52.910> gift<00:04:54.580> they're<00:04:55.580> from

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
mark slippers were a gift they're from

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.960 
mark slippers were a gift they're from
Poland<00:04:56.229> actually<00:04:57.400> one<00:04:58.400> thing<00:04:58.610> I<00:04:58.729> don't<00:04:58.790> like

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
Poland actually one thing I don't like

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.800 
Poland actually one thing I don't like
though<00:04:59.390> is<00:04:59.419> that<00:04:59.740> with<00:05:00.740> repeated<00:05:01.310> where<00:05:01.810> they

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
though is that with repeated where they

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.850 
though is that with repeated where they
kind<00:05:03.140> of<00:05:03.200> slope<00:05:03.710> off<00:05:03.950> to<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.370> side<00:05:04.669> and<00:05:05.169> I<00:05:06.169> find

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
kind of slope off to the side and I find

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.860 
kind of slope off to the side and I find
that<00:05:07.040> I'm<00:05:07.190> almost<00:05:07.520> walking<00:05:07.970> on<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.570> edge<00:05:08.600> of

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
that I'm almost walking on the edge of

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.690 
that I'm almost walking on the edge of
the<00:05:08.990> slip<00:05:09.200> or<00:05:09.350> not<00:05:09.470> flat<00:05:09.919> on<00:05:10.040> the<00:05:10.160> bottom<00:05:10.310> as<00:05:10.610> I

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
the slip or not flat on the bottom as I

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.340 
the slip or not flat on the bottom as I
should<00:05:10.940> be<00:05:11.060> family<00:05:11.540> and<00:05:11.720> that<00:05:11.810> just<00:05:11.990> an<00:05:12.140> arch

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
should be family and that just an arch

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.960 
should be family and that just an arch
support<00:05:12.830> that's<00:05:13.010> really<00:05:13.340> a<00:05:13.370> problem<00:05:13.640> though

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
support that's really a problem though

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.750 
support that's really a problem though
because<00:05:14.150> as<00:05:14.510> you<00:05:14.720> can<00:05:14.750> see<00:05:14.900> there's<00:05:15.350> a<00:05:15.760> leather

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
because as you can see there's a leather

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.969 
because as you can see there's a leather
fabric<00:05:17.330> break<00:05:17.750> down<00:05:17.990> here<00:05:18.260> the<00:05:18.410> stitching<00:05:18.830> is

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
fabric break down here the stitching is

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.370 
fabric break down here the stitching is
intact<00:05:19.400> it's<00:05:19.880> just<00:05:20.210> wear<00:05:20.600> and<00:05:20.780> tear<00:05:20.960> from<00:05:21.200> that

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
intact it's just wear and tear from that

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.190 
intact it's just wear and tear from that
that<00:05:21.890> defect<00:05:22.370> there<00:05:22.750> they're<00:05:23.750> going<00:05:23.930> to<00:05:24.080> take

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
that defect there they're going to take

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.350 
that defect there they're going to take
down<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:24.650> resale<00:05:25.070> value<00:05:25.640> I<00:05:25.850> really<00:05:26.210> think

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
down the resale value I really think

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:34.120 
down the resale value I really think
they<00:05:26.540> should<00:05:26.810> reinforce<00:05:27.169> that<00:05:32.770> those<00:05:33.770> buttons

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
they should reinforce that those buttons

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.700 
they should reinforce that those buttons
are<00:05:34.340> they<00:05:34.430> would<00:05:34.700> or<00:05:34.880> they<00:05:35.210> polymer<00:05:36.140> there

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
are they would or they polymer there

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.770 
are they would or they polymer there
through<00:05:37.070> a<00:05:37.100> polymer<00:05:37.520> I<00:05:37.700> think<00:05:38.419> it's<00:05:38.570> actually

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
through a polymer I think it's actually

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.650 
through a polymer I think it's actually
it<00:05:39.110> looks<00:05:39.320> sort<00:05:39.470> of<00:05:39.590> like<00:05:39.650> what<00:05:40.160> the<00:05:40.660> what

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
it looks sort of like what the what

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.710 
it looks sort of like what the what
generic<00:05:41.960> bowling<00:05:42.380> balls<00:05:42.590> are<00:05:42.800> made<00:05:42.890> out<00:05:43.070> of

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
generic bowling balls are made out of

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.140 
generic bowling balls are made out of
you<00:05:44.720> know<00:05:44.810> in<00:05:44.930> five<00:05:45.110> plateau<00:05:45.800> classic<00:05:46.729> my

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
you know in five plateau classic my

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.159 
you know in five plateau classic my
opinion<00:05:47.720> yeah<00:05:47.960> like<00:05:48.200> that<00:05:49.720> do<00:05:50.720> you<00:05:50.780> mind<00:05:50.930> if<00:05:51.050> I

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
opinion yeah like that do you mind if I

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.200 
opinion yeah like that do you mind if I
gutter<00:05:51.380> guards<00:05:51.770> when<00:05:51.919> you<00:05:52.010> go<00:05:52.130> five<00:05:52.370> pin<00:05:52.640> no

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
gutter guards when you go five pin no

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.120 
gutter guards when you go five pin no
not<00:05:53.720> not<00:05:53.930> well<00:05:54.440> I<00:05:54.470> don't<00:05:54.800> know<00:05:54.860> I<00:05:54.890> haven't<00:05:55.010> been

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
not not well I don't know I haven't been

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.890 
not not well I don't know I haven't been
for<00:05:55.370> a<00:05:55.400> while<00:05:55.520> I<00:05:55.729> think<00:05:56.210> it's<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.390> same<00:05:56.690> kind

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
for a while I think it's the same kind

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.380 
for a while I think it's the same kind
of<00:05:57.050> material<00:05:58.010> actually<00:05:58.190> as<00:05:58.490> you<00:05:59.210> know

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
of material actually as you know

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.750 
of material actually as you know
kitchen<00:06:00.320> appliances<00:06:00.380> from<00:06:00.980> the<00:06:01.100> 70s<00:06:01.580> had<00:06:01.730> a

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
kitchen appliances from the 70s had a

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.750 
kitchen appliances from the 70s had a
lot<00:06:01.970> of<00:06:02.000> this<00:06:02.270> too<00:06:02.510> mmm<00:06:03.200> that<00:06:03.410> I<00:06:04.100> don't<00:06:04.700> know

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
lot of this too mmm that I don't know

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:12.820 
lot of this too mmm that I don't know
you'd<00:06:04.970> call<00:06:05.240> a<00:06:05.270> cedar<00:06:06.070> no<00:06:07.540> got<00:06:08.540> a<00:06:08.570> burr<00:06:11.830> so

you'd call a cedar no got a burr so

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:25.290 
you'd call a cedar no got a burr so
let's<00:06:13.220> just<00:06:13.280> carry<00:06:13.550> on<00:06:13.700> here<00:06:15.940> but<00:06:16.940> the<00:06:22.210> record

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.520 

you<00:06:26.300> know<00:06:28.810> feel<00:06:29.810> like<00:06:29.960> you're<00:06:30.080> not<00:06:30.200> you're<00:06:30.500> not
