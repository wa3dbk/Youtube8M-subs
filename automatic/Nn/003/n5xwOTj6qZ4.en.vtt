through walls to get into mine carts so
I<00:00:43.010> don't<00:00:44.010> know<00:00:44.100> why<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.340> came<00:00:44.940> up<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
I don't know why I just came up with a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.470 
I don't know why I just came up with a
random<00:00:45.480> idea<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:46.399> making<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.390> you

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
random idea of making this and so you

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.700 
random idea of making this and so you
can<00:00:48.870> go<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.289> every<00:00:49.620> six<00:00:49.980> blocks<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.820> 1<00:00:51.410> 1<00:00:52.410> 2<00:00:52.680> 3

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
can go like every six blocks so 1 1 2 3

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.650 
can go like every six blocks so 1 1 2 3
4<00:00:53.520> 5<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.690> then<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> 61<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.539> after<00:00:57.539> that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
4 5 and then this is a 61 and after that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.229 
4 5 and then this is a 61 and after that
one<00:00:57.899> then<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.949> start<00:00:59.520> building<00:00:59.760> up

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
one then you can start building up

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.990 
one then you can start building up
higher<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.079> um<00:01:01.559> first<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.640> all<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.789> want<00:01:02.940> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
higher so um first of all I want to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.429 
higher so um first of all I want to
thank<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.510> positive<00:01:03.629> support<00:01:04.290> I've

been getting on my videos and everything
I<00:01:08.909> wasn't<00:01:09.330> really<00:01:09.630> planning<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.110> making<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
I wasn't really planning on making a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.899 
I wasn't really planning on making a
video<00:01:10.560> I've<00:01:10.830> been<00:01:10.979> trying<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.400> think<00:01:11.700> of

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
video I've been trying to think of

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.420 
video I've been trying to think of
something<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.360> make<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.080> guys<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.560> uh<00:01:13.619> so

something to make for you guys but uh so

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.399 
something to make for you guys but uh so
then<00:01:14.549> they<00:01:14.640> had<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:14.909> idea<00:01:15.350> draw<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
then they had this idea draw the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.719 
then they had this idea draw the
positive<00:01:17.159> support<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.330> um<00:01:19.250> so<00:01:20.250> after<00:01:20.460> this

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
positive support so um so after this

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.060 
positive support so um so after this
that<00:01:21.390> first<00:01:21.810> block<00:01:22.170> under<00:01:22.530> here<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> actually

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
that first block under here it actually

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.550 
that first block under here it actually
counts<00:01:23.670> as<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.509> five<00:01:24.840> one<00:01:25.290> two

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
counts as one so it's just five one two

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.050 
counts as one so it's just five one two
three<00:01:25.710> four<00:01:26.630> five<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.930> then<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.060> build

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
three four five and then you build

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.410 
three four five and then you build
around<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:34.070> then<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.400> take<00:01:36.030> all<00:01:36.270> these

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
around it then you can take all these

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.120 
around it then you can take all these
out<00:01:38.780> put<00:01:39.780> your<00:01:39.869> track<00:01:40.079> down<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.799> put<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> my

card<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.729> then<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.570> that

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689
