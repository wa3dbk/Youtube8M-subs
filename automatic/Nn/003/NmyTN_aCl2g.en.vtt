00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
their head slows be covering these

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.580 
their head slows be covering these
ratings<00:01:53.119> are<00:01:54.119> good<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.140> fact<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.409> you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
ratings are good in the fact that you

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.170 
ratings are good in the fact that you
had<00:01:55.680> Roman<00:01:56.070> reigns<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.579> these<00:01:56.700> segments<00:01:57.090> and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
had Roman reigns in these segments and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.639 
had Roman reigns in these segments and
John<00:01:57.420> Cena<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.840> Randy<00:01:57.960> or<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.380> that's<00:01:58.500> when

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
John Cena and Randy or and that's when

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.160 
John Cena and Randy or and that's when
the<00:01:58.680> ratings<00:01:59.009> started<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.399> pick<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.659> so<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the ratings started to pick up so you

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.499 
the ratings started to pick up so you
know<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.890> raw<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.640> definitely<00:02:03.060> was<00:02:03.299> an

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
know this raw it definitely was an

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.149 
know this raw it definitely was an
improvement<00:02:04.020> I'd<00:02:04.350> say<00:02:04.560> over<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.770> last<00:02:04.950> couple

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
improvement I'd say over the last couple

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.880 
improvement I'd say over the last couple
of<00:02:05.369> rows<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> w/e<00:02:07.500> has<00:02:07.680> two
