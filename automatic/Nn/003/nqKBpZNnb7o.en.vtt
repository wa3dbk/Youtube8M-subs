00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.070
 do the good ones 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.230
 whenever god thinks back to 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.930
 wonderful simplicity of that sentence 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.850
 his only and original commandment 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.969
 another takes over automatically 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.579
 thought that dinosaur asshole that 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.739
 breed of arrogant dickhead throws 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.839
 in the toilet the only commandment that is him 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.210
 been given and pulls out 10 invented ones 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.829
 of healthy plant 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.269
 this is a passage where 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.269
 I suggest bertolino 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.010
 a love that cannot be used but that is 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.470
 devastating in its place 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.060
 someone would call it not true because 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.340
 he would never risk making himself there 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.360
 colon and turn into a joke 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.729
 vulgar or to consume painfully in 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.410
 love that risks nothing but yes 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.130
 keeps alive like a drop of honey 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:59.979
 an underground resource with the weight of 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.979
 this new silence kept murdered 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.640
 whenever i arrive at this not 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.190
 inclusive 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:21.430
 the heart tightens for pleasure as 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:23.320
 if you were to come back, live puros whoever has 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.910
 always envied those who have the 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.690
 feeling of being in control of 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.520
 own life 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.520
 those who can fully affirm 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.210
 your existence step by step 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.340
 putting subjects to so many families 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.770
 very good experiences for minors 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.870
 of white the bad the publicity above 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:47.350
 pain like this in raised up 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:51.730
 a fortress among others before bukowsky 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:57.770
 then then there is monica who is reading 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:00.970
 on the beach from the title we read 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.970
 a sentence of this video 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.510
 but the narrowness of the rigidity 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.280
 of who has no imagination has 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.290
 a nature similar to making rods 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.870
 moving from an organism 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.330
 to the other they mount the continuous form 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:22.010
 living and proliferating are almost without 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:24.080
 hope viva bukowsky 25th now means 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.670
 story of two boys in times of war 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.260
 the novel of another story 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.630
 exceptional consumer writing 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.530
 implacable suspense and this he writes 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.530
 it were 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.640
 the Milan was placed
