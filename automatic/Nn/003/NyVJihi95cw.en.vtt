00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and my recommendation would be these two

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.929 
and my recommendation would be these two
things<00:01:21.900> if<00:01:22.500> you're<00:01:22.710> not<00:01:22.860> resistance<00:01:23.610> training

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
things if you're not resistance training

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.120 
things if you're not resistance training
meaning<00:01:24.330> lifting<00:01:24.720> weights<00:01:24.960> at<00:01:25.229> least<00:01:25.799> three

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
meaning lifting weights at least three

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.010 
meaning lifting weights at least three
times<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.580> week<00:01:26.610> then<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.390> need<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.750> start

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
times a week then you need to start

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.710 
times a week then you need to start
there<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:29.189> you've<00:01:29.490> been<00:01:29.610> doing<00:01:29.939> cardio<00:01:30.390> like
