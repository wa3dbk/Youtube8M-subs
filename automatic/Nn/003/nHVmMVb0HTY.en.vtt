the review of testers Dell code if you
recall<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:20.040> did<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> video<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:21.000> couple<00:00:21.750> weeks<00:00:22.050> back

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
maybe where I was taking a look at

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.250 
maybe where I was taking a look at
testers<00:00:24.810> dokgo<00:00:25.170> versus<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:26.430> think<00:00:27.240> oh<00:00:27.720> gosh

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
testers dokgo versus I think oh gosh

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
I was pretty impressed with testers

ability to cover a glossy finish with a

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.760 
ability to cover a glossy finish with a
pretty<00:00:38.820> dull<00:00:39.090> appearance<00:00:39.989> really<00:00:40.470> gave<00:00:40.739> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
pretty dull appearance really gave a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.549 
pretty dull appearance really gave a
very<00:00:41.129> matte<00:00:41.550> coverage<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.989> wanted<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.350> take

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
very matte coverage and I wanted to take

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.469 
very matte coverage and I wanted to take
a<00:00:43.589> look<00:00:43.769> at<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.070> against<00:00:44.430> army<00:00:44.729> painters<00:00:45.089> matte

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.869 
a look at it against army painters matte
clear<00:00:45.750> coat<00:00:46.019> I<00:00:46.260> finally<00:00:47.159> picked<00:00:47.370> up<00:00:47.580> a<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.850> of

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
clear coat I finally picked up a can of

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.350 
clear coat I finally picked up a can of
army<00:00:48.269> painters<00:00:48.600> matte<00:00:48.930> clear<00:00:49.199> coat<00:00:49.409> and<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:50.489> got

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
army painters matte clear coat and I got

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.490 
army painters matte clear coat and I got
another<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.900> testers<00:00:52.140> because<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.409> had

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
another can of testers because I had

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.680 
another can of testers because I had
used<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.800> up<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.580> I've<00:00:53.850> given<00:00:54.180> them<00:00:54.269> a<00:00:54.330> side

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
used it up and so I've given them a side

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.719 
used it up and so I've given them a side
by<00:00:54.839> side<00:00:54.870> comparison<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> couple<00:00:56.280> pieces<00:00:56.430> to

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
by side comparison on a couple pieces to

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.329 
by side comparison on a couple pieces to
really<00:00:56.940> take<00:00:57.089> a<00:00:57.120> look<00:00:57.360> at<00:00:57.479> how<00:00:57.600> they<00:00:57.780> stack<00:00:58.080> up

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
really take a look at how they stack up

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.539 
really take a look at how they stack up
so<00:00:59.339> first<00:01:00.049> my<00:01:01.049> first<00:01:01.260> experiment<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.190> with

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:02.549 
so first my first experiment was with

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:04.939 
so first my first experiment was with
let<00:01:03.180> me<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.449> make<00:01:03.570> sure<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:03.960> we<00:01:03.989> go<00:01:04.170> my

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
let me just make sure here we go my

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.010 
let me just make sure here we go my
first<00:01:05.129> experiment<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.690> fuel

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
first experiment was with the fuel

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.330 
first experiment was with the fuel
depots<00:01:07.440> which<00:01:07.620> I<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:07.890> showed<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
depots which I just showed you in a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.870 
depots which I just showed you in a
previous<00:01:08.370> video<00:01:09.049> on<00:01:10.049> these<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.880> basically

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
previous video on these I basically

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.140 
previous video on these I basically
painted<00:01:12.869> them<00:01:13.020> then<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.890> dipped<00:01:14.310> them<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
painted them then I dipped them in the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.480 
painted them then I dipped them in the
quick<00:01:15.570> shade<00:01:15.810> strong<00:01:16.170> tone<00:01:16.440> which<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> very

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
quick shade strong tone which is a very

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.810 
quick shade strong tone which is a very
dark<00:01:17.820> dark<00:01:18.120> dark<00:01:18.300> brown<00:01:18.540> gray<00:01:18.930> black<00:01:19.920> some

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
dark dark dark brown gray black some

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.580 
dark dark dark brown gray black some
people<00:01:21.060> had<00:01:21.510> questioned<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.050> past<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.500> one

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
people had questioned in the past on one

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.720 
people had questioned in the past on one
of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.740> comments<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.160> the<00:01:23.190> videos<00:01:23.520> whether

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
of the comments in the videos whether

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.370 
of the comments in the videos whether
it's<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.420> black<00:01:24.660> or<00:01:24.870> whether<00:01:25.050> there<00:01:25.170> has<00:01:25.290> any

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
it's just black or whether there has any

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.080 
it's just black or whether there has any
brown<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.800> it<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.040> definitely<00:01:26.160> has<00:01:26.670> brown<00:01:26.910> in

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
brown in it it definitely has brown in

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.060 
brown in it it definitely has brown in
it<00:01:27.180> there's<00:01:27.420> no<00:01:27.480> doubt<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.110> my<00:01:28.140> mind<00:01:28.230> but<00:01:28.950> it's

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
it there's no doubt in my mind but it's

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.830 
it there's no doubt in my mind but it's
almost<00:01:29.310> black<00:01:29.810> any<00:01:30.810> case<00:01:31.110> dip<00:01:31.890> those<00:01:32.390> then<00:01:33.390> dry

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
almost black any case dip those then dry

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.490 
almost black any case dip those then dry
brush<00:01:34.110> them<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.030> then<00:01:36.110> actually<00:01:37.110> first<00:01:37.320> I

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
brush them and then actually first I

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.980 
brush them and then actually first I
clear<00:01:38.160> coated<00:01:38.490> them<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.240> testers<00:01:39.750> and

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
clear coated them with the testers and

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.810 
clear coated them with the testers and
the<00:01:40.170> army<00:01:40.410> painter<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.190> I<00:01:41.340> dry<00:01:41.550> brushed

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the army painter and then I dry brushed

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.330 
the army painter and then I dry brushed
over<00:01:41.940> that<00:01:42.210> because<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.630> figured<00:01:42.930> with<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
over that because I figured with the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.330 
over that because I figured with the
matte<00:01:44.340> covering<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:46.250> paint<00:01:47.250> would

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
matte covering of it the paint would

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.740 
matte covering of it the paint would
adhere<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.910> a<00:01:47.940> little<00:01:48.030> bit<00:01:48.210> better<00:01:48.330> for<00:01:48.600> dry

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
adhere to it a little bit better for dry

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.150 
adhere to it a little bit better for dry
brushing<00:01:49.200> because<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:49.710> going<00:01:49.830> to<00:01:49.890> give<00:01:49.980> it<00:01:50.010> a

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
brushing because it's going to give it a

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.770 
brushing because it's going to give it a
rougher<00:01:50.460> texture<00:01:50.760> so<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.270> paint<00:01:51.540> will<00:01:51.630> come

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
rougher texture so the paint will come

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.340 
rougher texture so the paint will come
off<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.020> brush<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.230> little<00:01:52.440> bit<00:01:52.530> easier<00:01:52.800> so

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
off the brush a little bit easier so

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.580 
off the brush a little bit easier so
taking<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.440> look<00:01:55.590> at<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.659> army

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
taking a look at it so this is the army

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.540 
taking a look at it so this is the army
painters<00:01:59.010> pieces<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.409> actually<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:02.250> I'll

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
painters pieces and actually and I'll

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.460 
painters pieces and actually and I'll
have<00:02:02.730> to<00:02:02.850> see<00:02:03.030> when<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.240> process<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:03.960> video<00:02:04.260> it

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
have to see when I process this video it

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.810 
have to see when I process this video it
may<00:02:04.590> look<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:04.860> little<00:02:05.040> shinier<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.610> video

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
may look a little shinier in the video

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.180 
may look a little shinier in the video
than<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.120> actually<00:02:06.240> does<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:06.810> real<00:02:06.990> life<00:02:07.200> one

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
than it actually does in real life one

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.899 
than it actually does in real life one
of<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.369> key<00:02:08.550> areas<00:02:09.030> where<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:10.400> matte<00:02:11.400> clear

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
of the key areas where the matte clear

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.430 
of the key areas where the matte clear
coat<00:02:12.209> was<00:02:12.390> most<00:02:12.569> important<00:02:13.019> is<00:02:13.140> going<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.349> be

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
coat was most important is going to be

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.250 
coat was most important is going to be
at<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.830> intersections<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.790> these<00:02:15.390> nubs<00:02:15.900> on

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
at the intersections of these nubs on

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.879 
at the intersections of these nubs on
the<00:02:16.769> barrels<00:02:17.190> because<00:02:17.430> here's<00:02:17.849> where<00:02:18.090> the

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:18.889 
the barrels because here's where the

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.670 
the barrels because here's where the
quick<00:02:19.889> shade<00:02:20.159> pooled<00:02:20.609> the<00:02:21.030> heaviest<00:02:21.469> which<00:02:22.469> is

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
quick shade pooled the heaviest which is

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.510 
quick shade pooled the heaviest which is
you<00:02:22.980> know<00:02:23.099> its<00:02:23.280> intended<00:02:23.579> effect<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:24.180> hide

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
you know its intended effect to hide

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.760 
you know its intended effect to hide
like<00:02:24.610> those<00:02:24.820> eight<00:02:25.030> edges<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.600> also<00:02:26.440> was

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
like those eight edges and also was

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.560 
like those eight edges and also was
areas<00:02:27.100> that<00:02:27.220> received<00:02:27.550> very<00:02:27.940> little<00:02:28.030> dry

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
areas that received very little dry

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.630 
areas that received very little dry
brushing<00:02:28.960> so<00:02:29.410> I'm<00:02:29.740> looking<00:02:30.040> for<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.310> best

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
brushing so I'm looking for the best

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.570 
brushing so I'm looking for the best
coverage<00:02:30.940> in<00:02:31.270> those<00:02:31.450> spots<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.350> overall<00:02:32.920> I'd

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
coverage in those spots and overall I'd

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.140 
coverage in those spots and overall I'd
say<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.330> army<00:02:34.630> painter<00:02:35.040> gave<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.280> very<00:02:36.850> good

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
say the army painter gave a very good

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
say the army painter gave a very good
coverage<00:02:37.990> I'm<00:02:38.200> gonna<00:02:38.470> have<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.800> say<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.190> I

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
coverage I'm gonna have to say that I

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.360 
coverage I'm gonna have to say that I
compared<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.380> Krylon<00:02:41.590> for<00:02:42.010> instance

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
compared to the Krylon for instance

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.250 
compared to the Krylon for instance
there's<00:02:42.820> absolutely<00:02:43.450> no<00:02:43.570> competition<00:02:43.780> army

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
there's absolutely no competition army

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.560 
there's absolutely no competition army
painter<00:02:44.410> is<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.950> very<00:02:45.490> good<00:02:45.700> Mac<00:02:45.940> coverage<00:02:46.360> and

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
painter is a very good Mac coverage and

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.280 
painter is a very good Mac coverage and
then<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.800> of<00:02:48.310> course<00:02:48.340> did<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.760> testers<00:02:49.630> on<00:02:49.840> the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
then I of course did the testers on the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.510 
then I of course did the testers on the
same<00:02:50.500> style<00:02:50.860> piece<00:02:51.160> same<00:02:51.940> kind<00:02:52.330> of<00:02:53.520> paint

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
same style piece same kind of paint

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.340 
same style piece same kind of paint
effects<00:02:54.910> same<00:02:55.210> style<00:02:55.600> same<00:02:55.750> technique<00:02:56.320> same

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
effects same style same technique same

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.910 
effects same style same technique same
stage<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.280> application<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.500> again<00:02:59.500> this

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
stage of application and again this

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.320 
stage of application and again this
looks<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.190> little<00:03:00.280> bit<00:03:00.400> shinier<00:03:00.850> at<00:03:01.030> least<00:03:01.180> in

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
looks a little bit shinier at least in

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.390 
looks a little bit shinier at least in
the<00:03:01.420> viewfinder<00:03:01.630> than<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.620> does<00:03:02.800> in<00:03:02.830> real<00:03:03.010> life

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
the viewfinder than it does in real life

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.180 
the viewfinder than it does in real life
but<00:03:04.300> I'll<00:03:04.780> be<00:03:04.960> honest<00:03:05.230> with<00:03:05.350> you<00:03:05.560> side-by-side

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
but I'll be honest with you side-by-side

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.130 
but I'll be honest with you side-by-side
on<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.820> tabletop

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
on the tabletop

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.350 
on the tabletop
I<00:03:08.170> cannot<00:03:08.980> tell<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.610> difference<00:03:10.000> between

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
I cannot tell the difference between

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.170 
I cannot tell the difference between
these<00:03:10.750> two<00:03:10.990> pieces<00:03:11.170> in<00:03:11.740> terms<00:03:12.400> of<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.790> clear

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
these two pieces in terms of the clear

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.120 
these two pieces in terms of the clear
coat<00:03:13.420> coverage<00:03:13.810> on<00:03:13.990> them

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
coat coverage on them

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.850 
coat coverage on them
I<00:03:15.390> really<00:03:16.390> can't<00:03:16.630> in<00:03:16.780> fact<00:03:16.810> I<00:03:17.140> had<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.320> mark<00:03:17.620> one

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
I really can't in fact I had to mark one

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.100 
I really can't in fact I had to mark one
on<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.100> bottom<00:03:18.400> with<00:03:18.910> an<00:03:19.060> A<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.210> denote<00:03:20.050> that

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
on the bottom with an A to denote that

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.740 
on the bottom with an A to denote that
it<00:03:20.290> was<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.620> army<00:03:20.830> painter<00:03:20.980> because<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:22.000> you

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
it was the army painter because I you

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.910 
it was the army painter because I you
know<00:03:22.780> otherwise<00:03:23.200> I<00:03:23.380> might<00:03:23.530> not<00:03:23.650> be<00:03:23.740> able<00:03:23.800> to

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
know otherwise I might not be able to

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.420 
know otherwise I might not be able to
tell<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:25.510> I'm<00:03:25.900> gonna<00:03:26.140> I'm<00:03:26.740> gonna<00:03:27.040> go<00:03:27.160> out<00:03:27.250> on<00:03:27.310> a

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
tell so I'm gonna I'm gonna go out on a

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.890 
tell so I'm gonna I'm gonna go out on a
limb<00:03:27.580> and<00:03:27.670> I'm<00:03:27.760> going<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:27.910> say<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.360> army

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
limb and I'm going to say that army

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.580 
limb and I'm going to say that army
painter<00:03:29.200> is<00:03:29.410> at<00:03:29.680> least<00:03:30.570> comparable<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.990> or<00:03:32.230> as

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
painter is at least comparable to or as

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.800 
painter is at least comparable to or as
good<00:03:32.980> as<00:03:33.250> testers<00:03:33.790> dull<00:03:34.030> coat<00:03:34.209> I<00:03:34.420> would<00:03:34.630> say

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
good as testers dull coat I would say

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.220 
good as testers dull coat I would say
that<00:03:35.020> the<00:03:35.140> difference<00:03:35.530> in<00:03:35.709> their<00:03:35.920> quality<00:03:36.340> is

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
that the difference in their quality is

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.540 
that the difference in their quality is
vastly<00:03:38.230> offset<00:03:38.680> by<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:38.860> difference<00:03:39.280> in<00:03:39.400> their

to thirteen and a half ounces so that is

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.390 
to thirteen and a half ounces so that is
roughly<00:03:57.220> for<00:03:57.790> testers<00:03:58.330> Dulko<00:03:59.020> cans<00:03:59.320> for<00:04:00.630> the

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
roughly for testers Dulko cans for the

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.920 
roughly for testers Dulko cans for the
cost<00:04:03.400> for<00:04:03.820> an<00:04:03.910> army<00:04:04.090> painter<00:04:04.209> can<00:04:04.510> is<00:04:04.750> about

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
cost for an army painter can is about

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.150 
cost for an army painter can is about
nine<00:04:05.380> dollars<00:04:06.270> testers<00:04:07.270> about<00:04:07.840> four<00:04:08.260> so

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
nine dollars testers about four so

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.760 
nine dollars testers about four so
really<00:04:09.670> um<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.630> know<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.990> equivalent<00:04:11.590> in

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
really um you know the equivalent in

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.250 
really um you know the equivalent in
testers<00:04:12.310> coverage<00:04:12.850> for<00:04:13.450> this<00:04:13.570> can<00:04:13.870> is<00:04:14.140> going

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
testers coverage for this can is going

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.680 
testers coverage for this can is going
to<00:04:14.320> be<00:04:14.440> about<00:04:14.980> over<00:04:15.670> four<00:04:15.940> cans<00:04:16.239> four<00:04:16.540> and<00:04:16.630> a

half<00:04:16.780> cans<00:04:17.049> are<00:04:17.169> about<00:04:17.320> fifteen<00:04:17.739> dollars<00:04:17.890> it's

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
half cans are about fifteen dollars it's

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.070 
half cans are about fifteen dollars it's
about<00:04:18.549> twice<00:04:18.880> as<00:04:19.120> expensive<00:04:19.239> as<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.750> army

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
about twice as expensive as the army

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.659 
about twice as expensive as the army
painter<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.859> definitely<00:04:21.400> don't<00:04:21.549> think

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
painter and I definitely don't think

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:22.920 
painter and I definitely don't think
you're<00:04:21.850> getting<00:04:22.060> twice<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.419> improved

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
you're getting twice the improved

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.720 
you're getting twice the improved
quality<00:04:23.230> out<00:04:23.740> of<00:04:23.980> the<00:04:24.040> testers<00:04:24.370> as<00:04:24.490> you<00:04:24.610> are

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
quality out of the testers as you are

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.450 
quality out of the testers as you are
the<00:04:25.030> army<00:04:25.240> painter<00:04:25.390> matte<00:04:25.690> clear<00:04:25.900> coat<00:04:26.200> I<00:04:26.470> did

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
the army painter matte clear coat I did

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.280 
the army painter matte clear coat I did
a<00:04:27.490> second<00:04:27.970> piece<00:04:28.180> just<00:04:28.419> to<00:04:28.510> double<00:04:28.810> check<00:04:28.840> and

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
a second piece just to double check and

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.230 
a second piece just to double check and
this<00:04:29.950> turned<00:04:30.610> out<00:04:30.730> a<00:04:30.790> little<00:04:31.090> more

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
this turned out a little more

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.290 
this turned out a little more
interesting<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:32.430> took<00:04:33.430> these<00:04:33.820> two<00:04:34.030> wall

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
interesting I took these two wall

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.730 
interesting I took these two wall
sections<00:04:34.720> which<00:04:34.870> I'm<00:04:34.990> going<00:04:35.110> to<00:04:35.169> discuss<00:04:35.470> in<00:04:35.650> a

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
sections which I'm going to discuss in a

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.460 
sections which I'm going to discuss in a
later<00:04:35.860> video<00:04:36.130> and<00:04:36.640> I<00:04:37.360> these<00:04:38.110> are

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
later video and I these are

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.830 
later video and I these are
built<00:04:39.160> out<00:04:39.280> of<00:04:39.340> her<00:04:39.520> stars<00:04:39.790> box<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.270> painted

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
built out of her stars box I painted

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.230 
built out of her stars box I painted
them<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.200> then<00:04:41.530> because<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.520> Hirst<00:04:42.760> arts<00:04:42.910> box

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
them and then because the Hirst arts box

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.360 
them and then because the Hirst arts box
tend<00:04:43.630> to<00:04:43.810> you<00:04:44.080> know<00:04:44.200> the<00:04:44.410> risk<00:04:44.620> is<00:04:44.800> always<00:04:45.070> when

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
tend to you know the risk is always when

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.950 
tend to you know the risk is always when
you<00:04:45.460> work<00:04:45.610> with<00:04:45.670> plaster<00:04:46.090> is<00:04:46.180> chipping<00:04:46.540> and<00:04:46.750> I

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
you work with plaster is chipping and I

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.600 
you work with plaster is chipping and I
thought<00:04:47.140> let's<00:04:47.440> try<00:04:47.530> giving<00:04:47.920> them<00:04:48.070> a<00:04:48.220> heavy

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
thought let's try giving them a heavy

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.360 
thought let's try giving them a heavy
coverage<00:04:49.480> protective<00:04:50.170> coat<00:04:50.440> so<00:04:50.950> I<00:04:50.980> sprayed

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
coverage protective coat so I sprayed

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.360 
coverage protective coat so I sprayed
them<00:04:51.580> with<00:04:51.760> painters<00:04:52.540> touch<00:04:52.860> gloss<00:04:53.860> clear

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
them with painters touch gloss clear

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.730 
them with painters touch gloss clear
coat<00:04:54.580> first<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:55.300> I<00:04:55.660> gave<00:04:55.840> them<00:04:56.050> a<00:04:56.290> a<00:04:56.440> very

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
coat first and I gave them a a very

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.050 
coat first and I gave them a a very
heavy<00:04:57.040> coat<00:04:57.280> well<00:04:57.520> I<00:04:57.550> wouldn't<00:04:57.970> say<00:04:58.030> very

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
heavy coat well I wouldn't say very

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.520 
heavy coat well I wouldn't say very
heavy<00:04:58.540> coat<00:04:58.780> of<00:04:58.900> them<00:04:58.990> but<00:04:59.110> I<00:04:59.140> gave<00:04:59.380> him<00:04:59.500> a

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
heavy coat of them but I gave him a

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.890 
heavy coat of them but I gave him a
pretty<00:04:59.740> solid<00:05:00.100> coat<00:05:00.490> of<00:05:00.610> that<00:05:00.790> just<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.780> give

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
pretty solid coat of that just to give

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.440 
pretty solid coat of that just to give
it<00:05:01.930> a<00:05:02.020> little<00:05:02.230> protection<00:05:02.560> and<00:05:03.090> then<00:05:04.090> I<00:05:04.120> gave

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
it a little protection and then I gave

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.520 
it a little protection and then I gave
one<00:05:05.110> the<00:05:05.950> testers<00:05:06.700> dull<00:05:07.120> coat<00:05:07.390> spray<00:05:08.200> on<00:05:08.470> it

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
one the testers dull coat spray on it

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
one the testers dull coat spray on it
and<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.870> other<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:11.140> gave<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.740> army<00:05:12.100> painters

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
and the other I gave the army painters

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.020 
and the other I gave the army painters
spray<00:05:13.300> on<00:05:13.570> it<00:05:13.750> and<00:05:13.960> I<00:05:14.410> have<00:05:14.590> to<00:05:14.800> say<00:05:15.130> for<00:05:15.790> some

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
spray on it and I have to say for some

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.100 
spray on it and I have to say for some
reason<00:05:17.010> they<00:05:18.060> ended<00:05:19.060> up<00:05:19.180> a<00:05:19.360> bit<00:05:19.600> more<00:05:19.840> glossy

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
reason they ended up a bit more glossy

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.490 
reason they ended up a bit more glossy
than<00:05:21.070> what<00:05:21.880> I've<00:05:22.000> seen<00:05:22.210> in<00:05:22.390> the<00:05:22.480> past<00:05:22.510> on<00:05:23.050> some

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
than what I've seen in the past on some

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.810 
than what I've seen in the past on some
of<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:23.650> other<00:05:23.800> test<00:05:24.070> pieces<00:05:24.280> that<00:05:24.550> I've<00:05:24.640> done

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
of the other test pieces that I've done

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.900 
of the other test pieces that I've done
with<00:05:24.970> the<00:05:25.090> testers<00:05:25.420> dull<00:05:25.600> coat<00:05:26.790> and<00:05:27.790> I'm

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
with the testers dull coat and I'm

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.090 
with the testers dull coat and I'm
wondering<00:05:28.150> if<00:05:28.420> it's<00:05:28.570> because<00:05:28.930> you<00:05:29.710> know<00:05:29.830> in

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
wondering if it's because you know in

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.610 
wondering if it's because you know in
the<00:05:30.460> past<00:05:30.580> I've<00:05:31.150> technically<00:05:31.600> painted<00:05:32.110> over

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
the past I've technically painted over

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.550 
the past I've technically painted over
those<00:05:33.070> gloss<00:05:33.370> coats<00:05:33.700> a<00:05:34.210> little<00:05:34.960> bit<00:05:35.080> before

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
those gloss coats a little bit before

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.550 
those gloss coats a little bit before
applying<00:05:35.980> or<00:05:36.370> I<00:05:36.430> should<00:05:36.970> say<00:05:37.200> after<00:05:38.200> applying

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
applying or I should say after applying

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.350 
applying or I should say after applying
the<00:05:38.950> matte<00:05:39.160> clear<00:05:39.430> coat<00:05:39.730> I<00:05:39.940> have<00:05:40.180> then

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
the matte clear coat I have then

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.030 
the matte clear coat I have then
subsequently<00:05:40.870> painted<00:05:41.320> over<00:05:41.500> those<00:05:41.770> spots

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
subsequently painted over those spots

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.580 
subsequently painted over those spots
and<00:05:42.250> so<00:05:42.760> that<00:05:42.940> probably<00:05:43.360> helped<00:05:43.750> mute<00:05:44.140> some<00:05:44.440> of

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
and so that probably helped mute some of

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.590 
and so that probably helped mute some of
the<00:05:44.740> residual<00:05:45.310> gloss<00:05:45.640> when<00:05:46.270> you<00:05:46.360> look<00:05:46.510> at

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
the residual gloss when you look at

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.140 
the residual gloss when you look at
these<00:05:46.720> pieces<00:05:46.960> there<00:05:47.650> is<00:05:47.860> a<00:05:48.100> little<00:05:48.580> bit<00:05:48.760> of<00:05:49.030> a

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
these pieces there is a little bit of a

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.810 
these pieces there is a little bit of a
gloss<00:05:49.390> still<00:05:49.810> showing<00:05:50.230> on<00:05:50.410> them<00:05:50.700> so<00:05:51.700> they're

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
gloss still showing on them so they're

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.770 
gloss still showing on them so they're
not<00:05:51.880> completely<00:05:52.660> flat<00:05:53.350> but<00:05:53.830> having<00:05:54.340> said<00:05:54.490> that

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
not completely flat but having said that

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.120 
not completely flat but having said that
the<00:05:55.780> army<00:05:56.020> painter<00:05:56.169> is<00:05:56.350> no<00:05:56.470> more<00:05:56.620> glossy<00:05:56.800> than

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
the army painter is no more glossy than

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.219 
the army painter is no more glossy than
the<00:05:57.220> testers<00:05:57.580> is<00:05:57.729> so<00:05:58.150> I<00:05:58.180> give<00:05:58.479> them<00:05:58.630> both<00:05:58.810> equal

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
the testers is so I give them both equal

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:00.930 
the testers is so I give them both equal
you<00:05:59.470> know<00:05:59.500> weight<00:05:59.919> in<00:06:00.190> terms<00:06:00.400> of<00:06:00.610> how<00:06:00.700> well

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
you know weight in terms of how well

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.480 
you know weight in terms of how well
they've<00:06:01.090> covered<00:06:01.570> the<00:06:01.720> gloss<00:06:01.900> coating<00:06:02.830> but

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
they've covered the gloss coating but

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.850 
they've covered the gloss coating but
it's<00:06:03.640> not<00:06:03.850> quite<00:06:04.150> as<00:06:04.360> flat<00:06:04.840> as<00:06:05.080> I<00:06:05.229> had<00:06:05.440> hoped

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
it's not quite as flat as I had hoped

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.140 
it's not quite as flat as I had hoped
which<00:06:06.130> I<00:06:06.280> was<00:06:06.430> a<00:06:06.460> little<00:06:06.490> surprised<00:06:06.910> because

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
which I was a little surprised because

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.990 
which I was a little surprised because
the<00:06:07.570> quick<00:06:08.290> shape<00:06:08.530> produces<00:06:09.130> you<00:06:09.580> know<00:06:09.669> a<00:06:09.700> very

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
the quick shape produces you know a very

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.969 
the quick shape produces you know a very
high<00:06:10.120> gloss<00:06:10.479> finish<00:06:10.540> and<00:06:11.020> it<00:06:11.350> seems<00:06:11.590> to<00:06:11.680> cover

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
high gloss finish and it seems to cover

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:13.530 
high gloss finish and it seems to cover
the<00:06:12.340> quick<00:06:12.490> shade<00:06:12.820> a<00:06:12.970> little<00:06:13.240> bit<00:06:13.360> better

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
the quick shade a little bit better

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.930 
the quick shade a little bit better
which<00:06:14.080> is<00:06:14.260> an<00:06:14.410> interesting<00:06:14.979> comment<00:06:15.490> now<00:06:15.790> that

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
which is an interesting comment now that

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.040 
which is an interesting comment now that
I'm<00:06:16.030> thinking<00:06:16.180> about<00:06:16.419> it<00:06:16.630> because<00:06:16.690> perhaps

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
I'm thinking about it because perhaps

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.690 
I'm thinking about it because perhaps
the<00:06:17.200> quick<00:06:17.350> shade<00:06:17.620> is<00:06:17.770> a<00:06:18.190> little<00:06:18.490> bit<00:06:18.580> more

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
the quick shade is a little bit more

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.180 
the quick shade is a little bit more
receptive<00:06:19.090> to<00:06:19.720> a<00:06:19.750> matte<00:06:20.020> clear<00:06:20.169> coat<00:06:20.500> then<00:06:20.890> say

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
receptive to a matte clear coat then say

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.250 
receptive to a matte clear coat then say
the<00:06:21.550> gloss<00:06:21.850> clear<00:06:22.120> coat<00:06:22.390> from<00:06:22.600> painters

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
the gloss clear coat from painters

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.140 
the gloss clear coat from painters
touching<00:06:23.650> which<00:06:23.830> is<00:06:23.979> a<00:06:24.010> common<00:06:24.669> Home<00:06:24.850> Depot

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150

but in any case they still equal in

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.870 
but in any case they still equal in
