 that I have another machine 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.770
 that motto of making a 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.900

 we learned to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.950
 the model of the imss ht 16 0 0 6 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.200
 the last precedent 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.890
 that is to share files 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.730
 with people at risk 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.660
 all keep a copious connected to the same working group 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.800
 to know a little more 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.200
 following 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.920
 to bring to light hard work 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.390
 said 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.060
 morin properties 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.060
 a team in that work group 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.620
 a network does not 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.979
 mockus 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.790

 what they do not stop changing 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.530
 and in that section I did a good job here we put the new name 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.290
