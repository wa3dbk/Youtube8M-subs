00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
until I found something that I liked now

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.870 
until I found something that I liked now
obviously<00:01:07.439> if<00:01:07.950> you're<00:01:08.280> looking<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:08.700> an

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
obviously if you're looking for an

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.310 
obviously if you're looking for an
application<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.510> allows<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.080> quickly

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
add a consistent effect this is not the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.570 
add a consistent effect this is not the
most<00:01:13.380> efficient<00:01:13.890> way<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.400> just

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
most efficient way so this is just

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.460 
most efficient way so this is just
something<00:01:14.729> that's<00:01:14.970> really<00:01:15.180> fun<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:15.720> but

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
something that's really fun to do but

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.440 
something that's really fun to do but
once<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.950> do<00:01:17.159> find<00:01:17.460> something<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.090> like

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
once you do find something that you like

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.990 
once you do find something that you like
you<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:19.140> actually<00:01:19.830> add<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.490> one<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.790> your

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
you can actually add that as one of your

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.249 
you can actually add that as one of your
favorites<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:21.689> going<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.840> keep<00:01:21.990> swiping

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
favorites so I'm going to keep swiping

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.780 
favorites so I'm going to keep swiping
through<00:01:22.470> here<00:01:22.799> until<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.070> find<00:01:23.100> something<00:01:23.580> that

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
through here until I find something that

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.880 
through here until I find something that
I<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.390> I'm<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.320> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.680> keep<00:01:25.830> going

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
I like and I'm just going to keep going

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.730 
I like and I'm just going to keep going
so<00:01:26.880> let's<00:01:27.119> pretend<00:01:27.390> like<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.170> so

so let's pretend like I like this one so

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.530 
so let's pretend like I like this one so
what<00:01:28.860> i<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.040> do<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.220> i<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.460> tap<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.450> i

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
what i can do is i can tap on here and i

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.600 
what i can do is i can tap on here and i
can<00:01:30.570> push<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.680> star<00:01:31.979> right<00:01:32.130> here<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.520> that

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
can push this star right here and that

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.149 
can push this star right here and that
adds<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.180> as<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.450> favorite<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.650> i<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.860> always

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159

here<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.650> i<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.009> also<00:01:38.189> click<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.820> effects

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
here is i can also click this effects

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.630 
here is i can also click this effects
button<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.020> there<00:01:40.680> are<00:01:40.829> all<00:01:41.040> kinds<00:01:41.549> of

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
button here and there are all kinds of

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.399 
button here and there are all kinds of
effects<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.150> been<00:01:42.360> pre-made<00:01:43.020> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
effects that have been pre-made and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.560 
effects that have been pre-made and
their<00:01:44.009> name<00:01:44.189> something<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.149> boiling

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
their name something like the boiling

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.899 
their name something like the boiling
anger<00:01:45.990> swallowed<00:01:46.590> deep<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.250> ancient

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
anger swallowed deep and ancient

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.240 
anger swallowed deep and ancient
simplicity<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.570> zen<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:48.930> peace<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.979> i'm<00:01:50.070> not

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
simplicity of zen and peace so i'm not

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.340 
simplicity of zen and peace so i'm not
quite<00:01:50.610> sure<00:01:50.640> how<00:01:51.060> those<00:01:51.299> names<00:01:51.630> were<00:01:51.869> created

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
quite sure how those names were created

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.170 
quite sure how those names were created
but<00:01:52.530> there<00:01:52.680> they<00:01:52.829> are<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.790> we're<00:01:54.000> going<00:01:54.090> to

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
but there they are and so we're going to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.850 
but there they are and so we're going to
choose<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.630> warm<00:01:54.840> chocolate<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.470> we<00:01:55.590> ate

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
choose the warm chocolate that we ate

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.959 
choose the warm chocolate that we ate
slowly<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:57.049> there's<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.350> effect<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.700> so<00:01:59.909> i

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
slowly and there's the effect and so i

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.670 
slowly and there's the effect and so i
can<00:02:00.090> go<00:02:00.180> right<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.689> now<00:02:01.020> once<00:02:01.409> i<00:02:01.530> have

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
can go right to that now once i have

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.709 
can go right to that now once i have
that<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:02.040> here<00:02:02.070> i<00:02:02.310> can<00:02:02.670> start<00:02:02.969> playing<00:02:03.479> with<00:02:03.659> it

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
that in here i can start playing with it

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.630 
that in here i can start playing with it
and<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.259> we<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.710> little<00:02:05.070> thing<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.490> says

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
and so we have this little thing it says

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.320 
and so we have this little thing it says
yen<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.119> other<00:02:06.360> one<00:02:06.479> says<00:02:06.719> yang<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.770> yen

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
yen in other one says yang and so yen

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.059 
yen in other one says yang and so yen
adjusts<00:02:09.330> how<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.660> texture<00:02:10.349> on<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> image

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
adjusts how the texture on the image

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.730 
adjusts how the texture on the image
looks<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:11.849> i<00:02:11.879> can<00:02:12.239> add

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
looks and so i can add

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.550 
looks and so i can add
more<00:02:12.950> texture<00:02:13.490> i<00:02:13.760> can<00:02:14.210> add<00:02:14.360> less<00:02:14.780> texture<00:02:15.350> and

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
more texture i can add less texture and

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.680 
more texture i can add less texture and
then<00:02:15.920> also<00:02:16.130> i<00:02:16.280> can<00:02:16.370> choose<00:02:16.850> how<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.300> texture

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
then also i can choose how that texture

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.200 
then also i can choose how that texture
is<00:02:17.750> applied<00:02:18.170> by<00:02:18.980> clicking<00:02:19.520> down<00:02:19.670> here<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.120> you

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
is applied by clicking down here and you

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.030 
is applied by clicking down here and you
can<00:02:20.330> see<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.540> we<00:02:20.720> have<00:02:20.750> hard<00:02:21.170> light<00:02:21.380> we<00:02:21.890> can

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
can see that we have hard light we can

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.550 
can see that we have hard light we can
choose<00:02:22.250> overlay<00:02:22.700> multiply<00:02:23.300> luminosity<00:02:24.110> etc

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
choose overlay multiply luminosity etc

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.260 
choose overlay multiply luminosity etc
and<00:02:24.740> so<00:02:24.800> if<00:02:25.160> you're<00:02:25.280> familiar<00:02:25.400> with<00:02:25.670> photoshop

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
and so if you're familiar with photoshop

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.930 
and so if you're familiar with photoshop
you're<00:02:26.480> familiar<00:02:26.600> with<00:02:26.900> how<00:02:27.170> those<00:02:27.440> apply<00:02:28.070> the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
you're familiar with how those apply the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.360 
you're familiar with how those apply the
overlays<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.690> image<00:02:29.960> itself<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.920> then

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
overlays to the image itself and then

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.640 
overlays to the image itself and then
what<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.670> yang<00:02:31.940> does<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.840> yang<00:02:33.110> actually

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
what the yang does the yang actually

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.010 
what the yang does the yang actually
adjusts<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.430> image<00:02:35.030> layered<00:02:35.450> on<00:02:35.630> top<00:02:35.660> of

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
adjusts the image layered on top of

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.020 
adjusts the image layered on top of
itself<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.770> so<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:37.310> actually<00:02:37.580> have<00:02:37.730> two

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
itself and so you actually have two

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.900 
itself and so you actually have two
images<00:02:38.810> here<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.530> mountains<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:40.880> i

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
images here of the mountains and so i

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.720 
images here of the mountains and so i
can<00:02:41.390> adjust<00:02:41.690> how<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.590> looks<00:02:42.950> can<00:02:43.550> add<00:02:43.700> a

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
can adjust how that looks can add a

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.100 
can adjust how that looks can add a
little<00:02:43.910> bit<00:02:44.030> more<00:02:44.210> a<00:02:44.270> little<00:02:44.390> bit<00:02:44.570> less<00:02:44.810> and

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
little bit more a little bit less and

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.830 
little bit more a little bit less and
then<00:02:45.200> again<00:02:45.530> i<00:02:45.560> can<00:02:45.770> change<00:02:46.120> how<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.150> that

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
then again i can change how that that

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.810 
then again i can change how that that
layer<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.350> applied<00:02:48.530> either<00:02:49.160> it's<00:02:49.400> hard<00:02:49.610> light

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
layer is applied either it's hard light

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.270 
layer is applied either it's hard light
or<00:02:50.030> multiplied<00:02:50.480> or<00:02:50.510> overlaid<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:51.890> just<00:02:52.160> by

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
or multiplied or overlaid and so just by

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.070 
or multiplied or overlaid and so just by
changing<00:02:52.790> that<00:02:53.120> sometimes<00:02:53.780> i<00:02:53.840> can<00:02:53.960> get

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
changing that sometimes i can get

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.050 
changing that sometimes i can get
different<00:02:54.260> effects<00:02:54.710> and<00:02:55.640> then<00:02:55.790> there's<00:02:55.940> this

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
different effects and then there's this

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.150 
different effects and then there's this
other<00:02:56.300> thing<00:02:56.600> that's<00:02:56.840> called<00:02:57.050> glow<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:58.040> what

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
other thing that's called glow and what

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.980 
other thing that's called glow and what
glow<00:02:58.430> does<00:02:58.670> is<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.060> adds<00:02:59.210> a<00:02:59.390> magical<00:02:59.840> glow

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
glow does is it adds a magical glow

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.710 
glow does is it adds a magical glow
that's<00:03:00.470> unpredictable<00:03:01.240> just<00:03:02.240> like<00:03:02.450> life

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
that's unpredictable just like life

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.120 
that's unpredictable just like life
that's<00:03:03.050> what<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.470> says<00:03:03.860> in<00:03:04.040> the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
that's what that says in the

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.130 
that's what that says in the
instructions<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:04.790> when<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:04.970> click<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:05.270> you

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
instructions so when I click this you

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.440 
instructions so when I click this you
can<00:03:06.290> see<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:06.620> I<00:03:06.680> get<00:03:06.740> this<00:03:07.180> interesting<00:03:08.180> glow

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
can see that I get this interesting glow

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.240 
can see that I get this interesting glow
here<00:03:08.660> now<00:03:09.020> the<00:03:09.080> cool<00:03:09.410> thing<00:03:09.440> is<00:03:09.650> I<00:03:09.920> can<00:03:10.070> also

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
here now the cool thing is I can also

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.000 
here now the cool thing is I can also
click<00:03:11.150> on<00:03:11.330> this<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:11.540> get<00:03:12.050> more<00:03:12.290> options<00:03:12.890> and

so I can add a vignette to this image I

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.440 
so I can add a vignette to this image I
can<00:03:15.620> adjust<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.100> contrast<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.880> can<00:03:17.000> adjust<00:03:17.330> the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
can adjust the contrast I can adjust the

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.630 
can adjust the contrast I can adjust the
brightness<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:18.170> once<00:03:18.830> I<00:03:18.980> have<00:03:19.160> that<00:03:19.190> I<00:03:19.400> can

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
brightness and once I have that I can

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.910 
brightness and once I have that I can
even<00:03:19.790> click<00:03:20.150> add<00:03:20.360> effect<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.080> so<00:03:21.620> that<00:03:21.770> adds

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
even click add effect and so that adds

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.980 
even click add effect and so that adds
the<00:03:22.130> effect<00:03:22.430> there<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:22.910> then<00:03:23.570> it'll<00:03:23.720> take

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
the effect there and then it'll take

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.570 
the effect there and then it'll take
this<00:03:24.230> current<00:03:24.500> effect<00:03:24.860> and<00:03:25.010> use<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:25.220> as<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.370> new

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
this current effect and use it as a new

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.090 
this current effect and use it as a new
original<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.390> create<00:03:26.690> 100<00:03:27.230> new<00:03:27.440> effects<00:03:27.800> and

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
original to create 100 new effects and

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.520 
original to create 100 new effects and
so<00:03:28.190> that's<00:03:28.370> really<00:03:28.580> cool<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.480> so<00:03:29.930> then<00:03:30.170> I<00:03:30.200> can

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
so that's really cool and so then I can

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.820 
so that's really cool and so then I can
go<00:03:30.770> in<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.190> I<00:03:31.850> add<00:03:32.480> another<00:03:32.960> effect<00:03:33.350> on<00:03:33.500> top<00:03:33.710> of

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
go in and I add another effect on top of

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.320 
go in and I add another effect on top of
that<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.130> another<00:03:34.340> effect<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:34.880> top<00:03:35.090> of<00:03:35.210> that

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
that and another effect on top of that

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.990 
that and another effect on top of that
and<00:03:35.510> so<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:35.720> can<00:03:35.990> just<00:03:36.530> create<00:03:37.370> these<00:03:37.610> works

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
and so you can just create these works

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.300 
and so you can just create these works
of<00:03:38.120> art<00:03:38.330> based<00:03:38.990> on<00:03:39.290> adding<00:03:39.800> effect<00:03:40.100> upon

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
effect upon effect you can also rotate

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.080 
effect upon effect you can also rotate
things<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:42.890> you<00:03:42.980> can<00:03:43.100> reset<00:03:43.490> them<00:03:43.730> if<00:03:43.850> you<00:03:43.940> get
