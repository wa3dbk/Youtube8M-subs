00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:13.229
 as 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.200
 the decline is that none of this has anything to do with it 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.100
 maybe the stupidities 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.620
 this nature 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.180
 maybe when I hear is the term global warming think about 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.790
 sci-fi movies of radical environmental groups or even worse than 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.230
 it's been many years before it becomes a reality, maybe if 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.730
 they are recovering 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.250
 this is our planet 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.840
 the house that surrounds us is the atmosphere its function is to catch some of the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.090
 Sun rays and keep them inside the planet to conserve a temperature 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.840
 of 15 degrees centigrade 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.189
 otherwise the sun's rays would escape and our planet would fall 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.189
 at a temperature of - August 18 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.560
 this is known as greenhouse effect ten effected by gases like steam 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.470
 of water the carbon dioxide the veteran pivot post in a proportion 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.250
 adequate greenhouse gases do their job 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.260
 but you and your concentration increases the rays of the sun can not escape and the 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.630
 temperature of the planet 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.890
 although it leaves with repercussions 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.130
 disastrous this is the concentration of carbon dioxide the temperature 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.999
 global average of the last 30 years 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.840
 and this is the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere currently 

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:53.550
 us some relation 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.820
 because they increase greenhouse gases there are three factors 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.820
 fundamentals the burning of fossil fuels 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.450
 the destruction of forests that absorb carbon dioxide and the increase of 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.250
 the whole population is a vicious circle the population of the world increases 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.650
 dizzily which supposes a greater demand of food water and the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.129
 natural resources 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.349
 the trees absorb a large percentage of the dioxide emanations 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.790
 carbon but we are currently destroying our forests and jungles 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.709
 the lungs of our planet to meet the demands that lead us 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.749
 to the third point of the vicious circle 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:33.469
 obsolete technologies 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.629
 the human being still uses coal-based plants to generate energy 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.649
 this translates into 2 thousand 500 million tons of carbon dioxide per year 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:46.049
 that excessive use of the automobile is expelled into the environment and generate 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.379
 hundreds of millions of tons of carbon dioxide that are going away 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.249
 he urged the atmosphere what consequences the 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:55.719
 global warming let's see 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:59.430
 When caught, a greater number of sun rays and the temperature of the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.680
 planet increase this causes there was a strong water shortage so that 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.519
 lose 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.079
 Paradoxically, global warming also produces flood changes 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.299
 more severe 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.079
 the sun's rays increase the temperature of the oceans this causes 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.079
 greater evaporation and more severe rainfall 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.120
 but also when in a creek in contact with black water 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.299
 happens 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.679
 with the reopening occasions also that the funds are unknown 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:33.540
 as a consequence basagoiti a more central 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.950
 that raise the level of the oceans causing severe flooding the 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.470
 problem is serious if the sea level will rise 6 meters randomly and some 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.869
 places like lorica san francisco holland 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:51.789
 of Iceland in Calcutta clarÃ­n a maneuvers act veracruz was initiated 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:54.589
 Tabasco and Campeche 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:56.209
 I could feel in my own flesh 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.009
 you can keep thinking there is still time to change but that is not true 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:04.599
 we have to start acting now here are some simple points that you can 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.839
 adopt to help the planet 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:09.349
 buy energy-saving lights 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.219
 turn off electrical appliances instead of leaving them on hold reduces consumption 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:19.449
 of heaters and air conditioning if you can buy a motor car 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.869
 own electricity of a percentage of 17 kilometers per liter 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.819
 keep your car tires well inflated share the car 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.460
 in a bicycle 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.330
 uses less hot water to bread and art washes clothes with cold water porthole 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.349
 Recycle 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.020
 separate garbage planted a tree 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.159
 efe 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:46.749
 We are finishing the planet this wonderful world that makes us so much 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:51.479
 we are still on time but we have to change our way of thinking and 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.720
 start acting 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.850
