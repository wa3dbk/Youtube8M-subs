and Maidana Conor Casey getting into it

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.300

so<00:04:58.389> really<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.139> for<00:04:59.470> them<00:04:59.590> the<00:04:59.770> help<00:04:59.979> was

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
so really the for them the help was

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.670 
so really the for them the help was
needed<00:05:00.370> at<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.150> center<00:05:01.389> back<00:05:01.570> musician<00:05:02.169> and<00:05:02.380> I

needed at the center back musician and I

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.320

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
think he you couldn't have asked for a

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.700 
think he you couldn't have asked for a
better<00:05:04.360> scientist<00:05:04.990> no<00:05:05.199> and<00:05:05.470> they<00:05:05.530> also

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
better scientist no and they also

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.050 
better scientist no and they also

the<00:05:11.470> signing<00:05:11.800> from<00:05:11.919> Carlos<00:05:12.250> Valdez<00:05:12.610> and<00:05:12.669> I

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
the signing from Carlos Valdez and I

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.939 
the signing from Carlos Valdez and I
actually<00:05:13.090> think<00:05:13.509> if<00:05:13.990> I<00:05:14.169> had<00:05:14.289> to<00:05:14.349> pick<00:05:14.410> one<00:05:14.530> team

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
actually think if I had to pick one team

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.620 
actually think if I had to pick one team
out<00:05:15.220> of<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.580> playoff<00:05:15.880> picture<00:05:15.910> at<00:05:16.419> this

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
out of the playoff picture at this

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.540 
out of the playoff picture at this
moment<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:17.259> think<00:05:17.680> Philadelphia<00:05:18.220> makes<00:05:18.430> the

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
moment I think Philadelphia makes the

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.490 
moment I think Philadelphia makes the
playoffs<00:05:18.759> because<00:05:19.090> of<00:05:19.449> this<00:05:19.539> signing<00:05:20.020> now

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
playoffs because of this signing now

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.020 
playoffs because of this signing now
what<00:05:20.800> do<00:05:20.889> you<00:05:20.919> do<00:05:21.190> it<00:05:21.370> gives<00:05:21.550> you<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:21.820> luxury

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
what do you do it gives you the luxury

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.939 
what do you do it gives you the luxury
to<00:05:22.270> say<00:05:22.449> well<00:05:22.930> Marissa<00:05:23.080> do<00:05:23.440> complain<00:05:23.770> the

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
to say well Marissa do complain the

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.339 
to say well Marissa do complain the
midfield<00:05:24.310> I<00:05:24.550> can<00:05:24.729> play<00:05:24.880> him<00:05:25.120> next<00:05:25.750> to<00:05:25.930> Valdez

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
midfield I can play him next to Valdez

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.529 
midfield I can play him next to Valdez
everyone<00:05:27.039> forgets<00:05:27.400> Austin<00:05:27.909> buried<00:05:28.240> next<00:05:28.360> to

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
everyone forgets Austin buried next to

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.480 
everyone forgets Austin buried next to
friedrich<00:05:28.990> was<00:05:29.199> a<00:05:29.229> very<00:05:29.590> good<00:05:29.860> center<00:05:30.310> back

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
friedrich was a very good center back

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.460 
friedrich was a very good center back
for<00:05:30.699> chicago<00:05:31.090> fire<00:05:31.330> maybe<00:05:31.960> he's<00:05:32.139> better<00:05:32.380> at

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
for chicago fire maybe he's better at

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.500 
for chicago fire maybe he's better at
centre-back<00:05:33.010> and<00:05:33.190> then<00:05:33.280> you<00:05:33.400> can<00:05:33.550> play<00:05:33.760> okugo

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
centre-back and then you can play okugo

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.540 
centre-back and then you can play okugo
and<00:05:34.900> a<00:05:35.080> do<00:05:35.260> in<00:05:35.349> the<00:05:35.440> midfield<00:05:35.620> they're<00:05:36.340> very

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
and a do in the midfield they're very

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.219 
and a do in the midfield they're very
good<00:05:36.699> going<00:05:37.090> forward<00:05:37.449> I<00:05:37.539> think<00:05:37.570> Brian<00:05:37.930> Browns

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
good going forward I think Brian Browns

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.290 
good going forward I think Brian Browns
an<00:05:38.440> interesting<00:05:38.919> pick<00:05:39.460> up<00:05:39.639> I<00:05:39.789> think<00:05:39.849> he<00:05:40.150> could

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
an interesting pick up I think he could

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.080 
an interesting pick up I think he could
be<00:05:40.419> very<00:05:40.780> dangerous<00:05:41.470> one<00:05:41.800> game<00:05:42.250> one<00:05:42.460> goal<00:05:42.699> yeah

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
be very dangerous one game one goal yeah

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.450 
be very dangerous one game one goal yeah
nice<00:05:43.389> ratio<00:05:43.659> yeah<00:05:44.199> I<00:05:44.229> thought<00:05:44.830> that<00:05:45.070> Taylor

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
nice ratio yeah I thought that Taylor

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.240 
nice ratio yeah I thought that Taylor
Twellman<00:05:45.849> asked<00:05:46.240> ratio<00:05:46.810> there<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.320> I<00:05:47.740> let's

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
Twellman asked ratio there and I let's

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.529 
Twellman asked ratio there and I let's
hope<00:05:48.400> he's<00:05:48.580> better<00:05:48.729> than<00:05:48.970> that<00:05:49.120> let's<00:05:49.360> be

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
hope he's better than that let's be

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.360 
hope he's better than that let's be
honest<00:05:49.750> but<00:05:50.199> you<00:05:50.440> really<00:05:50.620> look<00:05:50.889> at<00:05:51.010> it<00:05:51.070> i<00:05:51.310> think

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
honest but you really look at it i think

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.510 
honest but you really look at it i think
the<00:05:51.729> Eastern<00:05:52.060> Conference<00:05:52.240> because<00:05:52.840> of<00:05:52.990> how

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
the Eastern Conference because of how

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.370 
the Eastern Conference because of how
uncertain<00:05:54.520> they<00:05:54.729> really<00:05:55.000> are<00:05:55.180> your<00:05:55.840> stats<00:05:56.080> say

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
uncertain they really are your stats say

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.200 
uncertain they really are your stats say
a<00:05:56.409> lot<00:05:56.680> I<00:05:56.740> think<00:05:57.130> Philadelphia's<00:05:57.849> turning<00:05:58.120> the

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
a lot I think Philadelphia's turning the

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.939 
a lot I think Philadelphia's turning the
corner<00:05:58.360> involved<00:05:58.750> as<00:05:58.870> only<00:05:59.050> hope<00:05:59.259> so<00:05:59.380> let's

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
corner involved as only hope so let's

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.310 
corner involved as only hope so let's
move<00:06:00.430> on<00:06:00.669> and<00:06:00.699> not<00:06:01.240> talk<00:06:01.840> about<00:06:02.050> all<00:06:02.169> the

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
move on and not talk about all the

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.540 
move on and not talk about all the
serious<00:06:02.740> stuff<00:06:02.919> as<00:06:03.070> we've<00:06:03.220> been<00:06:03.250> doing

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
serious stuff as we've been doing

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.330 
serious stuff as we've been doing
because<00:06:03.970> the<00:06:04.150> mls<00:06:04.570> all-star<00:06:05.080> event<00:06:05.740> has<00:06:05.949> so
