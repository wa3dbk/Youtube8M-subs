00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.730
 imagine the head seen from above le 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.449
 divisions we're going to perform 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.070
 they will be very similar to an octagon 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.289
 obviously the lines in our case do not 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.029
 then ours will be regular 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.029
 octagon will be irregular 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.130
 all 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.420
 the third is what will be transported 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.730
 slightly outward for 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.730
 keep the frontal part longer 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.630
 in case of backwards and hats that 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.300
 they push towards the skin we will go to 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.370
 roll on the opposite side and with 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.470
 movements from the bottom to the other we will do 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.460
 slip the scissors by opening and closing 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.460
 the upper blade 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.080
 as you can see the hair will have more thrust 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.160
 upwards and that's what we need 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.160
 for the final line 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.580
 understood
