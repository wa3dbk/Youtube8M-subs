00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
we're going to play it like this is

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.360 
we're going to play it like this is
because<00:02:20.579> this<00:02:21.030> song<00:02:21.299> uses<00:02:22.019> a<00:02:22.170> standard<00:02:23.099> C

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
because this song uses a standard C

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.869 
because this song uses a standard C
chord<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.700> regular<00:02:24.090> old<00:02:24.359> C<00:02:24.689> chord<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.879> there's

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
chord a regular old C chord and there's

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.440 
chord a regular old C chord and there's
fast<00:02:27.299> transitions<00:02:27.959> between<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.439> C<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:29.069> G

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
fast transitions between the C and the G

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.809 
fast transitions between the C and the G
and<00:02:30.450> when<00:02:31.319> we<00:02:31.409> play<00:02:31.620> G<00:02:31.829> like<00:02:31.980> this<00:02:32.219> it's<00:02:32.760> very

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
and when we play G like this it's very

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.700 
and when we play G like this it's very
easy<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.359> transition<00:02:33.810> over<00:02:34.109> to<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.379> C<00:02:34.560> chord

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.380 

the<00:02:38.710> other<00:02:38.860> chords<00:02:39.220> we're<00:02:39.340> going<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.520> need<00:02:39.700> are

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
the other chords we're going to need are

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.240 
the other chords we're going to need are
a<00:02:40.450> standard<00:02:40.810> D<00:02:41.110> chord<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.590> then<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:41.980> standard

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
a standard D chord and then a standard

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.050 
a standard D chord and then a standard
Iman

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.620 

so<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.270> intro<00:02:50.720> uses<00:02:51.710> just<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.430> C<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:53.180> G<00:02:53.390> and

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
so the intro uses just the C the G and

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.080 
so the intro uses just the C the G and
the<00:02:53.870> D<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:55.040> uses<00:02:55.280> all<00:02:55.430> downstrokes

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
the D and it uses all downstrokes

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.590 
the D and it uses all downstrokes
it<00:02:56.360> goes<00:02:56.570> like<00:02:56.750> this<00:02:56.780> down<00:02:57.680> down<00:02:58.220> down<00:02:58.730> down

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
it goes like this down down down down
