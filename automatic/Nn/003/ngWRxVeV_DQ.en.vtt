00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:09.330
 a few words about the preparation 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.630
 antenna cable in type and a couch on 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.040
 He special connectors connectors 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.740
 cable is used as in TVs 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.900
 and satellites for example to connect 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.230
 television antenna to the television either 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.670
 to connect a satellite dish to 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.060
 various household compounds for 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:32.460
 dilutions of 20 and patches of the TV 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:34.730
 Now I will show how this is done and so 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.820
 we will need some basic 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.969
 elements from and cable antenna normal 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.629
 cable 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:47.370
 special connectors 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.260
 This is the first plan of the cable 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.559
 all ends on one side and on 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.770
 on the other side 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.510
 limit switches 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.850
 and in the subsequent ready connection 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.730
 worn by such a connector on 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.380
 cable trailer going right 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:22.229
 connector either with such a limit switch is already possible 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:25.549
 embed satellite equipment i for 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:33.079
 example take a small piece of cable 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:33.079
 to show how you can compress it 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:43.170
 the tool we need a piece of cable 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:45.590
 ordinary stationery knife with closely cut 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.180
 cable cutter 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:54.270
 may not be useful yet small 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.820
 passatizh take cable that's just 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.399
 cut a piece of cable 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.860
 about so that's roughly this 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:06.840
 two centimeters can even be half 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.120
 take out the knife and scroll to give not 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.150
 cable neat circular motion 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:19.739
 We apply and so here it is 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.400
 scroll to incise the top 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.030
 isolation 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.569
 in this way you need it again 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.849
 push and top insulation start 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.849
 break down like this happened here 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:42.379
 prune and she is all here 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.379
 way breaks 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.840
 remove rises accordingly copper it 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.390
 here's the thread it can be copper can 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.110
 be another material this is so 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.590
 called screen foil respectively 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.629
 thread we unravel a little I do 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.790
 It is so there are other ways but probably 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.190
 my slept with me the way she is working on 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.730
 I'm not working on it anymore not TV 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.950
 one satellite dish and so thread we 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.090
 brought to the bottom here and so it squeezed 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.470
 because it should be visible on camera 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.360
 like this 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.120
 we twist it so that it does not 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:34.989
 deformed not torn on becomes 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:37.629
 this way the canvas and so here's the excess 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:43.330
 then we will cut it like this 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:50.430
 we hammer in further we take too a knife by business 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.430
 one more cut in the same circle 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:04:01.540
 so you can remove the rest 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:04.420
 cable and 1 live internal copper conductor 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:11.019
 you need to do the central one too 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:15.720
 neatly so here we are big 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:19.560
 in circular motions in this way 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.560
 we bare live 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.620
 so much i don't speak to bulge 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:41.770
 isolation is something like this should 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:46.090
 look like if 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:48.700
 cable braid tight and thick and 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.430
 screwed up the connector will be hard for 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.800
 she can try to do the following 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:00.070
 manipulations take a pliers and a little bit 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:03.169
 rumpled like this change a little bit 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:09.980
 it is then a little bit she sat down and easier 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:12.190
 on cool minus take here such 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.190
 connector 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.580
 so here's a connector 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:34.980
 so he looks start to wear here and 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:37.800
 I wind it on the cable such here 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.670
 ordinary mechanical actions when 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.740
 already he planted began to curl we 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:46.860
 so that the thread here is not looking out 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:53.610
 the connector slightly retreat to 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:06:01.530
 about the width of the wrap and remove it 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:06.020
 the extra part is superfluous 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.020
 Tim choose worth for a small tail 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.310
 accordingly which will close now 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.310
 winding process 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:28.169
 cheat if it goes hard you can 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.169
 a little help and so pliers and 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.280
 follow carefully 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:40.389
 when spinning need to achieve that 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:43.960
 to wind here for that image 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:49.900
 so that where we cut the insulation on 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:53.740
 I am fully seated and not stuck out here and 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.659
 something like this you do not show how ready 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:07:01.090
 the form 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:07:10.020
 that is, the village's cable here she sits 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:11.860
 here so here we cut off 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.280
 the remainder 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.800
 [music] 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.900
 according to the instructions usually sent here 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:25.700
 bulging in this part for two or three 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:29.370
 millimeter that is something like this 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:34.370
 cut in this form 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:35.639
 the connector is completely ready now here you can 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.770
 wind up 

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:40.740
 any additional connector either 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.200
 directly in this form to insert into the satellite 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.070
 equipment 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:47.610
 the connector can be like this 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:51.060
 for example g-shaped and tv in this 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:53.130
 case, we first insert it here after 

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:57.480
 of this we wind it accordingly 

00:07:53.130 --> 00:08:01.080
 then either here so here it is exactly the same 

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:03.990
 cheat set twist up 

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:07.710
 tight twisting after this it's all 

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:11.540
 ready and in this form in this form all 

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:14.100
 it can be used further in work 

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:16.620
 here and so see see doing this 

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.710
 all on this I have all the best 

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.710
 until
