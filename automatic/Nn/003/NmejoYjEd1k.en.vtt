there isn't trust me I'm an artist
these<00:06:37.919> are<00:06:38.040> actually<00:06:38.340> a<00:06:38.400> real<00:06:38.700> time<00:06:38.970> and<00:06:39.270> not

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
these are actually a real time and not

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
that goes on is a little bit where we'll

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.810 
that goes on is a little bit where we'll
just<00:06:45.480> wait<00:06:45.720> for<00:06:45.750> it<00:06:46.020> to<00:06:46.080> drive<00:06:46.430> but<00:06:47.430> there's<00:06:47.610> no

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
just wait for it to drive but there's no

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.370 
just wait for it to drive but there's no
bits<00:06:48.150> missed<00:06:48.450> out<00:06:48.690> you<00:06:49.020> see<00:06:49.710> it<00:06:49.830> all<00:06:50.090> but<00:06:51.090> here

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
bits missed out you see it all but here

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.490 
bits missed out you see it all but here
now<00:06:52.380> I<00:06:52.410> want<00:06:52.830> to<00:06:52.889> get<00:06:53.010> the<00:06:53.130> feel<00:06:53.460> eventually

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
now I want to get the feel eventually

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.250 
now I want to get the feel eventually
that<00:06:55.500> this<00:06:55.770> path<00:06:56.070> here<00:06:56.690> goes<00:06:57.690> off<00:06:57.930> into<00:06:58.139> the

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.260 
that this path here goes off into the

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.129 
that this path here goes off into the
distance<00:06:58.470> disappears<00:06:59.220> only<00:06:59.370> emerges<00:07:00.000> and<00:07:00.720> so

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 
distance disappears only emerges and so

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:03.440 
distance disappears only emerges and so
