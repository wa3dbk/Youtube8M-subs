blades and the way you tell how to put
it<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:21.930> just<00:00:21.960> by<00:00:22.320> looking<00:00:22.710> at<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.920> blade

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
it on just by looking at the blade

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.189 
it on just by looking at the blade
whatever<00:00:23.609> side<00:00:23.939> that's<00:00:24.269> facing<00:00:24.600> that's

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
whatever side that's facing that's

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.650 
whatever side that's facing that's
elevated<00:00:25.609> that's<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.820> direction<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.420> is

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
elevated that's the direction that is

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.950 
elevated that's the direction that is
going<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.199> one<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.619> facing<00:00:29.179> up<00:00:30.179> on<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
going so this one is facing up on the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.990 
going so this one is facing up on the
right<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.410> up<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> left<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.700> means

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
right and up on the left so that means

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.990 
right and up on the left so that means
it's<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.360> counterclockwise<00:00:34.160> okay<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.940> you

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
it's going counterclockwise okay so you

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.540 
it's going counterclockwise okay so you
look<00:00:36.300> at<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.809> one<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.530> arms<00:00:37.950> where<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.460> you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
look at the one of the arms where as you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.229 
look at the one of the arms where as you
go<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.629> right<00:00:39.780> here<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.739> facing<00:00:41.370> it's

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
go this one right here is facing it's

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.970 
go this one right here is facing it's
rotating<00:00:42.719> counterclockwise<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.680> put

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
rotating counterclockwise so you put

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.049 
rotating counterclockwise so you put
this<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.579> one

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
this on this one

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.779 
this on this one
now<00:00:45.719> how<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.930> put<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.590> by<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.280> rotate

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
now how you put it on is by you rotate

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.279 
now how you put it on is by you rotate
it<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.030> opposite<00:00:48.510> direction<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
it in the opposite direction that is

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.290 
it in the opposite direction that is
it's<00:00:49.739> turning<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> arrow<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.000> pointing

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
it's turning so if the arrow is pointing

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.350 
it's turning so if the arrow is pointing
kind<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.989> clockwise<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.680> would<00:00:52.800> face<00:00:53.039> it

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
kind of clockwise you would face it

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.810 
kind of clockwise you would face it
likewise<00:00:54.360> until<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.020> locks<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:56.670> do

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
likewise until it locks like that so do

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:07.280 
likewise until it locks like that so do
so<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> other<00:00:57.960> blades

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.899 

okay<00:01:08.290> once<00:01:08.619> you<00:01:08.740> put<00:01:08.920> on<00:01:08.950> all<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.520> blaze<00:01:09.700> on

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
okay once you put on all the blaze on

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.410 
okay once you put on all the blaze on
your<00:01:10.030> phantom<00:01:10.420> install<00:01:11.409> the<00:01:11.590> battery<00:01:12.420> my

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
your phantom install the battery my

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.580 
your phantom install the battery my
first<00:01:13.659> thing<00:01:13.810> you<00:01:13.869> have<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:14.020> do<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.290> turn<00:01:14.530> on

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
first thing you have to do is turn on

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.430 
first thing you have to do is turn on
the<00:01:14.799> remote<00:01:14.890> control<00:01:15.369> and<00:01:18.900> then<00:01:19.900> push<00:01:20.229> it<00:01:20.259> into

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
the remote control and then push it into

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.020 
the remote control and then push it into
the<00:01:20.560> battery<00:01:22.140> now<00:01:23.140> once<00:01:23.350> you<00:01:23.500> push<00:01:23.710> it<00:01:23.860> in<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
the battery now once you push it in you

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.389 
the battery now once you push it in you
need<00:01:25.180> to<00:01:25.270> press<00:01:25.479> it<00:01:25.630> at<00:01:25.780> one<00:01:25.869> time<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.399> the

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
need to press it at one time and the

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.130 
need to press it at one time and the
like<00:01:27.550> it<00:01:27.670> will<00:01:27.759> come<00:01:27.909> on<00:01:28.090> then<00:01:28.360> you<00:01:28.479> press<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:28.960> a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
like it will come on then you press it a

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.700 
like it will come on then you press it a
second<00:01:29.649> time

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
second time

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.149 
second time
does<00:01:32.710> that<00:01:32.860> make<00:01:33.009> sense<00:01:34.649> until<00:01:35.649> it<00:01:35.890> makes<00:01:36.040> that

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
does that make sense until it makes that

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.850 
does that make sense until it makes that
beeping<00:01:36.580> noise<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.210> now<00:01:38.020> your<00:01:38.229> Phantom<00:01:38.679> is

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
beeping noise and now your Phantom is

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.130 
beeping noise and now your Phantom is
connected<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.610> your<00:01:39.850> remote<00:01:40.810> control<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
connected to your remote control and the

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.499 
connected to your remote control and the
way<00:01:44.229> you<00:01:44.289> turn<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:44.679> on<00:01:44.800> on<00:01:45.090> remote<00:01:46.090> control<00:01:46.179> is

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
way you turn it on on remote control is

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.350 
way you turn it on on remote control is
you<00:01:46.600> push<00:01:46.810> it<00:01:46.929> towards<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.320> center<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:50.320> so

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
you push it towards the center like so

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:15.039 
you push it towards the center like so
okay<00:01:52.500> let's<00:01:53.500> do<00:01:53.649> a<00:01:53.679> test<00:01:53.920> fly

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.770 

and<00:02:16.049> there<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.220> your<00:02:17.879> DJI<00:02:18.239> phantom<00:02:18.750> 2

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
and there you have it your DJI phantom 2

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.280 
and there you have it your DJI phantom 2
is<00:02:19.500> out<00:02:19.709> ready<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.099> fly
