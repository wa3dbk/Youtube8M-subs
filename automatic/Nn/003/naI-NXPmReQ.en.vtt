00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.130
 then the good federal journalist 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.830
 buffa tells me but I haven't yet 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.570
 answered the decision then to say 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.580
 They'd stop to basketball for the past 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.080
 imagine why if there is a detective in 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.060
 in terms of stay here dj look at that 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.160
 we advance we propose this was not a 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.400
 melina was a mistake by 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.130
 my part is the explanation of this 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:35.540
 for those who go home they didn't have so much 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:38.879
 familiarity when you receive support 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.690
 I have received in these years you have a 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.899
 express debt to a 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.410
 group of people you don't know but that 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:56.399
 you see them you know very well more or less 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:01:01.430
 who are they are males between 20 and 30 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:04.379
 well-to-do average Italian families with 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:09.030
 passion for American sport but 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.760
 these are not a normal audience is a 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.000
 highly prepared audience that is able 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.979
 to access a huge amount of 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.630
 information and who wants you 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.810
 accompany him to the things he already knows 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.560
 so it's not an audience that you can 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.079
 treat to your liking anything else 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.750
 very very advanced very demanding is 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.320
 a niche of a few thousand 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.460
 people 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.619
 but they are fundamentalists, they exist only 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.729
 that and see them at night because 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.850
 le bien without confusion and distraction 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.860
 which therefore and know all about the players and 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.509
 we could say who on the market 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.970
 you should go and get someone who is a 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.740
 free agent next year they know that 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.530
 in the center po stressful no no no 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.659
 grandiose, that is, it is not the public that is 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.750
 know a bit it's a frightening audience 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.640
 informed that he knows how much he wants you 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.649
 simply be accompanied in the 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.740
 throat affair 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.060
 when you know it's over that is you who 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.000
 you had a relationship with them 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.750
 particularly strong because why you 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.890
 they testify because they are affectionate 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:29.530
 manic affections almost in theirs 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.989
 passion you realize that the beauty of 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.170
 do this job s.to for one 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.970
 coincidence if he is able to get to 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.260
 of people 30 years old and less than you 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.570
 that is, to be able to speak a language that a 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.019
 20 year old boy at prices that he is not 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.459
 a simple thing to help sport 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.940
 that is my question which is the youngest 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.860
 sport that the English language that exists is 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.630
 an Esperanto on regional that you 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.050
 allows more utility and I don't know 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.000
 something else 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:07.150
 comes when you have to tell a 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.250
 such a strong audience that I continue to 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.650
 ask yourself come back true because I have 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.700
 made a sort of sabbatical if via dei 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.220
 world and so I thought that 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.900
 traditional communication test ride between 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.480
 the other is not that much to say 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.829
 in the 2014 season and then come 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.750
 buffalo football on and no no you owe him 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.700
 some you need something so you can't 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.250
 not even allowing you to write is enough 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:39.430
 I thought that spending and then I have 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.230
 thought to record a video in which 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.519
 I was telling more or less these or not 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.160
 this, however, cannot be separated 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:51.700
 man journalist and I am convinced 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.980
 that there are periods in human life and 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.440
 professional of individual that I of 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.590
 I usually outline in 15 years I believe that 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.320
 I spent 15 years a man if he has the 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.420
 possibility to do so must be done 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.340
 something else because and the came 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.200
 Your time has elapsed 15 years 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.459
 lawyer 15 years the commentator e 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.590
 now he knows what i will be 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.989
 next fifteen interleague history the 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.340
 story teller I must know though 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.510
 I would like to do things that 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.510
 I certainly can't do
