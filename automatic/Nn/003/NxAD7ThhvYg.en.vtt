00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.439 

okay<00:00:00.810> inspired<00:00:01.770> by<00:00:01.920> that<00:00:02.280> last<00:00:02.580> design<00:00:03.090> that

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
okay inspired by that last design that

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.320 
okay inspired by that last design that
crazy<00:00:03.750> star<00:00:04.140> I<00:00:05.100> started<00:00:05.670> looking<00:00:05.790> at<00:00:06.120> a

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
crazy star I started looking at a

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.589 
crazy star I started looking at a
simpler<00:00:07.200> one<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.680> so<00:00:07.859> this<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.639> for<00:00:09.240> peak

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
simpler one and so this is a for peak

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.589 
simpler one and so this is a for peak
star<00:00:10.019> so<00:00:10.700> let's<00:00:11.700> see<00:00:11.820> if<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:11.969> make<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.269> one

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
star so let's see if I can make that one

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.379 
star so let's see if I can make that one
quickly<00:00:13.070> now<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.130> design<00:00:14.610> works<00:00:15.000> like<00:00:15.210> this

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
quickly now the design works like this

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.019 
quickly now the design works like this
you<00:00:15.719> have<00:00:17.840> full<00:00:18.840> same<00:00:19.560> kind<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.949> balloon<00:00:20.250> just

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
you have full same kind of balloon just

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.939 
you have full same kind of balloon just
a<00:00:21.119> little<00:00:21.330> bit<00:00:21.420> left<00:00:21.630> for<00:00:22.050> nine<00:00:22.199> segments<00:00:22.800> and

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
a little bit left for nine segments and

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.830 
a little bit left for nine segments and
so<00:00:23.189> what<00:00:23.850> we're<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.210> do<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.570> we're<00:00:24.720> going

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:38.420 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:00:24.930> make<00:00:26.359> here<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:28.189> square<00:00:36.230> okay<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.219> make<00:00:38.399> a

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
to make here a square okay so you make a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.850 
to make here a square okay so you make a
square<00:00:38.670> like<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:40.230> will<00:00:40.440> die<00:00:40.590> here

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
square like this and one will die here

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.470 
square like this and one will die here
and<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.300> connect<00:00:43.309> another<00:00:44.480> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and so to that we connect another the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.709 
and so to that we connect another the
exact<00:00:45.870> same<00:00:46.110> thing<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.730> away<00:00:47.879> from<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.390> so

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
exact same thing so one away from it so

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.310 
exact same thing so one away from it so
one<00:00:48.960> away<00:00:49.079> from<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.950> there<00:00:51.050> make<00:00:52.050> sure<00:00:52.079> we

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
one away from here is there make sure we

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.790 
one away from here is there make sure we
try<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.530> around<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.890> bunch<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.260> do<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.590> same

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
try it around a bunch so we do the same

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:11.410 
try it around a bunch so we do the same
thing<00:00:59.100> started<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.760> get<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> same<00:01:00.420> one

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:23.570 

continuing<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> square<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:23.009> make<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> square

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
continuing the square to make the square

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.029 
continuing the square to make the square
here

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.200 

so<00:01:29.039> in<00:01:29.189> some<00:01:29.399> sense<00:01:29.430> we're<00:01:29.759> making<00:01:30.030> three

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
so in some sense we're making three

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.139 
so in some sense we're making three
squares<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:30.899> in<00:01:31.229> another<00:01:31.320> sense<00:01:31.560> we<00:01:32.130> are<00:01:32.280> look

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
squares but in another sense we are look

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.420 
squares but in another sense we are look
like<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> cube<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.770> we're<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.039> to<00:01:35.130> make<00:01:35.220> three

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
like a cube so we're going to make three

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:44.480 
like a cube so we're going to make three
small<00:01:35.850> segments<00:01:36.390> now<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:43.310> we're<00:01:44.310> going<00:01:44.460> to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
small segments now and we're going to

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.580 
small segments now and we're going to
come<00:01:44.729> across<00:01:47.210> this<00:01:48.210> thing<00:01:48.539> here<00:01:50.960> like<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.229> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
come across this thing here like so and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:04.639 
come across this thing here like so and
then<00:01:52.619> here<00:02:02.000> cut<00:02:03.000> across<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.020> opposite

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
then here cut across to the opposite

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:15.380 
then here cut across to the opposite
point<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.369> square<00:02:06.349> and<00:02:07.349> then<00:02:07.500> down<00:02:14.390> have

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
point of this square and then down have

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.440 
point of this square and then down have
this<00:02:15.690> sucker<00:02:15.959> be<00:02:16.260> finished<00:02:16.650> off<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.910> this

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
this sucker be finished off and so this

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:33.979 
this sucker be finished off and so this
guy<00:02:20.269> going<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:22.040> go<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.099> this<00:02:23.489> point<00:02:23.760> here<00:02:32.989> this

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
guy going to go to this point here this

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:47.809 
guy going to go to this point here this
guy's<00:02:34.200> going<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.470> do<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.650> same<00:02:35.030> bubble

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.670 

come<00:02:48.819> on<00:02:49.110> okay<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.470> nice<00:02:51.660> shape<00:02:52.660> here<00:02:52.930> make

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
come on okay so the nice shape here make

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.259 
come on okay so the nice shape here make
sure<00:02:53.709> that<00:02:54.160> all<00:02:54.340> those<00:02:54.489> little<00:02:54.730> guys<00:02:54.910> are<00:02:55.180> on

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
sure that all those little guys are on

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.729 
sure that all those little guys are on
the<00:02:55.360> inside<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.019> see<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.290> little<00:02:56.500> mini

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
the inside so you see a little mini

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.170 
the inside so you see a little mini
tetrahedron<00:02:57.489> in<00:02:57.610> there<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.599> got<00:02:58.780> our

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
tetrahedron in there and you got our

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.430 
tetrahedron in there and you got our
points<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.780> nice<00:03:01.930> thing<00:03:01.959> about<00:03:02.170> this

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
points so the nice thing about this

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.620 
points so the nice thing about this
design<00:03:02.769> is<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:03.250> can<00:03:03.370> see<00:03:03.519> that<00:03:03.550> you<00:03:04.180> get<00:03:04.269> a

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
design is you can see that you get a

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.270 
design is you can see that you get a
nice<00:03:05.519> sort<00:03:06.519> of<00:03:06.610> symmetric<00:03:07.180> thing<00:03:07.390> going<00:03:07.660> on

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
nice sort of symmetric thing going on

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.920 
nice sort of symmetric thing going on
anyway<00:03:09.280> what's<00:03:09.790> interesting<00:03:09.970> is<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.510> same

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
anyway what's interesting is that same

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.309 
anyway what's interesting is that same
design<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.830> can<00:03:11.860> change<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:13.030> ratio<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.810> the

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
design you can change the ratio of the

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.410 
design you can change the ratio of the
long<00:03:14.530> compared<00:03:15.069> to<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.250> short<00:03:15.519> in<00:03:16.150> fact

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
long compared to the short in fact

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.750 
long compared to the short in fact
invert<00:03:16.810> that<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.319> you<00:03:17.799> have<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.190> short<00:03:18.459> the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
invert that and you have the short the

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.520 
invert that and you have the short the
long<00:03:19.209> ones<00:03:19.420> become<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:19.780> short<00:03:20.019> ones<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.410> then

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
long ones become the short ones and then

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.470 
long ones become the short ones and then
those<00:03:20.950> many<00:03:21.310> ones<00:03:21.579> become<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.090> diagonal

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
those many ones become the diagonal

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.170 
those many ones become the diagonal
something<00:03:22.750> you<00:03:22.840> get<00:03:23.019> a<00:03:23.069> cube<00:03:24.090> kind<00:03:25.090> of

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
something you get a cube kind of

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.270 
something you get a cube kind of
interesting<00:03:25.630> anyway<00:03:26.349> I<00:03:26.380> hope<00:03:26.739> you<00:03:26.950> enjoyed<00:03:27.250> it

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
interesting anyway I hope you enjoyed it

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.000 
interesting anyway I hope you enjoyed it
Cheers
