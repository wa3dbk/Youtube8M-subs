this<00:00:23.090> young<00:00:23.420> stage<00:00:23.750> is<00:00:24.020> when<00:00:24.199> we<00:00:24.380> ideally<00:00:24.949> try

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
this young stage is when we ideally try

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.390 
this young stage is when we ideally try
to<00:00:25.310> start<00:00:26.060> training<00:00:26.330> our<00:00:26.630> lambs<00:00:26.930> to<00:00:27.230> show<00:00:27.500> it's

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
to start training our lambs to show it's

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.730 
to start training our lambs to show it's
a<00:00:28.520> lot<00:00:28.670> easier<00:00:28.910> to<00:00:29.180> train<00:00:29.600> a<00:00:29.900> young<00:00:29.960> animal

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
a lot easier to train a young animal

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.889 
a lot easier to train a young animal
versus<00:00:31.130> an<00:00:31.279> old<00:00:31.430> animal<00:00:31.670> just<00:00:32.059> in<00:00:32.269> any<00:00:32.539> species

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:45.889 
in a short amount of time so we're

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:47.800 
in a short amount of time so we're
always<00:01:46.069> here<00:01:46.489> with<00:01:46.639> them<00:01:46.819> especially<00:01:47.029> in<00:01:47.599> the

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
always here with them especially in the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.849 
always here with them especially in the
the<00:01:48.409> early<00:01:48.439> stages<00:01:49.069> of<00:01:49.249> the<00:01:49.489> training<00:01:49.909> process

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
the early stages of the training process

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.440 
the early stages of the training process
will<00:01:51.859> use<00:01:52.039> this<00:01:52.219> rack<00:01:52.520> quite<00:01:52.849> frequently

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
will use this rack quite frequently

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.359 
will use this rack quite frequently
throughout<00:01:53.869> their<00:01:54.109> their<00:01:54.469> training<00:01:54.889> process

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
throughout their their training process

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.459 
throughout their their training process
and<00:01:55.579> throughout<00:01:55.819> the<00:01:55.880> year<00:01:56.329> on<00:01:56.509> young<00:01:57.200> lambs

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
and throughout the year on young lambs

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.279 
and throughout the year on young lambs
we'll<00:01:57.770> do<00:01:57.889> this<00:01:58.069> for<00:01:58.130> three<00:01:58.489> or<00:01:58.609> four<00:01:58.639> days

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
we'll do this for three or four days

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.510 
we'll do this for three or four days
just<00:02:00.289> getting<00:02:00.619> them<00:02:00.739> used<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.069> having<00:02:01.399> their

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
just getting them used to having their

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.149 
just getting them used to having their
head<00:02:01.729> restrained<00:02:02.389> I<00:02:02.689> think<00:02:03.499> it's<00:02:03.649> really<00:02:03.859> good

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
head restrained I think it's really good

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.249 
head restrained I think it's really good
on<00:02:04.189> a<00:02:04.429> rack<00:02:04.759> versus<00:02:05.270> tying<00:02:05.539> them<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.869> fence

that way if they do start fighting they

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.520 
that way if they do start fighting they
are<00:02:08.599> going<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.780> be<00:02:08.899> slamming<00:02:09.319> their<00:02:09.410> head

we see used at home or at the shows it's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.140 
we see used at home or at the shows it's
just<00:02:27.800> a<00:02:27.920> nylon<00:02:28.370> rope<00:02:28.780> with<00:02:29.780> hog<00:02:30.020> ring<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.970> make

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
the loops this halter here is about a

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.240 
the loops this halter here is about a
smaller<00:02:35.720> diameter<00:02:36.080> is<00:02:36.440> what<00:02:36.680> we'd<00:02:36.860> like<00:02:37.070> to

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
smaller diameter is what we'd like to

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.060 
smaller diameter is what we'd like to
use<00:02:37.550> we<00:02:37.820> would<00:02:38.390> rather<00:02:38.660> maybe<00:02:39.350> have<00:02:39.620> something

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
use we would rather maybe have something

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.680 
use we would rather maybe have something
a<00:02:40.130> little<00:02:40.400> bit<00:02:40.550> bigger<00:02:40.760> bigger<00:02:41.360> for<00:02:41.660> a

a little bit bigger bigger for a
training<00:02:42.050> halter<00:02:42.670> definitely<00:02:43.670> not<00:02:43.850> any

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
training halter definitely not any

this allows the the halter to get
tighter<00:02:57.410> under<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.130> chin<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.670> not<00:02:58.820> over<00:02:59.090> the

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.010 
easy if the lamb does happen to choke
down<00:05:39.940> but<00:05:40.940> we'll<00:05:41.060> just<00:05:41.090> sit<00:05:41.420> here<00:05:41.600> and<00:05:41.720> rub<00:05:41.870> on

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020

may do this for 10 minutes the first day
20<00:05:48.860> minutes<00:05:49.190> the<00:05:49.310> next<00:05:49.610> day<00:05:49.790> and<00:05:50.060> just<00:05:50.660> work

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
20 minutes the next day and just work

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.500 
20 minutes the next day and just work
into<00:05:51.170> the<00:05:51.260> longer<00:05:51.590> periods<00:05:52.070> every<00:05:52.250> day<00:05:52.550> before

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
into the longer periods every day before

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.420 
into the longer periods every day before
you<00:05:53.630> know<00:05:53.660> it<00:05:53.990> he's<00:05:54.200> learned<00:05:54.770> to<00:05:54.860> respect<00:05:55.310> the

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
you know it he's learned to respect the

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.250 
you know it he's learned to respect the
halter<00:05:55.820> we<00:05:55.940> learned<00:05:56.120> respect<00:05:56.540> to<00:05:56.660> rack<00:05:58.180> and

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
halter we learned respect to rack and

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.680 
halter we learned respect to rack and
then<00:06:00.260> we'll<00:06:00.440> go<00:06:00.590> from<00:06:00.620> here<00:06:01.160> outside<00:06:01.340> and<00:06:02.030> by

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
then we'll go from here outside and by

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.080 
then we'll go from here outside and by
that<00:06:02.900> point<00:06:03.140> in<00:06:03.350> time<00:06:03.560> our<00:06:04.280> lamb<00:06:04.610> is<00:06:04.790> probably

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
that point in time our lamb is probably

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.930 
that point in time our lamb is probably
going<00:06:05.240> to<00:06:05.360> lead<00:06:05.570> pretty<00:06:05.900> well<00:06:06.110> for<00:06:06.410> us<00:06:06.470> and<00:06:06.940> not

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
going to lead pretty well for us and not

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.080 
going to lead pretty well for us and not
be<00:06:08.120> quite<00:06:08.330> the<00:06:08.450> struggle
