00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.480

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.200
 theme of birthday snacks 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.540
 we are going on a base of 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.940
 cake with yoghurt for cake and on 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.990
 tops with fresh cheese and for that we 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.180
 we need 1/2 "plain yoghurt 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.540
 of oil taxes and a half of sugar in 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.310
 sachet of baking powder and 1/2 sachet 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.590
 vanilla sugar and a pinch of salt I 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.780
 start by preheating the oven at 200 ° 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:55.829
 then I put my yogurt in the robot 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:01:04.229
 with sugar without forgetting sugar 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:05.250
 vanilla and I mix once my 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.740
 whitening mix 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.740
 I add the flour 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:25.330
 yeast and oil and I mix a 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.710
 once my mixture is homogeneous 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.710
 I add museum 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:44.800
 of course we do not forget the pinch of 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:46.180
 salt and mapathé mixture ready 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.100
 I will now divide it into 4 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.900
 different salad bowl now 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.130
 let's color the legs for that 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.840
 I use food colors 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.009
 personally I use dyes 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.790
 for that I bought in a store 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.399
 specialized 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.140
 but you can also use the 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.430
 small tubes of liquid dyes that 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.810
 buy at the supermarket 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.890
 I chose to make four colors 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.810
 different from the pink of iron red and 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:15.040
 I take just a pinch of 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:15.489
 dyes and I mix and that's the 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.110
 result 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.970
 I repeat the operation for all 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.840
 the colors but four colors are 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.400
