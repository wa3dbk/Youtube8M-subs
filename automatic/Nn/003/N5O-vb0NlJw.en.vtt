00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
poorer i guess submissions we got

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.680 
poorer i guess submissions we got
although<00:05:28.639> you<00:05:28.820> know<00:05:28.909> they<00:05:29.030> weren't<00:05:29.180> that

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
although you know they weren't that

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.240 
although you know they weren't that
horrible<00:05:30.169> most<00:05:30.409> of<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.590> submissions<00:05:30.979> most

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
horrible most of the submissions most

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.680 
horrible most of the submissions most
officials<00:05:31.639> were<00:05:31.699> actually<00:05:31.909> quite<00:05:32.060> good<00:05:32.090> but

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
officials were actually quite good but

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.029 
officials were actually quite good but
some<00:05:32.930> of<00:05:33.020> them<00:05:33.110> were<00:05:33.289> a<00:05:33.320> little<00:05:33.710> bit<00:05:33.889> bizarre

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
some of them were a little bit bizarre

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.830 
some of them were a little bit bizarre
and<00:05:34.460> we<00:05:34.789> could<00:05:34.940> put<00:05:35.090> up<00:05:35.180> three<00:05:35.449> of<00:05:35.539> them<00:05:35.659> so

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
and we could put up three of them so

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.180 
and we could put up three of them so
hope<00:05:36.259> you<00:05:36.320> guys<00:05:36.380> enjoy<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:36.860> meanwhile<00:05:37.159> a

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
hope you guys enjoy that meanwhile a

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.499 
hope you guys enjoy that meanwhile a
storks<00:05:37.639> going<00:05:37.849> for<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.060> robotics<00:05:38.419> facility

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:38.509 
storks going for the robotics facility

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.320 
storks going for the robotics facility
after<00:05:38.960> arranged<00:05:39.680> and<00:05:39.919> i<00:05:40.190> believe<00:05:40.250> reach<00:05:41.090> is

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
after arranged and i believe reach is

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.749 
after arranged and i believe reach is
also<00:05:41.690> doing<00:05:41.930> that<00:05:42.050> I<00:05:42.259> think<00:05:43.219> storks<00:05:43.520> is<00:05:43.639> going

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
also doing that I think storks is going

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.450 
also doing that I think storks is going
to<00:05:43.820> be<00:05:43.880> done<00:05:44.000> a<00:05:44.030> little<00:05:44.270> bit<00:05:44.449> sooner<00:05:44.780> and<00:05:45.560> we'll

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
to be done a little bit sooner and we'll

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.860 
to be done a little bit sooner and we'll
see<00:05:46.610> what<00:05:46.729> happens<00:05:46.820> here<00:05:47.120> reach<00:05:47.330> looks<00:05:47.750> like

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
see what happens here reach looks like

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.180 
see what happens here reach looks like
it's<00:05:48.050> just<00:05:48.229> a<00:05:48.320> complete<00:05:48.650> mirror<00:05:48.800> match<00:05:48.979> right

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
it's just a complete mirror match right

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.610 
it's just a complete mirror match right
now<00:05:49.219> um<00:05:49.639> no<00:05:50.090> real<00:05:50.330> bill<00:05:50.930> divergence<00:05:51.500> between

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
now um no real bill divergence between

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.279 
now um no real bill divergence between
either<00:05:51.919> players<00:05:52.250> and<00:05:52.630> we'll<00:05:53.630> see<00:05:53.840> what<00:05:54.050> store

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
either players and we'll see what store

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
gate and the rowboat facility alright so

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.640 
gate and the rowboat facility alright so
that's<00:06:24.830> fair<00:06:25.960> robotics<00:06:26.960> facility<00:06:27.020> so<00:06:27.500> yeah

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
that's fair robotics facility so yeah

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.900 
that's fair robotics facility so yeah
basically<00:06:27.860> these<00:06:28.130> two<00:06:28.310> players<00:06:28.490> at<00:06:28.669> a<00:06:28.699> similar

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
basically these two players at a similar

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.090 
basically these two players at a similar
position<00:06:29.120> here<00:06:29.540> both<00:06:30.020> first<00:06:30.229> program<00:06:30.620> expand

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
position here both first program expand

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.270 
position here both first program expand
right<00:06:31.340> now<00:06:32.229> after<00:06:33.229> getting<00:06:33.620> a<00:06:33.710> good<00:06:33.919> Scout<00:06:34.100> off

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
right now after getting a good Scout off

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.860 
right now after getting a good Scout off
on<00:06:34.490> the<00:06:34.639> respective<00:06:35.150> fields<00:06:35.540> they're<00:06:35.750> gonna

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
on the respective fields they're gonna

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.480 
on the respective fields they're gonna
realize<00:06:36.080> SATA<00:06:36.470> expanding<00:06:37.040> is<00:06:37.100> probably<00:06:37.340> the

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
realize SATA expanding is probably the

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.450 
realize SATA expanding is probably the
best<00:06:37.729> option<00:06:37.880> right<00:06:38.150> now<00:06:39.070> although<00:06:40.070> reach

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
best option right now although reach

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.480 
best option right now although reach
might<00:06:40.699> have<00:06:40.820> to<00:06:40.910> defend<00:06:41.180> against<00:06:41.780> a<00:06:42.490> shuttle

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
might have to defend against a shuttle

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.100 
might have to defend against a shuttle
for<00:06:43.639> ass<00:06:43.729> if<00:06:43.940> his<00:06:44.210> zealots<00:06:44.570> don't<00:06:44.780> decide<00:06:44.990> to

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
for ass if his zealots don't decide to

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.810 
for ass if his zealots don't decide to
jump<00:06:45.290> up<00:06:45.470> sometimes<00:06:46.220> they're<00:06:46.400> low<00:06:46.550> on<00:06:46.580> energy

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
jump up sometimes they're low on energy

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.610 
jump up sometimes they're low on energy
so<00:06:47.150> they<00:06:47.240> can't<00:06:47.449> fly<00:06:47.630> and<00:06:48.110> shoot<00:06:48.290> that's<00:06:48.500> all

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
so they can't fly and shoot that's all

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.670 
so they can't fly and shoot that's all
but<00:06:48.949> um<00:06:49.180> shoot<00:06:50.180> that<00:06:50.300> shuttle<00:06:50.660> but<00:06:50.870> uh<00:06:50.900> we'll

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
but um shoot that shuttle but uh we'll

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.469 
but um shoot that shuttle but uh we'll

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:55.729 
scouting pylon for little historic just

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:58.150 
scouting pylon for little historic just
keeping<00:06:56.000> it<00:06:56.090> there<00:06:56.180> in<00:06:56.389> the<00:06:56.510> corner<00:06:56.810> and<00:06:57.290> reach

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 
keeping it there in the corner and reach

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.560 
keeping it there in the corner and reach
is<00:06:58.340> also<00:06:58.550> going<00:06:58.639> to<00:06:58.700> show<00:06:58.850> us<00:06:58.970> some<00:06:59.120> reaver

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570 
is also going to show us some reaver

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.000 
is also going to show us some reaver
micro<00:06:59.870> this<00:07:00.020> game<00:07:00.200> too<00:07:00.380> so<00:07:00.680> let's<00:07:00.860> see<00:07:00.979> how

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.010 
micro this game too so let's see how

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.180 
micro this game too so let's see how
reach<00:07:01.340> does<00:07:01.580> with<00:07:02.000> these<00:07:02.180> Reivers<00:07:02.510> and<00:07:03.190> reach

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
reach does with these Reivers and reach

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.820 
reach does with these Reivers and reach
has<00:07:04.370> a<00:07:04.400> good<00:07:04.610> supply<00:07:04.880> of<00:07:05.139> forces<00:07:06.139> there<00:07:06.320> and<00:07:06.470> so

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
has a good supply of forces there and so

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.290 
has a good supply of forces there and so
the<00:07:06.919> stork<00:07:07.160> so<00:07:07.280> it<00:07:07.460> actually<00:07:07.580> won't<00:07:07.880> be<00:07:08.030> a<00:07:08.060> fast

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
the stork so it actually won't be a fast

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.570 
the stork so it actually won't be a fast
expand<00:07:08.690> game<00:07:08.900> reach<00:07:09.680> has<00:07:09.860> decided<00:07:10.280> go<00:07:10.400> for

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 
expand game reach has decided go for

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.650 
expand game reach has decided go for
Reavers<00:07:10.880> first<00:07:11.120> so<00:07:11.270> it's<00:07:11.360> going<00:07:11.450> to<00:07:11.510> be<00:07:11.630> a

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:11.660 
Reavers first so it's going to be a

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.930 
Reavers first so it's going to be a
pretty<00:07:11.930> aggressive<00:07:12.110> game<00:07:12.650> now<00:07:12.940> neither

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
pretty aggressive game now neither

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.430 
pretty aggressive game now neither
player<00:07:14.180> is<00:07:14.300> really<00:07:14.510> going<00:07:14.600> to<00:07:14.690> go<00:07:14.810> for<00:07:15.050> an

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.090 
expansion anytime soon now given that

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.420 
expansion anytime soon now given that
we've<00:07:17.510> seen<00:07:17.750> reverse<00:07:18.229> or<00:07:18.380> both<00:07:18.590> of<00:07:18.620> them<00:07:18.860> not

we've seen reverse or both of them not

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.920 
we've seen reverse or both of them not
just<00:07:19.580> observers<00:07:19.910> and<00:07:20.150> there's<00:07:20.539> a<00:07:20.660> third

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:20.930 
just observers and there's a third

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.150 
just observers and there's a third
gateway<00:07:21.260> going<00:07:21.530> up<00:07:21.650> second<00:07:21.949> and<00:07:22.010> third

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 
gateway going up second and third

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.950 
gateway going up second and third
gateway<00:07:22.460> going<00:07:22.729> up<00:07:22.850> for<00:07:23.060> stork<00:07:23.419> but<00:07:23.630> reach<00:07:23.780> has

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 
gateway going up for stork but reach has

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.390 
gateway going up for stork but reach has
more<00:07:24.110> ground<00:07:24.350> forces<00:07:24.680> right<00:07:24.800> now<00:07:24.979> I<00:07:25.010> believe

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.400 
more ground forces right now I believe

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.790 
more ground forces right now I believe
probably<00:07:26.150> by<00:07:26.300> one<00:07:26.479> or<00:07:26.600> two<00:07:26.810> dragoons<00:07:27.110> stork

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 
probably by one or two dragoons stork
