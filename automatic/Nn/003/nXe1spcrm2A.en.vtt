is that you get a little card slot there
so<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:48.120> depending<00:00:48.480> how<00:00:48.600> thick<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.110> how<00:00:49.410> many

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
so just depending how thick and how many

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.470 
so just depending how thick and how many
cards<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.980> have<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.190> would<00:00:50.430> say<00:00:50.460> about<00:00:50.820> 2<00:00:51.300> or<00:00:51.329> 3

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
could probably fit in that so that's

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.840 
could probably fit in that so that's
pretty<00:00:53.370> cool<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:55.530> know<00:00:55.590> card<00:00:56.129> style<00:00:56.520> flip

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
edges and then make sure every corners

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.940 
edges and then make sure every corners
down<00:01:23.570> there<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.990> that's<00:01:25.170> as<00:01:25.439> easy<00:01:25.770> it

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
down there you have it that's as easy it

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.410 
down there you have it that's as easy it
is<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.220> install<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.670> alright<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.119> let's<00:01:27.299> go

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
is to install it alright so let's go

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.940 
is to install it alright so let's go
ahead<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.750> take<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> little<00:01:28.290> look<00:01:28.409> around<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
ahead and take a little look around the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.499 
ahead and take a little look around the
case<00:01:29.189> while<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:29.700> got<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.939> installed<00:01:30.299> now

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
case while we got it installed now

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.210 
case while we got it installed now
you're<00:01:31.409> going<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.619> notice<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.920> it's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
you're going to notice that it's

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.830 
you're going to notice that it's
actually<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.579> pretty<00:01:33.000> thinner<00:01:33.329> profile

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
actually a pretty thinner profile

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.440 
actually a pretty thinner profile
there's<00:01:34.079> not<00:01:34.229> much<00:01:34.610> bulk<00:01:35.610> added<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
there's not much bulk added to this the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.200 
there's not much bulk added to this the
flip<00:01:37.049> covers<00:01:37.439> really<00:01:37.770> thin<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
flip covers really thin so I like that a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.679 
flip covers really thin so I like that a
lot

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
lot

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.539
