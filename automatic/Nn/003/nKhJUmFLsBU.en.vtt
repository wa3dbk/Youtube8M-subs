case<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:38.579> 49<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.420> think<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.170> BK<00:01:40.770> series

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
case be 49 I think this is the BK series

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.389 
case be 49 I think this is the BK series
because<00:01:42.630> i<00:01:42.780> already<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.409> copo<00:01:43.799> camaro<00:01:44.189> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
because i already have the copo camaro a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.219 
because i already have the copo camaro a
Corvette<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.360> other<00:01:45.509> cars<00:01:45.810> from<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.950 
Corvette and the other cars from the a
case<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.610> think<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> bks<00:01:48.570> release

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960
