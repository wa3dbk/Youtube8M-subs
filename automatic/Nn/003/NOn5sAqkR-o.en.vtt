00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440
 he for replacing the generator hard to reach 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:22.760
 manufacturer recommends draining antifreeze 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:26.130
 take this radiator and then pull it out 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.250
 generator through the top on trying it 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.820
 make through down without draining without removing 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.820
 radiator 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.989
 first you need to turn off 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.989
 battery reject 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.949
 unscrew the bolts for 10 2 pieces 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.170
 which asu wiring 3 back them 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.750
 twist not lose recognition not 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.049
 installed in the money do not pull the chip 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.100
 just click with your finger and 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.100
 we pull for ourselves 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.760
 then unscrew the bolt and the central 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:24.470
 steeper than a neutral bolt 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:26.300
 key ratchet head 12 further 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.100
 weaken 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:35.250
 on 10 hairpin 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:41.369
 tension roller to sing the kids 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.710
 share then drive it gets up further 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:49.410
 will unscrew 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:53.000
 this bolt and climb climb stress arch 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:56.000
 calf amir conditioner compressor 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 fastens 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:05.460
 what 500 times was he 2 block up plan 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:12.570
 long bolts like that 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.570
 mats and on 12 and on top also 2 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:30.010
 Any command all further here is rubber 1 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.819
 this 1 this 2 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:40.060
 here on them we will unbend it and we can 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:46.680
 crawl generators all here are 4 bolts 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:49.540
 removed fastening compressor air conditioner 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:55.709
 used the usual key-ratchet 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.709
 such a great pledge 19 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.650
 12 millimeters 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:10.620
 now there will be 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:10.620
 elect remove remove 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.430
 May 8 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.510
 sensors 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:30.040
 theoretically place should she titanium 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:35.050
 place until then we will twist 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:40.070
 Robin generator unscrew him 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:43.270
 press growth bends down like this nothing 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:48.040
 tear off nothing bent 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.040
 then put back without problems 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:04:01.250
 we will further unscrew the head to 14 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:06.920
 generator cutter lower bolt and top 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:15.550
 bolt use ordinary ratchet ordinary 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:15.550
 head on top of the bolt here it is 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.570
 12 best to use a 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.390
 key 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.390
 mined spinning ratchet 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.000
 insert it by unscrewing 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:41.150
 lower bolt is better to break the task 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:46.250
 unscrew especially in the middle of the generator 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:48.940
 pole dance 1 so the first bolt 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:54.310
 there is a bottom bolt he last merge 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.310
 the best regenerator here is the bottom bolt 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.209
 thereof 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.209
 So 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:09.310
 everywhere bob he is maximum pulled out like this 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.310
 you because it does not give 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:25.300
 I hope you will see these slit in 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.790
 it will be a bolt thread it will come out 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:34.020
 and he will need to rest as much as possible 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:34.020
 here in full like there is the maximum 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:45.300
 so you can insert a new 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.300
 baltic 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:56.760
 Instead, there is a generator theme of production 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:06:16.020
 not wife mean on the exchange and 506 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:22.110
 where they will be 291 quietly still copy 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:25.130
 expect to rearrange just that flap over here 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.130
 generator blown out 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.130
 this goat 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.510
 put everything in place set new 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.780
 generator 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.780
 growth 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.430
 Michele bolts with wait for the bolt about fig. 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:04.880
 100 photos 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:06.920
 and the press will be born oner 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.900
 I throw in the belt is stretched 

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.900
 we connect to twist 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.199
 start up checking everything goes dead 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.919
 charging is
