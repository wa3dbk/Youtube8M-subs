00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
development methodology what what is

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.730 
development methodology what what is
that<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.520> agile<00:00:20.850> no<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> proven

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
that is it agile no it is a proven

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.890 
that is it agile no it is a proven

develop<00:00:25.529> effectively<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.580> efficiently<00:00:26.699> it's

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
develop effectively and efficiently it's

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.160

not agile why would I want it well it is

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.990 
not agile why would I want it well it is
similar<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.830> agile<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.790> has<00:00:32.969> a
