00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
will need one of these wires make sure

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.389 
will need one of these wires make sure
it's<00:00:36.780> got<00:00:36.930> these<00:00:37.230> connections<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:38.190> either

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
it's got these connections on either

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.639 
it's got these connections on either
ends<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.149> one<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.719> goes<00:00:39.840> up<00:00:40.020> behind<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.440> TV

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649

end male connections on that end and you
want<00:01:23.230> to<00:01:23.350> connect<00:01:24.570> these<00:01:25.570> wires<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:27.100> one<00:01:27.550> end

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
want to connect these wires on one end

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.980 
want to connect these wires on one end
to<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.990> ports<00:01:29.560> on<00:01:29.980> here<00:01:30.760> obviously<00:01:31.390> match<00:01:31.810> the

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
to the ports on here obviously match the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.080 
to the ports on here obviously match the
colors<00:01:32.290> up<00:01:32.440> red<00:01:32.710> to<00:01:33.040> red<00:01:33.930> white<00:01:35.730> to<00:01:36.730> the<00:01:36.760> right

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
colors up red to red white to the right

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.700 
colors up red to red white to the right
and<00:01:37.330> I<00:01:37.720> don't<00:01:37.900> think<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.140> matters<00:01:38.260> where<00:01:38.620> you

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
and I don't think it matters where you

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.980 
and I don't think it matters where you
put<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.040> other<00:01:39.220> one<00:01:39.310> as<00:01:40.090> long<00:01:40.360> as<00:01:40.390> it<00:01:40.630> goes<00:01:40.960> in

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
put the other one as long as it goes in

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.930 
put the other one as long as it goes in
the<00:01:41.230> yellow<00:01:41.500> slot<00:01:41.770> on<00:01:41.950> your<00:01:42.070> TV<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.640> it<00:01:45.760> should

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
the yellow slot on your TV so it should

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.390 
the yellow slot on your TV so it should
be<00:01:45.970> like<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:49.090> that<00:01:49.330> and<00:01:50.320> then<00:01:51.160> you're<00:01:51.310> going

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
be like like that and then you're going

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.570 
be like like that and then you're going
to<00:01:51.490> grab<00:01:51.730> the<00:01:51.970> wires<00:01:52.210> from<00:01:52.570> your<00:01:52.900> ps3

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
to grab the wires from your ps3

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.380 
to grab the wires from your ps3
obviously<00:01:54.580> it's<00:01:54.670> not<00:01:54.760> going<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.940> be<00:01:55.000> recording

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
obviously it's not going to be recording

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.750 
obviously it's not going to be recording
HD<00:01:55.600> so<00:01:56.170> you<00:01:56.230> won't<00:01:56.590> need<00:01:56.680> your<00:01:56.740> HDMI<00:01:57.280> cable<00:01:57.610> for

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
HD so you won't need your HDMI cable for

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.910 
HD so you won't need your HDMI cable for
this<00:01:57.850> just<00:01:58.060> these<00:01:58.270> wise<00:01:58.510> here<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.770> other
