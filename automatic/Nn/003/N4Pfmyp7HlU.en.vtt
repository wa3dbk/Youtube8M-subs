she's asking I'd like to know what the
most<00:00:15.660> common<00:00:16.049> reasons<00:00:16.410> for<00:00:16.439> skin<00:00:16.800> breakouts

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
most common reasons for skin breakouts

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.359 
most common reasons for skin breakouts
in<00:00:17.400> adults<00:00:17.640> are<00:00:18.119> ok<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.200> my<00:00:19.800> skin<00:00:20.070> breakouts

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
in adults are ok so my skin breakouts

in adults are ok so my skin breakouts
you<00:00:20.730> know<00:00:20.789> we're<00:00:20.910> talking<00:00:21.210> mainly<00:00:21.570> about

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
you know we're talking mainly about

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.859 
you know we're talking mainly about
things<00:00:22.619> like<00:00:22.920> acne<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.360> know<00:00:24.449> any<00:00:24.630> sort

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
things like acne and you know any sort

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.120 
things like acne and you know any sort
of<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.080> those<00:00:25.230> Whitehead<00:00:25.590> bumps<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.039> you

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
of like those Whitehead bumps that you

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.000 
of like those Whitehead bumps that you
get<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.369> your<00:00:26.400> face<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.650> there's<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> few

get on your face and there's a few

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.920 
get on your face and there's a few
different<00:00:29.160> reasons<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:30.090> getting<00:00:30.300> skin

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
different reasons for getting skin

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.229 
different reasons for getting skin
breakouts<00:00:31.410> one<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.309> most<00:00:32.489> common<00:00:33.030> ones

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
breakouts one of the most common ones

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.989 
breakouts one of the most common ones
that<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.629> see<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.229> due<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.399> hormonal

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:35.999 
that we see is due to hormonal

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:39.079 
that we see is due to hormonal
imbalances<00:00:36.929> and<00:00:37.229> typically<00:00:38.039> this<00:00:38.429> shows<00:00:38.760> up

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:39.089 
imbalances and typically this shows up

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.079 
imbalances and typically this shows up
in<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:40.199> jowl<00:00:40.440> or<00:00:40.889> the<00:00:41.010> jaw<00:00:41.190> line<00:00:41.219> around<00:00:41.909> the

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
in the jowl or the jaw line around the

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.020 
in the jowl or the jaw line around the
mouth<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.690> chin<00:00:43.019> area<00:00:43.289> and<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.339> can<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.609> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
mouth and chin area and that can be the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.389 
mouth and chin area and that can be the
result<00:00:45.179> of<00:00:45.679> imbalances<00:00:46.679> in<00:00:46.739> different

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
result of imbalances in different

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.059 
result of imbalances in different
hormones<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.089> typically<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:49.079> could<00:00:49.409> mean<00:00:49.620> low

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:50.069 
hormones so typically it could mean low

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:53.360 
hormones so typically it could mean low
estrogen<00:00:50.489> hi<00:00:51.359> progesterone<00:00:51.989> or<00:00:52.440> excess

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
estrogen hi progesterone or excess

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.610 
estrogen hi progesterone or excess
testosterone<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.659> it's<00:00:54.809> not<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.319> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
testosterone and it's not just the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.500 
testosterone and it's not just the
levels<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.280> those<00:00:56.519> but<00:00:56.879> also<00:00:57.089> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
levels of those but also the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.359 
levels of those but also the
relationship<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:58.619> another<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.979> their

00:00:59.359 --> 00:00:59.369 
relationship to one another and their

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:01.759 
relationship to one another and their
ratios<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.879> one<00:01:00.239> another<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.780> well<00:01:01.229> as<00:01:01.589> any

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
ratios to one another as well as any

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.130 
ratios to one another as well as any
abnormalities<00:01:02.369> in<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.239> rhythm<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.929> their

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
abnormalities in the rhythm of their

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.860 
abnormalities in the rhythm of their
production<00:01:04.800> and<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.480> that<00:01:06.600> does<00:01:06.840> is

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
production and so that what that does is

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.110 
production and so that what that does is
that<00:01:07.140> promotes<00:01:07.770> oil<00:01:08.070> production<00:01:08.550> in<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
that promotes oil production in the

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.920 
that promotes oil production in the
gland<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.780> then<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.530> results<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.360> in<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
gland and then that results in in the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.770 
gland and then that results in in the
skin<00:01:13.140> break<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> skin<00:01:14.100> erupting

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
skin break out or the skin erupting

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.390 
skin break out or the skin erupting
typically<00:01:15.780> with<00:01:15.960> hormonal<00:01:16.350> imbalances<00:01:17.040> they

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
typically with hormonal imbalances they

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.630 
typically with hormonal imbalances they
show<00:01:17.670> up<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.870> small<00:01:19.380> cysts<00:01:19.980> or<00:01:20.130> like

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
show up as a small cysts or like

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.990 
show up as a small cysts or like
Whitehead<00:01:21.120> bumps<00:01:22.110> underneath<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.400> skin<00:01:23.670> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
Whitehead bumps underneath the skin and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.270 
Whitehead bumps underneath the skin and
you<00:01:24.690> know<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.620> would<00:01:25.800> probably<00:01:26.160> think

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
you know you you would probably think

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.950 
you know you you would probably think
that<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.730> more<00:01:26.910> common<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.420> women<00:01:27.480> which

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
that this is more common in women which

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.160 
that this is more common in women which
it<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.980> also<00:01:29.160> happen<00:01:29.570> in<00:01:30.570> men<00:01:30.870> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
it is but it can also happen in men and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.520 
it is but it can also happen in men and
we<00:01:32.040> often<00:01:32.250> see<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.940> women<00:01:33.270> with<00:01:33.450> PCOS<00:01:33.690> or

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
we often see this in women with PCOS or

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.790 
we often see this in women with PCOS or
typically<00:01:35.430> related<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:36.800> different

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
typically related to different

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.590 
typically related to different
fluctuations<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.850> their<00:01:39.030> cycles<00:01:39.420> so

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
fluctuations in their cycles so

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.780 
fluctuations in their cycles so
different<00:01:39.960> times<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.560> their<00:01:41.010> monthly<00:01:41.310> cycle

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
different times in their monthly cycle

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.790 
different times in their monthly cycle
they'll<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.480> breakouts<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.440> be<00:01:43.470> due

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
they'll have breakouts and it can be due

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.890 
they'll have breakouts and it can be due
to<00:01:43.980> what's<00:01:44.760> happening<00:01:44.880> with<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.330> hormones<00:01:45.659> at

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
to what's happening with the hormones at

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.230 
to what's happening with the hormones at
that<00:01:46.380> time<00:01:46.770> yeah<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.730> another<00:01:47.880> thing<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.120> look

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
that time yeah and another thing to look

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.120 
that time yeah and another thing to look
at<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.810> addition<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.680> whole<00:01:49.860> mental

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
at in addition to the whole mental

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.760 
at in addition to the whole mental
aspect<00:01:50.580> is<00:01:50.760> the<00:01:51.240> integrity<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.260> digestive

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
aspect is the integrity of digestive

to the body and that inflammation has an

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.730 
to the body and that inflammation has an
effect<00:02:15.700> on<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.450> oil<00:02:16.630> glands<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.470> skin

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
effect on the oil glands in the skin

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.680 
effect on the oil glands in the skin
producing<00:02:18.340> too<00:02:18.520> much<00:02:18.550> oil<00:02:18.880> which<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.480> then

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
producing too much oil which is then

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.360 
producing too much oil which is then
going<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.900> have<00:02:19.990> consequences<00:02:20.530> from<00:02:20.830> then<00:02:21.100> on

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
going to have consequences from then on

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.820 
going to have consequences from then on
in<00:02:21.750> another<00:02:22.750> thing<00:02:22.990> to<00:02:23.020> consider<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
in another thing to consider is the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.430 
in another thing to consider is the
single<00:02:24.310> gut<00:02:24.520> dysbiosis<00:02:24.840> which<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:25.990> when<00:02:26.170> the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
single gut dysbiosis which is when the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.740 
single gut dysbiosis which is when the
bad<00:02:26.680> bacteria<00:02:26.980> in<00:02:27.550> your<00:02:27.700> gut<00:02:27.760> has<00:02:28.480> kind<00:02:28.720> of

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
bad bacteria in your gut has kind of

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.449 
bad bacteria in your gut has kind of
over<00:02:29.020> taken<00:02:29.350> from<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.590> good<00:02:29.740> bacteria<00:02:29.920> and

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
over taken from the good bacteria and

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.220 
over taken from the good bacteria and
the<00:02:30.760> new<00:02:30.850> bacteria<00:02:31.270> is<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:31.480> important<00:02:32.020> that<00:02:32.170> it

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
the new bacteria is so important that it

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.199 
the new bacteria is so important that it
really<00:02:32.440> has<00:02:32.620> massive<00:02:33.220> knock-on<00:02:33.550> effects<00:02:34.030> and

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
really has massive knock-on effects and

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.090 
really has massive knock-on effects and
all<00:02:34.840> these<00:02:34.990> bad<00:02:35.170> bacteria<00:02:35.410> are<00:02:35.830> going<00:02:36.010> to

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
all these bad bacteria are going to

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.710 
all these bad bacteria are going to
produce<00:02:36.250> all<00:02:36.580> sorts<00:02:36.880> of<00:02:36.940> toxins<00:02:37.450> in<00:02:37.570> your<00:02:37.600> body

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720

that going to circulate and your skin

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.250 
that going to circulate and your skin
being<00:02:40.180> one<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.360> your<00:02:40.510> media<00:02:40.690> detoxification

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
being one of your media detoxification

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.890 
being one of your media detoxification
organs<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.220> going<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.670> try<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:42.910> get<00:02:43.720> rid<00:02:43.840> of

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
organs is going to try and get rid of

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.180 
organs is going to try and get rid of
some<00:02:43.990> of<00:02:44.110> these<00:02:44.200> tops<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.680> seems<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.890> come<00:02:45.160> out

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
some of these tops and seems to come out

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.220 
some of these tops and seems to come out
through<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.820> skin<00:02:45.970> resulting<00:02:46.750> in<00:02:47.110> these

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
through the skin resulting in these

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.310 
through the skin resulting in these
breakouts<00:02:47.680> is<00:02:47.920> also<00:02:48.550> going<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.760> have<00:02:48.910> a

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
breakouts is also going to have a

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.750 
breakouts is also going to have a
general<00:02:50.320> overload<00:02:50.739> kind<00:02:51.010> of<00:02:51.070> impact<00:02:51.459> on<00:02:51.670> the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
general overload kind of impact on the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.280 
general overload kind of impact on the
liver<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.030> other<00:02:52.209> decalcification<00:02:52.750> organs

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
liver and other decalcification organs

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.110 
liver and other decalcification organs
too<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:54.250> that's<00:02:54.430> something<00:02:54.610> else<00:02:54.880> is<00:02:55.090> a

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
too so that's something else is a

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.410 
too so that's something else is a
digestive<00:02:55.840> kind<00:02:56.380> of<00:02:56.440> health<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:56.980> general<00:02:57.420> yeah

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
digestive kind of health in general yeah

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.580 
digestive kind of health in general yeah
then<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.750> other<00:02:58.870> thing<00:02:58.930> too<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.290> just

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
then the other thing too is just

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.920 
then the other thing too is just
anything<00:02:59.890> that<00:03:00.100> promotes<00:03:00.370> inflammation<00:03:00.930> so

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
anything that promotes inflammation so

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.240 
anything that promotes inflammation so
whether<00:03:02.080> that's<00:03:02.200> your<00:03:02.560> lifestyle<00:03:03.070> maybe

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
whether that's your lifestyle maybe

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.090 
whether that's your lifestyle maybe
you're<00:03:03.459> super<00:03:03.790> stressed<00:03:04.150> poor<00:03:05.080> poor<00:03:05.590> diets

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
you're super stressed poor poor diets

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.190 
you're super stressed poor poor diets
that's<00:03:06.459> compromising<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:07.360> digestive<00:03:07.810> system

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
that's compromising the digestive system

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.920 
that's compromising the digestive system
and<00:03:09.100> just<00:03:09.610> your<00:03:09.730> lifestyle<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.270> general<00:03:10.300> can

and just your lifestyle in general can

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.890 
and just your lifestyle in general can
can<00:03:11.440> help<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:12.010> promote<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.670> skin<00:03:12.910> eruptions

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
can help to promote the skin eruptions

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.410 
can help to promote the skin eruptions
because<00:03:14.110> it's<00:03:14.290> inflammatory<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:16.209> that's

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
because it's inflammatory so that's

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.720 
because it's inflammatory so that's
that's<00:03:17.080> what<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.620> also<00:03:17.890> want<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.100> look<00:03:18.190> at<00:03:18.400> so

that's what you also want to look at so

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.840 
that's what you also want to look at so
the<00:03:18.910> way<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.120> kind<00:03:19.989> of<00:03:20.049> systematically

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
the way to kind of systematically

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.610 
the way to kind of systematically
address<00:03:21.850> skin<00:03:22.299> rickets<00:03:22.750> number<00:03:23.200> one<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.590> to
