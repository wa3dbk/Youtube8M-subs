00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.340
 to understand what the new conditions 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.230
 he needs to play just a couple of hours 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.639
 play to understand in the morning was early 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.529
 greener Stalin livelier game better 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.279
 such a feeling haunt you all 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.480
 the game and not far behind whatever speed on 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.480
 their electoral developed 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.710
 masons from sample 2005 to play my 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.330
 still and she understood 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.770
 but this was from what is now not 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.070
 enough not to save 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.870
 this is the hooligan style 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.710
 and large capacity new Novodvorskaya 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.110
 space bus is a real city which many 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.030
 know by heart and who clearly spoke 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.020
 what are you snot here 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.000
 if you want rabbis the big leagues should 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.950
 fight 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.020
 if we proceed from this new oslo over 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.499
 can hardly be considered a title 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:49.879
 even title close 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.019
 the developers are barrels of this 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.789
 ideologies precisely to denote what 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.859
 we didn't have the word socks tactics 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:56.760
 masons 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.920
 three hours we give me no complaints 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.990
 more precisely was not 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.800
 i love that burnout paradise i am delighted and 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.280
 reasons for success but here are the bridge of the foundation 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.840
 turned pure on your product 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.850
 shoveling everything is not worth it in fact 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.940
 no it's original 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.770
 interesting was the plot of the bridge fund yes 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.210
 black list treble 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.990
 riders who knew the recipe on what 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.500
 there is food and you must say muslin too 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.210
 raisa hands give a lot to dial 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.580
 five things 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.670
 but forget about it as it was in 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.340
 the last few parts do not keep up 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.050
 forbids a female voice which is why 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.440
 then you start to hate when he 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.969
 He speaks 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.120
 here is a list of ten riders brain he beats 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.150
 beat them and you got their cars 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.230
 dial for the first place of luck 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.610
 but it's just quiet 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.010
 see lazio 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.850
 to get to the next rider 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.400
 more precisely to the car because in general 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.500
 unknown there are these 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.109
 racers 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:45.919
 need a place for money numbers speculators 

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:47.809
 which are given for almost everything here 

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:49.599
 neutralized rival yes ride by 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:50.420
 counter 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.540
 I certainly understand everything but I am in five hours 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.869
 games managed to get to 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.909
 Fourth place in the list, that is, if 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.710
 try you can go through something like 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.530
 plot to score 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.260
 I weighed the main thing is not interesting 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.090
 is it true 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.940
 again remember the seven-year-old masuda 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.420
 prescription such cars were there yes such 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.730
 happiness was to buy any new point 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.989
 a real monster 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.879
 And if you also close up godly 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.919
 and how I loved to leave the workshop of Mexico 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.739
 told us to listen powerful about 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.609
 updated motor 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.529
 I am questioning tech in part 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:20.759
 what I got today is pretty big 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:22.889
 car park and just over 50 cars where 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.299
 wormed the atmosphere of Kiev is natural 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.639
 Historic Movie Racing Car 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:29.199
 car and secu brothers 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.139
 lasted the fact that all cars are with 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.189
 the very beginning you just have them 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:34.379
 find and fun tell us 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.199
 developers 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:37.979
 for each car and withdrawn five races 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:39.339
 different degree of complexity which 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:41.459
 discover new modifications and when 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.499
 did not end you can safely forget about 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.379
 the car we drove and sit down 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.519
 on the other starting essentially anew of course 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.319
 worth paying tribute to the arcade criteria 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.119
 can not do the race dynamics 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:52.789
 beyond all if you enter two 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:54.689
 shimmers car worn on low 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:55.969
 speeds and engine noise 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.199
 overlap the grass of conversation 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:59.419
 the cops everything seems to be great until you 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:00.090
 come back 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.560
 racing mechanics look like trying 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.400
 by force i must admit it was 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.999
 complicated 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:05.699
 for each car was created its own 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:07.609
 behavior model is described by turning 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.209
 not even for me 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.269
 the reason became the sport mechanic seems 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.189
 car behavior still need to attract 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:14.630
 but it became noticeably lighter 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.010
 corporate crash display in all 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.830
 angles which are so pleased signature bin 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.419
 Bernanke in the same asked 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.239
 The boss here is just furious 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.290
 You will have a lot of accidents and everyone will 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.999
 be accompanied by a roller and not 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:26.680
 very spectacular and it is not only 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.809
 annoying but spoils the whole dynamic 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.569
 in the second races accounted for honor 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.189
 passing through marks 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.369
 miss everything but most 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:36.879
 the tracks are not fenced, that is, in general, and a salute 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.099
 ruble risk under the screen unknowing 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.369
 still these are charged with 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:41.979
 surroundings and skip turning 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.119
 go somewhere in the field here is a sweet affair 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:46.219
 and if you return to the track you will 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:48.350
 already far behind without hope of victory 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.220
 the third was the track of the game just grounds 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.230
 only to the wards really making 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.620
 drive but everything else then 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.950
 slurred pro collector 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.850
 annoying things but the local police 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.080
 pleased and here just wildly and fought to 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.950
 last we have their importunity connected 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.969
 take one more minus go 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.829
 even if you have this sheet held by 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:05.939
 smell find out your location 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.439
 take this immediately the number of the road segment 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.559
 ways of retreat 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:11.349
 therefore, it is often easier to stop a course 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.219
 bind arrest benefit punish you not very much 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.489
 rather, they did not notice at all that someone 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.749
 punished hell before banks meet 

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:20.039
 such that the usb port and screensaver grabbed 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.059
 green elephant 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:23.039
 such a drug addiction has long been admitted not 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:23.610
 saw 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.930
 but the camera flies upside down yes portraying 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.360
 human suicide giving with 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.360
 skyscraper and surroundings 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.120
 this happiness is accepted then machines 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.159
 water will begin to waltz the water so 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.370
 But if the banks seem to be a godsend then all 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.370
 the rest is cleaning bernau though if 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.539
 honestly until he even terrified you 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.360
 ride the course of the beautiful shining 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.130
 success of his attacker request 0 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.190
 but there is absolutely nothing to do 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.260
 except as the search for the car if the banks 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.560
 will throw licensing 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.330
 blacklist machine with some 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.440
 pieces of meat repair item style just 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.850
 lapped burnout paradise of course you can decide 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.620
 that the emphasis was on multiplex all the same 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.050
 also auto forehead all things 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.370
 yes logic is fun 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.470
 wants a car asks for a collection point we 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.979
 waiting for each other's tests 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.410
 then everyone is trying to get more points 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.780
 become the first so on 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.210
 in place of lada cool but for how long 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.009
 identity of his words instead of stories 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.650
 examples of illegal vodka as shown 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.410
 the analysis after this assignment is very 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.250
 beautiful repetition is not interesting year 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.340
 for this money how we remember and love him 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.210
 also no yes it is really a class 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.879
 super backs in acting race 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.809
 lady warm perhaps exploit your interest in 

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:23.810
 the game for a maximum of a week but only 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:24.630
 why so wonderful 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.580
 developers to the criteria to spoil something 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.000
 that worked fine for seven years 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.180
 back and it would work fine now i'm not 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.639
 I know it was waiting for that very Freemason 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:33.020
 Tatars 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.939
 but that's all 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:35.079
 performers fact
