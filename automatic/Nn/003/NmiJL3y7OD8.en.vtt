excellent<00:00:17.070> for<00:00:17.250> hvz<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.449> i<00:00:18.779> guess<00:00:18.930> some<00:00:19.109> other

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
excellent for hvz and i guess some other

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.830 
excellent for hvz and i guess some other
some<00:00:19.890> other<00:00:19.949> applications<00:00:20.609> but<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:21.029> also<00:00:21.300> love

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
flywheel blasters and I think they don't

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.140 
flywheel blasters and I think they don't
get<00:00:24.480> as<00:00:24.779> much<00:00:25.740> credit<00:00:26.010> as<00:00:26.279> they<00:00:26.519> should<00:00:26.580> for

out<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.200> bought<00:00:46.289> another<00:00:46.770> Raven<00:00:47.190> because<00:00:47.879> I

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
out and bought another Raven because I

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.850 
out and bought another Raven because I
was<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.750> an<00:00:48.870> integration<00:00:49.289> with<00:00:49.530> it

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
was going to do an integration with it

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.520 
was going to do an integration with it
but<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.489> wasn't<00:00:50.969> really<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.660> size<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.379> would

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
but it wasn't really the size that would

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.889 
but it wasn't really the size that would
fit<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.250> wouldn't<00:00:53.460> really<00:00:53.550> work<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.090> I

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
fit and it wouldn't really work so I

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.260 
fit and it wouldn't really work so I
opened<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.590> up<00:00:55.739> did<00:00:56.460> some<00:00:56.670> tweaking<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
opened it up did some tweaking on the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.599 
opened it up did some tweaking on the
inside<00:00:57.539> rewired<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.289> stuff<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.550> I

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
inside rewired it stuff like that but I

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.529 
inside rewired it stuff like that but I
also<00:01:00.000> wanted<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.660> paint<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:02.359> gave<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.480> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
also wanted to paint it so I gave it a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.380 
also wanted to paint it so I gave it a
nice<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.840> vinyl<00:01:04.260> dye<00:01:05.000> covering<00:01:06.000> that's<00:01:06.210> like

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
nice of vinyl dye covering that's like

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.810 
nice of vinyl dye covering that's like
four<00:01:06.869> layers<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> stuff<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.189> little<00:01:08.640> bit

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
four layers of the stuff so a little bit

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.460 
four layers of the stuff so a little bit
of<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> green<00:01:09.180> shows<00:01:09.510> through<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.020> not<00:01:10.200> too

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
of the green shows through but not too

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.850 
of the green shows through but not too
much<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.030> what<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.240> thought<00:01:12.630> I'd<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.530> try

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
much and what I thought I'd do is try

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.710 
much and what I thought I'd do is try
something<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.790> haven't<00:01:14.970> really<00:01:15.119> seen

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
something that I haven't really seen

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.080 
something that I haven't really seen
done<00:01:16.140> before<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.520> don't<00:01:17.729> know<00:01:17.820> how<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.030> is

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
done before so I don't know how this is

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.179 
done before so I don't know how this is
going<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.270> turn<00:01:18.390> out<00:01:18.509> but<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:19.590> way<00:01:19.740> I'm<00:01:19.890> going

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
going to turn out but the way I'm going

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.240 
going to turn out but the way I'm going
to<00:01:20.310> paint<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:21.530> involves<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.710> three<00:01:23.009> can't

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
to paint this involves a three can't

let me open up the sides here so the law
school<00:05:28.760> I'm<00:05:28.880> gonna<00:05:29.000> put<00:05:29.210> on<00:05:29.360> this<00:05:29.480> side<00:05:29.690> is<00:05:29.990> a

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
school I'm gonna put on this side is a

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.310 
school I'm gonna put on this side is a
nice<00:05:30.440> dose<00:05:31.340> of<00:05:31.580> blue<00:05:31.820> Moyne<00:05:32.150> that<00:05:32.540> way<00:05:32.720> on<00:05:32.870> it

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
I think I'll kind of make the blast a

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.880 
I think I'll kind of make the blast a
little<00:05:35.930> more<00:05:36.050> symmetrical<00:05:36.500> since<00:05:36.710> there's

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
little more symmetrical since there's

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.020 
little more symmetrical since there's
blue<00:05:37.100> going<00:05:37.310> the<00:05:37.400> same<00:05:37.580> way<00:05:37.730> on<00:05:37.850> the<00:05:37.880> other
