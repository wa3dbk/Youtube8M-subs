00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.150
 so our encounter with the device 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.800
 mini max was through a 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.269
 advertorial in a daily newspaper 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.920
 we were actually looking for 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.660
 long of a solution to fight 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.190
 against the limestone at home the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.510
 first we had it was not 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.939
 only the limestone but also the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.570
 place to be able to put a device 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.670
 all we had seen this compound 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.170
 usually ahead of carboy that was 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.480
 relatively huge but who could not 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.740
 not be placed at our destination 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.020
 of water is at home below 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.730
 7 c term in Asia and so it was necessary 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.520
 of course place the device the most 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.829
 near the water supply and the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.750
 unfortunate place of tonton could 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.000
 benefit it was inside of 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.039
 this wardrobe was complicated because 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.320
 that there was already a water filter that 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.000
 had been installed but despite five 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.460
 technicians got to put 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.079
 the device in the cabinet so we have 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.210
 a clutter really 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.210
 minimum of the device 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.979
 I must say that it is indeed a 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.840
 change day and night 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.630
 2 compared to the previous situation 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.420
 one of the first arguments is the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.890
 feeling about the skin the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.300
 hands of course but not only 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.759
 I would say when we take a shower 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.330
 feel the difference right away 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.280
 it's not a luxury 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.310
 you could say it's all 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.750
 devices that are empty accessible to 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.960
 everyone to everyone but 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.160
 on the other hand good people have good 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.740
 of people many TVs I know 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.460
 do not ask dgsn not to know 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.100
 what to do 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.100
 consumption was really the one that 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.479
 had been the one that had been announced 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.670
 the installation was done in the month of 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.500
 May is about seven months later 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.750
 So I'm going down at the end of December 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.330
 actually we had to ask the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.460
 passage of the technician because we 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.050
 had no salt and it was really 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.380
 what had been to what had been 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.380
