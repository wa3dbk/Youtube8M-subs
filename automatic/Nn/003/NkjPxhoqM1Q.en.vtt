00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.349
 a greeting to all the readers of 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.559
 tuttoandroid.net we are the stand of 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.739
 lenovo at the berlin 2014 Ia this is 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.909
 vice x2 the new top of the house range 

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:20.339
 Chinese 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:22.199
 it is a device that does this first 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:24.630
 to design all its point 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.429
 force because this to see it so of 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.539
 front my says well yes warlike na 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.109
 nice interface, however, has nothing 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.740
 particular apart from that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.570
 practically a copy of ios 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.350
 the particularity is on the side and on the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.670
 back because as you can see in layers 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.230
 this is a tool choice 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.940
 this is a precise stylistic choice 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.969
 of lenovo that he wanted to introduce 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.460
 this peculiarity on its top of 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.739
 range to give greater freedom to 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.780
 users to find their own color 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.609
 preferred the first preferred shade 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.409
 on your phone 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.899
 as you can see, you pass from the black of the 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.250
 screen to this very dark red up 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.280
 to get to them it was clear that 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.470
 then it is also the color of the back one 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.509
 definitely very much choice 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.210
 interesting that could be 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.289
 rewarded all by the users in a 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.780
 market that has crowded with smartphones 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.670
 but for better or for worse they are all 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.869
 how many equal with the usual white colors 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.610
 and black and little else to say in hand 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.100
 device despite this 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.740
 security device set at 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.920
 back is very good it is very much 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.630
 this light and quite ergonomic 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.670
 thanks also to the 5-inch display 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.080
 so not too big not too much 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.230
 I live 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.820
 the 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution for which 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.940
 full hd for which it is absolutely online 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.650
 with what is the competition of 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.780
 Christmas here below are present 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.460
 three soft touch keys that the mayon 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.250
 French for a short time we have a menu 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.440
 home and back 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.530
 long press of the home button 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.960
 leads to search with google now il 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.670
 menu button instead leads to 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.520
 recent applications that among other things 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.330
 they are in full ios style ie own 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.720
 equal spell out apple system 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.320
 the pressure of writing does not 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.270
 no particular action let's talk a little 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.250
 index of technical characteristics 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.780
 Lenovo has chosen an nvidia processor 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.470
 tech for immediate accuracy 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.630
 put 1595 for this smartphone 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.640
 let's talk about an okhta core processor 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.340
 what gives me who calls truvada 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.080
 races are eight cores all the same and not 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.489
 four cores of one type and four shots 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.660
 another as for example with the ex 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:45.730
 silos or with the new qualcomm operates at two 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.140
 giger and supports quarrels and lte networks 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.600
 the new ones were chosen by mild as 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.310
 launch partner for this type of 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.630
 processor for which it is the first 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.160
 device to mount it in a manner 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.220
 official 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.860
 then we find 2 gigabytes of ram and 32gb of 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.260
 memory was unfortunately not expandable 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.360
 along with a 2,300 milan battery 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.860
 for now he should secure one 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.530
 good longevity 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.280
 then we have a 5 camera 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.220
 megapixel 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.700
 here above it is a so-called 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.490
 I know who he is but there is one in the new states 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.180
 be suitable for taking selphy while 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.250
 instead on the back in the upper part 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.010
 in the upper left corner we have 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.290
 a 13 megapixel camera with flash 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.620
 lED 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.920
 Now let's see what the sides are like 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.450
 then on the left side we have the slot 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.180
 for the micro sim 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.900
 on the lower side we have the 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.700
 microphone 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.680
 here I believe that there is then the side e 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.970
 the micro usb port that greets me 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.110
 occupied by this device of 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.800
 safety 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.629
 we therefore have the key on the right side 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.819
 of switching off and on 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.370
 the upper side volume rocker 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.130
 instead it only hosts the 3.5 jack 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.460
 millimeters for headphones and others 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.340
 accessories will come tv to audio 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.590
 let's try this smartphone a bit 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.840
 uses android 4.4 in the cast like 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.050
 operating system as you can see enough 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.260
 fluid and reactive 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:22.620
 open the settings it is set 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.330
 in Russian at a guess why it is 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.100
 actually a bit complicated 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.920
 orient yourself but these should be 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.920
 device information 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.750
 ok any battery is charged 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.580
 while in the sky we find various here 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.930
 settings ok now inter safe if I have to 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.590
 admit it's not really the thing 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.080
 easy world but we found the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.130
 information screen on 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:55.150
 device with the lenovo defines x2 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:57.520
 android 4.4.2 and says that there are 2 GB of 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.020
 ram and 32 gb of rom but we knew this 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.310
 already the arrival in Europe should be 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.200
 quite certain but unfortunately not 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.670
 we still know if it will also arrive in 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.760
 Italy and the 9 in Italy a presence 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:13.420
 quite small and I do n't like whole 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.640
 certainly with the arrival of motorola too 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.530
 in this regard lenovo said that 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.290
 for a certain period there will be one 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.170
 overlap between the ugly motorola i 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.600
 lenovo products for which it is probable 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.760
 instead we will see this device 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.850
 at least we hope because surely yes 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.620
 it's a smartphone that could 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.970
 have your say and it could be 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.690
 surely intrigue users 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.860
 thanks to this found of the three colors 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.500
 different among other salmon available 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.330
 various colors have also shown the 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.980
 blue and so on we show you now 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:50.320
 for example the bamboo that lenovo says 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.880
 be produced with growing bamboo 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.860
 only in spring in one 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.320
 particular region of China for which 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.360
 a very precious material 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.800
 which I must also say has a state 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.050
 because definitely why 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.450
 edition but I don't know what to say about heat 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.180
 typical of wood is that it really is 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.070
 appreciable on a smartphone than in the 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.090
 moments there is not enough cold it is 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:18.240
 quite impersonal what to say for the 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.900
 moment is everything from the new from riccardo 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.900
 for all android
