what<00:00:22.520> happened<00:00:23.620> because<00:00:24.620> everything<00:00:25.010> else

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
what happened because everything else

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.590 
what happened because everything else
seems<00:00:25.430> to<00:00:25.490> be<00:00:25.610> pretty<00:00:25.760> good<00:00:25.970> with<00:00:26.030> the<00:00:26.270> engine

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
seems to be pretty good with the engine

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.990 
seems to be pretty good with the engine
I<00:00:26.720> think<00:00:26.900> what<00:00:27.380> happened<00:00:27.800> is<00:00:27.950> the<00:00:28.520> person<00:00:28.910> I

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
I think what happened is the person I

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.790 
I think what happened is the person I
bought<00:00:29.240> it<00:00:29.390> from<00:00:29.510> had<00:00:29.780> rebuilt<00:00:30.140> the<00:00:30.320> motor<00:00:30.350> and

bought it from had rebuilt the motor and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.459 
bought it from had rebuilt the motor and
I<00:00:31.059> they<00:00:32.059> did<00:00:32.300> everything<00:00:32.570> they<00:00:32.750> said<00:00:32.870> they<00:00:33.230> did

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
I they did everything they said they did

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.139 
I they did everything they said they did
because<00:00:33.829> you<00:00:33.950> can<00:00:34.100> run<00:00:34.460> this<00:00:34.640> thing<00:00:34.879> and<00:00:35.000> it

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
because you can run this thing and it

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.779 
because you can run this thing and it
does<00:00:35.300> have<00:00:35.510> a<00:00:35.540> cam<00:00:35.809> in<00:00:36.020> it<00:00:36.050> I<00:00:36.489> mean<00:00:37.489> a<00:00:37.550> little

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789
