00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
of those variables also you can just

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.169 
of those variables also you can just
turn<00:01:39.830> on<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:40.130> let<00:01:40.280> it<00:01:40.310> diffuse<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:40.909> it<00:01:41.000> should

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
will turn it off and then it's just

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.740 
will turn it off and then it's just
diffusing<00:01:56.179> turn<00:01:56.959> it<00:01:57.080> back<00:01:57.200> on<00:01:58.300> below<00:01:59.300> that<00:01:59.509> is

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
diffusing turn it back on below that is

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.499 
diffusing turn it back on below that is
the<00:01:59.959> volume<00:02:00.759> right<00:02:01.759> now<00:02:01.910> I<00:02:01.940> think<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.300> have<00:02:02.330> it

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
the volume right now I think I have it

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.630 
the volume right now I think I have it
all<00:02:02.599> the<00:02:02.629> way<00:02:02.810> up<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:06.140> then<00:02:07.099> we<00:02:07.220> can<00:02:07.250> turn<00:02:07.550> it

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
all the way up and then we can turn it

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.619 
all the way up and then we can turn it
way<00:02:08.119> down

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.039 

it's<00:02:13.290> much<00:02:13.439> quieter<00:02:14.480> then<00:02:15.480> below<00:02:15.749> that<00:02:15.900> you

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
it's much quieter then below that you

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:24.710 
it's much quieter then below that you
can<00:02:16.079> cycle<00:02:16.409> through<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.799> lights

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.920 

go<00:02:25.380> through<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.800> different<00:02:25.950> colors<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:27.780> can

have<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.500> set<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.800> where<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.280> naturally

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
have it set to where it just naturally
