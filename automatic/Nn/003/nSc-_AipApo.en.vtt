00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello guys from the city of the sun among the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.819
 so many creative activities you can 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.280
 find more the city ​​of the sun 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.500
 there are also these fun 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.330
 especially very educational even cards 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.059
 creative of the house and trust the cus 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.740
 bourne that allow us to pass the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.930
 time traveling but situation that 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.210
 this is not the case for the Pope 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.609
 difficult and I live it too or at first 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 person are suitable for both travel 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.859
 but also above all 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.630
 getting back on the theme signatures like 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.949
 the sister works I will show between 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.500
 the other directly extreme some 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.140
 games are cards in the house 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.180
 that can be written 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.050
 with an accused marker in operation 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.700
 this keep it that can be easily 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.280
 washed by writing if I for example 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.350
 using a normal handkerchief 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.660
 normal and the rodia marker 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.610
 completely truly past tongues 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.590
 so a moment has an excellent also 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.079
 reason to start smaller at 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.780
 difficult art of culture 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.850
 here we are in the plastic cards that 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.650
 allow us to play the games there 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.330
 we find they are very, very different 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.180
 see someone monster in this case 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.070
 we have the image of a child who 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.450
 we must complete the card tells us 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.250
 draw a hat a crown for 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.280
 this child but since I'm a fan 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.049
 of princesses we go to draw the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.420
 crown of the first obviously here we are 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.700
 us to be able to take off with read of 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.170
 case some decoration and so on 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.970
 it's a game we made but 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.369
 attention games I am sure therefore no 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.840
 we have time to spend 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.329
 another type of game that we find 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.369
 to that of being able to recognize the 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.170
 dragon shape then I usually 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.140
 when I play this game I concentrate 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.040
 on the elements no we have a shape one 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.020
 single leg 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.850
 he is not the other one to both legs 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.340
 let's go see the wings here there is one with 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.560
 the only one cannot be he remains 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.259
 two with two wings we see with the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.759
 Unlike here's where there is the tail 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.530
 the item is obviously missing the queue 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.170
 be careful not to take it in 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.689
 head when he wants that in the sky ok a 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.060
 another game and this pa butterfly 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.579
 hidden where the eight butterflies are in 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.140
 this illustration looks for the signal 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:18.950
 with a circle then 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:20.270
 one is only touched 2 3 4 5 6 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.010
 then 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.050
 we see that it was such a fact a little earlier 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.320
 because I didn't see myself having to deal with it 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:33.590
 from 7 and then how not to know how to find again 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:35.210
 the last 377777 you know I tell you 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.470
 you find me and you write to me 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.870
 comments below 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.280
 then we have a car from 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.560
 we can draw two blood 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.910
 so machines can we have power 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.150
 with our marker I remind you 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.820
 A handkerchief is enough to wash 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.550
 very clean as you see not 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.570
 looking for is transcribed by us into 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.120
 this way we do another 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.530
 machine we have our pilot that 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.560
 guide we can also do the steering wheel of the 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.330
 in case maybe we even do some 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.640
 reinforcing a collector in this way 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.840
 we can also put the lights to do 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.440
 so we made ours 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.420
 next machine to play in the junta 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.850
 What is hidden in the jungle are we 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.660
 to be able to draw it then source 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.660
 to deliver 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:30.269
 because we have our tiger lion o 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.950
 then evaluate we also have a lot of games 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.780
 classics such as what he says 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.849
 if not for which the differences between 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.890
 I like one image at the other 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.670
 a lot because it allows you to go to 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.519
 reconstruct the story by drawing it 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.519
 exactly half symmetrical a light 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.840
 serious to rebuild our ok this 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.599
 completing could have time 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.519
 nicolò and so on even this much 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.260
 nice not only cloud transforms 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.430
 map clouds again a monster of one 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:04.049
 quite then at the moment I go to 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.480
 little sheep orecchiette in this way 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.000
 very very simple 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.659
 coordinates by piece and by saying all 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.840
 the 150 cards for two games of course 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.519
 front and allow to develop the 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.199
 own fantasy to pass the time e 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.630
 solve puzzles such as 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.310
 this of the facsal during not only i 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.900
 others in my opinion but also during a 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.350
 maybe rainy afternoon of this 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.870
 winter 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.419

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.220
