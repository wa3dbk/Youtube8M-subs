00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
flood zone in theory two layers are

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.350 
flood zone in theory two layers are
better<00:03:50.690> than<00:03:50.930> one<00:03:51.230> but<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.250> me<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.880> map<00:03:53.120> kind

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
better than one but to me the map kind

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.840 
better than one but to me the map kind
of<00:03:53.450> feels<00:03:53.630> empty<00:03:54.080> at<00:03:54.380> times<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:55.010> sometimes<00:03:55.070> it

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
of feels empty at times and sometimes it

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.030 
of feels empty at times and sometimes it
just<00:03:56.090> feels<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.690> weird<00:03:57.080> having<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:57.800> upstairs

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
just feels so weird having a upstairs

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.729 
just feels so weird having a upstairs
and<00:03:58.670> downstairs<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.930> flow<00:04:00.140> of<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.380> map<00:04:00.560> is

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
and downstairs the flow of the map is

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.680 
and downstairs the flow of the map is
off<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.220> i<00:04:01.280> hope<00:04:01.459> they<00:04:01.640> can<00:04:01.850> fix<00:04:02.120> this<00:04:02.390> and

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
off and i hope they can fix this and

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.620 
off and i hope they can fix this and
grow<00:04:03.440> market<00:04:03.709> so<00:04:04.400> i<00:04:04.700> really<00:04:05.090> look<00:04:05.209> forward<00:04:05.269> to

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
grow market so i really look forward to

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.540 
grow market so i really look forward to
that<00:04:05.900> i'm<00:04:06.320> really<00:04:06.620> hoping<00:04:06.769> that<00:04:06.980> dice<00:04:07.280> have

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
that i'm really hoping that dice have

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.610 
that i'm really hoping that dice have
spent<00:04:07.880> some<00:04:08.060> time<00:04:08.090> playing<00:04:08.720> with<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.380> map

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
spent some time playing with the map

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.650 
spent some time playing with the map
design<00:04:09.830> it<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.880> really<00:04:11.180> cool<00:04:11.330> that<00:04:11.540> they

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
design it is really cool that they

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.840 
design it is really cool that they
brought<00:04:11.930> back<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.260> falling<00:04:13.010> rubble<00:04:13.250> i<00:04:13.640> have<00:04:13.820> a

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
brought back the falling rubble i have a

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.400 
brought back the falling rubble i have a
really<00:04:14.120> good<00:04:14.360> feeling<00:04:14.420> that<00:04:14.810> this<00:04:15.019> is<00:04:15.080> going

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
really good feeling that this is going

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.820 
really good feeling that this is going
to<00:04:15.560> be<00:04:15.709> a<00:04:15.739> really<00:04:16.280> good<00:04:17.209> infra<00:04:18.019> tree<00:04:18.230> map<00:04:18.500> and<00:04:18.769> i

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
to be a really good infra tree map and i

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.909 
to be a really good infra tree map and i
hope<00:04:19.070> that<00:04:19.400> idea<00:04:20.000> actually<00:04:20.299> sticks<00:04:20.870> out<00:04:21.109> also

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
hope that idea actually sticks out also
