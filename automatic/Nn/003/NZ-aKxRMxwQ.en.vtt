after dragon ravine got banned and I

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.370 
after dragon ravine got banned and I
kind<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.389> go<00:00:09.570> over<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:09.929> kind<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.230> thought

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
kind of go over that I kind of thought

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.530 
kind of go over that I kind of thought
the<00:00:10.559> deck<00:00:10.950> type<00:00:11.190> was<00:00:11.370> dead<00:00:11.610> but<00:00:12.150> when<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.300> took<00:00:12.420> a

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
the deck type was dead but when I took a

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.450 
the deck type was dead but when I took a
look<00:00:12.780> back<00:00:13.259> at<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.620> know<00:00:13.710> what<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:13.980> can<00:00:14.130> do<00:00:14.280> I

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
look back at you know what it can do I

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.010 
look back at you know what it can do I
don't<00:00:14.820> think<00:00:14.969> it's<00:00:15.059> dead<00:00:15.269> necessarily<00:00:15.990> I

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
don't think it's dead necessarily I

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.630 
don't think it's dead necessarily I
think<00:00:16.260> it's<00:00:16.410> just<00:00:16.470> not<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:17.039> know<00:00:17.070> as<00:00:17.279> strong

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
think it's just not you know as strong

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.550 
think it's just not you know as strong
anymore<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:18.240> still<00:00:18.660> think<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.930> has<00:00:19.050> access<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.529> a

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
anymore I still think it has access to a

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.590 
anymore I still think it has access to a
lot<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.770> really<00:00:20.039> fun<00:00:20.220> stuff<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.060> dude<00:00:21.210> does

do it just has to you know spend more

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.500

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.080 
can see why that would be powerful in a
deck<00:05:27.719> like<00:05:27.750> this<00:05:28.159> makers<00:05:29.159> attack<00:05:29.520> can<00:05:30.060> be

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
deck like this makers attack can be

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.209 
deck like this makers attack can be
powerful<00:05:30.479> but<00:05:30.629> we<00:05:31.020> run<00:05:31.319> too<00:05:31.500> many<00:05:31.650> dragons<00:05:32.099> I

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 
powerful but we run too many dragons I

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:34.459 
powerful but we run too many dragons I
think<00:05:32.430> to<00:05:32.759> really<00:05:32.789> make<00:05:33.300> use<00:05:33.479> of<00:05:33.509> this<00:05:33.779> trap

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
think to really make use of this trap

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:36.230 
think to really make use of this trap
stun<00:05:34.710> again<00:05:35.039> if<00:05:35.130> we're<00:05:35.219> going<00:05:35.340> 40<00:05:35.520> TKS<00:05:35.969> and<00:05:36.120> big

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
stun again if we're going 40 TKS and big

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.180 
stun again if we're going 40 TKS and big
plays<00:05:36.479> obviously<00:05:37.139> trap<00:05:37.380> stun<00:05:37.590> is<00:05:37.740> a<00:05:37.770> good<00:05:37.979> card

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
plays obviously trap stun is a good card

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.649 
plays obviously trap stun is a good card
for<00:05:38.340> that<00:05:38.370> and<00:05:38.819> again<00:05:39.240> there's<00:05:39.419> a<00:05:39.479> lot<00:05:39.630> of

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
for that and again there's a lot of

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.510 
for that and again there's a lot of
synchros<00:05:40.080> on<00:05:40.169> XYZ's<00:05:40.680> I<00:05:40.800> just<00:05:41.009> couldn't<00:05:41.219> fit<00:05:41.430> in

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
synchros on XYZ's I just couldn't fit in

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.189

have<00:05:58.770> room<00:05:58.949> for<00:05:59.159> them<00:05:59.279> so<00:05:59.610> that's<00:05:59.699> my

00:05:59.869 --> 00:05:59.879 
have room for them so that's my

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:01.939 
have room for them so that's my

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
them for a very long time so I'm kind of

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:05.180 
them for a very long time so I'm kind of
coming<00:06:03.840> back<00:06:03.960> to<00:06:04.139> it<00:06:04.259> seeing<00:06:04.740> what<00:06:04.770> i<00:06:04.889> could<00:06:04.979> do

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
coming back to it seeing what i could do

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.559 
coming back to it seeing what i could do
with<00:06:05.219> them<00:06:05.520> hopefully<00:06:06.000> you<00:06:06.090> can<00:06:06.180> see<00:06:06.389> you<00:06:06.479> know

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 
with them hopefully you can see you know

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:08.269 
with them hopefully you can see you know
my<00:06:06.719> build<00:06:06.960> kind<00:06:07.199> of<00:06:07.259> experimenting<00:06:07.889> with<00:06:07.919> some

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:08.279 
my build kind of experimenting with some

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:09.379 
my build kind of experimenting with some
other<00:06:08.430> stuff<00:06:08.729> that<00:06:08.789> i<00:06:08.940> think<00:06:09.029> will<00:06:09.270> be

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
other stuff that i think will be

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.029 
other stuff that i think will be
effective<00:06:09.779> for<00:06:09.900> this<00:06:10.020> deck<00:06:10.199> but<00:06:10.770> i'm<00:06:10.889> still

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
effective for this deck but i'm still

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.409 
effective for this deck but i'm still
getting<00:06:11.159> used<00:06:11.460> to<00:06:11.550> kind<00:06:11.819> of<00:06:11.909> the<00:06:12.029> new<00:06:12.180> version

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
getting used to kind of the new version

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:17.819 
about you know what card you use maybe

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:19.399 
about you know what card you use maybe
there's<00:06:18.060> some<00:06:18.240> things<00:06:18.419> I<00:06:18.659> didn't<00:06:19.169> think<00:06:19.229> about

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:19.409 
there's some things I didn't think about

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:20.990 
there's some things I didn't think about
that<00:06:19.560> could<00:06:19.830> be<00:06:19.949> useful<00:06:20.069> with<00:06:20.370> a<00:06:20.400> new<00:06:20.610> build<00:06:20.849> of

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
that could be useful with a new build of

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.700 
that could be useful with a new build of
this<00:06:21.150> I've<00:06:21.539> been<00:06:21.690> looking<00:06:21.750> around<00:06:22.080> trying<00:06:22.529> to

what I'm trying to do here but I'm sure
there's<00:06:25.979> some<00:06:26.129> of<00:06:26.219> their<00:06:26.310> stuff<00:06:26.430> that<00:06:26.789> I

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:26.819 
there's some of their stuff that I

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.430 
there's some of their stuff that I
haven't<00:06:27.479> seen<00:06:27.629> that<00:06:27.690> could<00:06:27.960> be<00:06:28.080> really<00:06:28.259> useful

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
haven't seen that could be really useful
