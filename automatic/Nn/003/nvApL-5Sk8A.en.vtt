this<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.040> was<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> pitch<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:42.180> was<00:00:42.420> kind

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
this so this was a pitch that was kind

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.049 
this so this was a pitch that was kind
of<00:00:42.809> low<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:44.010> was<00:00:44.160> kind<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.370> down<00:00:44.520> right<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
of low that was kind of down right the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.220 
of low that was kind of down right the
picture<00:00:45.300> did<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> great<00:00:45.660> job<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.840> keeping<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
picture did a great job of keeping the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.760 
picture did a great job of keeping the
ball<00:00:46.350> down<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.829> we'll<00:00:47.789> see<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.059> Matt<00:00:48.770> was

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
ball down and we'll see that Matt was

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.619 
ball down and we'll see that Matt was
very<00:00:50.219> very<00:00:50.430> aggressive<00:00:50.940> right<00:00:51.090> at<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.420> pitch

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
very very aggressive right at this pitch

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.650 
very very aggressive right at this pitch
I<00:00:52.500> think<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.129> pitch<00:00:53.340> was<00:00:53.520> right<00:00:54.059> between<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
I think this pitch was right between the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.110 
I think this pitch was right between the
second<00:00:55.020> baseman<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.280> actual<00:00:56.579> second

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
second baseman and the actual second

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.840 
second baseman and the actual second
base<00:00:57.239> bag<00:00:57.449> there's<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.989> line<00:00:58.199> drive<00:00:58.230> shot<00:00:58.850> what

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
base bag there's a line drive shot what

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.790 
base bag there's a line drive shot what
I<00:01:00.030> really<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.690> about<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:01.079> situation<00:01:01.260> or

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
enough so that he was still able to put

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.670 
enough so that he was still able to put
a<00:01:23.790> great<00:01:24.240> swing<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.869> was<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> 20<00:01:25.290> swing

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
a great swing on it this was a 20 swing

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.710 
a great swing on it this was a 20 swing
made<00:01:25.950> meaning<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.119> was<00:01:27.330> an<00:01:27.420> aggressive

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
made meaning that this was an aggressive

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.719 
made meaning that this was an aggressive
hack<00:01:28.049> right<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> two-hour<00:01:29.250> swing<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.610> an

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
hack right a two-hour swing is an

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.859 
hack right a two-hour swing is an
aggressive<00:01:30.000> hack<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:31.430> it's<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> ball<00:01:32.869> comes

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
aggressive hack so it's the ball comes

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.770 
aggressive hack so it's the ball comes
out<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.200> over<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> plate<00:01:34.850> but<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.390> was<00:01:36.509> deep

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
out and over the plate but it was deep

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.090 
out and over the plate but it was deep
enough<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.350> was<00:01:37.470> able<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.799> drive<00:01:38.070> it

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
enough so that it was able to drive it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.670 
enough so that it was able to drive it
know<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> lot<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.850> what<00:01:39.090> you'll<00:01:39.210> see<00:01:39.680> especially

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.740 
know a lot of what you'll see especially
with<00:01:40.829> younger<00:01:41.100> guys<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.360> they'll<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.720> a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
with younger guys is that they'll get a

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.020 
with younger guys is that they'll get a
little<00:01:43.170> bit<00:01:43.320> too<00:01:43.560> antsy<00:01:43.979> where<00:01:44.729> they<00:01:44.850> know

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
little bit too antsy where they know

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.719 
little bit too antsy where they know
that<00:01:45.180> they're<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> hitter's<00:01:45.600> count<00:01:45.720> and

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
that they're in a hitter's count and

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.980 
that they're in a hitter's count and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
then they know that this is a perfect
