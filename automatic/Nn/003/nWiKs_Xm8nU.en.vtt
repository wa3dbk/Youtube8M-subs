when<00:00:15.660> we<00:00:15.750> discovered<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.230> technique<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:17.070> we

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
when we discovered a technique that we

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.890 
when we discovered a technique that we
were<00:00:17.279> able<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.609> use<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.150> solve<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.480> serious

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
currently in foster care we didn't want

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.090 
currently in foster care we didn't want
to<00:00:42.300> get<00:00:42.450> into<00:00:42.570> reenactment<00:00:43.440> or<00:00:43.559> blurring

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
to get into reenactment or blurring

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.139 
to get into reenactment or blurring
their<00:00:44.219> face<00:00:44.489> because<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.879> would<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.059> given

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
their face because that would have given

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.700 
their face because that would have given
a<00:00:45.329> feel<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.840> as<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.260> an<00:00:46.320> episode<00:00:46.500> of

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
a feel like as if it was an episode of

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.850 
a feel like as if it was an episode of
cops<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.629> came<00:00:48.870> up<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.200> technique<00:00:49.680> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
cops so we came up with a technique that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.560 
cops so we came up with a technique that
gives<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.280> impression<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.910> her<00:00:51.059> kids<00:00:51.329> being

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
gives the impression of her kids being

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.840 
gives the impression of her kids being
there<00:00:51.930> without<00:00:52.260> actually<00:00:52.739> including<00:00:53.550> them<00:00:53.670> in

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
there without actually including them in

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.200 
there without actually including them in
the<00:00:53.969> scene<00:00:55.129> we<00:00:56.129> set<00:00:56.309> up<00:00:56.340> shots<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:56.879> props

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the scene we set up shots with props

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.060 
the scene we set up shots with props
that<00:00:57.329> indicated<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> presence<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.800> child

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that indicated the presence of a child

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.160 
that indicated the presence of a child
we<00:00:59.699> then<00:00:59.850> use<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> programming<00:01:00.600> function<00:01:01.050> of

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
we then use the programming function of

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.930 
we then use the programming function of
the<00:01:01.260> slider<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.829> repeat<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> previous<00:01:02.520> shot

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the slider to repeat the previous shot

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.889 
the slider to repeat the previous shot
multiple<00:01:03.420> times

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
multiple times

removing particular props each time
until<00:01:06.150> they<00:01:06.270> were<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.450> gone<00:01:07.880> then<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.060> brought

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
until they were all gone then we brought

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.120 
until they were all gone then we brought
all<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> shots<00:01:09.900> into<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.290> Edit<00:01:10.530> layering<00:01:11.040> and

synching them up by fading in and out we
were<00:01:13.740> able<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.040> make<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> props<00:01:14.640> appear<00:01:15.270> or

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
were able to make the props appear or

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.649 
were able to make the props appear or
disappear<00:01:16.549> to<00:01:17.549> suggest<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> foster<00:01:18.450> child
