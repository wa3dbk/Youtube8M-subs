drink<00:00:30.090> them<00:00:30.269> because<00:00:30.660> i<00:00:30.840> think<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.500> excess

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
drink them because i think that excess

drink them because i think that excess
calories<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:33.050> i<00:00:34.050> think<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.710> there<00:00:34.890> are

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
calories and i think that there are

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.370 
calories and i think that there are
necessary<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.120> most<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.870> them<00:00:36.960> are<00:00:37.050> full<00:00:37.260> of

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
necessary the most of them are full of

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.770 
necessary the most of them are full of
glucose<00:00:37.770> which<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.340> sugar<00:00:39.120> which<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.450> going<00:00:39.719> to

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
glucose which is sugar which is going to

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.650 
glucose which is sugar which is going to
turn<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.170> fat<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.800> i<00:00:41.670> don't<00:00:42.120> believe<00:00:42.600> that

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
turn to fat and i don't believe that

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.440 
turn to fat and i don't believe that
they're<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.440> good<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.129> here<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.030> can<00:00:45.180> you

i<00:00:48.030> don't<00:00:48.450> know<00:00:48.539> but<00:00:48.750> i<00:00:49.170> don't<00:00:49.559> think<00:00:49.680> they're

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
i don't know but i don't think they're

i don't know but i don't think they're
great<00:00:50.280> i<00:00:50.520> think<00:00:50.730> they're<00:00:50.940> well<00:00:51.239> marketed<00:00:51.750> to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
great i think they're well marketed to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.360 
great i think they're well marketed to
make<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.350> believe<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.980> they're<00:00:53.160> good

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
make you believe that they're good

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.939 
make you believe that they're good
because<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> lot<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.320> seeing<00:00:55.829> with

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
because we have a lot of and seeing with

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.279 
because we have a lot of and seeing with
sports<00:00:56.219> stars<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.940> our<00:00:57.000> TV<00:00:57.480> drinking<00:00:57.870> them<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
sports stars on our TV drinking them and

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.500 
sports stars on our TV drinking them and
making<00:00:58.739> us<00:00:58.980> believe<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.370> they're<00:00:59.670> good<00:00:59.879> for

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
making us believe that they're good for

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.039 
making us believe that they're good for
health<00:01:00.780> reasons<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.859> they're<00:01:02.100> good<00:01:02.460> for

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
health reasons but they're good for

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.660 
health reasons but they're good for
creating<00:01:04.049> high<00:01:04.260> burst<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.739> energy<00:01:04.979> for<00:01:05.519> that

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
creating high burst of energy for that

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.490 
creating high burst of energy for that
one<00:01:05.939> off<00:01:06.119> thing<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> football<00:01:07.110> match<00:01:07.260> or

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
one off thing like a football match or

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.600 
one off thing like a football match or
whatever<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.890> that's<00:01:08.040> what<00:01:08.189> they're<00:01:08.369> used

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
whatever and that's what they're used

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.200 
whatever and that's what they're used
for<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.510> we<00:01:10.229> as<00:01:10.619> consumers<00:01:10.970> think<00:01:11.970> that

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
for but we as consumers think that

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.750 
for but we as consumers think that
they're<00:01:12.390> used<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:12.810> every<00:01:13.439> day<00:01:13.650> gym<00:01:14.280> workouts

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
they're used for every day gym workouts

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.219 
they're used for every day gym workouts
and<00:01:15.030> they're<00:01:15.090> not<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.689> that's<00:01:15.930> not<00:01:16.020> what

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
and they're not and that's not what

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.749 
and they're not and that's not what
they're<00:01:16.380> designed<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:17.220> they're<00:01:17.400> kind<00:01:17.640> of

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
they're designed for but they're kind of

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.609 
they're designed for but they're kind of
try<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.600> market<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.229> way<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.409> i<00:01:19.530> think

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
try and market it that way so i think

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.249 
try and market it that way so i think
it's<00:01:19.770> bad<00:01:20.009> luck<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.400> peasant<00:01:20.880> yeah<00:01:21.360> pretty

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it's bad luck and peasant yeah pretty

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.460 
it's bad luck and peasant yeah pretty
pretty<00:01:22.650> spot<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.090> really<00:01:24.090> i<00:01:24.119> agree<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:25.259> me

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
pretty spot on really i agree with me

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.410 
pretty spot on really i agree with me
sports<00:01:26.460> drinks<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:26.850> me<00:01:26.970> as<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> rule<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.360> thumb

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
sports drinks for me as a rule of thumb

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.210 
sports drinks for me as a rule of thumb
if<00:01:27.840> any<00:01:28.080> exercise<00:01:28.530> you're<00:01:28.710> doing<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:28.979> under

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
if any exercise you're doing is under

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.310 
if any exercise you're doing is under
there<00:01:29.700> under<00:01:29.880> 60<00:01:30.450> minutes<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.960> don't<00:01:31.170> need<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
there under 60 minutes you don't need a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.289 
there under 60 minutes you don't need a
sport<00:01:31.650> drink<00:01:31.890> if<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.189> over<00:01:32.400> 60<00:01:32.729> minutes<00:01:33.000> yeah

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
sport drink if it's over 60 minutes yeah

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.240 
sport drink if it's over 60 minutes yeah
potentially<00:01:33.509> they<00:01:33.960> serve<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> purpose<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
potentially they serve a purpose but you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.560 
potentially they serve a purpose but you
can<00:01:35.369> get<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.670> from<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> piece<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.150> food<00:01:36.450> so

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
can get that from a piece of food so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.640 
can get that from a piece of food so
like<00:01:36.689> michelle<00:01:36.990> said<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.439> football

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
like michelle said if it's a football

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.260 
like michelle said if it's a football
match<00:01:37.979> there's<00:01:38.610> nothing<00:01:38.820> stopping<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.180> have

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
match there's nothing stopping you have

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.120 
match there's nothing stopping you have
an<00:01:39.360> orange<00:01:39.689> at<00:01:39.780> halftime<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> 90

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
an orange at halftime if it's like a 90

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.950 
an orange at halftime if it's like a 90
minute<00:01:41.280> game<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.270> your<00:01:42.299> goal<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.600> body

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
minute game but if your goal is body
