00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.040
 Halli hello and welcome to 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.980
 a new round playstation rotz out 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:16.529
 what's the name of her play playstation 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.300
 allstars one more time and I play 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.740
 not online again this time I have 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.060
 just round gambled online and there were 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.230
 the people had the headset on 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.689
 and you can not do that in between 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.890
 Exhibit because who will go online 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.240
 already in the break menu and in the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.410
 you can not load screen 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.690
 switch off and that goes a bit 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.219
 hard on the nuts and that's why I have 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.800
 let that go and just moved now 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.750
 times with the next track with the I 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.940
 not played at all 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:48.530
 you might see the level 1 pull 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:56.809
 us stylish in green no idea 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.809
 players against the sackboy in u- and 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.960
 I play against the bad coal 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.710
 times 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:13.049
 then come let my lord color is 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:16.020
 agree is okay so that's exactly what i do 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:21.600
 then now, and they are playing here 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:24.810
 in loco roco world loco roco I have 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.210
 Incidentally, never gambled but probably quite 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.720
 to have been funny is already 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:35.189
 a bit older I mean yes times 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.220
 I have to look new again 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.070
 to find out the character but that we 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.060
 Do not think so the topic 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.320
 In the end , you only work up anyway 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.060
 the buttons i'm not anymore 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.840
 decide 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.890
 that's really old okay that has me 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.890
 from the colors 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.810
 ok then there is a bit on the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.009
 ask what are you all doing in the water 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.009
 By the way, you can not fight 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.330
 Of course, the good Herr Drake has those on 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.650
 or what I'm pretty okay with 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.750
 a bit confused with call 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.520
 Of course, one or the other weapon on 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.160
 at the beginning 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:19.500
 and of course the band still has me 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.420
 just once ripped off with the stream 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.050
 biggest nonsense of the story 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.050
 provoziere 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.800
 section also already level 1 ok ok 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.030
 By the way, I have his finishing move 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.810
 not tried it was okay have 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.180
 I did not understand 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.310
 I have to look or maybe use 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:50.980
 I just start from the b2 on 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:52.960
 the fish boy the hottest of the 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.900
 whole old I try so far 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:04.300
 could eat his fat fish 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.980
 It's not nice to get that 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.340
 that I now lean on the thick 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.820
 eat fish 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:16.390
 you can grasp it's just jumping and 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.709
 cover what the hell was that 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.620
 because 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.850
 I want it to come level 2, it's always 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.720
 a little stupid if you like the character 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.440
 not really around yet 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.440
 Now he gets his teeth 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.739
 so level 2 does not even look if I'm okay 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.230
 I think that's something completely new 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.760
 you 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.330
 now changed stage and already 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:47.280
 we have no idea what background 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:58.099
 that seems to be of resistance exactly 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:58.099
 how did I do that right now 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.400
 no idea 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.790
 We definitely have minigun 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.360
 but I do not know where, so determined 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.360
 right there is 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.600
 This is exactly what the sector has taken again 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.880
 to let 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.330
 young boy level 1 but I 'm on the 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.530
 b2 come now i think everybody has 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.780
 two kills 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.440
 and I need shit at least 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.440
 28 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.910
 that's exactly what the two of them are doing here 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:42.600
 yes, shit , I was right now 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.600
 again a bit can 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.169
 confuse cabbage 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.650
 maybe next time I should 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.460
 Just take part yes have great there 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:02.150
 We lost 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:09.410
 for the first time against computer pride that 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:10.759
 was so bitter so intro you switch 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.770
 actually always on the 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.229
 next level free so on the second 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.520
 level 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.520
 which has passed a bit stupid 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:30.800
 Well you can not do anything 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:32.210
 Well that was not the gameplay and we 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.030
 See you next time if 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:41.449
 it's again hello when it's back 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:43.310
 means exactly great 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.610
 many thanks to look for and have fun 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.610
 Farther
