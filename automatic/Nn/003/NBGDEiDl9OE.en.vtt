00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
hey guys were submit this video about

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.590 
hey guys were submit this video about
the<00:00:12.080> galaxy<00:00:12.530> s5<00:00:12.769> official<00:00:13.309> hands<00:00:13.730> on<00:00:13.879> from<00:00:14.150> MW

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600 
the galaxy s5 official hands on from MW

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.960 
the galaxy s5 official hands on from MW
suit<00:00:14.780> on<00:00:14.959> 14<00:00:15.469> there's<00:00:16.040> some<00:00:16.189> photos<00:00:16.640> that<00:00:16.880> are

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
suit on 14 there's some photos that are

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.470 
suit on 14 there's some photos that are
leaked<00:00:17.300> from<00:00:17.990> that<00:00:18.259> event<00:00:18.950> and<00:00:19.369> even<00:00:20.180> hasn't

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
leaked from that event and even hasn't

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.140 
leaked from that event and even hasn't
just<00:00:20.570> started<00:00:20.930> at<00:00:21.080> the<00:00:21.290> moment<00:00:21.590> it<00:00:21.950> will<00:00:22.220> start

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
just started at the moment it will start

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.460 
just started at the moment it will start
like<00:00:23.570> towards<00:00:24.099> after<00:00:25.099> two<00:00:25.279> hours<00:00:25.310> so<00:00:25.849> at<00:00:26.810> 8pm

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
like towards after two hours so at 8pm

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.920 
like towards after two hours so at 8pm
so<00:00:27.919> but<00:00:28.369> there's<00:00:28.700> a<00:00:28.759> guy<00:00:28.970> who<00:00:29.029> has<00:00:29.450> leaked<00:00:29.779> the

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
so but there's a guy who has leaked the

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.530 
so but there's a guy who has leaked the
galaxy<00:00:30.290> s5<00:00:30.590> official<00:00:30.919> hands<00:00:31.279> on<00:00:31.399> and<00:00:31.730> also<00:00:32.059> he

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
galaxy s5 official hands on and also he

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.130 
galaxy s5 official hands on and also he
is<00:00:33.170> giving<00:00:33.680> us<00:00:33.829> some<00:00:34.250> of<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.640> features<00:00:35.140> pre

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
is giving us some of the features pre

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.950 
is giving us some of the features pre
leaks<00:00:36.410> about<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:36.829> features<00:00:37.010> so<00:00:37.630> perhaps<00:00:38.630> the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
leaks about the features so perhaps the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.139 
leaks about the features so perhaps the
most<00:00:39.079> interesting<00:00:39.410> claim<00:00:40.010> is<00:00:40.219> that<00:00:40.250> galaxy<00:00:40.850> s5

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
most interesting claim is that galaxy s5

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.470 
most interesting claim is that galaxy s5
has<00:00:41.359> a<00:00:42.050> swipe<00:00:42.469> type<00:00:43.309> fingerprint<00:00:44.089> sensor

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
has a swipe type fingerprint sensor

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.900 
has a swipe type fingerprint sensor
embedded<00:00:44.780> into<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.679> home<00:00:46.010> button<00:00:46.250> which<00:00:46.879> will

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
embedded into the home button which will

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.880 
embedded into the home button which will
apparently<00:00:47.480> allow<00:00:47.899> you<00:00:47.960> to<00:00:48.199> make<00:00:48.410> paypal

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
apparently allow you to make paypal

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.889 
apparently allow you to make paypal
payments<00:00:49.519> and<00:00:49.670> also<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.960> galaxy<00:00:51.440> s5<00:00:51.710> is<00:00:51.879> ip67

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
payments and also the galaxy s5 is ip67

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.209 
payments and also the galaxy s5 is ip67
certified<00:00:53.899> meaning<00:00:54.409> its<00:00:54.589> water<00:00:54.920> and

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
certified meaning its water and

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.160 
certified meaning its water and
dustproof<00:00:55.519> just<00:00:56.269> like<00:00:56.390> this<00:00:56.539> one<00:00:56.659> xperia<00:00:56.989> z2

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
dustproof just like this one xperia z2

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.430 
dustproof just like this one xperia z2
the<00:00:57.920> camera<00:00:58.219> is<00:00:58.249> set<00:00:58.519> to<00:00:58.699> be<00:00:58.850> 16<00:00:59.269> megapixel<00:00:59.870> one

the camera is set to be 16 megapixel one

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.529 
the camera is set to be 16 megapixel one
on<00:01:00.679> the<00:01:01.010> back<00:01:01.219> and<00:01:01.460> it's<00:01:01.730> also<00:01:01.940> interesting<00:01:02.239> to

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
on the back and it's also interesting to

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.270 
on the back and it's also interesting to
note<00:01:02.600> that<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.960> phone<00:01:03.170> has<00:01:03.199> gone<00:01:03.710> through

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
note that the phone has gone through

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.700 
note that the phone has gone through
some<00:01:04.489> rather<00:01:04.730> minor<00:01:05.210> but<00:01:05.840> visible<00:01:06.290> design

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
some rather minor but visible design

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.130 
some rather minor but visible design

changes for starters the back has a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.430 
changes for starters the back has a
rather<00:01:09.440> aggressive<00:01:09.890> dotted<00:01:10.700> pattern<00:01:11.170> so<00:01:12.170> no

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
rather aggressive dotted pattern so no

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.920

the screen looks slightly bigger and

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.620 
the screen looks slightly bigger and
also<00:01:25.040> i'm<00:01:25.430> guessing<00:01:25.760> that<00:01:25.790> default<00:01:26.240> proofing

through some flattening and folders are
definitely<00:01:38.450> different<00:01:38.690> than<00:01:39.080> what<00:01:39.950> we<00:01:40.130> used

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
definitely different than what we used

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.690 
definitely different than what we used

s5<00:01:54.980> this<00:01:55.250> feature<00:01:55.460> will<00:01:56.000> apparently<00:01:56.450> allow

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
s5 this feature will apparently allow

s5 this feature will apparently allow
you<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:57.080> download<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.950> files<00:01:58.340> over<00:01:58.820> 30<00:01:59.120> can<00:01:59.300> be

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
you to download the files over 30 can be

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.440 
you to download the files over 30 can be
faster<00:01:59.930> by<00:02:00.350> using<00:02:00.530> both<00:02:00.920> LTE<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.970> Wi-Fi

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
faster by using both LTE and Wi-Fi

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.310 
faster by using both LTE and Wi-Fi
network<00:02:03.140> so<00:02:03.800> these<00:02:04.250> are<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.540> photos<00:02:05.540> that<00:02:05.750> are

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
network so these are the photos that are

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.710 
network so these are the photos that are
pre<00:02:07.190> leaked<00:02:07.520> because<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.209> know<00:02:08.330> we<00:02:08.539> will

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
pre leaked because you know we will

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.229 
pre leaked because you know we will
definitely<00:02:09.229> can<00:02:09.470> see<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:10.069> galaxy<00:02:10.429> s5<00:02:10.700> two

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
definitely can see the galaxy s5 two

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.640 
definitely can see the galaxy s5 two
