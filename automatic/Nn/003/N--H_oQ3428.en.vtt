I have video on that too so once that
Sun<00:01:09.510> put<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.780> outside<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.380> connected<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.070> open

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
Sun put it outside is connected and open

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.330 
Sun put it outside is connected and open
up<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.360> command<00:01:12.630> prompt<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.470> your<00:01:13.860> computer

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:26.420 

adjust<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.670> camera<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:20.420> we'll<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:25.369> about<00:01:26.369> a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
adjust a camera and we'll do about a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.460 
adjust a camera and we'll do about a
command<00:01:26.729> problem<00:01:27.060> by<00:01:27.150> typing<00:01:27.630> CMD<00:01:27.869> right

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
command problem by typing CMD right

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.749 
command problem by typing CMD right
there<00:01:28.909> enter<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.710> let<00:01:31.710> me<00:01:31.829> zoom<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.579> this

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
there enter and let me zoom in to this

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.510 
there enter and let me zoom in to this
command<00:01:33.600> prompt<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.110> you'll<00:01:34.950> probably<00:01:35.280> want

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
command prompt and you'll probably want

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.280 
command prompt and you'll probably want
to<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.909> windows<00:01:36.240> i<00:01:36.420> find<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.840> simpler

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.520 

will<00:01:40.290> do<00:01:40.939> CD<00:01:41.939> /<00:01:42.509> one<00:01:43.500> click<00:01:44.460> root<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.530> then

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
will do CD / one click root and then

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.889 
will do CD / one click root and then
we're<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:46.740> going<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> do<00:01:47.310> run<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.570> that's<00:01:48.630> it

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
we're just going to do run and that's it

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.929 
we're just going to do run and that's it
actually<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.740> should<00:01:49.799> work<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.250> OSX<00:01:50.759> and

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
actually this should work on OSX and

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.929 
actually this should work on OSX and
everything<00:01:51.450> else<00:01:51.630> run<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.770> then<00:01:53.280> hit<00:01:53.610> another

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
everything else run and then hit another

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.030 
everything else run and then hit another
key<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.240> continue<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.530> will<00:01:55.740> basically

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
key to continue and this will basically

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.709 
key to continue and this will basically
root<00:01:56.729> your<00:01:57.240> phone<00:01:58.159> if<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.280> get<00:01:59.399> errors<00:01:59.719> you're

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
root your phone if you get errors you're

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.539 
root your phone if you get errors you're
probably<00:02:00.930> uh<00:02:01.079> don't<00:02:01.979> have<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.189> right<00:02:02.340> drivers

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
probably uh don't have the right drivers

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.700 
probably uh don't have the right drivers
installed<00:02:04.969> so<00:02:05.969> now<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.299> routing<00:02:06.659> let<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.530> do

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
installed so now it's routing let it do

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.589 
installed so now it's routing let it do
its<00:02:07.920> thing<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:08.819> going<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.000> install<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
its thing and it's going to install the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.309 
its thing and it's going to install the
latest<00:02:11.330> what<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> clock<00:02:12.840> mark<00:02:13.080> three

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
latest what is the clock mark three

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.030 
latest what is the clock mark three
point<00:02:13.560> oh

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
point oh

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.309 
point oh
and<00:02:14.219> another<00:02:15.180> thing<00:02:15.299> is<00:02:15.540> if<00:02:15.659> you<00:02:15.810> root<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.260> a

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
and another thing is if you root it a

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.440 
and another thing is if you root it a
long<00:02:16.590> time<00:02:16.620> ago<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:17.730> probably<00:02:18.000> have<00:02:18.239> like

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
long time ago and you probably have like

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.190 
long time ago and you probably have like
 my<00:02:19.219> recovery<00:02:20.219> 2.5<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.780> way<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:21.959> can
