was how impressed it was a scrappy was
scrappy<00:00:23.070> affair<00:00:23.160> but<00:00:23.519> when<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.730> place<00:00:24.029> toca

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
scrappy affair but when you place toca

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.759 
scrappy affair but when you place toca
it's<00:00:24.689> always<00:00:24.960> like<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.500> know<00:00:25.529> they<00:00:25.740> make

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
it's always like that you know they make

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.950 
it's always like that you know they make
it<00:00:26.010> very<00:00:26.130> difficult<00:00:26.310> they<00:00:27.060> defend<00:00:27.390> very<00:00:27.660> deep

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
it very difficult they defend very deep

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.750 
it very difficult they defend very deep
you<00:00:28.260> know<00:00:28.289> with<00:00:28.680> two<00:00:29.099> banks<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.490> four<00:00:29.730> and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
you know with two banks of four and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.179 
you know with two banks of four and
doesn't<00:00:30.570> really<00:00:30.720> change<00:00:31.019> much<00:00:31.679> if<00:00:31.920> they<00:00:32.070> have

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
doesn't really change much if they have

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.760 
doesn't really change much if they have
em<00:00:32.340> unless<00:00:32.520> they<00:00:33.090> still<00:00:33.300> after<00:00:33.450> eight<00:00:34.410> players

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
em unless they still after eight players

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.830 
em unless they still after eight players
and<00:00:35.130> then<00:00:35.309> behind<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.210> ball<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.690> always

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
and then behind the ball so it's always

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.690 
and then behind the ball so it's always
difficult<00:00:37.110> how<00:00:37.770> much<00:00:37.950> did<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> game<00:00:38.309> change

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
difficult how much did the game change

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.250 
difficult how much did the game change
with<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> sending<00:00:39.390> off<00:00:39.510> because<00:00:39.899> obviously

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
with the sending off because obviously

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.569 
with the sending off because obviously
Stoke<00:00:40.649> down<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.890> ten<00:00:41.070> men<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.370> then

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
Stoke down to ten men but you then

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.340 
Stoke down to ten men but you then
brought<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:41.910> one<00:00:42.120> matter<00:00:42.360> who<00:00:42.899> turned<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.260> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
brought on one matter who turned in a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.260 
brought on one matter who turned in a
man-of-the-match<00:00:43.530> performance<00:00:43.969> yeah<00:00:44.969> that's

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
man-of-the-match performance yeah that's

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.760 
man-of-the-match performance yeah that's
what<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.570> idea<00:00:45.809> there<00:00:46.050> was<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.350> idea<00:00:46.590> with

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
what the idea there was the idea with

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.430 
what the idea there was the idea with
who<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.280> matter<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:47.879> they<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:48.960> had<00:00:49.110> probably

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
who I matter but they just had probably

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.639 
who I matter but they just had probably
a<00:00:49.530> bit<00:00:49.710> less<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.850> transition<00:00:51.649> opportunity

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
a bit less of a transition opportunity

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.740 
a bit less of a transition opportunity
with<00:00:52.829> one<00:00:53.010> man<00:00:53.160> les<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.000> said<00:00:54.270> defending
