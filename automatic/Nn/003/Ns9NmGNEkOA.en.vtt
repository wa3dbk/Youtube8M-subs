play it really slow for you it was a
little<00:03:45.040> bit<00:03:45.160> complicated<00:03:45.280> pick<00:03:45.819> up<00:03:45.970> just

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
little bit complicated pick up just

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.290 
little bit complicated pick up just
those<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:47.490> switching<00:03:48.490> is<00:03:48.700> kind<00:03:49.000> of<00:03:49.060> weird<00:03:49.209> in

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
those that switching is kind of weird in

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.610 
those that switching is kind of weird in
the<00:03:49.360> chorus<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:49.810> so<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.020> kind<00:03:50.170> of<00:03:50.200> screws<00:03:50.410> me

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
the chorus and so it kind of screws me

00:03:50.620 --> 00:04:10.570 
the chorus and so it kind of screws me
up<00:03:50.709> too<00:03:50.890> but<00:03:51.550> so<00:03:52.150> we<00:03:52.240> go
