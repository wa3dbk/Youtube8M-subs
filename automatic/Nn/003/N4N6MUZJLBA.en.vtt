coffees<00:00:52.860> over<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> years<00:00:53.699> when<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.329> was<00:00:54.539> 11<00:00:55.050> I

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
coffees over the years when I was 11 I

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.010 
coffees over the years when I was 11 I
decided<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.340> wanted<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.730> try<00:00:57.000> archery

don't<00:00:58.680> know<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.039> couple<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.430> years<00:00:59.579> later<00:00:59.699> I

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
don't know a couple of years later I

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.229 
don't know a couple of years later I
decided<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:01.440> wasn't<00:01:01.800> violent<00:01:02.219> enough<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.879> I

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
decided that wasn't violent enough so I

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.719 
decided that wasn't violent enough so I
wanted<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.780> try<00:01:03.989> fencing<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.100> did<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.460> for

four<00:01:05.939> years<00:01:06.240> when<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.080> got<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.560> college<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.010> guess

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
four years when I got to college I guess

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.120 
four years when I got to college I guess
my<00:01:08.880> violent<00:01:09.360> tendencies<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:10.200> increased<00:01:10.770> so

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
my violent tendencies just increased so
