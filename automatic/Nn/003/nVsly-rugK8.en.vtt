00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
kind of a bike that transcends three

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.600 
kind of a bike that transcends three
different<00:00:49.780> categories<00:00:49.900> XE<00:00:50.770> trail<00:00:51.340> and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
different categories XE trail and

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.110 
different categories XE trail and
all-mountain<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:54.460> you<00:00:54.520> guys<00:00:54.640> agree<00:00:54.790> with<00:00:55.000> me

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
all-mountain do you guys agree with me

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.270 
all-mountain do you guys agree with me
with<00:00:55.210> that<00:00:55.390> I<00:00:55.660> think<00:00:55.870> we<00:00:55.989> even<00:00:56.260> thought<00:00:56.590> it<00:00:56.739> had

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
with that I think we even thought it had

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.280 
with that I think we even thought it had
transcends<00:00:58.210> a<00:00:58.269> few<00:00:58.449> more<00:00:58.629> categories

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
transcends a few more categories

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.579 
transcends a few more categories
yeah<00:00:59.379> Kyle's<00:01:00.190> straight<00:01:00.610> can<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.300> call<00:01:01.589> doing

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
yeah Kyle's straight can the call doing

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.430 
yeah Kyle's straight can the call doing
a<00:01:02.620> slope<00:01:03.430> style<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:03.879> do<00:01:03.940> a<00:01:03.970> slalom<00:01:04.300> on<00:01:04.570> it<00:01:04.780> it's

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
a slope style and do a slalom on it it's

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.300 
a slope style and do a slalom on it it's
it's<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.370> very<00:01:06.550> versatile<00:01:07.300> bike<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:08.650> what<00:01:09.159> is

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
it's a very versatile bike it's what is

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.920 
it's a very versatile bike it's what is
it<00:01:09.340> makes<00:01:09.729> it<00:01:09.880> better<00:01:10.060> stop<00:01:10.330> what<00:01:10.600> is<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:10.840> that

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
it makes it better stop what is it that

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.810 
it makes it better stop what is it that
makes<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:11.260> so<00:01:11.290> great<00:01:11.620> I<00:01:12.010> think<00:01:12.100> that's<00:01:12.430> that's

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
makes you so great I think that's that's

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.810 
makes you so great I think that's that's
what<00:01:13.060> yeah<00:01:13.570> I<00:01:13.870> think<00:01:14.740> it<00:01:14.979> has<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.280> do<00:01:15.430> with<00:01:15.460> the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
what yeah I think it has to do with the

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.289 
what yeah I think it has to do with the
the<00:01:16.270> stoutness<00:01:16.720> of<00:01:17.080> the<00:01:17.200> frame<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
the stoutness of the frame and the the

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.750 
the stoutness of the frame and the the
angles<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.380> head<00:01:20.890> angle<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.220> sixty<00:01:21.520> six

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
angles the the head angle is sixty six

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.060 
angles the the head angle is sixty six
and<00:01:21.820> a<00:01:21.909> half<00:01:22.060> degrees<00:01:22.479> already<00:01:23.350> Seska<00:01:23.830> is<00:01:23.920> that

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
and a half degrees already Seska is that

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.620 
and a half degrees already Seska is that
kind<00:01:24.310> of<00:01:24.369> geometry<00:01:24.520> we're<00:01:24.880> saying<00:01:25.060> fit<00:01:25.299> for

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
kind of geometry we're saying fit for

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.660 
kind of geometry we're saying fit for
this<00:01:25.780> category<00:01:26.470> were<00:01:26.650> in<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:26.979> trail<00:01:27.250> but<00:01:27.490> it's

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
this category were in the trail but it's

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.960 
this category were in the trail but it's
quite<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:27.880> radical<00:01:28.180> geometry<00:01:29.790> category<00:01:30.790> and<00:01:30.910> I

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
quite a radical geometry category and I

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.990 
quite a radical geometry category and I
think<00:01:31.180> it's<00:01:31.300> what<00:01:31.480> Braves<00:01:31.840> of<00:01:32.140> GT<00:01:32.530> of<00:01:32.680> dumbness

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
think it's what Braves of GT of dumbness

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.220 
think it's what Braves of GT of dumbness
it's<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.150> risk<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:36.700> one<00:01:36.880> of<00:01:36.940> those<00:01:37.060> bikes<00:01:37.240> that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
it's a risk it's one of those bikes that

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.670 
it's a risk it's one of those bikes that
is<00:01:38.500> not<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:40.360> not<00:01:40.540> for<00:01:40.720> everyone<00:01:40.930> I<00:01:41.320> think

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
is not it's not for everyone I think

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.830 
is not it's not for everyone I think
everyone<00:01:42.580> could<00:01:43.030> find<00:01:43.300> something<00:01:43.630> they<00:01:43.720> would

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
everyone could find something they would

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.290 
everyone could find something they would
love<00:01:44.020> in<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.860> think<00:01:44.920> it's<00:01:45.310> it's<00:01:45.670> for<00:01:46.060> and

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
love in it and I think it's it's for and

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.230 
love in it and I think it's it's for and
this<00:01:46.450> I'm<00:01:46.720> gonna<00:01:47.380> total<00:01:48.190> stroke<00:01:48.910> of<00:01:49.000> my<00:01:49.090> ego

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
this I'm gonna total stroke of my ego

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.330 
this I'm gonna total stroke of my ego
here<00:01:49.600> because<00:01:50.050> I<00:01:50.170> loved<00:01:50.380> it<00:01:50.470> too<00:01:50.530> but<00:01:50.890> it's<00:01:51.040> for

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
here because I loved it too but it's for

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.550 
here because I loved it too but it's for
a<00:01:51.670> more<00:01:52.450> refined<00:01:53.380> maybe<00:01:54.310> more<00:01:55.440> maybe<00:01:56.440> more

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
a more refined maybe more maybe more

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.470 
a more refined maybe more maybe more
technically<00:01:57.160> adept<00:01:57.400> rider<00:01:57.730> somebody<00:01:58.240> who

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
technically adept rider somebody who

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.750 
technically adept rider somebody who
isn't<00:01:59.200> looking<00:01:59.590> for<00:01:59.800> something<00:02:00.190> that's<00:02:00.430> six

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
isn't looking for something that's six

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.510 
isn't looking for something that's six
and<00:02:00.880> six<00:02:01.180> just<00:02:02.020> so<00:02:02.110> that<00:02:02.260> they<00:02:02.380> can<00:02:02.440> plow<00:02:03.160> over

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
and six just so that they can plow over

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.550 
and six just so that they can plow over
fields<00:02:03.820> or<00:02:03.910> rocks<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.450> mean<00:02:05.020> we<00:02:05.170> even<00:02:05.290> found

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
fields or rocks I mean we even found

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.440 
fields or rocks I mean we even found
that<00:02:05.740> it<00:02:06.010> was<00:02:06.550> a<00:02:06.580> little<00:02:07.000> more<00:02:07.120> likely<00:02:07.330> to

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
that it was a little more likely to

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.199 
that it was a little more likely to
pinch<00:02:07.720> flat<00:02:07.960> if<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.289> try<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.560> do<00:02:08.769> that<00:02:09.209> it's

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
pinch flat if you try and do that it's

sure this is definitely in my top three

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.400 
sure this is definitely in my top three
of<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.829> tryout<00:04:19.190> category<00:04:19.609> and<00:04:19.910> it's<00:04:20.870> still<00:04:21.290> my

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
of the tryout category and it's still my

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.629 
of the tryout category and it's still my
hot<00:04:21.590> perhaps<00:04:21.979> first<00:04:22.310> rise<00:04:23.949> top<00:04:24.949> three<00:04:25.310> or<00:04:25.430> four

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.950 
hot perhaps first rise top three or four
it<00:04:25.790> depends<00:04:26.120> on<00:04:26.210> what<00:04:26.389> your<00:04:26.570> what<00:04:26.840> your

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.770 
writing before I think if we're the fact
that<00:04:29.840> it<00:04:30.020> spans<00:04:30.620> categories<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.760> it's<00:04:32.690> a

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
that it spans categories and it's a
