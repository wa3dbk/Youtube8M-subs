00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:08.580
 and I realized that God had given me that 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.790
 back 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.790
 Imbalzano 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.770
 now there is 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.080
 I told him 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:34.970
 a dream was not to make a 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.780
 pilgrimage but inevitable to stop 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.650
 here on the point of impact where in 94 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.290
 ayrton senna 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.530
 if he goes away, I always have a vocation 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.900
 asked this death many times 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.710
 shaken the world by the same the word is 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.290
 served something 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.090
 but it was a big shock for the whole 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.489
 world of formula 1 that also because 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.019
 there was a widespread belief that by now 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.780
 were reached the levels of 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.800
 very high security so no 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.979
 pilot serves more dead on a track e 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.540
 these tragic events of 94 have been 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.970
 a rude awakening of a reality 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.430
 different and certainly have 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.020
 sensitized everyone to elevate 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.360
 further security levels 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.610
 so the machines are deeply 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.580
 change the cars today are 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.140
 decidedly safer than the 94 of 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.700
 all the circuits have made 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.780
 changes to increase levels of 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.250
 safety 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.170
 today I believe that formula 1 is 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.780
 actually a lot safer than three 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:47.090
 years ago at what point the process seems 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:53.149
 which says stefano tura commesse is not 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:55.310
 left the track at that point if not for 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:00.170
 but the problem can be a problem 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.939
 It was given by so many components that and we 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.859
 I can tell you one thing he will answer 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.420
 after almost a month since the beginning of 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:07.189
 imola protests the words of the former 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.810
 Formula 1 driver Pierluigi Martini 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.720
 that at the time in the grand prix of san 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.560
 marine of 94 was driving a minardi 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.390
 undoubtedly constitute the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.520
 most important testimony heard in 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.440
 aula martini connects but above all 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.090
 Ayrton Senna's friend did not want to 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.590
 unbalance the possible causes 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.600
 of the accident that led to the death 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.980
 of the Brazilian driver in correspondence 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.569
 of the tambourine curve 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.970
 but after seeing the images of the 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.240
 Schumacher's camera car said Jean 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.910
 has changed trajectory 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:40.300
 point of where we get to the point 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.550
 where there was virtually quell the 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.530
 asphalt roughness and by the way 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.670
 of the asphalt valley in that 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.590
 martini runway recalled 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.190
 like a few weeks before the gran 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.200
 prize 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.910
 some pilots including protected crest e 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.770
 good to complain to the manager of 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.330
 giorgio circuit for those 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.220
 harshness that made it difficult 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.050
 cornering machine control this 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.820
 circumstance confirmed by the images 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.170
 recorded by a video amateur is 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.520
 become one of the warhorses 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.320
 of the defense william 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.240
 investigators said 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.340
 oresties, legal dominations of the series 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.990
 English were incomplete partial 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.330
 especially regarding the conditions 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.500
 of the track but the defender of poggi not 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.510
 agree 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.580
 the williams defense understandably 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.780
 try to highlight those that 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:28.150
 may have been circumstances 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.370
 concause or that can be held o 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.610
 they would like to be considered such not 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.180
 I believe that from a substantive point of view 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.890
 there is no conclusion 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.180
 objective that can be treated in 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.560
 this set 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.170
 meanwhile the process becomes multimedia 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.180
 three different frequencies of the accident of 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.770
 steep marenna pictures from the camera car 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.110
 of scene from that of schumacher and to the 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.550
 rai room at the tambourine curve 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.680
 have been digitized in order to 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.540
 allow dynamic synchronization 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.100
 of video frames integrated with i 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.570
 telemetry data that the machine 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.520
 transmits to the pits 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.260
 the software was created by 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.940
 scientific visualization laboratory 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.040
 of the bologna cineca at the request of 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.140
 public prosecutor maurizio passarini ed 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.910
 has become an act of the process but 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.130
 yet he gets an answer to those to 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.630
 main it is right to do a process for 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.239
 the death of a Formula 1 driver 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:20.020
 during a grand prize go too far 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.760
 long on a misfortune that is part of the 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.900
 I think that's our job 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.000
 that yes yes we all want the truth 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.160
 if the process has been decided to do so e 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.630
 this must lead to a truth and 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.790
 we are all doing the maximum for 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.410
 get it right as it shows 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.180
 worried about this grand prize 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.819
 especially given the accidents of the 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:44.449
 office tests 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:49.699
 emma was after the ruffian incident 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:51.169
 berger and I saw him crying like a pit 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.830
 lane pit lane we make from imola 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.830
