their national team that that should be

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.020 
their national team that that should be
it<00:02:35.830> but<00:02:35.950> yeah<00:02:36.069> what<00:02:36.310> we're<00:02:36.459> seeing<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.730> up<00:02:36.849> from

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
the foreign influx of all the teams

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.860

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
actually pushed down the plane time for

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.039 
actually pushed down the plane time for
the<00:02:42.430> english-born<00:02:42.940> players<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:43.750> that's<00:02:43.900> hurt

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
the english-born players so that's hurt

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.180 
the english-born players so that's hurt
the<00:02:44.140> national<00:02:44.500> team<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.650> little<00:02:44.799> bit<00:02:44.920> they<00:02:45.069> have

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
the national team a little bit they have

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.100 
the national team a little bit they have
this<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.519> obviously<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.180> media<00:02:46.420> scrutiny<00:02:46.750> is

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
this and obviously the media scrutiny is

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.740 
this and obviously the media scrutiny is
second<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.590> none<00:02:47.620> but<00:02:47.799> i'm<00:02:48.700> not<00:02:48.910> against<00:02:49.630> this

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
second to none but i'm not against this

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.970 
second to none but i'm not against this
i<00:02:49.900> think<00:02:49.959> they<00:02:50.140> got<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.319> chance<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.799> i<00:02:50.860> had<00:02:50.950> a

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
i think they got a chance and i had a

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.440 
i think they got a chance and i had a
group<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.250> death<00:02:51.430> but<00:02:51.610> they've<00:02:52.030> got<00:02:52.239> some

III think like this is that's a team

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:12.809 
III think like this is that's a team
that<00:04:11.560> with<00:04:11.709> Balotelli<00:04:12.040> as<00:04:12.370> a<00:04:12.400> star<00:04:12.669> player

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
that with Balotelli as a star player

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.280 
that with Balotelli as a star player
could<00:04:13.359> get<00:04:13.510> through<00:04:13.690> but<00:04:13.900> I'm<00:04:13.989> with<00:04:14.109> you
