first thing you want to do with with
your<00:00:23.580> preservative<00:00:24.119> obviously<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.660> open<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
your preservative obviously you open the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.259 
your preservative obviously you open the
container<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.769> then<00:00:26.369> I'm<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.820> use<00:00:27.240> a

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
container and then I'm going to use a

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.839 
container and then I'm going to use a
drill<00:00:27.960> with<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.289> paddle<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.890> mix<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.580> real

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
drill with a paddle to mix it up real

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.229 
drill with a paddle to mix it up real
good<00:00:30.890> after<00:00:31.890> mixing<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.340> up<00:00:32.460> then<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.000> want<00:00:33.120> to

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
good after mixing it up then you want to

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.020 
good after mixing it up then you want to
pour<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.570> through<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:34.350> fine<00:00:34.980> mesh<00:00:35.030> strainer

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
pour it through a fine mesh strainer

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.389 
pour it through a fine mesh strainer
what<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.930> does<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:37.860> filters<00:00:38.250> out

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
what this does is this just filters out

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.100 
what this does is this just filters out
any<00:00:38.430> solids<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:40.140> might<00:00:40.790> become<00:00:41.790> clogging<00:00:42.450> to

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
any solids that might become clogging to

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.049 
any solids that might become clogging to
your<00:00:43.500> pump<00:00:43.890> garden<00:00:44.280> sprayer<00:00:44.610> which<00:00:44.850> we're

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
your pump garden sprayer which we're

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.170 
your pump garden sprayer which we're
then<00:00:45.210> going<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.510> pump<00:00:45.840> onto<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.100> floor<00:00:47.460> mostly

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
then going to pump onto the floor mostly

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.510 
then going to pump onto the floor mostly
the<00:00:48.930> reason<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.289> use<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.469> pump<00:00:49.800> garden<00:00:50.160> sprayer

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the reason you use a pump garden sprayer

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.479 
the reason you use a pump garden sprayer
is<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.899> enables<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> lot<00:00:53.430> of

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
is that it enables you to get a lot of

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.250 
is that it enables you to get a lot of
product<00:00:53.910> down<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.750> hurry

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
product down in a hurry

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.209 
product down in a hurry
also<00:00:56.190> using<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.180> pump<00:00:57.390> garden<00:00:57.780> sprayer<00:00:58.219> will

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
also using the pump garden sprayer will

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.520 
also using the pump garden sprayer will
enable<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.730> get<00:01:00.359> into<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> nooks<00:01:01.289> and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
enable you to get into the nooks and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.619 
enable you to get into the nooks and
crannies<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> little<00:01:02.340> bit<00:01:02.460> easier<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.210> usually

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
crannies a little bit easier but usually

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.109 
crannies a little bit easier but usually
I<00:01:03.660> first<00:01:04.049> try<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> start<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.430> railings

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
I first try to start with the railings

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.210 
I first try to start with the railings
and<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> balusters<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.710> most<00:01:07.920> tedious

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and the balusters it's the most tedious

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
and the balusters it's the most tedious
part<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.030> while<00:01:09.210> you're<00:01:09.390> fresh<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.780> it's

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
part and while you're fresh and it's

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.500 
part and while you're fresh and it's
early<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.770> you've<00:01:11.430> got<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> lot<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.970> patience

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
early and you've got a lot of patience

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.480 
early and you've got a lot of patience
left<00:01:12.780> still<00:01:13.110> that's<00:01:13.500> when<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.830> want<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.250> in

left still that's when you want to do in

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.270 
left still that's when you want to do in
my<00:01:14.640> opinion<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.990> hardest<00:01:16.380> part<00:01:16.619> how<00:01:17.220> do

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
my opinion the the hardest part how do

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.510 
my opinion the the hardest part how do
you<00:01:17.400> do<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.759> usually<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.750> combination<00:01:19.020> of

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
you do that usually a combination of

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.300 
you do that usually a combination of
brushing<00:01:20.520> or<00:01:20.909> with<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> roller<00:01:22.009> screwed<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
brushing or with a roller screwed on the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.730 
brushing or with a roller screwed on the
end<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.299> handle<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.140> wooden<00:01:25.380> handle

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
end of it of a handle of wooden handle

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.399 
end of it of a handle of wooden handle
for<00:01:25.920> example<00:01:26.400> enables<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.360> roll<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.930> from

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
for example enables you to roll it from

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.520 
for example enables you to roll it from
the<00:01:28.590> pan<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.360> dip<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.810> roller<00:01:31.079> into<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the pan you you dip the roller into the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.960 
the pan you you dip the roller into the
pan<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.100> then<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.220> want<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> make<00:01:32.640> sure<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
pan and then you want to make sure that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.789 
pan and then you want to make sure that
you<00:01:33.090> get<00:01:33.299> all<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.869> sides<00:01:34.140> you're<00:01:34.409> covering

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
you get all the sides you're covering

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.219 
you get all the sides you're covering
for<00:01:35.070> sides<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.610> your<00:01:35.700> balusters<00:01:36.299> your<00:01:36.600> posts

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
for sides of your balusters your posts

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.690 
for sides of your balusters your posts
and<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.400> forth<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.060> then<00:01:39.509> finally<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.320> end

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
and so forth and then finally at the end

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.280 
and so forth and then finally at the end
you<00:01:41.700> want<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.060> apply<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.780> top<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
you want to apply it to the top of the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.520 
you want to apply it to the top of the
handrail<00:01:44.630> after<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.869> around<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.380> doing

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
handrail after going around and doing

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.920 
handrail after going around and doing
most<00:01:47.399> all<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.000> handrails<00:01:48.540> then<00:01:48.810> I

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
most all of the handrails then I

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.690 
most all of the handrails then I
recommend<00:01:49.259> beginning<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> flooring

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
recommend beginning on the flooring

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.819 
recommend beginning on the flooring
starting<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.540> one<00:01:51.960> end<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.350> floor<00:01:52.649> and

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
starting on on one end of the floor and

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.300 
starting on on one end of the floor and
just<00:01:53.549> working<00:01:54.110> with<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.290> grain<00:01:55.560> applying<00:01:56.100> the
