stock prepared to the SI is 22 that's
kind<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.300> why<00:00:51.450> I<00:00:51.480> chose<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.810> also<00:00:52.260> i<00:00:52.290> got<00:00:52.440> the

carpet for cheap online as you can see
it's<00:00:55.860> got<00:00:55.980> yessir<00:00:56.850> intensity<00:00:57.750> at<00:00:58.110> the<00:00:58.200> SI<00:00:58.470> our

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
it's got yessir intensity at the SI our

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.880 
it's got yessir intensity at the SI our
badges<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.490> type<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.720> on<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.110> bed<00:01:01.380> yeah<00:01:01.830> i

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
badges on it type are on a bed yeah i

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.770

think<00:01:02.070> we're<00:01:02.280> going<00:01:02.310> to<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:02.850> much<00:01:03.060> in<00:01:03.240> size<00:01:03.510> in

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
think we're going to get much in size in

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.150 
think we're going to get much in size in
order<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:08.150> see<00:01:09.440> if<00:01:10.440> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.710> see<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.040> about

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
order to see if you can see it's about

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.590 
order to see if you can see it's about
the<00:01:11.280> artistic<00:01:11.700> talents<00:01:12.030> which<00:01:12.210> are<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.540> to

the artistic talents which are going to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.469 
the artistic talents which are going to
be<00:01:12.690> changed<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.130> SI<00:01:14.430> r<00:01:14.550> vtec<00:01:14.820> taillights

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
be changed to the SI r vtec taillights

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.750 
be changed to the SI r vtec taillights
I've<00:01:15.810> actually<00:01:16.050> wanted<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.530> set<00:01:16.830> their<00:01:17.040> things
