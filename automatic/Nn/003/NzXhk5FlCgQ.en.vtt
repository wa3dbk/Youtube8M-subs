00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 good i am from eurosport read yo os 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.460
 I welcome the third part of 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.660
 my experience and my project 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.660
 rereading harry potter 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.100
 I've already made two videos about it 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.780
 that I leave in the playlist 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.309
 so you can see the previous ones in case 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.020
 you want to see them in order or something in the 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.700
 first video about expectations 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.080
 in the second video I talked about the 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.180
 first impressions and in this third 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.029
 video I would like to talk about how rowling 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.130
 build this trip or this introduction 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.750
 to the magical world of harry potter in 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.789
 I would like to talk about how it is 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.960
 the introduction to howard because 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.780
 really in the magical world 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.760
 we know some very basic brushstrokes 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.410
 that simply make us give us a 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.120
 idea that will develop during 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.250
 subsequent books however from 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.229
 hogwarts we know a lot more details 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.120
 because Rowling is determined to build 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.070
 this aura not for the reader to 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.989
 enter where you are 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.820
 living harry ron and hermione and good 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.129
 more people but not good i just rub 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.110
 then what has called me the most 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.850
 attention is the way it goes 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.040
 entering from zero minute in 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.170
 flat there are some houses and the houses go 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.790
 Earning points and you have to honor your 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.320
 house so that they earn points and so 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.510
 take the cup of the houses that if the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.610
 room as the password with the lady 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.229
 fat you have a space where 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.969
 share experiences with the rest of 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.680
 those of your house even if it is and he introduced you 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:17.600
 the dining room that is like everything 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.280
 part is quite marked where the 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.510
 things are told little by little 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.250
 but what do you really get an idea 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.900
 pretty good now let's what what to 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.030
 I liked the way 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.550
 that JK Rowling presents this world of 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.830
 howard are the characters and the classes 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.900
 because you really as a reader do not know 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.660
 what kind of subjects or what kind of 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.369
 books are going to give in howard so there are 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.780
 a couple of chapters where they are used 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.010
 now he played positions where they did 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.390
 secret I do not know what is not counted after 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.650
 they were enchantments where I do not know what 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.210
 So much is then it's like you do 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.800
 an idea more or less of everything that 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.110
 they can do and everything they can 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.490
 teach and it's pretty pretty cool and in 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.990
 As for the characters, more than nothing is 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.940
 with the teachers because they show 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.680
 the way in which harry ron and hermione 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.270
 they see them or maybe it's because it's the first 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.550
 novel and it's more childish but really 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.050
 for example mcgonagall does not look the same in 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.790
 this book that for example in the fourth 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.290
 in the fifth as well as snape or 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.970
 dumbledore are characters that are 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.250
 drawn differently but I 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.110
 I think it 's because it's like more 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.120
 focused on something childish and we're going 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.430
 with all this I mean that jk 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.770
 rowling introduces howard and the universe 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.420
 magical in a fairly leisurely way 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.860
 but very specific at the same time and with 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.080
 small details 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.030
 the symbols that no longer in this novel 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.860
 they have slight importance but in 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.300
 later novels there are even winks or 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.980
 clues of things that will happen in the 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.300
 seventh book therefore a person 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.860
 who has already read the saga or who knows what 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.510
 what will happen to enjoy much more 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.830
 from a reading of this book that a 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.300
 person who does not know it although the 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.010
 person who does not know the saga or 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.110
 movies will equally enjoy because 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.330
 it shows something valuable is like a clue 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.860
 you say me static and it means something away 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.660
 everything is good because what I want to say 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.030
 that JK Rowling introduces into this world 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.709
 masterfully the past everything will be 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.810
 a fourth video that will be the last one where 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.459
 I will talk about my experience in general and 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.780
 I'll do a little review of Harry Potter 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.370
 and the philosopher's stone that this was 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.810
 It also cuts and I do not expect anything 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.400
 is liking this section see you in 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.400
 next videos and see you later 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.970
 do not
