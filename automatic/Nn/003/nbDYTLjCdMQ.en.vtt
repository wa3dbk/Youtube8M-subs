00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.590
 I showed what is like the first part 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.479
 which I had passed the truth that 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.490
 a game that recently released to me 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.560

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.450
 soundtrack maybe not right now 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.170
 you hear too much here as you saw 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.799
 I raised that lever to activate 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.600
 what is the bridge and let's see let's see and 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.989
 I have to grab this if I 'm not wrong 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.479
 because here is one I have quartz two of 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:14.410

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.890
 see in the relics option or by 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.690
 here I see something like your fence but also 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.560
 I have to put here 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.560
 and going up here that happens does not jump then 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.790
 do not 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.700
 then you have to think a little less 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.439
 since that is the modality of this 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.049
 lara croft go let's see when I do this is 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.749

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.920
 here I give you here let's see what happens today what 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:49.670
 happen today 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.430
 then I can lower this one goes down 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.220
 this one goes up this other and I can come 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.830
 towards this side before I will grab here 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.920
