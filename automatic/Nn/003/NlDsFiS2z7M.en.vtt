grip<00:02:02.500> it<00:02:02.530> from<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.890> background<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.610> do<00:02:03.759> that

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
grip it from the background and do that

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.390 
grip it from the background and do that
don't<00:02:04.390> try<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.750> push<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:05.530> hard<00:02:05.740> down<00:02:05.920> and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
don't try and push it hard down and

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:18.309 
don't try and push it hard down and
slide<00:02:06.940> off<00:02:07.150> just<00:02:07.470> lightly

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.369 

okay<00:02:18.829> so<00:02:19.340> get<00:02:19.879> used<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.629> that<00:02:20.750> movement<00:02:21.290> of

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
okay so get used to that movement of

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:29.180 
okay so get used to that movement of
just<00:02:21.530> going

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.010 

and<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:29.820> your<00:02:29.970> thumb<00:02:30.240> if<00:02:30.420> you're<00:02:30.570> looking<00:02:30.900> at

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
and so your thumb if you're looking at

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.800 
and so your thumb if you're looking at
it<00:02:31.170> your<00:02:31.710> thumb<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.280> trying<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.150> get<00:02:33.270> as<00:02:33.390> flat

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
it your thumb is trying to get as flat

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.250 
it your thumb is trying to get as flat
as<00:02:33.960> possible<00:02:34.520> your<00:02:35.520> thumb<00:02:35.820> is<00:02:36.060> not<00:02:36.660> angled<00:02:37.140> up

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
as possible your thumb is not angled up

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.290 
as possible your thumb is not angled up
it's<00:02:37.560> just<00:02:37.650> sort<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.010> angled<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.670> it's<00:02:39.150> not

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
it's just sort of angled and it's not

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.600 
it's just sort of angled and it's not
flat<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.050> it's<00:02:40.200> just<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.530> slightly<00:02:41.100> at<00:02:41.460> a

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
flat you that it's just so slightly at a

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.330 
flat you that it's just so slightly at a
very<00:02:41.940> slight<00:02:42.330> angle<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.050> string<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.560> it's

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
very slight angle on the string and it's

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.930 
very slight angle on the string and it's
going<00:02:44.720> slip<00:02:45.720> slip

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.460 

that's<00:02:50.940> how<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.150> pluck<00:02:51.570> well<00:02:51.990> with<00:02:52.290> your

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
that's how you pluck well with your

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.830 
that's how you pluck well with your
thumb<00:02:52.770> okay<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.940> your<00:02:54.240> other<00:02:54.390> fingers

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
thumb okay and your other fingers

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.260 
thumb okay and your other fingers
basically<00:02:55.440> when<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.770> pluck<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.280> string<00:02:56.580> what

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
basically when you pluck the string what

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.610 
basically when you pluck the string what
they're<00:02:57.510> doing<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:57.960> they're<00:02:58.110> just<00:02:58.170> sort<00:02:58.440> of

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
they're doing is they're just sort of

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.370 
they're doing is they're just sort of
resting<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.730> tips<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.210> your<00:03:00.300> fingers<00:03:00.870> are

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
resting the tips of your fingers are

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.700 
resting the tips of your fingers are
resting<00:03:01.980> on<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.640> string<00:03:02.940> just<00:03:03.710> slightly

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
resting on the string just slightly

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.880 
resting on the string just slightly
under<00:03:06.320> it<00:03:07.320> okay

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
under it okay

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.160 
under it okay
not<00:03:08.130> like<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:09.030> you're<00:03:09.300> not<00:03:09.360> sticking<00:03:10.080> your

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
not like that you're not sticking your

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.930 
not like that you're not sticking your
fingers<00:03:10.620> into<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.430> string<00:03:11.700> you're<00:03:11.820> not

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
fingers into the string you're not

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.910 
fingers into the string you're not
trying<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.210> rip<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.690> strings<00:03:12.960> out<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.770> just

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
trying to rip the strings out you just

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.360 
trying to rip the strings out you just
have<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.280> tips<00:03:14.640> or<00:03:15.450> your<00:03:15.630> fingers<00:03:16.370> just

have the tips or your fingers just
lightly<00:03:17.970> touching<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.600> strings<00:03:18.990> at<00:03:19.230> that

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
lightly touching the strings at that

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.920 
lightly touching the strings at that
sort<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.830> angle<00:03:20.760> where<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.450> know<00:03:21.660> they're<00:03:21.840> not

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
sort of angle where you know they're not

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.100 
sort of angle where you know they're not
straight<00:03:22.290> they<00:03:22.980> just<00:03:23.190> sort<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.750> had<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.780> slight

angle so when your hands resting its

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.960 
angle so when your hands resting its
shape<00:03:27.540> like<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:28.350> know<00:03:28.440> like<00:03:28.709> an<00:03:29.489> octopus

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
shape like that you know like an octopus

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.080 
shape like that you know like an octopus
or<00:03:30.120> something<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:31.070> your<00:03:32.070> fingers<00:03:32.580> are<00:03:32.610> like

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
that so here if you look at this finger

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.410 
that so here if you look at this finger
what<00:03:37.830> it's<00:03:37.950> doing<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.400> when<00:03:38.700> I<00:03:38.730> want<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.180> play

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
what it's doing is when I want to play

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.240 
what it's doing is when I want to play
the<00:03:39.570> string<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.959> don't<00:03:40.380> reach<00:03:40.620> under<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.130> I

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
the string I don't reach under it I

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.160 
the string I don't reach under it I
don't<00:03:41.489> try<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:41.790> pull<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.209> just<00:03:42.420> with<00:03:43.020> the

don't try and pull it I just with the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.110 
don't try and pull it I just with the
tip<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:43.380> my<00:03:43.620> finger<00:03:44.070> just<00:03:44.220> lightly<00:03:44.459> slide<00:03:45.000> off

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
tip of my finger just lightly slide off

you look from the front what's happening

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:04.370 
you look from the front what's happening
is<00:03:52.020> I'm<00:03:52.260> going<00:04:02.540> okay<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.600> do<00:04:03.840> this<00:04:04.019> with<00:04:04.200> your

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
is I'm going okay you do this with your

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
other fingers as well where you're just

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:20.599 
other fingers as well where you're just
sliding<00:04:06.150> off<00:04:07.610> sliding<00:04:08.610> off

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.159 

okay<00:04:21.609> so<00:04:21.669> this<00:04:21.940> is<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:22.150> simple<00:04:22.510> exercise<00:04:22.630> you

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
okay so this is a simple exercise you

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.980 
okay so this is a simple exercise you
can<00:04:23.320> do<00:04:23.590> in<00:04:23.800> order<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.130> just<00:04:24.450> get<00:04:25.450> your<00:04:25.690> hand

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
can do in order to just get your hand

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.100 
can do in order to just get your hand
used<00:04:26.320> to<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.680> mechanics<00:04:27.340> of<00:04:27.550> plucking<00:04:28.360> so

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
used to the mechanics of plucking so

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.590 
used to the mechanics of plucking so
like<00:04:29.730> basically<00:04:30.730> all<00:04:30.940> you<00:04:31.060> need<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.270> do<00:04:31.419> is

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
like basically all you need to do is

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:40.260 
like basically all you need to do is
just<00:04:31.870> with<00:04:32.620> your<00:04:32.740> thumb<00:04:32.980> you<00:04:33.130> go<00:04:33.340> one<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:39.270> just

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
just with your thumb you go one and just

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.320 
just with your thumb you go one and just
get<00:04:40.480> used<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.130> to<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.310> movement<00:04:42.820> of<00:04:43.000> of

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
get used to the to the movement of of

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.010 
get used to the to the movement of of
sliding

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020

your<00:04:48.020> fingers<00:04:48.380> off<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.830> string<00:04:49.100> okay<00:04:49.370> so<00:04:49.430> this

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
your fingers off the string okay so this

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.340 
your fingers off the string okay so this
is<00:04:49.820> a<00:04:49.850> mechanical<00:04:50.090> movement<00:04:50.900> which<00:04:51.050> you're

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
is a mechanical movement which you're

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.200 
is a mechanical movement which you're
you<00:04:51.650> have<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:51.980> train<00:04:52.250> your<00:04:52.370> body<00:04:52.520> to<00:04:52.730> get<00:04:53.000> used

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
you have to train your body to get used

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:02.590 
you have to train your body to get used
to<00:04:53.419> and<00:04:53.630> once<00:04:54.200> you've<00:04:54.440> managed<00:04:54.950> to<00:04:55.040> do<00:04:55.160> that

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.060 

once<00:05:03.600> you're<00:05:03.750> comfortable<00:05:03.960> with<00:05:04.380> just<00:05:04.680> doing

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
once you're comfortable with just doing

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.680 
once you're comfortable with just doing
them<00:05:06.860> sliding<00:05:07.860> what<00:05:08.430> you<00:05:08.550> what<00:05:08.880> I'll<00:05:09.030> do<00:05:09.240> later

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
them sliding what you what I'll do later

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.290 
them sliding what you what I'll do later
on<00:05:10.050> in<00:05:10.260> other<00:05:10.440> videos<00:05:10.560> is<00:05:11.010> I<00:05:11.220> will<00:05:11.760> teach<00:05:12.090> you

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
on in other videos is I will teach you

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.960 
on in other videos is I will teach you
some<00:05:12.600> simple<00:05:12.900> plucking<00:05:13.800> patterns<00:05:14.310> which<00:05:14.940> you

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
some simple plucking patterns which you

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.810 
some simple plucking patterns which you
can<00:05:15.270> then<00:05:15.450> use<00:05:15.750> with<00:05:15.990> chords<00:05:16.410> so<00:05:17.400> that<00:05:17.580> you<00:05:17.670> can

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
can then use with chords so that you can

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:27.579 
can then use with chords so that you can
actually<00:05:17.970> play<00:05:18.330> chords<00:05:18.720> right<00:05:18.930> so

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:27.589 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:30.019 

okay<00:05:28.589> so<00:05:28.649> that<00:05:29.039> you<00:05:29.159> can<00:05:29.369> just<00:05:29.550> you<00:05:29.729> just<00:05:29.849> have

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029 
okay so that you can just you just have

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.519 
okay so that you can just you just have
an<00:05:30.149> extra<00:05:30.389> thing<00:05:30.689> which<00:05:30.839> you<00:05:30.959> can<00:05:31.080> do<00:05:31.259> on<00:05:31.409> the

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:31.529 
an extra thing which you can do on the

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:32.959 
an extra thing which you can do on the
guitar<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.069> I'll<00:05:32.279> try<00:05:32.489> and<00:05:32.610> keep<00:05:32.699> it<00:05:32.849> as

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
guitar and I'll try and keep it as

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:34.100 
guitar and I'll try and keep it as
simple<00:05:33.330> as<00:05:33.479> possible

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
simple as possible

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.589 
simple as possible
but<00:05:34.439> the<00:05:34.559> hardest<00:05:34.889> part<00:05:35.009> here<00:05:35.459> is<00:05:36.119> actually

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
but the hardest part here is actually

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.399 
but the hardest part here is actually
just<00:05:36.869> getting<00:05:37.259> used<00:05:37.499> to<00:05:37.679> your<00:05:37.889> thumb<00:05:39.409> playing

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
just getting used to your thumb playing

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:43.790 
just getting used to your thumb playing
off<00:05:40.679> the<00:05:40.709> strings<00:05:41.189> and<00:05:42.259> and<00:05:43.259> your<00:05:43.439> fingers

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
off the strings and and your fingers

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.860 
off the strings and and your fingers
just<00:05:44.119> lightly

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
just lightly

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.290 
just lightly
sliding<00:05:47.870> off<00:05:48.020> okay<00:05:51.670> all<00:05:52.670> right<00:05:52.850> so<00:05:53.060> if<00:05:53.270> you

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
sliding off okay all right so if you

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.820 
sliding off okay all right so if you
want<00:05:53.570> to<00:05:53.720> you<00:05:53.870> can<00:05:53.990> practice<00:05:54.410> just<00:05:54.440> going

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
want to you can practice just going

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.490 
want to you can practice just going
index<00:05:55.310> middle<00:05:55.640> ring<00:05:55.970> finger<00:05:56.540> or<00:05:56.720> you<00:05:57.110> can<00:05:57.290> go

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
index middle ring finger or you can go

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:05.079 
index middle ring finger or you can go
the<00:05:57.890> reverse<00:05:58.310> as<00:05:58.520> well<00:05:58.760> or<00:05:59.590> alternate

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:05.089 

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:07.549 

you<00:06:06.089> know<00:06:06.240> you<00:06:06.509> can<00:06:06.689> try<00:06:06.899> all<00:06:07.050> that<00:06:07.169> but<00:06:07.409> you

00:06:07.549 --> 00:06:07.559 
you know you can try all that but you

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:09.169 
you know you can try all that but you
know<00:06:07.679> don't<00:06:07.919> worry<00:06:08.099> that<00:06:08.580> is<00:06:08.699> stuff<00:06:08.969> that<00:06:08.999> I

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:09.179 
know don't worry that is stuff that I

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:11.089 
know don't worry that is stuff that I
will<00:06:09.389> cover<00:06:09.599> in<00:06:10.020> in<00:06:10.319> the<00:06:10.499> other<00:06:10.619> videos<00:06:10.979> as

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
will cover in in the other videos as

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:14.119 
will cover in in the other videos as
well<00:06:11.249> so<00:06:11.490> in<00:06:11.969> the<00:06:12.089> meantime<00:06:12.770> practice<00:06:13.770> get

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:14.129 
well so in the meantime practice get

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:17.149 
well so in the meantime practice get
used<00:06:14.459> to<00:06:14.669> the<00:06:14.789> mechanics<00:06:15.300> of<00:06:15.649> I'm<00:06:16.649> just<00:06:16.919> doing

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:17.159 
used to the mechanics of I'm just doing

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:22.279 
used to the mechanics of I'm just doing
that<00:06:17.189> and<00:06:18.949> from<00:06:19.949> that<00:06:20.209> I'll<00:06:21.209> see<00:06:21.539> you<00:06:21.689> in<00:06:21.899> the

that and from that I'll see you in the

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.100 
that and from that I'll see you in the
other<00:06:22.379> videos<00:06:22.800> where<00:06:23.129> we'll<00:06:23.249> go<00:06:23.490> through<00:06:23.819> some

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
other videos where we'll go through some

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.760 
other videos where we'll go through some
some<00:06:25.110> some<00:06:25.649> simple<00:06:27.080> common<00:06:28.080> parking<00:06:28.439> patterns

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
some some simple common parking patterns

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.230 
some some simple common parking patterns
which<00:06:28.919> you<00:06:29.039> can<00:06:29.219> use<00:06:29.429> in<00:06:29.610> a<00:06:29.699> lot<00:06:29.879> of<00:06:29.909> different

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
which you can use in a lot of different

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.419 
which you can use in a lot of different
songs
