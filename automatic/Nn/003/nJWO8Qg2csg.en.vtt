train review which is that one there

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.860 
train review which is that one there
this<00:00:42.719> costs<00:00:43.020> 100<00:00:43.559> pounds<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> UK<00:00:44.550> you

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
this costs 100 pounds in the UK you

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.209 
this costs 100 pounds in the UK you
don't<00:00:45.870> get<00:00:46.020> any<00:00:46.140> batteries<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.129> you

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
don't get any batteries in it but you

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.660 
don't get any batteries in it but you
need<00:00:47.399> nine<00:00:47.730> triple-a<00:00:48.360> various<00:00:48.980> rp9<00:00:49.980> triple-a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
need nine triple-a various rp9 triple-a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.720 
need nine triple-a various rp9 triple-a
batteries<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.739> make<00:00:52.890> three<00:00:53.399> different

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
batteries you can make three different

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.979 
batteries you can make three different
kinds<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.059> circuits<00:00:54.800> you<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:56.690> i'll<00:00:57.690> show<00:00:57.930> you

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
kinds of circuits you can i'll show you

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.069 
kinds of circuits you can i'll show you
just<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> minute<00:00:58.800> anyway<00:00:58.890> i<00:00:59.750> think<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:00.930> one

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
just in a minute anyway i think it's one

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.700 
just in a minute anyway i think it's one
you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.379> make<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.850> 71<00:01:03.449> centimeters<00:01:06.320> wide<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
you can make the 71 centimeters wide and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.070 
you can make the 71 centimeters wide and
then<00:01:08.310> ninety<00:01:08.700> six<00:01:08.970> centimeters<00:01:10.100> in<00:01:11.100> length

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
then ninety six centimeters in length

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.870 
then ninety six centimeters in length
which<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.409> below<00:01:13.890> me<00:01:14.310> target<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:16.369> get<00:01:17.369> 16

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
which is just below me target is get 16

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.030 
which is just below me target is get 16
curved<00:01:18.180> pieces<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.229> then<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.439> get<00:01:19.560> 60

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
curved pieces and then you get 60

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.320 
curved pieces and then you get 60
lexical<00:01:20.640> pizzas<00:01:21.770> all<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.009> little<00:01:23.490> flexible

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
lexical pizzas all this little flexible

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.660 
lexical pizzas all this little flexible
pieces<00:01:24.659> are<00:01:25.250> just<00:01:26.250> these<00:01:26.430> i<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:27.420> move<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.689> or

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
pieces are just these i can move that or

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.920 
pieces are just these i can move that or
it<00:01:29.670> really<00:01:29.880> does<00:01:30.060> depend<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.210> 16<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.810> them

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
it really does depend you get 16 of them

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.410 
it really does depend you get 16 of them
and<00:01:34.140> all<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.159> 16<00:01:35.610> can<00:01:35.909> actually<00:01:36.829> build<00:01:37.829> up

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
and all of the 16 can actually build up

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.149 
and all of the 16 can actually build up
in<00:01:39.420> total<00:01:39.930> they<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.229> afford<00:01:40.350> these<00:01:40.829> straight

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
in total they can afford these straight

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.440 
in total they can afford these straight
pieces<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.840> or<00:01:42.840> four<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.530> curved<00:01:43.770> pieces

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
pieces here or four of the curved pieces

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.940 
pieces here or four of the curved pieces
here<00:01:45.450> these<00:01:46.020> are<00:01:46.170> just<00:01:46.200> too<00:01:46.530> stuck<00:01:46.799> together

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
here these are just too stuck together

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.950 
here these are just too stuck together
