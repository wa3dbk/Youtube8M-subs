has lower HP now although they doesn't
use<00:01:42.030> any<00:01:42.210> skills<00:01:42.659> if<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.290> use<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.680> song<00:01:43.890> of

Fantasia<00:01:44.460> keep<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.270> mind<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.720> very<00:01:45.899> weak

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
Fantasia keep in mind this is very weak

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.149 
Fantasia keep in mind this is very weak
jutsu<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:47.310> meant<00:01:47.579> for<00:01:47.640> its<00:01:47.880> actual<00:01:48.149> effects

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
jutsu it's meant for its actual effects

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.719 
jutsu it's meant for its actual effects
it<00:01:50.159> probably<00:01:50.729> won't<00:01:50.970> use<00:01:51.119> one<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.540> its<00:01:51.689> attacks

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
it probably won't use one of its attacks

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.190 
it probably won't use one of its attacks
so<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.880> probably<00:01:54.090> won't<00:01:54.299> bite<00:01:54.600> me<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> few

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
so it probably won't bite me for a few

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.060 
so it probably won't bite me for a few
turns<00:01:55.409> let's<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.009> I'm<00:01:56.130> correct

blind and the critical chance is shown
by<00:02:39.760> distract<00:02:40.270> so<00:02:41.260> my<00:02:41.410> use<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:42.100> should<00:02:42.400> do

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
by distract so my use it it should do

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.780 
by distract so my use it it should do
about<00:02:42.730> 200<00:02:43.180> damage<00:02:43.360> hopefully<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:47.490> it<00:02:48.490> is<00:02:48.640> now

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
about 200 damage hopefully and it is now

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.060 
about 200 damage hopefully and it is now
blinded<00:02:49.390> meaning<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.840> has<00:02:50.050> less<00:02:50.260> chance<00:02:50.290> so

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
blinded meaning that has less chance so

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.699 
blinded meaning that has less chance so
it<00:02:51.340> adds<00:02:51.490> to<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:53.530> media<00:02:54.130> is<00:02:54.459> about<00:02:54.700> 34<00:02:55.709> third

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
it adds to this media is about 34 third

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.830 
it adds to this media is about 34 third
third<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.550> chance<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.970> dodge<00:02:58.180> sucks<00:02:58.660> pretty

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
third of a chance to dodge sucks pretty

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.090 
third of a chance to dodge sucks pretty
nice<00:03:00.990> finally<00:03:01.990> hopefully<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.560> can<00:03:02.739> show<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.010> a

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
nice finally hopefully I can show you a

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.800 
nice finally hopefully I can show you a
weakened<00:03:03.550> technique<00:03:05.640> nope<00:03:06.640> I'll<00:03:07.239> keep<00:03:07.690> on

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
weakened technique nope I'll keep on

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.180 
weakened technique nope I'll keep on
doing<00:03:08.080> something<00:03:08.290> till<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.590> see<00:03:08.650> if<00:03:08.860> we<00:03:09.010> can

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
doing something till I see if we can

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.360 
doing something till I see if we can
technique<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:09.910> give<00:03:10.150> me<00:03:10.269> minute<00:03:11.190> quickly<00:03:12.190> go

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
technique so give me minute quickly go

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.870 
technique so give me minute quickly go
through<00:03:12.400> this<00:03:12.820> and<00:03:13.209> kill<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.140> or<00:03:14.860> kill<00:03:15.670> the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
through this and kill it or kill the

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.960 
through this and kill it or kill the
mountain<00:03:16.150> bandit<00:03:17.220> hopefully<00:03:18.220> if<00:03:18.519> I<00:03:18.640> attack<00:03:18.940> it

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
mountain bandit hopefully if I attack it

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.860 
mountain bandit hopefully if I attack it
it<00:03:19.930> will<00:03:20.470> weaken<00:03:23.850> currently<00:03:24.850> well<00:03:25.060> my<00:03:25.390> passive

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
it will weaken currently well my passive

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.250 
it will weaken currently well my passive
skill<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.380> not<00:03:26.530> very<00:03:26.769> strong<00:03:27.269> there's<00:03:28.269> a<00:03:28.390> 21%

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
skill is not very strong there's a 21%

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.130 
skill is not very strong there's a 21%
chance<00:03:29.320> to<00:03:29.680> weaken<00:03:29.980> by<00:03:30.100> 4%<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.910> if<00:03:31.570> I<00:03:31.690> do<00:03:31.750> add

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
chance to weaken by 4% and if I do add

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.750 
chance to weaken by 4% and if I do add
it<00:03:32.380> to<00:03:32.650> wine<00:03:32.980> Meridian<00:03:33.610> um<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:36.250> add<00:03:36.370> up<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.580> my

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
it to wine Meridian um to add up to my

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.550 
it to wine Meridian um to add up to my
brother's<00:03:37.239> Meridiana<00:03:37.930> stiva

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560

brother's Meridiana stiva
I<00:03:38.620> only<00:03:38.890> have<00:03:39.100> like<00:03:39.130> about<00:03:39.459> 10<00:03:40.380> sadly<00:03:42.390> I've

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
I only have like about 10 sadly I've

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.420 
I only have like about 10 sadly I've
been<00:03:43.570> trying<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.080> attack<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:44.800> see<00:03:44.950> get<00:03:45.400> a

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
been trying to attack it and see get a

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.240 
been trying to attack it and see get a
weakened<00:03:45.940> but<00:03:46.290> there's<00:03:47.290> only<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.560> 50%<00:03:47.769> chance

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
weakened but there's only a 50% chance

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.620 
weakened but there's only a 50% chance
so<00:03:48.820> gets<00:03:49.600> it<00:03:49.780> there<00:03:50.019> with<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:51.269> we<00:03:52.269> can<00:03:52.510> adjust

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
so gets it there with it we can adjust

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.710 
so gets it there with it we can adjust
as<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.620> UH<00:03:53.760> if<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.970> tells<00:03:55.209> you<00:03:55.390> if<00:03:55.510> it's<00:03:55.600> a

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
as the UH if it tells you if it's a

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.090 
as the UH if it tells you if it's a
weakened<00:03:56.049> it<00:03:56.170> just<00:03:56.320> has<00:03:56.470> a<00:03:56.500> little<00:03:56.680> weakened

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
weakened it just has a little weakened

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.979 
weakened it just has a little weakened
over<00:03:57.370> its<00:03:57.489> head<00:03:57.610> and<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.090> does<00:03:58.269> a<00:03:58.299> little<00:03:58.780> less

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
over its head and it does a little less

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.979 
over its head and it does a little less
damage<00:03:59.500> like<00:03:59.709> about<00:03:59.950> 1<00:04:00.160> or<00:04:00.190> 2<00:04:00.340> probably<00:04:00.989> when

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
damage like about 1 or 2 probably when

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.170 
damage like about 1 or 2 probably when
you<00:04:02.080> get<00:04:02.290> higher<00:04:02.500> level<00:04:02.950> it<00:04:03.100> does<00:04:03.280> about<00:04:03.580> 10

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
you get higher level it does about 10

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.910 
you get higher level it does about 10
less<00:04:04.480> 10%<00:04:05.170> for<00:04:05.890> 20%<00:04:06.370> less<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:08.140> that's<00:04:08.680> very

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
less 10% for 20% less and that's very

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.240 
less 10% for 20% less and that's very
nice<00:04:09.130> so<00:04:09.850> that's<00:04:10.360> all<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.600> have<00:04:10.810> for<00:04:11.110> today<00:04:11.350> so
