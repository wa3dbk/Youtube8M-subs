reference point we won't necessarily

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.589 
reference point we won't necessarily
just<00:02:02.920> keep<00:02:03.069> casting<00:02:03.310> raids<00:02:03.670> every<00:02:03.789> one<00:02:04.090> yeah

tip way up high you'd be taking away
from<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.460> diving<00:03:09.760> depth<00:03:09.940> in<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.890> same<00:03:12.100> way

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
from that diving depth in the same way

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.979 
from that diving depth in the same way
if<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.490> put<00:03:12.670> your<00:03:12.790> tip<00:03:13.000> down<00:03:13.239> low<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:13.510> can<00:03:13.840> get
