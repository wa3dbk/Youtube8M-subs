lot<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.850> tutors<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:55.200> been<00:01:55.500> known<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.770> say<00:01:56.270> get

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
lot of tutors have been known to say get

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.539 
lot of tutors have been known to say get
a<00:01:57.299> length<00:01:57.570> first<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.229> then<00:01:58.829> spin<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> ball

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
a length first and then spin the ball

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.370 
a length first and then spin the ball
but<00:01:59.790> you're<00:01:59.939> actually<00:02:00.210> saying<00:02:00.360> spin<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
but you're actually saying spin is the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.950 
but you're actually saying spin is the
priority<00:02:01.619> forget<00:02:02.430> about<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.759> length<00:02:02.969> you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
priority forget about the length you

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.550 
priority forget about the length you
have<00:02:04.219> lots<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.340> bowlers<00:02:05.520> who<00:02:05.939> are<00:02:06.560> just

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
have lots of bowlers who are just

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.469 
have lots of bowlers who are just
rollers<00:02:08.009> they<00:02:08.340> just<00:02:08.520> put<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.819> ball<00:02:08.970> layer<00:02:09.239> and

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
rollers they just put the ball layer and

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.690 
rollers they just put the ball layer and
that<00:02:10.140> suits<00:02:10.649> them<00:02:10.890> particularly<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.400> they<00:02:11.550> get

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
that suits them particularly if they get

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.480 
that suits them particularly if they get
a<00:02:11.730> pitch<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.150> may<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.569> been<00:02:12.750> prepared

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
a pitch that may have been prepared

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.060 
a pitch that may have been prepared
to<00:02:13.610> help<00:02:13.790> them<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.470> they<00:02:15.470> can<00:02:15.620> then<00:02:15.740> return

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
to help them and they can then return

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.520 
to help them and they can then return
good<00:02:16.340> figures<00:02:16.700> but<00:02:17.120> that<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:17.870> no<00:02:18.110> good<00:02:18.290> it's

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
good figures but that is no good it's

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.040 
good figures but that is no good it's
like<00:02:18.710> trying<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.040> teach<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.700> medium<00:02:20.540> pacer<00:02:20.810> to

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
like trying to teach a medium pacer to

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.870 
like trying to teach a medium pacer to
become<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.350> great<00:02:21.740> fast<00:02:22.040> bowler<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.490> can't<00:02:22.700> do

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
become a great fast bowler you can't do

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.190 
become a great fast bowler you can't do
it<00:02:22.970> he's<00:02:23.090> got<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.300> have<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.420> place<00:02:23.690> first<00:02:24.020> and

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
it he's got to have the place first and

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.850 
it he's got to have the place first and
in<00:02:24.740> this<00:02:24.890> case<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:26.000> leg<00:02:26.630> spinner<00:02:26.930> must<00:02:27.650> have

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
in this case the leg spinner must have

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.860 
in this case the leg spinner must have
the<00:02:28.010> fierce<00:02:28.370> spin<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.970> then<00:02:29.540> learn<00:02:29.750> to

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
the fierce spin and then learn to

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.750 
the fierce spin and then learn to
control<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:31.130> going<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.430> take<00:02:31.580> in

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
control it and that is going to take in

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.000 
control it and that is going to take in
mind<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.210> say<00:02:32.630> four<00:02:32.900> years<00:02:33.110> before<00:02:33.770> he<00:02:33.830> can

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
mind you say four years before he can

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.650 
mind you say four years before he can
control<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:34.730> teachers<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.270> bow<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.480> leg

just<00:03:50.140> have<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.319> look<00:03:50.500> at<00:03:50.620> at<00:03:51.400> your<00:03:52.060> grip<00:03:52.360> for<00:03:52.810> a

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
just have a look at at your grip for a

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.979 
just have a look at at your grip for a
start<00:03:53.110> that<00:03:53.349> the<00:03:53.500> whole<00:03:53.650> basis<00:03:54.099> of<00:03:54.930> modeling<00:03:55.930> a

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
start that the whole basis of modeling a

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.509 
start that the whole basis of modeling a
leg<00:03:56.140> break<00:03:56.379> is<00:03:57.099> that<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.060> ball<00:03:58.239> is<00:03:58.599> going<00:03:59.080> down

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
leg break is that the ball is going down

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.059 
leg break is that the ball is going down
the<00:04:00.519> pitch<00:04:00.760> needs<00:04:01.360> to<00:04:01.569> seem<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:02.050> be<00:04:02.200> rotating

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
the pitch needs to seem to be rotating

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.890 
the pitch needs to seem to be rotating
in<00:04:03.130> that<00:04:03.310> direction<00:04:03.459> I<00:04:03.940> just<00:04:04.599> turned<00:04:04.840> around

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
in that direction I just turned around

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.830 
in that direction I just turned around
to<00:04:05.590> get<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:05.860> read<00:04:06.099> so<00:04:06.700> it<00:04:06.790> needs<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.090> be<00:04:07.150> the

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
to get the read so it needs to be the

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.160 
to get the read so it needs to be the
seam<00:04:08.050> needs<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.410> be<00:04:08.500> turning<00:04:08.890> anti-clockwise

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
seam needs to be turning anti-clockwise

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.030 
seam needs to be turning anti-clockwise
going<00:04:11.170> from<00:04:11.530> leg<00:04:11.920> to<00:04:11.950> off<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:14.769> first

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
going from leg to off and the first

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.280 
going from leg to off and the first
thing<00:04:15.280> that's<00:04:15.700> happening<00:04:16.030> there<00:04:16.209> is<00:04:16.479> that<00:04:16.630> you

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
thing that's happening there is that you

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.390 
thing that's happening there is that you
haven't<00:04:17.500> got<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.650> ball<00:04:17.799> in<00:04:17.889> your<00:04:17.919> hand<00:04:18.220> as

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400
