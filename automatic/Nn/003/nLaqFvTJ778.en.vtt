earlier<00:00:15.679> today<00:00:16.040> actually<00:00:18.160> there's<00:00:19.160> a<00:00:19.279> motor

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.640 

sweet<00:00:23.690> got<00:00:24.650> a<00:00:24.680> big<00:00:24.920> ol<00:00:25.040> 11/8<00:00:25.820> prop

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.109 

let's<00:00:30.650> take<00:00:30.860> a<00:00:30.890> look<00:00:31.160> that<00:00:31.430> turnigy<00:00:31.910> motor

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
let's take a look that turnigy motor

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:39.010 
let's take a look that turnigy motor
says<00:00:32.450> 36<00:00:33.110> 32<00:00:33.800> on<00:00:34.070> it<00:00:34.989> 1200<00:00:35.989> kV<00:00:36.530> not<00:00:37.750> to<00:00:38.750> do<00:00:38.870> the

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
says 36 32 on it 1200 kV not to do the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.330 
says 36 32 on it 1200 kV not to do the
job<00:00:40.390> this<00:00:41.390> is<00:00:41.600> a<00:00:41.629> carbon<00:00:42.050> fiber<00:00:42.350> ring<00:00:42.739> carbon

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
job this is a carbon fiber ring carbon

Kevlar<00:00:52.850> oh<00:00:53.090> it's<00:00:53.420> strong<00:00:53.720> my<00:00:54.320> goodness<00:00:54.769> now<00:00:55.670> I

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
Kevlar oh it's strong my goodness now I

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.500 
Kevlar oh it's strong my goodness now I
want<00:00:55.879> to<00:00:55.909> take<00:00:56.089> a<00:00:56.150> particular<00:00:56.390> close<00:00:57.110> look<00:00:58.510> at

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
want to take a particular close look at

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.860 
want to take a particular close look at
my<00:00:59.809> risers<00:01:01.659> here<00:01:02.659> they<00:01:02.809> are<00:01:03.050> a<00:01:04.479> line<00:01:05.479> is<00:01:05.750> the

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
my risers here they are a line is the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.120 
my risers here they are a line is the
short<00:01:06.200> one<00:01:07.180> D<00:01:08.180> line<00:01:08.420> is<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:08.780> long<00:01:08.990> one<00:01:09.290> that

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.770 

reduces<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.280> angle<00:01:13.610> of<00:01:13.700> attack<00:01:13.790> pending

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
reduces the angle of attack pending

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:22.750 
reduces the angle of attack pending
using<00:01:15.380> more<00:01:15.530> penetration<00:01:18.370> there<00:01:19.370> it<00:01:19.580> is<00:01:21.760> ABCD

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
using more penetration there it is ABCD

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.520 
using more penetration there it is ABCD
starting<00:01:23.270> from<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.510> bottom<00:01:23.869> up<00:01:24.080> I<00:01:26.350> said<00:01:27.350> just

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
starting from the bottom up I said just

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.390 
starting from the bottom up I said just
put<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:27.800> wheels<00:01:28.010> on<00:01:28.370> it<00:01:30.010> yeah<00:01:31.010> it's<00:01:31.250> pretty

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
put the wheels on it yeah it's pretty

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.550 
put the wheels on it yeah it's pretty
cool<00:01:31.670> looking<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:32.360> know

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
cool looking I know

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.330 
cool looking I know
I<00:01:36.490> stole<00:01:37.490> Bella<00:01:37.790> dogs<00:01:38.980> idea<00:01:39.980> of<00:01:40.040> putting<00:01:40.280> the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
I stole Bella dogs idea of putting the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.070 
I stole Bella dogs idea of putting the
arms<00:01:40.700> out<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:41.000> harm's<00:01:41.270> way
