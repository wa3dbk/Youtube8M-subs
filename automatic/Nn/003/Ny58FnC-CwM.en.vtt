00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.020
 you don't know it 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.950

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.390
 cute card and this one already 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.049

 inside the box has arrived 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.549
 there were products I asked for 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.619
 I was however still amazed me 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.350
 a lot because then having in hand 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.180
 feeling in the perfumes being able to retouch 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.580
 really 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.340
 they tell me less catapult than 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.330
 world of scents of tastes disagreements 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.220
 of truly olfactory sensations of the 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.140
 all new product he sent me e 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.080
 this is a bath a shower bath 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:07.590
 cocoa anti-cellulite that has a scent 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.649
 chocolate good matches really don't 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.650
 feel like barrow and it's pretty much 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.020
 the cute packaging is also very 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.750
 very nice really very very nice 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.520
 very cute it is taken a lot from 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.330
 mobile phone in the mouth because not true the 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.470
 fragrance is very strong and cocoa lenses e 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.180
 the time to use it in fact made me 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.220
 this video right away because not from 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.530
 one to beat me to approve all these 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.370
 these products here so this is a 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.090
 bathroom shower 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.310
 indeed you follow the cocoa and the thing that 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.690
 instead a sack that says behind it 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.420
 just the deadline the deadline 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.640
 mandatory so I know that for example 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.280
 I have to finish this within four months 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.110
 now months were starting 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.030
 obviously it wo n't last four months 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.010
 because he used it because I do the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.610
 shower every day so girls is 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.320
 impossible though girls I like a 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.060
 canvas sack with the third is one thing 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.130
 that struck me so much about these 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.489
 of these products is accuracy with 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.260
 which are precisely produced to the thing 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.900
 in one gone and cost maintenance also 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.519
 for dry heels I like to remember 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.650
 I therefore leave mutation death 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.950
 very very pretty cute 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:22.469
 really pretty cute pretty and this is it 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.849
 an ointment even if very fragrant 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.590
 that are just about to soften 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.150
 heels that are fixed with the feet it 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.560
 knows well both in winter and in summer then it is 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.569
 it was all the more reason why anyway 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.549
 I always walk because I wear 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.049
 sandals for the sea even if this in the 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.329
 sea ​​also this looking quater 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.670
 balcony because time 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.349
 in short, even the summer on vacation I don't know 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.819
 what happened to it 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.680
 anyway, I'm looking forward to 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.920
 really try it and I like it a lot 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.870
 really cute packaging I have 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.489
 ate this bar of soap here which is a 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.909
 variegated with chocolate you want to 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.659
 eat them perfumed scented really 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:01.750
 or those in the Grazian mouth are wonderful 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:03.280
 this is a soap that I will put 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.079
 just in my wallet in mine 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.389
 Argentine in the bathroom to perfume 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.859
 the environment but I want to use 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:11.590
 absolute they gave me this pure 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:14.169
 exfoliating body that is applied during 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.329
 the shower is that I like a lot like 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.979
 she knows as a concept why you do things 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.530
 in the shower we say that it is much more 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.389
 hastily I love practical things 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.520
 here I like the oils in this 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.960
 period the one that can be used 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.280
 during the dessert because we are anyway 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.870
 always in a hurry because in any case not 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.630
 we have time to star was massaging 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.639
 the ark to make them create is absorbed 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.900
 so as it is more practical it is a 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.900
 product the more they violate and this 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.789
 I believe that it is and not scented 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.039
 an economy that will provoke butter 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.979
 cocoa butter, shea or coconut 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.449
 sweet almond oil over hazelnut 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.210
 part that really when they open 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.680
 they almost look like plots to eat and 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.180
 we have something that is watering 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.229
 mouth just the first feeling that 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.300
 evoke and unite and then sent me 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.590
 this vanilla body cream that you 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.590
 I want to open but it's possible because 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.780
 because first I want to use another 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:14.120
 and then the seal as much as I can 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.430
 Also this lasts six months with water 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.630
 job wheat germ oil butter of 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:23.120
 shea burdick lime of cetera mamma 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.740
 It did not give me a good fragrance and 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.360
 then bring I will use now that 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.010
 begin to use now because I have 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.220
 a bit of line stretch mark 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:38.020
 crown or mommy my crowned will be 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:41.180
 stop vabbè the crown on the twenty-three 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.720
 this cocoa body cream was stritch 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.930
 entering the vineyards now in the videos if 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.990
 there the cover is that we are not happy 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.370
 this crawford for cocoa I said 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.720
 this elasticizes stretch mark 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.070
 I asked him for it, I put it on 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.720
 what a product wants too 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.100
 stretch marks 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.690
 because a canon stretch mark 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.030
 began to go to some stretch mark 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.979
 yes to my venerable age I do not 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.570
 I've never had it in the latter though 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.700
 period I quit the gym 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.260
 unfortunately for the events you know not 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.540
 I could do physical activity then a 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.310
 a little let 's say there was a before 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.410
 then I am slimming 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.660
 putting back a little because that chechile 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.220
 network and I don't mind though 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.900
 not having physical activity 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.420
 toning the fabrics that way 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.730
 need 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.490
 also aid and so I decided to 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.900
 start using products 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.340
 elasticising and therefore anti- stretch marks e 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.360

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:36.130
 then I will find cocoa and see 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.740
 Obviously I can not say yet 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.150
 nothing but maybe I'll try with you too 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.890

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.980

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.120
