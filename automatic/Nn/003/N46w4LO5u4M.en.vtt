00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
trick here is that you have to play your

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.639 
trick here is that you have to play your
set<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.270> same<00:00:57.480> sentence<00:00:57.960> with<00:00:58.050> all<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
set in the same sentence with all the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.719 
set in the same sentence with all the
time<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.579> example<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:01.160> 98<00:01:02.449> 96<00:01:04.040> 96<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.280> 98

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
time for example I have 98 96 96 and 98

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.770 
time for example I have 98 96 96 and 98
