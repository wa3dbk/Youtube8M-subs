gives<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> little<00:01:29.640> bit<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.970> shows<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
gives you a little bit it shows you the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.649 
gives you a little bit it shows you the
dimensions<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.250> square<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.420> we're<00:01:33.570> going

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
dimensions of the square so we're going

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.510 
dimensions of the square so we're going
to<00:01:33.750> go<00:01:33.810> ahead<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.770> coke<00:01:35.159> can

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
to go ahead and do just this coke can

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.880 
to go ahead and do just this coke can
perfect<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.689> when<00:01:37.229> you're<00:01:37.350> done<00:01:37.439> just<00:01:37.650> click

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
perfect and when you're done just click

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.190 
perfect and when you're done just click
crop<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.880> there<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.450> go<00:01:39.540> zooms<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> right<00:01:40.110> in

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
crop and there you go zooms it right in

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.679 
crop and there you go zooms it right in
for<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.710> then<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.040> down<00:01:41.280> here<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.689> just

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
for you and then this down here is just

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.160 
for you and then this down here is just
to<00:01:42.780> basically<00:01:42.960> rotate<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:44.119> okay<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.049> can

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
to basically rotate it okay so you can

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.749 
to basically rotate it okay so you can
basically<00:01:46.350> rotate<00:01:46.799> any<00:01:47.009> direction<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.490> want

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
basically rotate any direction you want

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.120 
basically rotate any direction you want
to<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.409> sideways<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.040> all

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
to you can have a like sideways and all

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.530 
to you can have a like sideways and all
that<00:01:50.280> stuff<00:01:50.399> which<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.880> pretty<00:01:51.000> cool<00:01:51.210> that

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
that stuff which is pretty cool that

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.050 
that stuff which is pretty cool that
puts<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.049> upside<00:01:52.350> down<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.680> really<00:01:52.890> cool<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
puts it upside down so really cool and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.819 
puts it upside down so really cool and
then<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> left-hand<00:01:55.020> corner<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
then on the left-hand corner here the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.069 
then on the left-hand corner here the
filters<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.090> where<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.540> change<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
filters this is where you can change the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.060 
filters this is where you can change the
sharpness<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.710> your<00:01:58.950> image<00:01:59.399> zoom<00:02:00.240> out<00:02:00.390> here

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
sharpness of your image zoom out here

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.920 
sharpness of your image zoom out here
you<00:02:02.070> just<00:02:02.280> basically<00:02:02.430> slide<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.149> across<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
you just basically slide this across and

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.719 
you just basically slide this across and
it<00:02:04.200> sharpens<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.680> for<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.159> not<00:02:05.399> too

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
it sharpens it for you it's not too

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.210 
it sharpens it for you it's not too
noticeable<00:02:06.020> um<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.320> depends<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.710> what<00:02:07.979> kind<00:02:08.009> of

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
noticeable um it depends on what kind of

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.770 
noticeable um it depends on what kind of
photo<00:02:08.459> you're<00:02:08.640> taking<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.179> like<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.690> be

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
photo you're taking I like it to be

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.750 
photo you're taking I like it to be
pretty<00:02:09.989> sharp<00:02:10.170> though<00:02:10.379> now<00:02:11.160> here's<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.459> pencil

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
pretty sharp though now here's a pencil

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.860 
pretty sharp though now here's a pencil
section<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:12.450> is

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
section this is

and this is pretty cool I like that one
a<00:02:35.190> lot<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:35.970> we're<00:02:36.209> just<00:02:36.239> going<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.540> take<00:02:36.989> that

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
a lot so we're just going to take that

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.770 
a lot so we're just going to take that
off<00:02:37.650> reset<00:02:38.310> then<00:02:39.150> down<00:02:39.329> here<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.599> little

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
off reset then down here this little

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.250 
off reset then down here this little

color wheel icon allows you to change

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.319 
color wheel icon allows you to change
just<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:43.920> brightness<00:02:44.489> this<00:02:44.670> will<00:02:44.819> change<00:02:45.090> the

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
just the brightness this will change the

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.869 
just the brightness this will change the
brightness<00:02:45.510> right<00:02:45.900> here<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:47.099> can<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.430> make<00:02:47.760> it

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
brightness right here you can I make it

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.789 
brightness right here you can I make it
darker<00:02:48.269> or<00:02:48.390> lighter<00:02:48.530> anything<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.620> want<00:02:49.769> to

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
do or just leave it like that and now

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.080 
do or just leave it like that and now
here's<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.420> exposure<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:53.220> obvious<00:02:53.879> this

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
here's the exposure this obvious this

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.309 
here's the exposure this obvious this
kind<00:02:54.329> of<00:02:54.390> allows<00:02:54.569> you<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.780> brighten<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.140> to

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
kind of allows you to brighten it to

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.490 
kind of allows you to brighten it to
going<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.099> go<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:57.000> then<00:02:57.090> contrast<00:02:57.780> you

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
going to go that and then contrast you

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.920 
going to go that and then contrast you
y'all<00:02:59.010> note<00:02:59.159> contrast<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.879> so<00:02:59.909> pretty<00:03:00.690> cool

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
y'all note contrast is so pretty cool

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.270 
y'all note contrast is so pretty cool
how<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.170> how<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.680> has<00:03:01.829> all<00:03:01.980> these<00:03:02.069> different

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
how you how it has all these different

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.069 
how you how it has all these different
features<00:03:02.670> down<00:03:03.000> here<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:03.659> change<00:03:03.870> the
