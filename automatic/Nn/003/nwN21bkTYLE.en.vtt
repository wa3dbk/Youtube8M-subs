catching the ball out the back field is

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.500 
catching the ball out the back field is
one<00:02:30.830> area<00:02:31.070> I<00:02:31.459> don't<00:02:32.000> think<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.300> necessarily

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
one area I don't think you necessarily

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.660 
one area I don't think you necessarily
need<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.320> lean<00:02:33.530> on<00:02:33.560> him<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.100> be<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.280> leader<00:02:34.550> I

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
need to lean on him to be a leader I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.850 
need to lean on him to be a leader I
think<00:02:35.030> each<00:02:35.390> guy<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.750> different<00:02:35.989> you<00:02:36.560> know<00:02:36.709> and

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
think each guy is different you know and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.979 
think each guy is different you know and
you<00:02:36.950> let<00:02:37.160> him<00:02:37.430> start<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.360> leave<00:02:38.570> when<00:02:38.810> he's

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
you let him start to leave when he's

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.150 
you let him start to leave when he's
ready<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.530> leave<00:02:40.720> but<00:02:41.720> at<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.900> same<00:02:42.110> time<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:42.800> do

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
ready to leave but at the same time I do

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.210 
ready to leave but at the same time I do
think<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:44.480> know<00:02:44.630> they're<00:02:45.620> gonna<00:02:45.800> have<00:02:46.070> to

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
think you know they're gonna have to

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.880 
think you know they're gonna have to
have<00:02:46.400> somebody<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:47.000> help<00:02:47.180> him<00:02:47.330> because

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
have somebody to help him because

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.940 
have somebody to help him because
putting<00:02:48.890> all<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.840> carries<00:02:50.840> on<00:02:51.020> Ryan<00:02:51.410> Mathews

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
putting all the carries on Ryan Mathews

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.740 
putting all the carries on Ryan Mathews
it's<00:02:52.340> probably<00:02:52.700> too<00:02:52.910> much<00:02:53.090> for<00:02:53.390> him<00:02:53.480> as<00:02:53.600> you

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
it's probably too much for him as you

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.440 
it's probably too much for him as you
mentioned<00:02:54.230> he's<00:02:54.769> proven<00:02:55.310> is<00:02:55.730> hard<00:02:56.120> for<00:02:56.299> him<00:02:56.420> to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
mentioned he's proven is hard for him to

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.690 
mentioned he's proven is hard for him to
stay<00:02:56.750> healthy<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.769> so<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.010> think<00:02:58.160> it's<00:02:58.459> fair<00:02:58.640> to

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
stay healthy and so I think it's fair to

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.699 
stay healthy and so I think it's fair to
say<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.690> know<00:02:59.720> you<00:02:59.870> need<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.410> help<00:03:00.590> him

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
say that you know you need to help him

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.740 
say that you know you need to help him
out<00:03:00.890> maybe<00:03:01.160> you<00:03:01.880> know<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.090> have<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.420> monitor

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
out maybe you know you have to monitor

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.020 
out maybe you know you have to monitor
his<00:03:03.170> carries<00:03:03.709> how<00:03:04.070> many<00:03:04.280> carrots<00:03:04.670> can<00:03:04.880> he

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.390

in solana cm

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.870 
in solana cm
and<00:03:47.590> your<00:03:47.770> guards<00:03:48.220> if<00:03:48.370> you're<00:03:48.520> running<00:03:48.670> the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
ball inside you better have good guards

their to the respective offenses yeah
well<00:04:34.330> I<00:04:34.360> think<00:04:34.480> great<00:04:34.870> rice<00:04:35.110> as<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:36.010> balance

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
well I think great rice as the balance

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.960 
well I think great rice as the balance
that<00:04:36.930> Baltimore<00:04:37.930> knees<00:04:38.170> on<00:04:38.560> their<00:04:39.070> offense<00:04:39.550> if

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
that Baltimore knees on their offense if

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.450 
that Baltimore knees on their offense if
you<00:04:40.120> think<00:04:40.390> about<00:04:40.450> it<00:04:40.890> during<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.100> postseason

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
you think about it during the postseason

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.700 
you think about it during the postseason
during<00:04:43.000> their<00:04:43.150> postseason<00:04:43.570> run<00:04:43.960> they<00:04:44.620> have

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
during their postseason run they have

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.230 
during their postseason run they have
been<00:04:44.920> pretty<00:04:45.160> balanced<00:04:45.700> meaning<00:04:46.030> they<00:04:46.210> have

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
been pretty balanced meaning they have

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.420 
been pretty balanced meaning they have
run<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.660> ball<00:04:46.870> over<00:04:47.110> 30<00:04:47.440> times<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.980> game<00:04:48.190> and

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
run the ball over 30 times the game and

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.730 
run the ball over 30 times the game and
joe<00:04:48.580> flacco<00:04:48.880> has<00:04:49.060> thrown<00:04:49.480> the<00:04:49.660> ball<00:04:49.810> around<00:04:50.110> 35

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
joe flacco has thrown the ball around 35

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.220 
joe flacco has thrown the ball around 35
times<00:04:51.070> again<00:04:51.430> that's<00:04:51.970> very<00:04:52.090> balanced<00:04:52.900> that's

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
times again that's very balanced that's

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.380 
times again that's very balanced that's
because<00:04:53.680> of<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.190> type<00:04:54.490> of<00:04:54.520> office<00:04:55.030> that<00:04:55.210> they

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
because of the type of office that they

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.410 
because of the type of office that they
run<00:04:55.630> they<00:04:56.020> need<00:04:56.320> ray<00:04:56.710> rice<00:04:56.980> to<00:04:57.310> be<00:04:57.490> running<00:04:57.730> the
