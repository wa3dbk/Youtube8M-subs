00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
a little bit but the offense was

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.650

Philadelphia<00:02:17.740> team<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.220> just<00:02:18.760> think<00:02:18.910> that

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
Philadelphia team I just think that

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.700 
Philadelphia team I just think that
alice<00:02:19.270> is<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.510> better<00:02:19.690> football<00:02:20.110> team<00:02:20.140> I

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
alice is the better football team I

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.840 
alice is the better football team I
don't<00:02:20.890> think<00:02:21.070> they're<00:02:21.190> going<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.370> be<00:02:21.550> phased

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
don't think they're going to be phased

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.000 
don't think they're going to be phased
to<00:02:22.030> play<00:02:22.210> on<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.450> road<00:02:22.630> cincinnati<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.830> good

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
to play on the road cincinnati is good

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.650 
to play on the road cincinnati is good
they've<00:02:24.280> kind<00:02:24.520> of<00:02:24.580> overachieved<00:02:25.180> all<00:02:25.390> year

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
they've kind of overachieved all year

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.810 
they've kind of overachieved all year
think<00:02:26.320> it's<00:02:26.440> time<00:02:26.650> for<00:02:26.830> Dallas<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.310> pick<00:02:27.490> up<00:02:27.670> a

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
think it's time for Dallas to pick up a

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.090 
think it's time for Dallas to pick up a
big<00:02:28.060> road<00:02:28.330> win<00:02:28.360> ignore<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.440> three<00:02:29.650> points<00:02:30.040> I

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
big road win ignore the three points I

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.920 
big road win ignore the three points I
think<00:02:30.280> Dallas<00:02:30.460> takes<00:02:30.880> this<00:02:31.030> game<00:02:31.270> outright<00:02:31.510> in

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
think Dallas takes this game outright in

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.810 
think Dallas takes this game outright in
Cincinnati<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:32.530> Sunday<00:02:32.860> all<00:02:33.310> right<00:02:33.490> but<00:02:33.640> what

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.050 
think they're trying to tell us
something<00:02:56.650> gallant<00:02:57.160> making<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.700> beer<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:58.030> know

something gallant making a beer you know
you<00:02:58.210> probably<00:02:58.540> could<00:02:58.810> have<00:02:58.840> put<00:02:59.080> this<00:02:59.260> line<00:02:59.500> at

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
you probably could have put this line at

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.470 
you probably could have put this line at
six<00:02:59.950> or<00:03:00.100> seven<00:03:00.550> but<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.760> think<00:03:01.030> somebody's

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
six or seven but I think somebody's

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.000

impression of this game in this line was
like<00:03:27.190> since<00:03:27.430> he's<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.670> obvious<00:03:27.820> play<00:03:28.239> but

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
like since he's the obvious play but

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
what do you think maybe about the over

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.300 
what do you think maybe about the over
45<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.930> half<00:03:38.080> kind<00:03:38.320> of<00:03:38.440> a<00:03:38.500> high<00:03:38.620> total<00:03:38.920> but

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
45 and a half kind of a high total but

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.470 
45 and a half kind of a high total but
you<00:03:39.459> know<00:03:39.580> since<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.850> night<00:03:40.000> he<00:03:40.030> does<00:03:40.239> have<00:03:40.450> a

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
you know since the night he does have a

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.410 
you know since the night he does have a
quality<00:03:40.870> offense<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:42.280> cowboys<00:03:43.060> defense

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
quality offense and and cowboys defense

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.640 
quality offense and and cowboys defense
has<00:03:43.570> looked<00:03:43.600> very<00:03:43.900> vulnerable<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:44.500> if<00:03:44.560> the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
has looked very vulnerable and if the

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.050 
has looked very vulnerable and if the
Cowboys<00:03:44.980> often<00:03:45.310> starting<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.700> click<00:03:45.850> now

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
Cowboys often starting to click now

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.940 
Cowboys often starting to click now
maybe<00:03:46.480> 45<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.110> a<00:03:47.140> half<00:03:47.260> me<00:03:47.410> good<00:03:47.590> candidate

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
maybe 45 and a half me good candidate

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.280 
maybe 45 and a half me good candidate
for<00:03:47.980> an<00:03:48.220> over<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.840> wouldn't<00:03:49.840> i<00:03:49.989> wouldn't<00:03:50.080> go

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
for an over I wouldn't i wouldn't go

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.750 
for an over I wouldn't i wouldn't go
against<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.620> at<00:03:50.860> all<00:03:50.950> i<00:03:51.010> think<00:03:51.340> both<00:03:51.730> teams

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
against that at all i think both teams

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.699 
against that at all i think both teams
could<00:03:52.360> be<00:03:52.540> in<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.750> high<00:03:52.870> twenties<00:03:53.350> i<00:03:53.470> think

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
could be in the high twenties i think

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.160 
could be in the high twenties i think
you're<00:03:53.800> going<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:53.950> see<00:03:54.010> kind<00:03:54.430> of<00:03:54.489> a<00:03:54.610> 33-27<00:03:55.600> type

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
you're going to see kind of a 33-27 type

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.590 
you're going to see kind of a 33-27 type

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
game the dallas pulls out i would not be

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.300 
game the dallas pulls out i would not be
opposed<00:03:59.020> to<00:03:59.140> taking<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.470> over<00:03:59.620> in<00:03:59.800> this<00:03:59.890> one<00:03:59.950> I

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
opposed to taking the over in this one I

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.190 
opposed to taking the over in this one I
do<00:04:00.610> like<00:04:00.850> dallas<00:04:01.209> won<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.540> football<00:04:01.690> game<00:04:02.020> now

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
do like dallas won the football game now
