00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
um as you can see I went up onto the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.469 
um as you can see I went up onto the
edge<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.439> where<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> wood<00:01:35.040> stops<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.790> put

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
edge this is where the wood stops I put

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.170 
edge this is where the wood stops I put
some<00:01:36.720> foam<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.049> there<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:38.189> got<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.610> down<00:01:38.759> and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
some foam in there and got it down and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.590 
some foam in there and got it down and
then<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.320> put<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> tiny<00:01:41.159> bit<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.490> bondo<00:01:41.850> that

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
then I put like a tiny bit of bondo that

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.139 
then I put like a tiny bit of bondo that
should<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.110> should<00:01:43.170> stay<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.979> stick<00:01:45.079> but<00:01:46.079> a

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
should it should stay and stick but a

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.630 
should it should stay and stick but a
like<00:01:47.929> I<00:01:48.049> said<00:01:48.109> I<00:01:48.259> put<00:01:48.409> bondo<00:01:48.829> to<00:01:49.250> make<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:49.520> edge

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
like I said I put bondo to make the edge

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.599 
like I said I put bondo to make the edge
a<00:01:49.670> little<00:01:49.880> bit<00:01:50.149> nicer<00:01:52.090> better<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:55.310> sides

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
a little bit nicer better that sides

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.870 
a little bit nicer better that sides
done<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:56.030> same<00:01:56.240> way<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.920> I<00:01:58.130> sanded<00:01:58.490> this<00:01:58.670> foil

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
done the same way and I sanded this foil

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.359 
done the same way and I sanded this foil
so<00:01:59.210> it's<00:01:59.630> going<00:01:59.840> to<00:01:59.899> stick<00:02:00.109> I<00:02:03.009> just<00:02:04.009> have<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.250> be

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
so it's going to stick I just have to be

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.760 
so it's going to stick I just have to be
careful<00:02:04.729> when<00:02:04.850> I'm<00:02:04.939> taking<00:02:05.119> this<00:02:05.329> paper<00:02:05.600> out

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
careful when I'm taking this paper out

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.710 
careful when I'm taking this paper out
not<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.950> like<00:02:07.069> rip<00:02:07.399> off<00:02:07.579> the<00:02:07.789> paint<00:02:08.060> or

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
not to like rip off the paint or

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.080 
not to like rip off the paint or
anything<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.440> bed<00:02:09.590> liner<00:02:09.789> because<00:02:10.789> I<00:02:10.819> went

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
anything the bed liner because I went

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.000 
anything the bed liner because I went
down<00:02:11.239> onto<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:11.690> edge<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:11.900> little<00:02:12.110> bit<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.650> guess

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
down onto this edge a little bit I guess

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.440 
down onto this edge a little bit I guess
I'm<00:02:13.129> gonna<00:02:13.220> have<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.489> cut<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.760> with<00:02:13.879> a<00:02:13.910> razor<00:02:14.120> or

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
I'm gonna have to cut it with a razor or

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.569 
I'm gonna have to cut it with a razor or
something<00:02:16.060> but<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:18.430> think<00:02:19.430> that's<00:02:19.610> about<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:19.880> I

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
something but I think that's about it I

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.420 
something but I think that's about it I
put<00:02:22.579> some<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.530> bed<00:02:24.530> liner<00:02:24.739> on<00:02:24.980> top<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.340> that

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
put some of the bed liner on top of that

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.940 
put some of the bed liner on top of that
wood<00:02:25.670> just<00:02:26.660> in<00:02:26.870> case<00:02:27.049> like<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.440> little<00:02:27.769> few

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
wood just in case like a little few

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.710 
wood just in case like a little few
drops<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.340> water<00:02:28.489> get<00:02:28.730> through<00:02:28.940> which<00:02:29.540> I'm

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
drops of water get through which I'm

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.809 
drops of water get through which I'm
sure<00:02:29.870> they're<00:02:30.079> not<00:02:30.110> because<00:02:30.829> I<00:02:31.900> can't<00:02:32.900> see<00:02:33.140> it

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
sure they're not because I can't see it

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.449 
sure they're not because I can't see it
put<00:02:34.819> those<00:02:36.370> little<00:02:37.370> blobs<00:02:38.079> right<00:02:39.079> there<00:02:39.560> in

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
put those little blobs right there in

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.920 
put those little blobs right there in
front<00:02:40.519> of<00:02:40.730> my<00:02:40.849> finger<00:02:41.200> are<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:44.120> ends<00:02:44.569> of<00:02:44.690> duct

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
once you get it's on you it's kind of

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.030 
once you get it's on you it's kind of
hard<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.239> get<00:03:08.420> off<00:03:08.569> so<00:03:10.209> if<00:03:11.209> you're<00:03:11.450> ever<00:03:11.630> doing

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
hard to get off so if you're ever doing

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.610 
hard to get off so if you're ever doing
bed<00:03:13.040> cutting<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:14.359> try<00:03:15.049> not<00:03:15.079> to<00:03:15.260> get<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.560> on

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
bed cutting just try not to get it on

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.309 
bed cutting just try not to get it on
yourself

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
yourself

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.930 
yourself
the<00:03:18.319> sucky<00:03:18.739> thing<00:03:18.919> is<00:03:19.040> it's<00:03:19.400> not<00:03:19.579> the<00:03:19.760> one<00:03:19.910> that

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
the sucky thing is it's not the one that

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.220 
the sucky thing is it's not the one that
matches<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.690> doors<00:03:22.180> but<00:03:23.180> it's<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:23.810> lot<00:03:23.989> thicker

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
matches the doors but it's a lot thicker

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.050 
matches the doors but it's a lot thicker
so<00:03:24.799> it<00:03:24.980> looks<00:03:25.160> like<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.430> professionals

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
so it looks like the professionals

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.849 
so it looks like the professionals
sprayed<00:03:26.359> on<00:03:26.540> kind<00:03:27.609> so<00:03:28.609> I<00:03:28.970> guess<00:03:29.720> that's<00:03:29.900> the

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
sprayed on kind so I guess that's the

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.309 
sprayed on kind so I guess that's the
good<00:03:30.889> part<00:03:31.310> about<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:32.139> everything's<00:03:33.139> still

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
good part about it everything's still

good part about it everything's still
