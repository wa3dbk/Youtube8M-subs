00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.649
 Hello my name is Stas and this 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.800
 Softklab company and so many 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.849
 the question became after the release especially ios 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.310
 7.1 beta 1 version of what is the term 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.150
 action troubles and when it expires and a lot 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.970
 much more 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.070
 every time the beta is released 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.050
 any device that is not important 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.480
 is it like an iphone or the same 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.490
 this you are you a magician with him and the term 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.040
 actions that is, well, this person 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.140
 system what does it mean an example you 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.770
 use and release well, for example, 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.590
 will be and I am 704 as it comes out today 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.070
 first beta next firmware and 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.480
 you update it you update it you 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.550
 pre-download because with 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.059
 release go to beta 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.559
 vayfay impossible for you download it 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.390
 further click if you have windows to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.329
 shift update choose operating 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.899
 system if you have mac then you choose 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.300
 alt well, either he is an option on the first 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.640
 firmware and 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.040
 update the pop file 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.920
 updated on counting the essence before 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.770
 there was such a thing that you could 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.570
 update without 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.330
 without a developer account, let's say 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.820
 because and beta just 7 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.860
 I am looking for firmware when everyone sat on 6 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.960
 It could be done here but also to the girl I 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.899
 that's just in December, we got this 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.180
 banana him because without account 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.789
 now your device is not activated 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.369
 that's as far as beta firmware is concerned 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.380
 now this expiration yes what is it 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.640
 does that mean that if 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.240
 out of that 7.1 beta 1 for example 1 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.640
 December 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.100
 not valid for her valid up to 1 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.720
 January that at least means that 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.000
 The next beta version will be released before January 1 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.770
 this is understandable yes because it cannot be 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.539
 such that the beta version is the first 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.940
 over and the second is still no such 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.390
 It happens like a miniature that says: 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:10.470
 what about apologize about the firmware 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:13.360
 will be released earlier and then you will have 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.510
 brick if you do not upgrade to the next 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.130
 firmware this means that if 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.380
 January 1, you are not updated for the second 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.019
 a beta version that is already coming out for you 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.620
 here it will be written about what you do not 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.329
 are your phone developer 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.579
 unable to activate if you 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.420
 really not a developer and you 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.510
 no 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.320
 This is called a sensitive screen. 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.510
 this word can be seen in aytyuns 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.230
 right from your every device there 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.690
 displays it needs to be added to the base apple 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.120
 on it is based on there developers it 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.209
 also done if you need to do it 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.500
 costs there from 10 to 50 dollars 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.989
 write me either by mail or there 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.590
 skype anywhere see all contact on 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.319
 screen I will help if you do not add something 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.319
 your iphone is simply not activated if 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.109
 add it all good it does not matter you sit 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.549
 for example on beta just 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.620
 update the next baht version 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.370
 activate your devices but in 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.000
 basically everything 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.680
 so today today if 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.530
 you are not a developer 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.850
 or you do not have your registered 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.640
 grandfather in 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.150
 Apple I do not recommend bad 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.480
 versions to play in principle transition from 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.220
 first beta version to second one was 7.1 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.050
 problematic in people because before 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.780
 plan when this is not watched today 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.810
 she took it very strongly therefore 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.610
 How can I put 3 beta separately? 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.910
 version or fourth beta which 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.680
 today is relevant I don't know 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.330
 checked but by the way it will be possible to carry out 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.980
 I'll take the device somehow I'll check 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.240
 be sure to accomplish your goal by video data 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.470
 external devices that are not 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.300
 activated and so here if you don't want 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.160
 try on this one fishing rod 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.050
 just use what you have today 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.620
 there is either pay money and 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.510
 enjoy all the privileges of the new 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.260
 beta here's the principle all that's why 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.850
 will be there 7.2 beta though its it already in 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.680
 I believe a little, that is, if it comes out now 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.620
 official rather not if and when 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.510
 official 7.1 will be released next bad version 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.030
 I already think that they will not be again 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.160
 starting from 8 that is in the summer when necessary 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.190
 It was add disie show us how 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.110
