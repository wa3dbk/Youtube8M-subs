00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 Y 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.060
 m 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.599
 I'm going to practice a topic that I see that a 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.970
 all moms interests us is what 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.220
 do with a child does not want to eat 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.259
 probing itself experten is the subject but yes 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.970
 to breastfeed and what I do with my son 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.739
 I want to share it to see if it helps 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.419
 now is that after I read him 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.390
 because we enter these periods of 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.430
 mono diet or total hunger and then 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.260
 obviously that is worrying one wants 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.020
 know how to fix it does not happen to you 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.399
 that more or less I learned what has 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.649
 served now is that I follow 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.280
 applying and I feel that we can all 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.059
 eat in peace and respecting the cycles of 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.690
 child the first point is mom not in what 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.949
 what is gas does not have to be 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.870
 threatened despaired I do not know at the time 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.909
 of food will always be a field of 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.699
 battle that is eaten that does not eat the 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:02.219
 blackmail and then there and then it 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.809
 it all comes back very very very dramatic 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.640
 when it really is meal time 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.100
 and the children, well, the appetite of 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.799
 they very very variable by this of the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.630
 growth rates decelerated the 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.030
 appetites are different then 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.789
 really the idea is new not to be 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.100
 quiet not in what will be a comfortable 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.530
 more so that the child does not perceive me either 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.679
 that anxiety and then be greater the 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.750
 food refusal point 2 is 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.229
 They are going to offer me and I try to be 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.229
 two options 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.179
 of squeamishness to the community that I follow 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.950
 being but at that time it was much more 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.719
 so by regular treatment I give you two 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.210
 options the first one is the one that we're 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.819
 eating thing like adults 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.439
 I say vehemently with chile and so on 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.409
 its variations but I try to give it 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.630
 that option and if not then I give it the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.030
 always not the classic one that never fails and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.709
 that's what is grabbing of lost a 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.750
 I'm just a wave 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.520
 like this then like this and so on 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.750
 then I give him what I already know that he does not 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.070
 he will say no if 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.770
 I was hungry 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.810
 3 you need more than the account does not have 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.960
 case to be here please as best in 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.150
 the mouth still like that one plus the last one far 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.250
 and one tries to make all the voices are 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.560
 he sings of the jungle as if all this 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.270
 true if you do not want to eat you will not eat 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.770
 and I think the message should not be 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.780
 an amount that you are not hungry and you 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.340
 eat the truth is that they listen more 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.140
 his little body of what we like 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.090
 adults, we sometimes have hunger 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.620
 emotional and we eat by act or because 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.050
 is available they are not like that 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.270
 then the ideal is to respect your appetite 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.010
 If they are not hungry, they will eat later 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.650
 to dine the phrase of all the grandmothers 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.290
 and it is totally true and will eat will 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.880
 eat a little while and when he wants to 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.150
 obviously they let you know and nobody goes 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.500
 to have to be fighting with 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.200
 because I eat because I do not eat 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.090
 in another point do not give prizes for eating 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.620
 we go because sometimes we are careful to 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.630
 which is that if you finish this I'm going to 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.880
 adapt then as you should not 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.100
 have not this kind of reward for 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.320
 eat what you will eat is a 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.360
 need and request then we do not have 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.830
 why reward for doing something that 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.709
 naturally we should do what 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.480
 grouper by not need then do not pass 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.950
 nothing with nothing else as good in the morning 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.990
 and then already the use commented the day does not pass 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.670
 nothing with nothing else dinner good appetites 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.350
 they are varied the truth is that someone 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.690
 He said we have to eat three times at 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.820
 day and not necessarily they go with 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.190
 this rhythm will later be adapted but 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.110
 now they eat once or twice well 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.820
 sometimes three times well and sometimes not 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.540
 they eat three four days every time that 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.120
 is independent and is very very individual 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.770
 10 its rate of growth which is 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.180
 an important point to the mansur I 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.220
 I consider super important is that when 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.270
 they are in these stages that it seems 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.490
 our stand 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.890
 in full famine the ideal is that what 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.860
 little or almost nothing that you eat is healthy 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.260
 it's worth nothing if you eat only once 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.060
 or twice are sweet chocolates 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.800
 highly processed cookies 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.570
 and all this will be descriptions can 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.090
 weaken terminological that's already 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.070
 another story then how little you eat 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.550
 or almost nobody eat that is healthy 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.680
 that's super important and I try not to 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.500
 give him snacks in that period because 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.360
 then I am suffering say the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.790
 part that could get to eat something else 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.520
 more I'm quite substances in the house 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.970
 so if it 's not give them snacks in those 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.030
 periods when you do not want to eat and if 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.530
 whatever fruit is that I am took him 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.720
 some snacks because it 's in the 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.780
 terrible 200 apart with hypoglycemia 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.220
 well it would be very very this nobody 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.380
 we would pass it directly that is to say he tried 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.360
 to take some snacks but live half 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.360
 apple with chili and everything took a 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.409
 banana or something like that and it's the only thing 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.039
 I can give why 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:43.830
 I try that when then it's more or 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.119
 less here are the tips that 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.339
 I wanted to use that really is what to me 

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:50.009
 it works for me and obviously I get there 

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:52.709
 relax at the table relaxed and not 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:55.110
 associate the time of the meal they go to 

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:56.669
 associate food with something with something 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.459
 stressful to go manifest 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.709
 scolded by all this I think that as 

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:04.050
 as I said it is a is a necessity 

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:06.749
 basic therefore you should not reward 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.219
 you should not punish either nor 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:10.289
 to go around comparing what the boy is 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:11.069
 me or well and that is that they eat very badly 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.889
 and child 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:16.169
 nothing better I think that being 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:19.079
 rewarding positively I do not mean with 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.849
 with commercial reding compliments that 

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:23.069
 you ate well hey you go down for you 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:24.629
 Strong saw this really big this 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:26.489
 motivates us much more always the responsibility 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:28.589
 positive is much better than the 

00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:31.619
 negative possibly the moment what 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:33.300
 do but this brings other things more 

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:34.860
 go ahead that we do not want then I 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.469
 I think the positive reinforcement be 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.989
 calm respect their own cycles and 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.940
 I put anything that is very very very 

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:43.250
 healthy 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.940
 is the summary of all this crime and 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.940
 I hope it has served you
