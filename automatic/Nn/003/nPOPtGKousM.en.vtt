and for this video we're gonna we're
gonna<00:00:07.080> look<00:00:07.410> at<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.770> neuron<00:00:08.189> model<00:00:08.990> this

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
gonna look at the neuron model this

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.220 
gonna look at the neuron model this
whole<00:00:10.290> thing<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.860> neuron<00:00:11.099> model<00:00:12.230> the

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
whole thing is the neuron model the

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.600 
whole thing is the neuron model the
parts<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.889> need<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.160> know<00:00:14.280> for<00:00:14.490> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
parts that you need to know for the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
place where dendrites are if I turn the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.200 
place where dendrites are if I turn the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
model kind of sideways back here our

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.380 
model kind of sideways back here our
dendrites

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.580 

these<00:01:06.200> rubbery<00:01:06.890> things<00:01:07.960> that<00:01:08.960> come<00:01:09.320> in<00:01:09.440> and

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
these rubbery things that come in and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.380 
these rubbery things that come in and
connect<00:01:10.040> to<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.730> cell<00:01:11.630> body<00:01:11.870> or<00:01:12.170> soma<00:01:12.440> or<00:01:13.390> that

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
connect to the cell body or soma or that

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.900 
connect to the cell body or soma or that
connect<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.930> dendrites<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:19.220> rubbery<00:01:19.550> things

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
connect to dendrites the rubbery things

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.540 
connect to dendrites the rubbery things
are<00:01:20.120> actually<00:01:20.470> axon<00:01:21.470> terminals<00:01:22.040> from<00:01:22.340> other

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
are actually axon terminals from other

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.830 
are actually axon terminals from other
neurons<00:01:23.979> so<00:01:24.979> if<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.310> sticker<00:01:25.610> is<00:01:25.940> on<00:01:26.300> one<00:01:26.810> of

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
neurons so if the sticker is on one of

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.060 
neurons so if the sticker is on one of
those<00:01:27.460> rubbery<00:01:28.460> structures<00:01:29.590> axon<00:01:30.590> terminal

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
those rubbery structures axon terminal

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.270 
those rubbery structures axon terminal
is<00:01:31.190> probably<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.760> correct<00:01:32.090> thing<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.390> say

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
is probably the correct thing to say

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.730 
is probably the correct thing to say
now<00:01:34.280> if<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.580> sticker<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:35.180> stuck<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.870> both<00:01:36.140> this

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
now if the sticker is stuck to both this

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.930 
now if the sticker is stuck to both this
rubbery<00:01:37.190> part<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:38.290> to<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:40.310> part<00:01:40.580> on<00:01:40.729> this

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
rubbery part and to the part on this

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.640 
rubbery part and to the part on this
neuron<00:01:41.330> that<00:01:41.450> it's<00:01:41.570> attached<00:01:41.900> to<00:01:42.170> then<00:01:42.500> I'm

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
neuron that it's attached to then I'm

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.710 
neuron that it's attached to then I'm
asking<00:01:43.040> for<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.340> connection<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.090> again

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
asking for the connection and again

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.300 
asking for the connection and again
always<00:01:45.140> read<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.410> question<00:01:45.830> because<00:01:46.070> if<00:01:46.190> I'm

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
always read the question because if I'm

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.430 
always read the question because if I'm
asking<00:01:46.670> for<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.910> connection<00:01:47.479> that's<00:01:48.050> called

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
asking for the connection that's called

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.359 
asking for the connection that's called
a<00:01:48.560> synapse<00:01:49.660> for<00:01:50.660> synapse<00:01:51.140> these<00:01:51.890> structures

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
a synapse for synapse these structures

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.150 
a synapse for synapse these structures
up<00:01:52.580> here<00:01:52.910> which<00:01:53.060> have<00:01:53.240> yellow<00:01:53.479> in<00:01:53.660> them<00:01:54.160> that

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
up here which have yellow in them that

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.999 
up here which have yellow in them that
connection<00:01:55.700> between<00:01:56.060> this<00:01:56.660> axon<00:01:57.440> terminal

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
connection between this axon terminal

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.249

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
and this cell body of the next neuron

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.400 
and this cell body of the next neuron
that's<00:02:01.250> also<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:01.820> synapse<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:03.050> there's

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
that's also a synapse and there's

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.210 
that's also a synapse and there's
another<00:02:03.680> synapse<00:02:04.250> down<00:02:04.520> here<00:02:05.979> this<00:02:06.979> is<00:02:07.190> a

another synapse down here this is a

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.470 
another synapse down here this is a
synapse<00:02:08.200> their<00:02:09.200> synapse<00:02:10.450> everywhere<00:02:11.450> a

synapse their synapse everywhere a

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.410 
synapse their synapse everywhere a

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
synapse on this picture of a neuron you

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.360 
synapse on this picture of a neuron you
could<00:02:17.600> also<00:02:17.750> be<00:02:18.080> asked<00:02:18.440> about<00:02:18.530> things<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.250> this

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
could also be asked about things so this

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.420 
could also be asked about things so this
would<00:02:19.580> be<00:02:19.670> cell<00:02:19.940> body<00:02:20.299> or<00:02:20.690> soma<00:02:21.010> this<00:02:22.010> would<00:02:22.280> be

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
would be cell body or soma this would be

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.979 
would be cell body or soma this would be

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.780 
for physiology the axon hillock is
important<00:03:58.260> because<00:03:58.409> it<00:03:59.010> is<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.549> place<00:03:59.670> where

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
important because it is the place where

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.470 
important because it is the place where
action<00:04:00.599> potentials<00:04:01.230> actually<00:04:01.829> start<00:04:02.480> back

it starts around minus 70 millivolts if

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.339 
it starts around minus 70 millivolts if
it<00:05:01.770> becomes<00:05:02.010> more<00:05:02.159> positive<00:05:02.520> up<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.389> minus<00:05:03.810> 55

it becomes more positive up to minus 55

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.990 
it becomes more positive up to minus 55
millivolts<00:05:04.740> then<00:05:06.289> that<00:05:07.289> can<00:05:07.560> cause<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:08.460> axon

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
millivolts then that can cause the axon

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.290 
millivolts then that can cause the axon
hillock<00:05:09.740> to<00:05:10.740> initiate<00:05:11.310> an<00:05:11.550> action<00:05:11.669> potential

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
hillock to initiate an action potential

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.000 
hillock to initiate an action potential
and<00:05:12.659> that<00:05:12.840> action<00:05:13.139> potential<00:05:13.440> will<00:05:13.650> go<00:05:13.800> down

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
and that action potential will go down

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.700 
and that action potential will go down
the<00:05:14.190> axon<00:05:16.909> the<00:05:17.909> Schwann<00:05:18.180> cells<00:05:18.630> these<00:05:19.229> yellow

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
the axon the Schwann cells these yellow

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.830 
the axon the Schwann cells these yellow
cells<00:05:20.039> that<00:05:20.310> surround<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.909> axon<00:05:21.389> are<00:05:21.630> called

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
cells that surround the axon are called

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.129 
cells that surround the axon are called
Schwann<00:05:22.080> cells<00:05:22.940> so<00:05:23.940> this<00:05:24.180> is<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.389> Schwann<00:05:24.750> cell

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
Schwann cells so this is a Schwann cell

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.180 
Schwann cells so this is a Schwann cell
and<00:05:25.440> this<00:05:26.400> cell<00:05:26.460> up<00:05:27.030> here<00:05:27.570> is<00:05:27.800> also<00:05:28.800> a<00:05:28.830> Schwann

cell<00:05:31.310> myelin<00:05:32.310> is<00:05:32.520> what<00:05:32.849> the<00:05:32.970> Schwann<00:05:33.210> cells

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
cell myelin is what the Schwann cells

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.320 
cell myelin is what the Schwann cells
produce

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
produce

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.309

we see the axon surrounded by myelin and

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.330 
we see the axon surrounded by myelin and
then<00:06:59.980> the<00:07:00.130> axon<00:07:00.490> terminals<00:07:00.970> for<00:07:01.300> motor<00:07:01.480> fibers

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
then the axon terminals for motor fibers

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.430 
then the axon terminals for motor fibers
look<00:07:03.340> something<00:07:03.700> like<00:07:03.730> this<00:07:04.120> and<00:07:04.480> they<00:07:05.200> make<00:07:05.410> a
