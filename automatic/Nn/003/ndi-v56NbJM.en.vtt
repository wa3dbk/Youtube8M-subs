00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hey what is up guys Jeremy here and I

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.940 
hey what is up guys Jeremy here and I
got<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.730> really<00:00:03.030> cool<00:00:03.270> combo<00:00:04.080> for<00:00:04.410> you<00:00:04.470> guys<00:00:04.620> to

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
got a really cool combo for you guys to

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.519 
got a really cool combo for you guys to
tweaks<00:00:05.250> here<00:00:05.430> that<00:00:05.609> make<00:00:05.759> up<00:00:05.879> this<00:00:06.060> kind<00:00:06.330> of

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
tweaks here that make up this kind of

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.589 
tweaks here that make up this kind of
style<00:00:07.529> passcode<00:00:08.160> input<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:09.269> think<00:00:09.480> it's

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
style passcode input and I think it's

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.060 
style passcode input and I think it's
really<00:00:09.780> really<00:00:10.019> secure<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.679> thought<00:00:10.860> it<00:00:10.950> was<00:00:11.010> a

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
really really secure I thought it was a

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.980 
really really secure I thought it was a
cool<00:00:11.250> combo<00:00:11.610> like<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.880> said<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.660> I'll<00:00:12.719> show<00:00:12.900> it

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
cool combo like I said so I'll show it

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.810 
cool combo like I said so I'll show it
off<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.290> guys<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:13.679> like<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.519> said<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:14.759> is

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
off to you guys so like I said this is

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.090 
off to you guys so like I said this is
to<00:00:15.210> separate<00:00:15.780> tweaks<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.289> if<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.800> use<00:00:16.830> them

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
to separate tweaks that if you use them

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.410 
to separate tweaks that if you use them
together<00:00:17.220> you'll<00:00:17.580> get<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.820> same<00:00:17.940> setup<00:00:18.210> that

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
together you'll get the same setup that

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.230 
together you'll get the same setup that
I<00:00:18.449> have<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.250> basically<00:00:20.250> we<00:00:20.430> have<00:00:20.460> simple

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
I have so basically we have simple

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.759 
I have so basically we have simple
passcode<00:00:21.689> buttons<00:00:22.020> as<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.470> guys<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.710> see

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
passcode buttons as you guys can see

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:23.950 
passcode buttons as you guys can see
this<00:00:22.980> tweak<00:00:23.220> has<00:00:23.310> been<00:00:23.460> around<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.910> while

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
this tweak has been around for a while

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.910 
this tweak has been around for a while
and<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.050> really<00:00:25.230> like<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.410> way<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.560> looks<00:00:25.590> it's

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
and I really like the way it looks it's

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.740 
and I really like the way it looks it's
simplified<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.699> might<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.210> confusing<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
simplified it might be confusing to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.390 
simplified it might be confusing to
somebody<00:00:28.080> that's<00:00:28.170> trying<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.619> get<00:00:28.949> into<00:00:29.189> your

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
somebody that's trying to get into your

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.250 
somebody that's trying to get into your
phone<00:00:29.670> because<00:00:30.599> they<00:00:30.689> can't<00:00:30.869> actually<00:00:30.990> see

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
phone because they can't actually see

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.690 
phone because they can't actually see
the<00:00:31.380> numbers<00:00:31.740> I'm<00:00:31.920> sure<00:00:32.099> they<00:00:32.250> could<00:00:32.309> probably

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
the numbers I'm sure they could probably

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.479 
the numbers I'm sure they could probably
figure<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.390> out<00:00:33.540> if<00:00:34.350> they're<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:35.130> know<00:00:35.160> if

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
figure it out if they're you know if

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.680 
figure it out if they're you know if
they<00:00:35.610> have<00:00:35.760> their<00:00:35.910> own<00:00:35.940> iPhone<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.570> if

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
they have their own iPhone but if

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.450 
they have their own iPhone but if
they're<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.320> know<00:00:37.440> an<00:00:37.559> Android<00:00:37.920> user<00:00:37.980> this

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
they're you know an Android user this

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.280 
they're you know an Android user this
might<00:00:38.670> look<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.210> know<00:00:39.329> somewhat<00:00:39.780> confusing

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
might look you know somewhat confusing

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.049 
might look you know somewhat confusing
if<00:00:40.379> they've<00:00:40.530> never<00:00:40.620> seen<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.640> or<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:41.910> they

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
if they've never seen it or if they

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.420 
if they've never seen it or if they
don't<00:00:42.629> use<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> regular<00:00:43.260> basis<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.010> then

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
don't use it on a regular basis and then

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.279 
don't use it on a regular basis and then
the<00:00:44.550> other<00:00:44.579> tweak<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.090> called<00:00:45.329> time<00:00:45.719> pass<00:00:46.050> code

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
the other tweak is called time pass code

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.529 
the other tweak is called time pass code
where<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.710> use<00:00:46.860> your<00:00:47.070> time<00:00:47.399> your<00:00:48.300> current

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
where you can use your time your current

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.569 
where you can use your time your current
time<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.960> your<00:00:49.050> device<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.950> passcode<00:00:50.399> so

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
time on your device as the passcode so

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.720 
time on your device as the passcode so
my<00:00:50.700> passcode<00:00:51.059> right<00:00:51.239> now<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.600> 0<00:00:52.440> 6<00:00:52.860> 44<00:00:53.460> that's

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
my passcode right now is 0 6 44 that's

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.310 
my passcode right now is 0 6 44 that's
the<00:00:53.850> pass<00:00:54.030> code<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.270> get<00:00:54.449> into<00:00:54.660> my<00:00:54.750> device<00:00:55.079> and

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the pass code to get into my device and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.729 
the pass code to get into my device and
now<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:55.890> changed<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.579> 0<00:00:57.000> 6<00:00:57.300> 45<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
now it just changed to 0 6 45 so the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.229 
now it just changed to 0 6 45 so the
cool<00:00:58.859> thing<00:00:58.890> about<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.430> obviously<00:00:59.789> you

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
cool thing about this is obviously you

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.209 
cool thing about this is obviously you
can't<00:01:00.420> see<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> numbers<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.710> passcode

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
can't see the numbers and the passcode

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.939 
can't see the numbers and the passcode
is<00:01:02.250> basically<00:01:02.820> forever<00:01:03.149> changing<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.799> if

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
is basically forever changing so if

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.200 
is basically forever changing so if
you're<00:01:05.100> worried<00:01:05.309> about<00:01:05.339> somebody<00:01:05.670> that's<00:01:05.939> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you're worried about somebody that's you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.660 
you're worried about somebody that's you
know<00:01:06.530> watching<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.799> input<00:01:08.159> your<00:01:08.189> passcode

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
know watching you input your passcode

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.890 
know watching you input your passcode
all<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.970> time<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.330> they<00:01:09.420> might<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.720> able<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
all the time and they might be able to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.570 
all the time and they might be able to
figure<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.140> out<00:01:10.200> by<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.650> know<00:01:10.799> maybe<00:01:11.310> looking

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
figure it out by you know maybe looking

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.890 
figure it out by you know maybe looking
over<00:01:11.729> your<00:01:11.820> shoulder<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.210> seeing<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.540> input

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
over your shoulder and seeing you input

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.410 
over your shoulder and seeing you input
the<00:01:12.930> passcode<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> good<00:01:14.520> way<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> kind

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the passcode this is a good way to kind

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.090 
the passcode this is a good way to kind
of<00:01:15.570> make<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.530> they'll<00:01:16.680> never<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:17.040> able

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
of make it so that they'll never be able

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.260 
of make it so that they'll never be able
to<00:01:17.220> figure<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.549> out<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.880> let's<00:01:18.000> go<00:01:18.090> ahead<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
to figure it out so let's go ahead and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.679 
to figure it out so let's go ahead and
do<00:01:18.960> our<00:01:18.990> passcode<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.700> then<00:01:20.729> we

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
do our passcode just like so and then we

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.960 
do our passcode just like so and then we
will<00:01:21.840> go<00:01:22.020> into<00:01:22.229> system<00:01:22.740> preferences<00:01:23.220> here<00:01:23.280> so

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
will go into system preferences here so

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.880 
will go into system preferences here so
here<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.049> preferences<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:25.680> time

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
here is the the preferences for time

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.460 
here is the the preferences for time
pass<00:01:26.070> code<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.450> on/off<00:01:28.229> switch

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
pass code I just have the on/off switch

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.950 
pass code I just have the on/off switch
at<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.710> top<00:01:28.829> there<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.939> allow<00:01:30.299> your<00:01:30.600> true

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
at the top there you can allow your true

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.230 
at the top there you can allow your true
passcode<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.619> unlock<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.130> device<00:01:32.220> as<00:01:32.549> well<00:01:32.759> so

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
passcode to unlock the device as well so

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.719 
passcode to unlock the device as well so
the<00:01:33.390> pass<00:01:33.540> code<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.960> set<00:01:34.170> up<00:01:34.290> with<00:01:34.470> in

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
the pass code that you set up with in

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.399 
the pass code that you set up with in
touch<00:01:35.729> ID<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.119> passcode<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.689> then<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.290> can

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
touch ID and passcode and then you can

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.950 
touch ID and passcode and then you can
also<00:01:37.590> reverse<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.640> passcode<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.479> time<00:01:39.720> pass

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
also reverse the passcode the time pass

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.899 
also reverse the passcode the time pass
code<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> time

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
code so that you can have it be the time

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.580 
code so that you can have it be the time
but<00:01:42.119> backwards<00:01:42.420> which<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.020> really<00:01:43.170> cool<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
but backwards which is really cool and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.950 
but backwards which is really cool and
if<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.670> decide<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.180> want<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.450> upgrade<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
if you decide you want to upgrade to the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.120 
if you decide you want to upgrade to the
pro<00:01:45.990> version<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.189> even<00:01:47.369> set<00:01:47.700> an<00:01:47.850> offset

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
pro version you can even set an offset

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.800 
pro version you can even set an offset
for<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.399> time<00:01:50.610> let's<00:01:50.850> say<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.720> know

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
for the time let's say it's you know

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.050 
for the time let's say it's you know
it's<00:01:51.840> 645<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.070> add<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.520> offset

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
it's 645 now and if you add a offset

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.719 
it's 645 now and if you add a offset
let's<00:01:54.720> say<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.110> don't<00:01:55.290> know<00:01:55.350> plus<00:01:55.619> 10<00:01:55.950> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
let's say I don't know plus 10 the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.679 
let's say I don't know plus 10 the
passcode<00:01:57.149> would<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.649> 0<00:01:59.119> 656<00:02:00.119> right<00:02:00.329> now<00:02:00.479> so

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
passcode would be 0 656 right now so

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.789 
passcode would be 0 656 right now so
that<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> passcode<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.530> there's<00:02:01.680> an

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
that be the passcode so there's an

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.020 
that be the passcode so there's an
offset<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.219> make<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.579> even<00:02:02.759> more<00:02:02.880> confusing

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
offset to make it even more confusing

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.350 
offset to make it even more confusing
but<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.020> think<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:06.270> know

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
but I think that this is you know

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.730 
but I think that this is you know
perfectly<00:02:06.719> fine<00:02:06.960> with<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.469> free

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
perfectly fine with just the free

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.529 
perfectly fine with just the free
version<00:02:07.920> because<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.489> can<00:02:08.610> reverse<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.330> time

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
version because you can reverse the time

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.330 
version because you can reverse the time
pass<00:02:09.750> code<00:02:09.989> which<00:02:10.500> I'll<00:02:10.679> actually<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:11.160> because

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
pass code which I'll actually do because

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.500 
pass code which I'll actually do because
that's<00:02:11.489> really<00:02:11.849> slick<00:02:12.270> actually<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.870> then

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
that's really slick actually and then

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.990 
that's really slick actually and then
we'll<00:02:14.140> go<00:02:14.230> over<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.010> system<00:02:15.430> settings<00:02:15.790> for

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
we'll go over to the system settings for

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.059 
we'll go over to the system settings for
simple<00:02:16.330> passcode<00:02:16.689> buttons<00:02:17.019> very<00:02:17.680> simple

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
simple passcode buttons very simple

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.220 
simple passcode buttons very simple
these<00:02:18.189> are<00:02:18.310> both<00:02:18.430> free<00:02:18.670> tweaks<00:02:18.939> so<00:02:19.810> here<00:02:20.079> are

these are both free tweaks so here are

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.660 
these are both free tweaks so here are

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
the button styles you can choose from

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.460 
the button styles you can choose from
there's<00:02:21.849> default<00:02:22.299> hide<00:02:22.569> letters<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.110> then

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
there's default hide letters and then

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.960 
there's default hide letters and then
there's<00:02:23.620> hide<00:02:23.739> everything<00:02:24.040> like<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.459> how<00:02:24.939> I

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
there's hide everything like I how I
