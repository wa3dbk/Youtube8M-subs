00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.800
 The first thing we have to do to 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.570
 perform the cord as we did is 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.330
 paste the 8 silk strips inside the 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.790
 cap in this case we have used 2 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.580
 gray color 2 mustard color 2 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.320
 purple and 2 green for 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.910
 we put some droplets of 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.910
 glue inside the cap 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.660
 we apply by the walls 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.510
 and with a flat-nose pliers we 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.380
 we make sure that all the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.380
 ends inside 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.369
 now we pass the cap through the 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.500
 cumin disk and we hooked a weight 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.430
 that will help us to tighten the cord 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.430
 while we have it 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.729
 now we will place the cap on the 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.280
 hole center of the technical donut and 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.800
 heras will place in this order to 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.340
 side the first black dot the two venues 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.340
 purple 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.200
 down the two yellow rooms 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.340
 at one end the two gray seats 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.780
 has another end the greens 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.050
 we adjust releasing the strips until 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.440
 center the cap in the center of the 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.440
 disk 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.370
 now it is making a move 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.890
 very repetitive the silk cord of 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.629
 up we'll go straight down to this 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.519
 point below and the one below 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.819
 we will go straight to this point of 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.819
 above 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.830
 now we turn the record a quarter and 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.750
 we do the same again the above 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.400
 we lower it straight to the point below and the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.670
 from below we will upload it straight to the point of 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.670
 above 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.230
 ah 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.690
 we turn a quarter the disc we repeat the 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.620
 from above straight down 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.420
 from below correct up 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.420
 we turn a fourth disc 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:15.609
 low and the bottom one goes up 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:17.090
 Rotating the top floor and below the 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.099
 time 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.769
 if at some point we want to stop is 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.510
 better to leave the three threads down to 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.400
 that on returning we know that the one of the 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.670
 right we have to go up towards 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.670
 above 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.400
 in this way we continue to knit the 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.800
 lace up to get the length 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.450
 desired remember that you will find 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.730
 models of necklaces woven with this 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.239
 cubism technique in our magazines 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.239
 the workshop
