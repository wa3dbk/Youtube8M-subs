00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
wrapped in this which which I which I've

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.320 
wrapped in this which which I which I've
found<00:02:13.110> odd<00:02:13.400> once<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.519> opened<00:02:14.879> it<00:02:14.940> one<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.239> these

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
found odd once I opened it one of these

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.570 
found odd once I opened it one of these
popped<00:02:15.720> out<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.290> one<00:02:16.769> of<00:02:16.830> these<00:02:16.950> popped<00:02:17.340> out

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
so that's fun that's aside for no reason

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.860 
so that's fun that's aside for no reason

well you can see it this is going to be

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.750 
well you can see it this is going to be
what<00:03:19.260> we're<00:03:19.380> working<00:03:19.530> with<00:03:19.680> which<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.459> great

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
what we're working with which is great

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.870 
what we're working with which is great

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.960 
and apparently want to need this piece
it<00:03:23.900> guess<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.049> bridges<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.379> connection<00:03:25.950> as<00:03:26.549> for

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
it guess it bridges a connection as for

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.360 
it guess it bridges a connection as for
what<00:03:27.120> else<00:03:27.359> is<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.660> this<00:03:27.750> box<00:03:28.010> nothing<00:03:29.010> there's

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
what else is in this box nothing there's

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.330 
what else is in this box nothing there's
there's<00:03:29.790> nothing<00:03:30.090> else<00:03:30.209> in<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.450> box<00:03:30.629> so<00:03:31.340> at

there's nothing else in the box so at

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.860 
there's nothing else in the box so at
least<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:32.609> thing's<00:03:32.819> foamy<00:03:33.239> so<00:03:33.720> it's

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
least this thing's foamy so it's

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.050 
least this thing's foamy so it's
protected<00:03:34.519> hopefully<00:03:35.519> this<00:03:35.639> thing<00:03:35.790> doesn't

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060

this<00:03:40.620> thing<00:03:40.769> actually<00:03:40.889> could<00:03:41.280> probably<00:03:41.519> fail

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
this thing actually could probably fail

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.349 
this thing actually could probably fail
in<00:03:42.120> some<00:03:42.329> way<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:43.040> we'll<00:03:44.120> we'll<00:03:45.120> definitely

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
in some way so we'll we'll definitely

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.879 
in some way so we'll we'll definitely
see<00:03:45.599> how<00:03:45.750> this<00:03:45.870> goes<00:03:46.049> i'll<00:03:46.290> set<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.530> up<00:03:46.709> maybe

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
see how this goes i'll set it up maybe

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.220 
see how this goes i'll set it up maybe
make<00:03:47.099> some<00:03:47.280> videos<00:03:47.430> but<00:03:47.940> that's<00:03:48.389> my<00:03:48.599> random
