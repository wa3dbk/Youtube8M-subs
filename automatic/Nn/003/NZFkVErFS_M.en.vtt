decide whether it's across made every so
often<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.080> get<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> headers<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:28.619> would<00:01:29.430> you

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
often and get the headers but would you

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.010 
often and get the headers but would you
have<00:01:29.640> default<00:01:29.939> front<00:01:30.240> who<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.540> not<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
have default front who is not the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.350 
have default front who is not the
tallest<00:01:31.259> made<00:01:31.950> about<00:01:32.280> 548<00:01:32.790> I've<00:01:33.030> got<00:01:33.150> nine

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
tallest made about 548 I've got nine

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.300 
tallest made about 548 I've got nine
every<00:01:34.079> could<00:01:34.229> correct<00:01:34.590> me<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
every could correct me on that that the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.780 
every could correct me on that that the
young<00:01:35.549> good<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:37.130> we<00:01:38.130> didn't<00:01:38.310> come<00:01:38.460> into<00:01:38.579> this

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
