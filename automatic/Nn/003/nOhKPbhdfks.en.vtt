if you go to Walmart and you buy a bag
of<00:01:57.390> Doritos<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.869> guess<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.140> get<00:01:58.259> double<00:01:58.500> xp<00:01:58.860> but

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
of Doritos I guess you get double xp but

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.560 
of Doritos I guess you get double xp but
I<00:01:59.490> guess<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.820> don't<00:01:59.909> even<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.299> open<00:02:00.509> up

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
I guess you don't even have to open up

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.060 
I guess you don't even have to open up
the<00:02:00.659> back<00:02:00.869> end<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.530> code<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.009> I

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
the back end you can get the code and I

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.590 
the back end you can get the code and I
guess<00:02:02.219> hello<00:02:02.460> people<00:02:02.759> are<00:02:02.850> doing<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.540> I

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
guess hello people are doing that and I

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.760 
guess hello people are doing that and I
don't<00:02:03.689> see<00:02:03.899> what<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.079> problem<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.590> is

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
don't see what the problem with that is

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.560 
don't see what the problem with that is
because<00:02:05.340> apparently<00:02:05.850> there's<00:02:06.000> no<00:02:06.270> purchase

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
because apparently there's no purchase

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.300 
because apparently there's no purchase
necessary<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.619> know<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:07.860> free<00:02:08.039> double

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
necessary and you know it's free double

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.770
