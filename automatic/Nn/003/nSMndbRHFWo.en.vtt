and not too big of a head

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.650 
and not too big of a head
and<00:01:54.870> the<00:01:55.740> reason<00:01:55.890> why<00:01:56.190> most<00:01:56.820> ballerinas<00:01:57.510> you

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
and the reason why most ballerinas you

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.440 
and the reason why most ballerinas you
see<00:01:57.870> are<00:01:58.050> very<00:01:58.350> slim<00:01:58.800> is<00:01:59.640> because<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
see are very slim is because of the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.170 
see are very slim is because of the
dynamics<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.170> turning<00:02:01.680> if<00:02:02.400> the<00:02:02.700> hips<00:02:02.970> are

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
dynamics of turning if the hips are

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.840 
dynamics of turning if the hips are
wider<00:02:03.479> than<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.350> shoulders<00:02:04.460> is<00:02:05.460> very

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
wider than the shoulders is very

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.540 
wider than the shoulders is very
difficult<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.479> do<00:02:06.630> pirouettes

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
difficult to do pirouettes
