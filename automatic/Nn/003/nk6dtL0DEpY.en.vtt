00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
new game when you have touch controls

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.170 
new game when you have touch controls
you're<00:00:49.899> just<00:00:50.250> dragging<00:00:51.250> the<00:00:51.610> spaceship<00:00:52.000> which

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
you're just dragging the spaceship which

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.650 
you're just dragging the spaceship which
is<00:00:52.300> a<00:00:52.329> lot<00:00:52.540> easier<00:00:52.690> than<00:00:52.930> joystick<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:55.000> you

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
is a lot easier than joystick and you

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.790 
is a lot easier than joystick and you
don't<00:00:55.809> get<00:00:55.899> to<00:00:56.020> control<00:00:56.200> the<00:00:56.500> shooting

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
don't get to control the shooting

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.880 
don't get to control the shooting
shooting<00:00:57.130> it's<00:00:57.309> automatic<00:00:57.850> so<00:00:58.890> sometimes

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
shooting it's automatic so sometimes

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.720 
shooting it's automatic so sometimes
you're<00:01:00.010> just<00:01:00.040> not<00:01:00.280> going<00:01:00.370> to<00:01:00.430> be<00:01:00.520> able<00:01:00.550> to

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
you're just not going to be able to

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.990 
you're just not going to be able to
shoot<00:01:00.850> them<00:01:01.059> or<00:01:01.210> else<00:01:01.329> the<00:01:01.480> crash<00:01:01.719> into<00:01:02.020> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
shoot them or else the crash into you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.969 
shoot them or else the crash into you
okay<00:01:04.000> so<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.629> score<00:01:04.839> is<00:01:04.899> counted<00:01:05.619> in<00:01:05.740> top

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
okay so the score is counted in top

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.149 
okay so the score is counted in top
middle<00:01:06.960> your<00:01:07.960> health<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:08.440> in<00:01:08.620> the<00:01:08.710> top<00:01:08.860> right

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
and on top left you can see our score

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.310 
and on top left you can see our score
multiplier<00:01:12.370> now<00:01:12.940> as<00:01:13.120> you<00:01:13.150> kill<00:01:13.540> more<00:01:13.810> aliens

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
multiplier now as you kill more aliens

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.640 
multiplier now as you kill more aliens
your<00:01:14.950> scores<00:01:15.310> multiply<00:01:15.790> was<00:01:15.909> going<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.120> go<00:01:16.270> up

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
your scores multiply was going to go up

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.830 
your scores multiply was going to go up
and<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:18.700> you<00:01:18.970> see<00:01:19.150> there's<00:01:19.390> some<00:01:19.540> power-ups

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
and as you see there's some power-ups

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.930 
and as you see there's some power-ups
I'm<00:01:20.140> getting<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:20.979> those<00:01:21.130> also<00:01:21.549> increase<00:01:21.850> your

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
I'm getting and those also increase your

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.390 
I'm getting and those also increase your
score<00:01:22.150> multiplier<00:01:22.630> as<00:01:23.190> your<00:01:24.190> score

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
score multiplier as your score

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.430 
score multiplier as your score
multiplier<00:01:24.760> goes<00:01:25.000> up<00:01:25.180> of<00:01:25.330> course<00:01:25.930> your<00:01:26.140> score

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
multiplier goes up of course your score

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.980 
multiplier goes up of course your score
will<00:01:26.590> increase<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:27.190> lot<00:01:27.729> more<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:29.320> also<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
will increase a lot more and also the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.109 
will increase a lot more and also the
monsters<00:01:32.409> will<00:01:32.560> come<00:01:32.710> faster<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.790> game<00:01:33.970> will

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
monsters will come faster the game will

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.120 
monsters will come faster the game will
move<00:01:34.240> faster<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.320> music's<00:01:35.740> going<00:01:35.890> to<00:01:35.979> get

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
move faster the music's going to get

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.149 
move faster the music's going to get
more<00:01:36.280> intense<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:38.290> will<00:01:38.530> start<00:01:38.860> shooting

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
more intense and you will start shooting

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.740 
more intense and you will start shooting
a<00:01:39.220> lot<00:01:39.340> faster<00:01:39.790> so<00:01:40.510> right<00:01:40.659> now<00:01:40.689> it's<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.049> 24<00:01:42.750> so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
a lot faster so right now it's a 24 so

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.570 
a lot faster so right now it's a 24 so
let's<00:01:43.960> see<00:01:44.140> if<00:01:44.290> I<00:01:44.409> can<00:01:44.560> get<00:01:44.650> up<00:01:44.830> to<00:01:44.979> 50<00:01:45.430> that's

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
let's see if I can get up to 50 that's

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.200 
let's see if I can get up to 50 that's
that's<00:01:46.210> how<00:01:46.330> much<00:01:46.479> I<00:01:46.600> got<00:01:46.750> it<00:01:46.869> before<00:01:48.060> now<00:01:49.060> it's

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
that's how much I got it before now it's

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.810 
that's how much I got it before now it's
a<00:01:49.270> 29

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.030 

there's<00:01:53.630> also<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:53.960> health<00:01:54.230> power<00:01:54.500> up<00:01:54.740> like<00:01:54.920> I

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
there's also a health power up like I

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.710 
there's also a health power up like I
just<00:01:55.100> got<00:01:55.600> okay<00:01:57.729> if<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.790> monster<00:01:59.030> crashes<00:01:59.570> into

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
just got okay if a monster crashes into

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.810 
just got okay if a monster crashes into
not<00:02:00.500> only<00:02:00.530> do<00:02:00.860> you<00:02:00.890> lose<00:02:01.100> health<00:02:01.370> but<00:02:01.700> your

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
not only do you lose health but your

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.730 
not only do you lose health but your
multiplier<00:02:02.720> goes<00:02:02.960> down<00:02:03.170> quite<00:02:03.650> a<00:02:03.680> bit

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
multiplier goes down quite a bit

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.560 
multiplier goes down quite a bit
probably<00:02:04.700> just<00:02:04.760> went<00:02:04.940> down<00:02:05.180> about<00:02:05.330> 10<00:02:05.780> already

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
probably just went down about 10 already

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
probably just went down about 10 already
so<00:02:08.570> now<00:02:08.690> have<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.869> get<00:02:09.020> it<00:02:09.110> all<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.289> way<00:02:09.440> back

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
so now have to get it all the way back

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:19.880 
so now have to get it all the way back
up

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.600 

there<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.580> got<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:21.230> another<00:02:22.230> power<00:02:22.530> up<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.490> now

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
there I got a another power up so now

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.820 
there I got a another power up so now
it's<00:02:23.730> all<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.880> way<00:02:23.940> up<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.090> 35<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.140> already

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
it's all the way up to 35 and already

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.280 
it's all the way up to 35 and already
you<00:02:25.980> can<00:02:26.010> see<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.520> games<00:02:26.700> all<00:02:26.910> moving<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.690> lot

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
you can see the games all moving a lot

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.370 
you can see the games all moving a lot
faster<00:02:28.640> there's<00:02:29.640> different<00:02:30.170> monsters<00:02:31.170> now

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
faster there's different monsters now

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.630 
faster there's different monsters now
although<00:02:31.650> all<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:31.980> think<00:02:32.160> they<00:02:32.250> all<00:02:32.370> do<00:02:32.520> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
although all you think they all do the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.510 
although all you think they all do the
same<00:02:32.670> thing<00:02:33.350> there's<00:02:34.350> power-ups<00:02:34.920> they're

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
same thing there's power-ups they're

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.910 
same thing there's power-ups they're
shooting<00:02:35.790> very<00:02:36.030> fast<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:37.440> music's<00:02:37.800> going

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
shooting very fast and the music's going

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.230 
shooting very fast and the music's going
to<00:02:38.040> start<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.310> get<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.459> little<00:02:38.490> different

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.660 

there's<00:02:42.240> more<00:02:42.390> power-ups<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:44.370> let's<00:02:44.520> see<00:02:44.640> how

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
there's more power-ups so let's see how

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.750 
there's more power-ups so let's see how
I<00:02:44.880> can<00:02:45.000> get<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.300> multiplier<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.670> a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
I can get the multiplier so it's a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.250 
I can get the multiplier so it's a
really<00:02:47.970> fun<00:02:48.060> game<00:02:49.190> overall<00:02:50.390> I<00:02:51.390> don't<00:02:52.050> know<00:02:52.140> if

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
really fun game overall I don't know if

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.140 
really fun game overall I don't know if
I<00:02:52.320> can<00:02:52.380> think<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.739> anything<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.130> would<00:02:53.250> make

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
I can think of anything that would make

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.170 
I can think of anything that would make
it<00:02:54.180> better<00:02:56.600> of<00:02:57.600> course<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.200> guess<00:02:58.910> maybe<00:02:59.910> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
it better of course I guess maybe the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.000 
it better of course I guess maybe the
ability<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.810> change<00:03:00.989> your<00:03:01.230> ship<00:03:01.470> although<00:03:01.800> the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
ability to change your ship although the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.070 
ability to change your ship although the
design<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.120> everything<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.630> pretty<00:03:03.870> neat

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
design and everything is pretty neat

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.190 
design and everything is pretty neat
already<00:03:04.380> but<00:03:05.190> just<00:03:05.489> thinking<00:03:05.959> so<00:03:06.959> there<00:03:07.170> I

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
already but just thinking so there I

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.830 
already but just thinking so there I
died<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.530> got<00:03:07.890> half<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.670> million<00:03:09.000> points<00:03:09.209> game

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
died I got half a million points game

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.160 
died I got half a million points game
over<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.459> some<00:03:11.459> cool<00:03:11.670> special<00:03:11.940> effects<00:03:12.510> like

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
over and some cool special effects like

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.650 
over and some cool special effects like
that<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:14.400> that's<00:03:14.580> parallax<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.239> believe<00:03:15.450> it's<00:03:15.600> a

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
that so that's parallax I believe it's a

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.740 
that so that's parallax I believe it's a
dollar<00:03:15.870> in<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.080> App<00:03:16.200> Store<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:17.820> exact<00:03:18.570> amount

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
dollar in the App Store the exact amount

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.790 
dollar in the App Store the exact amount
from<00:03:19.050> wrong<00:03:19.290> will<00:03:19.440> be<00:03:19.560> in<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.709> video
