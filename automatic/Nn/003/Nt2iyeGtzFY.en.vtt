00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
from wet protruding it doesn't need to

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.060 
from wet protruding it doesn't need to
be<00:05:26.700> when<00:05:26.970> I<00:05:27.000> eat<00:05:27.390> give<00:05:27.690> me<00:05:27.810> both<00:05:28.050> or<00:05:28.440> just<00:05:28.770> of

be when I eat give me both or just of

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.330 
be when I eat give me both or just of
course<00:05:29.250> all<00:05:29.430> night<00:05:29.580> so<00:05:30.210> that's<00:05:30.300> really<00:05:31.340> cool

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
course all night so that's really cool

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.520 
course all night so that's really cool
thing<00:05:32.580> to<00:05:32.610> check<00:05:32.940> about<00:05:33.120> and<00:05:34.080> if<00:05:34.169> you<00:05:34.320> have

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
thing to check about and if you have

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.180 
thing to check about and if you have
that<00:05:35.070> sugar<00:05:35.430> just<00:05:35.790> like<00:05:35.970> you're<00:05:36.300> better<00:05:36.600> sick
