flexibility exercise for the hip flexor
we're<00:00:27.000> gonna<00:00:27.090> put<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> three-dimensional

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
we're gonna put a three-dimensional

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.560 
we're gonna put a three-dimensional
twist<00:00:28.200> to<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.350> by<00:00:29.070> doing<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.490> walking<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.510> I

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
twist to it by doing it walking and I

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.550 
twist to it by doing it walking and I
just<00:00:30.780> know<00:00:30.900> there's<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.110> lot<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.350> different

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
just know there's a lot of different

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.930 
just know there's a lot of different
variations<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.640> can<00:00:32.820> do<00:00:32.910> this

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
variations of this you can do this

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.819 
variations of this you can do this
standing<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.600> place<00:00:33.749> you<00:00:34.019> can<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> stepping

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
standing in place you can do it stepping

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.700 
standing in place you can do it stepping
forwards<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:35.699> step<00:00:35.940> backwards<00:00:36.710> there's

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
forwards you can step backwards there's

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.959 
forwards you can step backwards there's
a<00:00:37.800> lot<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.039> different<00:00:38.309> tweaks<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.760> can

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
a lot of different tweaks that you can

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.369 
a lot of different tweaks that you can
do<00:00:39.059> with<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.629> know<00:00:39.870> today<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.289> going

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
do with this so just know today is going

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.930 
do with this so just know today is going
to<00:00:40.499> be<00:00:40.589> a<00:00:40.620> moving<00:00:40.890> variation<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:43.820> all<00:00:44.820> right

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
to be a moving variation and all right

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.369 
to be a moving variation and all right
so<00:00:45.300> I'll<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.510> coming<00:00:45.600> after<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:48.109> to<00:00:49.109> have<00:00:49.350> a

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
so I'll be coming after and to have a

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.779 
so I'll be coming after and to have a
three-dimensional<00:00:49.769> component<00:00:50.550> I'm<00:00:50.640> gonna

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
three-dimensional component I'm gonna

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.520 
three-dimensional component I'm gonna
move<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.089> stick<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.960> three<00:00:52.230> different

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
move this stick in three different

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.319 
move this stick in three different
points<00:00:52.679> so<00:00:52.979> you'll<00:00:53.129> see<00:00:53.339> I'll<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.879> playing

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
points so you'll see I'll do one playing

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.790 
points so you'll see I'll do one playing
first<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.870> then<00:00:54.960> I'll<00:00:55.079> tweak<00:00:55.319> it<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.589> every

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
first and then I'll tweak it with every

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
first and then I'll tweak it with every
single<00:00:55.949> lap<00:00:56.249> so<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.059> person<00:00:57.269> we're<00:00:57.510> just

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
single lap so this person we're just

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.069 
single lap so this person we're just
gonna<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:58.019> a<00:00:58.339> sagittal<00:00:59.339> plane<00:00:59.690> hip<00:01:00.690> flexor

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
gonna be a sagittal plane hip flexor

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.709 
gonna be a sagittal plane hip flexor
stretch<00:01:01.550> so<00:01:02.550> forward<00:01:02.909> walk<00:01:03.089> and<00:01:03.300> lunch<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
stretch so forward walk and lunch and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.539 
stretch so forward walk and lunch and
reach<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.440> back<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> stick

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
boardwalk and hip flexor stretch again a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.000 
boardwalk and hip flexor stretch again a
lot<00:02:49.660> of<00:02:49.780> different<00:02:50.050> tweaks<00:02:50.260> depending<00:02:50.770> on<00:02:50.860> how

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
lot of different tweaks depending on how

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.450 
lot of different tweaks depending on how
we<00:02:51.070> want<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.460> do<00:02:51.610> this<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.920> what<00:02:53.920> variation<00:02:54.400> we

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
we want to do this and what variation we

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.770 
we want to do this and what variation we
want<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.730> do<00:02:54.820> whether<00:02:55.030> I'm<00:02:55.180> standing<00:02:55.570> in<00:02:55.690> place

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
want to do whether I'm standing in place

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.040 
want to do whether I'm standing in place
whether<00:02:56.560> I'm<00:02:56.680> stepping<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:58.120> also<00:02:58.600> could<00:02:58.870> rotate

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
whether I'm stepping I also could rotate

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.100 
whether I'm stepping I also could rotate
different<00:02:59.590> directions<00:02:59.980> really<00:03:00.280> quick<00:03:00.490> I<00:03:01.110> was

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
different directions really quick I was

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.600 
different directions really quick I was
I<00:03:02.470> was<00:03:02.590> doing<00:03:02.680> all<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:02.950> variations<00:03:03.430> where<00:03:03.580> I

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
I was doing all the variations where I

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.240 
I was doing all the variations where I
was<00:03:03.760> turning<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.240> my<00:03:04.420> stepping<00:03:04.990> leg<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.560> could

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
was turning to my stepping leg I could

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.820 
was turning to my stepping leg I could
also<00:03:06.370> do<00:03:06.550> or<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.790> turn<00:03:06.910> it<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.300> my<00:03:07.590> opposite<00:03:08.590> side

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
also do or I turn it to my opposite side

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.670 
also do or I turn it to my opposite side
with<00:03:09.700> either<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:10.120> rotation<00:03:10.660> or<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.440> side

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
with either the rotation or the side

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.520 
with either the rotation or the side
Bend<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:13.060> it's<00:03:13.570> all<00:03:13.780> good<00:03:13.960> just<00:03:13.990> kind<00:03:14.320> of<00:03:14.350> feed

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
Bend so it's all good just kind of feed

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.630 
Bend so it's all good just kind of feed
your<00:03:14.650> nervous<00:03:14.920> system<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.250> take<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.520> from

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
your nervous system and take it from

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.020 
your nervous system and take it from
there

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
there

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.280
