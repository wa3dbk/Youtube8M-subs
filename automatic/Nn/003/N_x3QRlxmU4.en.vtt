00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.690
 sometimes Gerhard Richter distributes the device that he himself designed 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.659
 To dye 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:15.980
 scratching it again way creates new structures 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.230
 always the same procedure 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.509
 Chance is part of the creative process

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.929
 for the lions 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.579
 nice green 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.070
 the break the loneliness and to work 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.330
 that he can film over a period of about five months 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.410
 it's an experiment for him 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.340
 the director Corinna Belz end of the celebration 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.310
 The only agreement is to see the film before the premiere in Cologne Red 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.870
 they are found in many faces 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.810
 most of what is special about it citizens 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.620
 it will not be her 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:12.030
 what attracted her to agree to this movie June 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.240
 4 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.520
 Jer 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.980
 you want called the irregular intervals 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.260
 and only for two three hours 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.530
 even as the artist almost too much 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.440
 with her persistent restrained nature wins the unique insights 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.520
 it does not count a password 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.280
 critical point 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.280
 be with him 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.240
 actually like it here 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.970
 the film shows the Gerhard Richter 2009 making a series of abstract pictures 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.630
 for an exhibition millions of times 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.969
 there works mostly on several pictures at the same time she always puts a lot 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.260
 again in question 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
 It may take weeks to settle for the result 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:12.959
 You can not talk about painting yourself, he once said 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:17.769
 and so comes the movie almost without comment on the painting process Abs 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.169
 No talks at the top locations and 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:24.399
 because then you also Bern 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:27.529
 Do not act as if you are not concerned about it did not do that either 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.179
 ultimately also to fight 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.579
 good way to handle it 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.189
 in the figurative or 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.749
 also abstract gray or colored 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.749
 the opposite of his style principle by Gerhard Richter 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:45.089
 he had exhibited to the most important museums worldwide and is considered as 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:47.839
 Most expensive German counterparts Marnach 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:51.349
 his works achieve top prices in the millions at auctions 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:54.489
 that he takes his pictures all by himself 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.489
 distinguishes him from many other famous contemporaries 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.079
 Even crises, the film holds 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.129
 he climbed 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:09.839
 all are behind the kidnappers 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.399
 Hesse's Interior Minister Boris Rhein would

 we are many 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.539

 Assad leaves Rheinfelden 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.459
 Wolves can do that

 Vellmar 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:39.279
 there are moments where density aborts the film voter will the observation 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:42.399
 can not stand the camera but the director returns to Harwich 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.439
 repaid that to the otherwise only two assistants of the artist 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.389
 Have access 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.389

 in the existing one 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:58.759
 they'll have to pay later to change in the coming year

 growing market 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:11.259

 Gerhard Richter goes through 

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:26.939
 before his work then the
