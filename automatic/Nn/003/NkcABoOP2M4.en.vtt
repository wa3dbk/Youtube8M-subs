00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 Function is a contact to introduce third generation 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.250
 who the device means Riedel 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.689
 I go into the area of ​​the main menu 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.589
 start the Melika countries photos and contacts 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:14.399

 and the areas music videos safari so the internet browser 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.769
 and last

 I decide for an album 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.130
 and there for fear of 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.930
 so what's up to that is the integrated speaker of the iPod Touch 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.690
 understandable if they are without lover or external speakers 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.420

 turns off automatically 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.480
