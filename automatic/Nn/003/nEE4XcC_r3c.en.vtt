that's<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.520> 90<00:00:47.879> potential<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.379> asked<00:00:49.530> we

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
that's like 90 potential but we asked we

that's like 90 potential but we asked we
can't<00:00:49.800> sign<00:00:50.039> him<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.190> can't<00:00:50.340> afford<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.640> they

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
can't sign him we can't afford and they

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.580 
can't sign him we can't afford and they
weren't<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.910> seven<00:00:51.210> million<00:00:51.360> for<00:00:51.719> him<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.110> we

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
weren't in seven million for him and we

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.869 
weren't in seven million for him and we
get<00:00:52.710> him<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.890> loan<00:00:53.010> instead<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> guess<00:00:53.760> he's

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
get him on loan instead so I guess he's

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.400

so<00:03:17.850> I<00:03:17.880> had<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.120> be<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.210> bit<00:03:18.330> more<00:03:18.510> careful<00:03:19.140> with

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
so I had to be a bit more careful with

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.080 
so I had to be a bit more careful with
my<00:03:19.410> defending<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.130> how<00:03:20.490> I<00:03:20.520> play<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.940> out<00:03:21.060> I

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
my defending and how I play it out I

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.160 
my defending and how I play it out I
think<00:03:21.240> that's<00:03:21.360> something<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.690> was<00:03:21.840> at<00:03:21.960> issues

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
think that's something I was at issues

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.380 
think that's something I was at issues
of<00:03:22.200> anyway<00:03:22.590> both<00:03:22.800> in<00:03:23.100> my<00:03:23.250> like<00:03:23.640> reload<00:03:24.090> numbers

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
of anyway both in my like reload numbers

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.850 
of anyway both in my like reload numbers
he<00:03:24.450> might<00:03:24.660> add<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:24.900> anything<00:03:25.080> to<00:03:25.230> pass<00:03:25.500> out

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
he might add this anything to pass out

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.650 
he might add this anything to pass out
and<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.550> causes<00:03:26.700> me<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:26.940> consider<00:03:27.240> like<00:03:27.390> gold

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
and it causes me to consider like gold

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.480 
and it causes me to consider like gold
sometimes<00:03:27.870> but<00:03:28.500> luckily<00:03:28.710> we<00:03:28.920> equalised<00:03:29.280> there

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
sometimes but luckily we equalised there

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.680 
sometimes but luckily we equalised there
in<00:03:29.550> fact<00:03:29.670> in<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:29.910> minute<00:03:30.120> with<00:03:30.240> Trotter<00:03:30.510> at

why does duck rejects that one I think

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.820 
why does duck rejects that one I think
it<00:04:03.450> might<00:04:03.570> have<00:04:03.660> been<00:04:03.810> because<00:04:04.020> I<00:04:04.200> didn't<00:04:04.500> I'm

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
players on loan and stuff it no longer

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.430 
players on loan and stuff it no longer
just<00:05:21.970> shows<00:05:22.150> you<00:05:22.330> them<00:05:22.509> but<00:05:22.870> based<00:05:23.080> on<00:05:23.229> their

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
just shows you them but based on their

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.110 
just shows you them but based on their
overall<00:05:23.650> rating<00:05:24.190> it<00:05:24.280> shows<00:05:24.460> you<00:05:24.669> based<00:05:24.880> on<00:05:25.000> the

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
overall rating it shows you based on the

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.300 
overall rating it shows you based on the
age<00:05:25.330> and<00:05:25.810> then<00:05:26.409> it's<00:05:26.560> in<00:05:26.680> alphabetic<00:05:27.220> order

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
age and then it's in alphabetic order

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.300 
age and then it's in alphabetic order
and<00:05:27.669> I'm<00:05:28.599> annoying<00:05:28.900> because<00:05:29.889> you<00:05:30.130> can't

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
and I'm annoying because you can't

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.140 
and I'm annoying because you can't
actually<00:05:30.400> lick<00:05:30.639> on<00:05:30.729> any<00:05:30.820> of<00:05:30.880> these<00:05:30.940> players

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
actually lick on any of these players

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.120 
actually lick on any of these players
and<00:05:31.539> just<00:05:31.719> find<00:05:31.930> out<00:05:32.139> that<00:05:32.349> over<00:05:32.469> rating<00:05:32.979> to

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
and just find out that over rating to

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.800 
and just find out that over rating to
find<00:05:33.370> out<00:05:33.520> I<00:05:33.550> players<00:05:33.820> overall<00:05:34.300> rating<00:05:34.690> these

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
find out I players overall rating these

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.980 
find out I players overall rating these
days<00:05:35.050> you<00:05:35.590> have<00:05:35.620> to<00:05:35.979> actually<00:05:36.130> scout<00:05:36.849> them<00:05:37.060> and

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
days you have to actually scout them and

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.959 
days you have to actually scout them and
even<00:05:38.320> then<00:05:38.590> you<00:05:39.099> don't<00:05:39.310> typically<00:05:39.550> get<00:05:39.820> the

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:39.969 
even then you don't typically get the

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.420 
even then you don't typically get the
overrating<00:05:40.389> you<00:05:40.449> get<00:05:40.599> their<00:05:40.750> rough<00:05:41.280> they<00:05:42.280> can

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
overrating you get their rough they can

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.830 
overrating you get their rough they can
give<00:05:42.610> you<00:05:42.669> stats<00:05:42.909> roughly<00:05:43.360> between<00:05:43.419> the<00:05:43.599> two

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
give you stats roughly between the two

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.120 
give you stats roughly between the two
I'm<00:05:44.169> assuming<00:05:44.560> that's<00:05:44.620> because<00:05:44.889> I<00:05:44.949> have

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
I'm assuming that's because I have

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.770 
I'm assuming that's because I have
crappy<00:05:45.550> Scouts<00:05:45.849> I<00:05:46.030> mean<00:05:46.150> maybe<00:05:46.449> I<00:05:46.509> have<00:05:46.599> to<00:05:46.659> get

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
crappy Scouts I mean maybe I have to get

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.120 
crappy Scouts I mean maybe I have to get
better<00:05:46.900> scallops<00:05:47.349> to<00:05:47.469> in<00:05:47.530> order<00:05:47.710> to<00:05:47.830> find<00:05:48.009> out

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
better scallops to in order to find out

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.980 
better scallops to in order to find out
this<00:05:48.219> information<00:05:48.509> but<00:05:49.509> yeah<00:05:49.659> there's<00:05:49.840> kind

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
this information but yeah there's kind

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.300 
this information but yeah there's kind
of<00:05:50.020> harder<00:05:50.349> to<00:05:50.469> find<00:05:50.650> players<00:05:50.830> so<00:05:51.070> now<00:05:51.159> he's

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
of harder to find players so now he's

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.230 
of harder to find players so now he's
kind<00:05:51.430> of<00:05:51.460> like<00:05:51.580> you<00:05:51.639> have<00:05:51.759> to<00:05:51.849> find<00:05:51.969> players

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
kind of like you have to find players

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.450 
kind of like you have to find players
that<00:05:52.479> you<00:05:52.570> know<00:05:52.840> of<00:05:53.139> by<00:05:53.320> their<00:05:53.530> names<00:05:53.740> so<00:05:54.310> got
