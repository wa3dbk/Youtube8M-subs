00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
hi on today's show I want to step you

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.499 
hi on today's show I want to step you
through<00:00:03.929> an<00:00:04.290> issue<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.710> found<00:00:05.100> on<00:00:05.250> my<00:00:05.370> second<00:00:05.970> da

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
through an issue I found on my second da

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.750 
through an issue I found on my second da
vinci<00:00:06.930> 1.0<00:00:07.440> printer<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:07.980> i<00:00:08.010> didn't<00:00:08.429> have<00:00:08.610> on

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
vinci 1.0 printer that i didn't have on

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.230 
vinci 1.0 printer that i didn't have on
my<00:00:08.940> first<00:00:09.590> 1.0<00:00:10.590> printer

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
my first 1.0 printer

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.140 
my first 1.0 printer
it's<00:00:12.240> an<00:00:12.480> off<00:00:12.750> set<00:00:13.139> problem<00:00:13.679> it'll<00:00:14.309> print<00:00:14.759> so

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
it's an off set problem it'll print so

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.050 
it's an off set problem it'll print so
far<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.809> then<00:00:16.379> shift<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.070> print<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.640> then

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
far and then shift the print and then

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.630 
far and then shift the print and then
continue<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.539> print<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:19.619> can<00:00:19.800> see<00:00:20.010> an<00:00:20.100> example

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
continue to print you can see an example

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.950 
continue to print you can see an example
right<00:00:21.180> up<00:00:21.359> here<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:22.380> shifted<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.250> print<00:00:23.670> and

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
right up here it shifted the print and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.550 
right up here it shifted the print and
then<00:00:24.960> continued<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:26.119> so<00:00:27.119> i<00:00:27.150> dug<00:00:27.630> into<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.410> i

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
then continued on so i dug into it and i

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.109 
then continued on so i dug into it and i
figured<00:00:29.010> out<00:00:29.070> what<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> problem<00:00:29.699> was

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
figured out what the problem was

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.580 
figured out what the problem was
so<00:00:30.539> i'm<00:00:30.630> going<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.840> show<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.170> what<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
so i'm going to show you what the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:45.470 
so i'm going to show you what the
problem<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.460> how<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.360> fix<00:00:33.630> it

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.930 

I<00:00:45.829> could<00:00:46.829> see<00:00:47.040> that<00:00:47.160> there<00:00:47.340> was<00:00:47.430> offset

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
I could see that there was offset

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.520 
I could see that there was offset
throughout<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.420> whole<00:00:48.570> print<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
throughout the whole print but the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.890 
throughout the whole print but the
bottom<00:00:49.890> was<00:00:50.070> clearly<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.820> worst<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.870> I

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
bottom was clearly the worst so I

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.180 
bottom was clearly the worst so I
checked<00:00:52.290> all<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.470> belts<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.980> they<00:00:53.129> were

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
checked all the belts and they were

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.580 
checked all the belts and they were
tight<00:00:53.489> they<00:00:53.700> were<00:00:53.760> fine<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.660> then<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.050> checked

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
tight they were fine so then I checked

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.700 
tight they were fine so then I checked
the<00:00:55.739> base<00:00:56.720> when<00:00:57.720> I<00:00:57.750> looked<00:00:57.989> at<00:00:58.110> the<00:00:58.230> base<00:00:58.470> I

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the base when I looked at the base I

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.770 
the base when I looked at the base I
noticed<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> left<00:00:59.400> side<00:00:59.699> was<00:00:59.910> all<00:01:00.059> sealed<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
noticed the left side was all sealed the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900 
noticed the left side was all sealed the
bearings<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.290> place<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.400> right<00:01:02.610> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
bearings in place but on the right it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.420 
bearings in place but on the right it
was<00:01:03.059> open<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.629> then<00:01:04.440> I<00:01:04.619> noticed<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.190> base

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
was open and then I noticed the base

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.480 
was open and then I noticed the base
actually<00:01:06.240> moved<00:01:06.869> around<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> bearing<00:01:08.009> it<00:01:08.310> was

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
actually moved around the bearing it was

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.570 
actually moved around the bearing it was
like<00:01:08.670> loose<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:10.020> when<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.380> moved<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> platform

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
like loose and when I moved the platform

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.390 
like loose and when I moved the platform
I<00:01:11.610> noticed<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.450> glass<00:01:12.810> was<00:01:13.590> sliding<00:01:13.950> back<00:01:14.369> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
I noticed the glass was sliding back and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.200 
I noticed the glass was sliding back and
forth<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.119> front<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> back<00:01:19.940> so<00:01:20.940> with<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
forth and front the back so with the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.540 
forth and front the back so with the
extruder<00:01:21.720> putting<00:01:22.050> plastic<00:01:22.560> down<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.369> is

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
extruder putting plastic down this is

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.550 
extruder putting plastic down this is
what<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.729> was<00:01:23.910> getting<00:01:24.270> moving<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.289> over<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
what I was getting moving all over the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.510 
what I was getting moving all over the
place<00:01:27.259> just<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.380> try<00:01:28.590> something<00:01:29.039> quick<00:01:29.369> I

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
place just to try something quick I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.430 
place just to try something quick I
jammed<00:01:29.910> an<00:01:30.149> exacto<00:01:30.630> blade<00:01:30.660> in<00:01:31.020> between<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
jammed an exacto blade in between the

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.410 
jammed an exacto blade in between the
bearing<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.830> plastic<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:33.090> worked

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
bearing and the plastic and this worked

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.520 
bearing and the plastic and this worked
really<00:01:33.660> well

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
really well

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.029 
really well
then<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.850> took<00:01:36.180> sandpaper<00:01:37.110> folded<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.830> in<00:01:38.009> half

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
then I took sandpaper folded it in half

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.430 
then I took sandpaper folded it in half
and<00:01:38.640> jammed<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.690> between<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.050> glass<00:01:40.380> and

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
and jammed it in between the glass and

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.600 
and jammed it in between the glass and
the<00:01:40.679> edge<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.160> this<00:01:41.850> worked<00:01:42.090> really<00:01:42.210> well

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
the edge and this worked really well

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.060 
the edge and this worked really well
when<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.700> tried<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.119> wiggle<00:01:45.390> things<00:01:45.630> around

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
when I tried to wiggle things around

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.940 
when I tried to wiggle things around
nothing<00:01:47.070> moved<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.880> was<00:01:48.090> solid<00:01:48.660> and<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.590> edges

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
nothing moved it was solid and the edges

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.529 
nothing moved it was solid and the edges
of<00:01:50.069> the<00:01:50.130> glass<00:01:50.250> don't<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.849> that<00:01:51.000> hot<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.509> I

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
of the glass don't get that hot so I

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:52.820 
of the glass don't get that hot so I
didn't<00:01:51.780> have<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.959> worry<00:01:52.140> about<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.470> sandpaper

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
didn't have to worry about the sandpaper

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.589 
didn't have to worry about the sandpaper
burning<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:54.030> fact<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.330> it<00:01:54.479> was

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:54.599 
burning and the fact that it was

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:57.020 
burning and the fact that it was
sandpaper<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.560> was<00:01:55.770> grabbing<00:01:56.160> really<00:01:56.580> well<00:01:56.789> I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
sandpaper it was grabbing really well I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.930 
sandpaper it was grabbing really well I
couldn't<00:01:57.599> get<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.780> paper<00:01:57.959> back<00:01:58.259> out<00:01:58.470> and<00:01:58.940> when

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
couldn't get the paper back out and when

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.320 
couldn't get the paper back out and when
I<00:01:59.970> ran<00:02:00.179> the<00:02:00.360> print<00:02:00.630> again<00:02:00.959> this<00:02:01.590> was<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> result

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
I ran the print again this was a result

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.779 
I ran the print again this was a result
perfect<00:02:03.330> all<00:02:03.569> the<00:02:03.630> way<00:02:04.080> up<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.380> down<00:02:04.789> compared

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
perfect all the way up and down compared

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.089 
perfect all the way up and down compared
to<00:02:05.849> what<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.090> had<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:07.050> was<00:02:07.289> a<00:02:07.319> tremendous

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
to what I had this was a tremendous

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.160 
to what I had this was a tremendous
improvement<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:12.300> may<00:02:12.480> be<00:02:12.540> wondering<00:02:13.080> what

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
improvement you may be wondering what

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.970 
this print is it's a valance clip for my
vertical<00:02:16.200> blinds<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:18.200> laid<00:02:19.200> an<00:02:19.380> old<00:02:19.560> one<00:02:19.739> on<00:02:19.770> my

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.550 
vertical blinds I laid an old one on my
paper<00:02:20.220> scanner<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.940> scanned<00:02:21.569> it<00:02:21.690> in<00:02:21.840> then<00:02:22.319> use

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
paper scanner and scanned it in then use

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.920 
paper scanner and scanned it in then use
Tinkercad<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.370> make<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.670> into<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.910> 3d<00:02:24.270> object<00:02:24.450> I

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
Tinkercad to make it into a 3d object I

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.350 
Tinkercad to make it into a 3d object I
actually<00:02:25.680> sell<00:02:26.130> these<00:02:26.250> on<00:02:26.430> eBay<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:27.030> help<00:02:27.180> pay

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
actually sell these on eBay to help pay

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.460 
actually sell these on eBay to help pay
for<00:02:27.390> plastic<00:02:29.239> next<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.390> tried<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.780> smaller<00:02:31.140> print

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
for plastic next I tried a smaller print

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.070 
for plastic next I tried a smaller print
to<00:02:31.830> see<00:02:32.040> how<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.340> would<00:02:32.459> turn<00:02:32.640> out<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.840> white

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
to see how it would turn out the white

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.260 
to see how it would turn out the white
part<00:02:34.410> is<00:02:34.560> before<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.220> fix<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.060> black

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
part is before the fix and the black

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.080 
part is before the fix and the black
part<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.780> after<00:02:37.099> these<00:02:38.099> small<00:02:38.430> parts<00:02:38.879> are

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
part is after these small parts are

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.500 
part is after these small parts are
printing<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.170> much<00:02:40.410> better<00:02:41.060> so<00:02:42.060> that's<00:02:42.239> it

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
printing so much better so that's it

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.380 
printing so much better so that's it
that's<00:02:43.260> how<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.500> fix<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.069> shifting<00:02:44.520> problem<00:02:44.760> on

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
that's how I fix the shifting problem on

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.190 
that's how I fix the shifting problem on
my<00:02:45.720> DaVinci<00:02:46.230> 1.0<00:02:46.770> printer<00:02:47.450> now<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.510> exacto

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
my DaVinci 1.0 printer now the exacto

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.199 
my DaVinci 1.0 printer now the exacto
blade<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.680> back<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:50.220> kind<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:50.970> broke<00:02:51.150> a

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
blade in the back I kind of broke a

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.440 
blade in the back I kind of broke a
piece<00:02:51.480> off<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.110> then<00:02:52.849> epoxied<00:02:53.849> it<00:02:54.000> in<00:02:54.180> place

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
piece off and then epoxied it in place

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.760 
piece off and then epoxied it in place
so<00:02:54.659> that's<00:02:54.930> pretty<00:02:55.590> solid<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.879> sandpaper

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
so that's pretty solid the sandpaper

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.760 
so that's pretty solid the sandpaper
it's<00:02:58.310> still<00:02:58.670> in<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.120> base<00:02:59.300> I<00:02:59.660> couldn't<00:03:00.650> get

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
it's still in the base I couldn't get

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.350 
it's still in the base I couldn't get
them<00:03:00.890> out<00:03:01.010> there<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.400> they're<00:03:01.550> so<00:03:01.880> good<00:03:02.150> and

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
them out there in they're so good and

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.940 
them out there in they're so good and
it's<00:03:02.570> printing<00:03:03.140> so<00:03:03.410> well

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
it's printing so well

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.670 
it's printing so well
I<00:03:03.980> left<00:03:04.940> them<00:03:05.120> if<00:03:05.330> you<00:03:06.050> have<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.200> better<00:03:06.470> idea

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
I left them if you have a better idea

I left them if you have a better idea
for<00:03:07.160> how<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.760> fix<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.300> leave<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.020> in<00:03:09.110> the
