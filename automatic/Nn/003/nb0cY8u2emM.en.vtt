I<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.680> kind<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.950> go<00:01:44.370> over<00:01:44.520> there<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.760> have<00:01:44.850> a

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
I just kind of go over there and have a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.730 
I just kind of go over there and have a
look<00:01:45.060> I'm<00:01:45.870> gonna<00:01:45.990> use<00:01:46.200> your<00:01:46.320> head<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.710> a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
look I'm gonna use your head as a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.360 
look I'm gonna use your head as a
reference<00:01:47.130> actually<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.020> that's<00:01:49.020> good

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
reference actually so that's good

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.080 
reference actually so that's good
because<00:01:50.370> we<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.510> also<00:01:51.830> make<00:01:52.830> custom<00:01:53.490> sizes<00:01:53.940> on

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
because we can also make custom sizes on

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.980 
because we can also make custom sizes on
thur<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.360> course<00:01:54.570> ok<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.760> does<00:01:56.760> I<00:01:57.450> guess

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
thur of course ok and so does I guess

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.600 
thur of course ok and so does I guess
I've<00:01:58.110> maximum<00:01:58.530> white<00:01:58.650> level<00:01:58.920> today's<00:01:59.220> scale

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
I've maximum white level today's scale

way<00:02:41.180> reduces<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.330> like<00:02:42.570> on<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.500> center<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:43.980> the

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
way reduces is like on the center of the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.880 
way reduces is like on the center of the
pan

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
pan

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.430 
pan
okay<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.430> course<00:02:45.880> when<00:02:46.330> it's<00:02:46.480> mostly<00:02:47.110> use

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
okay of course when it's mostly use

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.220 
okay of course when it's mostly use
these<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:48.010> put<00:02:48.220> some<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.150> our<00:02:49.300> standard<00:02:49.810> sizes

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
these to put some of our standard sizes

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.620 
these to put some of our standard sizes
next<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.709> each<00:02:50.800> other<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.760> keep<00:02:52.030> em<00:02:52.209> very<00:02:52.390> nice

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
next to each other you keep em very nice

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.860 
next to each other you keep em very nice
and<00:02:52.930> powerful<00:02:53.410> lineup<00:02:53.670> okay<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:55.090> guess<00:02:55.600> I'm<00:02:55.720> for

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
and powerful lineup okay I guess I'm for

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.960 
and powerful lineup okay I guess I'm for
power<00:02:56.170> level<00:02:56.560> or<00:02:56.860> power<00:02:57.340> output<00:02:57.670> how<00:02:57.790> do<00:02:57.850> you

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
power level or power output how do you

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.760 
power level or power output how do you
measure<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:58.510> or<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.200> have<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.380> certain

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
measure that or you have a certain

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.980 
measure that or you have a certain
metric<00:03:00.190> or<00:03:00.220> specification<00:03:01.030> for<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.660> square

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
metric or specification for the square

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.820 
metric or specification for the square
like<00:03:02.230> for<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:02.920> service<00:03:03.190> area<00:03:04.290> me<00:03:05.290> when<00:03:05.650> we

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
like for the service area me when we

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.250 
like for the service area me when we
make<00:03:06.010> those<00:03:06.640> noises<00:03:06.670> yeah<00:03:07.240> yeah<00:03:07.870> like<00:03:08.110> when

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
visit the magic comes from this

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.630 
visit the magic comes from this
polarizing<00:04:06.360> filter<00:04:06.930> okay<00:04:07.440> which<00:04:07.980> is<00:04:08.160> a<00:04:08.190> linear

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
polarizing filter okay which is a linear

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.350 
polarizing filter okay which is a linear
polarizer<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.810> also<00:04:10.110> works<00:04:10.260> as<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.620> 93<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:11.700> it

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
polarizer that also works as a 93 so it

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.020 
polarizer that also works as a 93 so it
