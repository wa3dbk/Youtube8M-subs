00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.660
 how it seems to us the average 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.160
 family consists of three four people a 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.050
 average family car 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.560
 third place last week 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.689
 wagon but Renault Logan Russia is not 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:18.449
 completely standard formats 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.369
 for some reason, let's take a closer look. 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.160
 it is based on a logan sedan with stretched wheel 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.679
 base increase was considerable 30 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:26.480
 centimeters 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.039
 but the body types wagon but such is 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.849
 simple recipe for this car 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.700
 looks even quite outside 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.280
 pretty recognizable face 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.530
 balanced easier and at once 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.260
 it is clear that this car is purely 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.980
 pragmatic and almost everything 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.000
 least when recreating 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.650
 cared for beauty 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.610
 but nothing repulsive 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.410
 appearance is not just competently 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.830
 designed wagon with 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.050
 maximum possibilities inside 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.400
 too stagnation 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.440
 not the most comfortable fit of the driver from 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.760
 for lack of steering adjustment 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.470
 are full 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.120
 simple finishing materials 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.900
 but all the acura is collected 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.790
 in general, a reasonable approach to saving 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.090
 funds on the second row of seats, too, without 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.860
 any frills ordinary sofa 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.920
 divided into two unequal parts 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.850
 no extra 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.729
 adjustments and other amenities for 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.070
 no second row passengers 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.340
 and here is enough place with an excess of three 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.200
 passengers in the second row let adams without 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.970
 of problems 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.600
 200 secret weapons Renault Logan Time Syria 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.240
 housed in the trunk 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.020
 additional 2 place which 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.040
 turns cars 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.730
 seven-seater minivan 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.750
 dangerously 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.750
 only need 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.000
 second row of seats 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 and then throw it away 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.060
 and borrow do not put the gallery 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.000
 you know here is not so bad as it could 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.930
 seem 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.250
 what am i with my 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.500
 for not really and feet fit though 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.630
 of course 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.630
 Lada Kalina 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.400
 I think that the trip is kilometers and so 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.530
 that I would not advise signing 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.799
 teenage children and less 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.990
 no problem at all 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.220
 500 kilometers 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.260
 but we also know that all ministries 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.329
 Of course the space for nothing fails 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:14.439
 what you have to sacrifice 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.790
 naturally trunk volume gradually 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.459
 the seats 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.459
 car class rb not everyone succeeded 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.469
 naturally not without 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.189
 disadvantages of the case 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.559
 small volume 7 place option 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:31.859
 so champ 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.269
 trunk pay 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.049
 maximum two such bags and where to put 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:36.889
 luggage 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.669
 all seven passengers 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:40.579
 remains a big question 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:41.999
 in case of moving to a new place 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.459
 whole family residence 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.119
 will have to do two flights 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:47.229
 the first to take out all the households in the second 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:49.109
 all things by removing the second row from the cabin 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.829
 seats and bringing a useful volume 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.249
 trunk up to almost two and a half 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.509
 cubic meters 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.409
 under the hood is equal logan m syria can 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.019
 installed as a gasoline engine 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.069
 volume of 1 6 liters and a half liter 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.339
 diesel of 75 horsepower of course 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:04.969
 diesel would be more suited to the character 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.439
 the purpose of this car but we 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.059
 were content with the gasoline version 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:11.079
 the motor turned out to be quite good letters 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.879
 at the same time writes dmitry green 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.989
 and this is not so much a disadvantage 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.689
 soundproofing how tough work 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:17.939
 the engine itself 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.290
 but the clutch pedal is clear the author Maza 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.319
 informative and unmistakable 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.849
 i.e. family cars 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.589
 very comfortable 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:28.589
 along with them the car is very 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.749
 UAH pension tax 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.169
 I am very comfortable 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.089
 I really like 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:41.089
 continue very energy intensive order 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:42.999
 I had to 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:45.319
 spacious 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.879
 no basically 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.369
 I thought he was quite 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:51.159
 answers 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.909
 over time needs 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.959
 average Belarusian side 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.329
 of course you can by openid guilty of violence 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.359
 over their own reputation doing 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.489
 car full 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:02.770
 vehicle 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.900
 for the whole family but also that feature set 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.280
 what if the car is enough for 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.730
 meet the majority 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.589
 needs 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:11.449
 not too pretentious force 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.409
 recall voting for the title 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.299
 the best family car passes
