blob it's a fine notch trowel and I'm

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.160 
blob it's a fine notch trowel and I'm
using<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.440> small<00:02:37.470> one<00:02:37.980> for<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.940> tight<00:02:39.630> area<00:02:39.959> in

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
here so that we don't get too much

adhesive spreading around on the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.260 
adhesive spreading around on the
material<00:02:46.340> now<00:02:47.340> I'll<00:02:47.520> go<00:02:47.700> ahead<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.000> spread

material now I'll go ahead and spread
this<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.750> we'll<00:02:48.840> need<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.050> give<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.440> about<00:02:49.560> 10

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
this and we'll need to give it about 10

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.670 
this and we'll need to give it about 10
minutes<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.550> tack<00:02:51.330> up<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.930> then<00:02:52.350> we'll<00:02:52.500> split

minutes to tack up and then we'll split

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.960 
minutes to tack up and then we'll split
the<00:02:52.830> material<00:02:53.280> right<00:02:53.370> into<00:02:53.700> it

doing<00:04:48.689> the<00:04:48.810> perimeter<00:04:49.259> exactly<00:04:50.009> what<00:04:50.219> I've

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
doing the perimeter exactly what I've

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.029 
doing the perimeter exactly what I've
done<00:04:50.520> here<00:04:50.729> is<00:04:50.879> staggered<00:04:51.360> out<00:04:51.509> the<00:04:51.719> pieces<00:04:52.289> so

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
done here is staggered out the pieces so

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.010 
done here is staggered out the pieces so
I<00:04:53.069> have<00:04:53.310> a<00:04:53.370> cluster<00:04:53.610> of<00:04:53.879> joints<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:54.509> it<00:04:54.779> flows

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
I have a cluster of joints and it flows

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.989 
I have a cluster of joints and it flows
very<00:04:55.319> uh<00:04:55.439> very<00:04:56.039> nicely<00:04:56.219> and<00:04:56.550> then<00:04:56.669> this<00:04:56.789> one

00:04:56.989 --> 00:04:56.999 
very uh very nicely and then this one

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:59.360 
very uh very nicely and then this one

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
that you have here can I put it in sure

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:00.689 
enough I mean this end here it's getting

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:03.230 
enough I mean this end here it's getting
a<00:05:00.840> little<00:05:00.960> bit<00:05:01.139> tight<00:05:01.409> it's<00:05:01.680> uh<00:05:02.029> right<00:05:03.029> up

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
a little bit tight it's uh right up

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.909 
a little bit tight it's uh right up
against<00:05:03.629> the<00:05:03.719> threshold<00:05:04.289> sure<00:05:04.650> we've

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
against the threshold sure we've

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.709 
against the threshold sure we've
undercut<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.550> door<00:05:05.729> casing<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.300> slide<00:05:06.569> it

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:06.719 
undercut the door casing to slide it

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:09.350 
undercut the door casing to slide it
right<00:05:06.750> in<00:05:07.050> what's<00:05:07.560> that<00:05:07.860> yeah<00:05:08.159> now<00:05:08.939> I<00:05:09.000> notice

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
in the powder room itself you've kind of

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.070 
in the powder room itself you've kind of
changed<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.469> the<00:05:14.400> pattern<00:05:14.879> what<00:05:15.810> do<00:05:15.870> you<00:05:15.960> call
