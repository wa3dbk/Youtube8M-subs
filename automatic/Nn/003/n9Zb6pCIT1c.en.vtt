00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.250
 very good guys again here leaves you 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.559
 how much telephony why not good 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.290
 doing a tutorial more for you 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.000
 so that you learn to do new things 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.730
 about your devices 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.980
 and nothing I have been seeing right now 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.860
 friend mystery videos I 'm you 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.290
 more than impressed because he has a 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.020
 quality of videos etcetera that good 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.949
 well, it's amazing compared to this 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.390
 this for next to it is a poop 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.400
 but good little by little we will go up 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.050
 the ribbon and see how far we got 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.000
 apparently good now let's go 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.519
 pretty good in terms of subscribers 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.390
 we are going up little by little now we stop 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.550
 for a tremendous number of about 760 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.780
 subscribers that is enough for me 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.880
 although I'd like them to be more 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.469
 because a lot of people watch our videos and 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.600
 very few people subscribe but good 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.160
 I'm still very happy with the people 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.070
 that is faithful to us from the first day that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.680
 we made the channel and the people that are 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.180
 subscribing now well I also give them 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.340
 thank you very much good apart from this 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.580
 Now let's make a video in which 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.710
 I 'm going to show you how to install install them 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.340
 first of all let's make a 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.340
 little bit of blue 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.830
 I do this at the request of a subscriber 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.010
 our good on twitter I think 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.710
 that is called salva domenech mich that 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.480
 good is a kid that comes almost 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.480
 supporting us from the beginning of the channel 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.240
 then well I do not ask you what 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.700
 installed installed once we have 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.109
 done the jailbreak very well I thought 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.390
 that I already had video made of this but 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:50.460
 well seen no but let's do it 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.979
 the first thing we need the most 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.310
 essential that we need is a connection 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.170
 to Internet 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.960
 but internet connection good data 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.420
 the phone is 5.1 megabytes what's 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.260
 to install more or less once we have 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.700
 installed well day we get simple 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:11.220
 we wait for him to load and good guys 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.720
 I see that this continues going forward and 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.640
 that every time good then we will go up 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.340
 a little more the bar each time we will be 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.780
 more etcetera then I hope this 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.200
 continues to grow that there is no 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.900
 problem and I already tell you that I am very 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.810
 good and happy once we opened 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.630
 cidh we are going to handle maniche 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.980
 how can you put in english 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:38.580
 and where it puts sources we give to edit to 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.450
 the right add to the left 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.970
 the following will not come out, enter the url 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.970
 of the cydia apt repository then 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:52.750
 we have to put cydia point crosier 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.750
 point 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.409
 point as 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:03.159
 and we give you to add start downloading 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.599
 it will get package or things like that and it will start 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:09.249
 to download, that's what was being 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:12.489
 saying then the following will come out a 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:15.580
 icon that puts calculation points and here you 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.640
 different things come out good 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.790
 and in this case I have the jailbreak done 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.940
 with him and you 5.1.1 of which I teach you in 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.240
 a video then the first thing we have 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.410
 to install is the app sing for ios 5.0 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.240
 if we have about 5.0 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.430
 if we have a device for example the 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.220
 fourth-generation ipod touch or the one 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.930
 third we would have to install this what 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.810
 it's safer because you'll take the 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.370
 version 5.1.1 because you finished it 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.489
 to update 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.290
 and if not good then the 4.0 this is 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.260
 It depends on the version we have of what 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:58.610
 of what of our ipod or iphone 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:01.879
 I explain if we have an ipod with 4.2.1 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:06.950
 we would have to install apps sync for 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:10.579
 4.0 and that that puts more is and following 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.659
 if we have any that is from 5.0 towards 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:16.850
 up the 5.0 and the more that means 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.169
 up if we have an ipod touch of 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.979
 first generation we would have to 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.889
 install apps sync ford or is 3.1 and good 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.470
 The 3.2 has installed us we have installed 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.770
 the truth 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.150
 once done that 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.040
 installed the apps inc 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.270
 we'll have to come down here where 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.120
 it installs and installs installed 5 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.900
 I'm going to install it so you can see how 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.060
 it is up here you can install 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.710
 we tell you to install and in this 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.430
 case you have to say reinstall but it gives 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.390
 same 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:55.590
 we confirm and wait for the short time 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.590
 that this may cost you 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.050
 and the truth is that I thought that 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.060
 we had made a video of this the 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.730
 true because as it is a channel that we have 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.030
 made videos of everything even the most 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.190
 big bullshit 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.400
 Well, I still do not know how we did not have 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.390
 done this the truth soon I will 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.830
 make a video in which I'm going to 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.430
 teach to change the back of 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.780
 your second generation ipod touch 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.900
 I have already bought the piece 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.910
 waiting for me to arrive then I have a 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.890
 iphone 3g to which you have to change the 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.260
 screen and the one that you have to change the 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:38.280
 backside buttons and so on 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.840
 what good then we will also make a video 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:45.800
 I'm pretty good at this 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.800
 dismantling and devices and you're done 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.830
 9 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.490
 we already had it installed the safest 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.250
 tell us to restart the spring board 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.050
 Well it will not return to Libya return 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.740
 so days we go out and here we have 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.990
 installed we have it already here in our 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.470
 home screen 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.200
 I recommend you here in settings 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:14.650
 active installs automatic li 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:17.180
 deactivate and sitt a think and let 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.580
 automatic read this why what for 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.260
 does automatic install reads is so that 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.450
 when we download an application nothing 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.720
 more is downloaded will install it and 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:30.420
 delete automatically would be to remove 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.610
 the app file that stays in it 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:36.210
 on the device because if we 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:38.480
 here in download we leave all of them 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.480
 records 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:44.500
 here saved what will happen is that if 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.990
 already the file weighs 16 megabytes inside 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.540
 of the device installed then 16 more 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:53.020
 8 or 10 which can weigh here as 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:55.509
 They are about 26 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.419
 with which we would double as good 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:07:00.699
 we would almost double what weighs each 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.919
 application and therefore good then in 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:04.240
 a device in this case 8 gigs 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:07.150
 although it can not be seen because I have 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.540
 put this then in a device 8 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.730
 gb that shows a lot 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.080
 then nothing, guys, nothing here, 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.880
 I leave with this I hope you liked it 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.010
 the video that you give to light favorites 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.680
 that you subscribe jce and that you continue 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.840
 following us as always I am very 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.850
 pleased with the result that the 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.030
 channel that every time I see myself I see myself more 

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:29.820
 closer to achieving the goal and 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.420
 nothing guys soon the review of 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.830
 iphone nano 

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:37.730
 I hope you see it and as I always say 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.730
 until next time
