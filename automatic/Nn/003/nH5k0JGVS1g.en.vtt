00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
supposed to be Easter eggs and I don't

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.340 
supposed to be Easter eggs and I don't
really<00:02:14.430> think<00:02:15.430> they<00:02:15.639> quite<00:02:16.000> look<00:02:16.510> like<00:02:16.810> Easter

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
really think they quite look like Easter

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.699 
really think they quite look like Easter
eggs<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.769> think<00:02:18.040> they<00:02:18.160> could<00:02:18.310> be<00:02:18.430> done<00:02:18.609> a<00:02:19.709> lot

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
eggs I think they could be done a lot

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.620 
eggs I think they could be done a lot
better<00:02:22.380> but<00:02:23.700> for<00:02:24.700> what<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.940> get<00:02:25.120> that's<00:02:25.329> fine

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
better but for what you get that's fine

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.860 
better but for what you get that's fine
and<00:02:25.840> if<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.019> have<00:02:26.139> some<00:02:26.290> extra<00:02:26.410> pieces<00:02:26.769> I

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
and if you have some extra pieces I

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.660 
and if you have some extra pieces I
think<00:02:28.870> would<00:02:28.959> be<00:02:29.139> very<00:02:29.349> easy<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.310> make<00:02:30.459> better

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
think would be very easy to make better

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.050 
think would be very easy to make better
Easter<00:02:31.510> eggs<00:02:31.690> for<00:02:32.139> the<00:02:32.170> basket<00:02:32.620> or<00:02:32.859> oh<00:02:33.280> that

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.309 
Easter eggs for the basket or oh that

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:39.669 
it with a ton of these dots and that

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.089 
it with a ton of these dots and that
would<00:02:39.790> be<00:02:40.049> equally<00:02:41.049> cute<00:02:41.290> or<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.799> can<00:02:41.919> fill<00:02:42.040> it
