have now a nice harmonica analog the
mouth<00:01:36.659> beats<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> holes<00:01:37.320> are<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.560> same<00:01:37.799> size

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
mouth beats the holes are the same size

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.859 
mouth beats the holes are the same size
as<00:01:38.520> your<00:01:38.670> standard<00:01:39.060> major<00:01:39.299> diatonic

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
as your standard major diatonic

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.780 
as your standard major diatonic
harmonica<00:01:40.350> there's<00:01:40.860> only<00:01:40.979> seven<00:01:41.369> holes<00:01:41.579> we

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
harmonica there's only seven holes we

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.490 
harmonica there's only seven holes we
don't<00:01:41.939> need<00:01:42.090> all<00:01:42.299> ten<00:01:42.540> holes<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.020> demonstrate

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
don't need all ten holes to demonstrate

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.230 
don't need all ten holes to demonstrate
what's<00:01:43.649> happening<00:01:44.009> with<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> lips<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
what's happening with the lips and the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.580 
what's happening with the lips and the
tongue<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:47.149> how<00:01:48.149> how<00:01:48.899> small<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.500> want

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
tongue and if you how how small you want

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.660 
tongue and if you how how small you want
to<00:01:49.740> make<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.009> mouthpieces

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
to make the mouthpieces

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.819 
to make the mouthpieces
up<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.149> how<00:01:51.270> much<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.840> pinch<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.740> you

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
up to you on how much you pinch so you

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.560 
up to you on how much you pinch so you
can<00:01:52.950> keep<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.189> fairly<00:01:53.340> large<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.060> squish

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
can keep it fairly large you can squish

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.639 
can keep it fairly large you can squish
it<00:01:54.689> down<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.899> little<00:01:55.079> bit<00:01:55.229> whatever<00:01:55.439> is

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
it down a little bit whatever is

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.020 
it down a little bit whatever is
comfortable<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.520> makes<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.820> easy

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
comfortable for you and makes it easy

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.719 
comfortable for you and makes it easy
for<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.360> see<00:01:57.770> talking<00:01:58.770> about<00:01:58.950> seeing<00:01:59.130> I've

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
for you to see talking about seeing I've

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.429 
for you to see talking about seeing I've
taken<00:02:00.090> one<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.360> these<00:02:00.479> going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.750> modify<00:02:01.200> them

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
taken one of these going to modify them

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.810 
taken one of these going to modify them
and<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.649> notice<00:02:01.860> there's<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.219> green<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.670> red

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
and you notice there's a green and red

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.030 
and you notice there's a green and red
they<00:02:03.780> come<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.170> various<00:02:04.500> colors

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
they come in various colors

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.530 
they come in various colors
I<00:02:05.070> found<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.579> color<00:02:05.759> doesn't<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.270> matter

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
I found that color doesn't really matter

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.719 
I found that color doesn't really matter
it's<00:02:07.110> more<00:02:07.439> about<00:02:07.680> seeing<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.550> know<00:02:08.610> your

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
it's more about seeing you know your

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.669 
it's more about seeing you know your
pink<00:02:08.970> tongue<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.599> then<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.050> black<00:02:10.379> hole

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
pink tongue and then the black hole

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.280 
pink tongue and then the black hole
basically<00:02:11.430> where<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.030> see<00:02:12.209> black<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.900> where

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
basically where you see black is where

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.780 
basically where you see black is where
is<00:02:13.349> open<00:02:13.769> in<00:02:13.890> your<00:02:14.010> mouth<00:02:14.159> you're<00:02:14.459> seeing<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
is open in your mouth you're seeing the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.390 
is open in your mouth you're seeing the
cavernous<00:02:15.450> cavity<00:02:16.019> inside<00:02:16.349> of<00:02:16.530> your<00:02:16.650> mouth<00:02:16.829> so

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
cavernous cavity inside of your mouth so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.250 
cavernous cavity inside of your mouth so
I've<00:02:17.670> actually<00:02:17.819> chopped<00:02:18.269> one<00:02:18.510> up<00:02:18.659> so<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.079> I

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
I've actually chopped one up so that I

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.770 
I've actually chopped one up so that I
make<00:02:19.829> sure<00:02:19.980> there's<00:02:20.250> no<00:02:20.599> obstruction<00:02:21.599> for

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
make sure there's no obstruction for

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.959 
make sure there's no obstruction for
light<00:02:22.049> so<00:02:22.349> that<00:02:22.530> when<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.680> go<00:02:22.859> to<00:02:22.920> my<00:02:23.459> close-up

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
light so that when I go to my close-up

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.429 
light so that when I go to my close-up
camera<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.359> can<00:02:24.480> see<00:02:24.629> exactly<00:02:24.959> what<00:02:25.290> my

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
camera you can see exactly what my

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.289 
camera you can see exactly what my
tongue<00:02:25.709> is<00:02:25.829> doing<00:02:26.159> so<00:02:26.340> that's<00:02:26.640> that's<00:02:27.030> my

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
tongue is doing so that's that's my

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.509 
tongue is doing so that's that's my
version<00:02:27.359> right<00:02:27.930> there<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.829> once<00:02:29.129> you<00:02:29.250> have<00:02:29.370> it

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
version right there so once you have it

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.339 
version right there so once you have it
all<00:02:29.700> set<00:02:30.239> up<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.629> you've<00:02:30.720> got<00:02:30.750> your<00:02:31.079> harmonica

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
all set up and you've got your harmonica

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.120 
all set up and you've got your harmonica
analog<00:02:32.159> you're<00:02:32.459> really<00:02:32.790> get<00:02:32.939> wrong
