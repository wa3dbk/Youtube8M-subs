avoid stories involving death here on

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.120 
avoid stories involving death here on
now<00:02:59.880> but<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.510> last<00:03:00.690> story<00:03:00.960> was<00:03:01.050> too<00:03:01.440> big<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.920> I

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
now but the last story was too big and I

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.860 
now but the last story was too big and I
feel<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.490> will<00:03:02.610> continue<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.180> get<00:03:03.270> bigger<00:03:03.480> so<00:03:03.660> I

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
feel it will continue to get bigger so I

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.020
