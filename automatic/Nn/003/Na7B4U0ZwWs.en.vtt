order to put this in and I don't really

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.250 
order to put this in and I don't really
understand<00:00:33.120> why<00:00:33.300> he<00:00:33.420> would<00:00:33.540> do<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.719> he<00:00:33.899> says

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
understand why he would do that he says

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.170 
understand why he would do that he says
under<00:00:34.530> lots<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.800> pressure<00:00:34.860> pressure<00:00:35.850> from

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
under lots of pressure pressure from

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.240 
under lots of pressure pressure from
whom<00:00:36.360> if<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> Americans<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.860> wonder<00:00:38.129> or

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
whom if it's the Americans you wonder or

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.799 
whom if it's the Americans you wonder or
who<00:00:38.399> exactly<00:00:38.790> as<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> government's<00:00:39.420> loyalty

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
who exactly as the government's loyalty

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.170 
who exactly as the government's loyalty
to<00:00:40.020> its<00:00:40.320> one<00:00:40.680> people<00:00:41.100> or<00:00:41.280> turn<00:00:41.460> another<00:00:41.670> power

to its one people or turn another power

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.299 
to its one people or turn another power
and<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:43.020> find<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.469> quite<00:00:43.530> worrying<00:00:44.129> because

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
and I find that quite worrying because

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.430 
and I find that quite worrying because
if<00:00:44.520> Gary<00:00:44.730> had<00:00:44.940> had<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> chance<00:00:45.450> for<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.289> to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
if Gary had had the chance for this to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.440 
if Gary had had the chance for this to
go<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.590> into<00:00:46.890> next<00:00:47.100> year<00:00:47.430> you'd<00:00:47.910> possibly<00:00:48.149> are

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
go on into next year you'd possibly are

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.250 
go on into next year you'd possibly are
going<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.660> have<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> change<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.110> government

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
going to have a change of government

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.529 
going to have a change of government
where<00:00:49.950> he<00:00:50.129> has<00:00:50.309> more<00:00:50.489> chance<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.969> staying<00:00:51.149> here

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
where he has more chance of staying here

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.720 
where he has more chance of staying here
because<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> Conservatives<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:53.100> expressed

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
because the Conservatives have expressed

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.270 
because the Conservatives have expressed
some<00:00:53.969> support<00:00:54.360> if<00:00:54.719> he<00:00:55.020> didn't<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.559> Asperger

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
some support if he didn't have Asperger

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.860 
some support if he didn't have Asperger
syndrome<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.879> problems<00:00:57.239> he's<00:00:57.420> got<00:00:57.660> you

syndrome and the problems he's got you

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.510 
syndrome and the problems he's got you
accept<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.350> he<00:00:58.469> probably<00:00:58.680> should<00:00:59.399> be

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
accept that he probably should be

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.790 
accept that he probably should be
extradited<00:00:59.820> absolutely<00:01:00.539> not<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:01.530> don't<00:01:01.649> have
