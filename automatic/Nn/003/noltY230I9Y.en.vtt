00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.070
 sÃ©verac am super happy to find 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.370
 for us when exo today a few 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.450
 items to exonhit dozen in all so from 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:38.820
 4-6 7-6 the world + 3 before dawn this 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.190
 time so it's gone I propose you 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.960
 and then suddenly a subscriber offered me 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.879
 pass an item for him so we'll see 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.530
 surprise at the end it's already a 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.839
 bigger system than I can 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.909
 you I can show you and we're going 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.610
 immediately started with the little ones 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.850
 rings does not know it's because they 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.830
 which is easier to pass 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.850
 I hope this will happen story of 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.610
 to be a little careful it's gone 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.479
 first no I have no change takes 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.180
 hop here's second either and the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.510
 third ring nothing so here we go 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.799
 we will now go to our 7 solo 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.930
 world so he really had nothing less 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.970
 that his pass is what the lack of that does 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.860
 long time we did not have an exodus 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.430
 has passed so it could be nice I 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.619
 think of 1,2 finally having a small item 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.079
 to resell at least 13 million that me 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.399
 would really please especially that 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.219
 since I'm trying to improve myself 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.829
 on the jets as you see here 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:37.079
 I try to play but more money in 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.990
 the streets finally so that would be 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.719
 really where the father's age worried part 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.280

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.229
 cool enough that we can make a profit 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.490
 little thing so second passing 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:56.810

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:59.549
