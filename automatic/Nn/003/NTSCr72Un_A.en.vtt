and that it looked at different types of
vegetarians<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.500> concluded<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.069> some

vegetarians and concluded that some

00:03:59.249 --> 00:03:59.259 
vegetarian dietary patterns are

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:00.839

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
definitely better than others which I've

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.520 
definitely better than others which I've
been<00:04:01.030> talking<00:04:01.329> about<00:04:01.389> for<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.720> long<00:04:01.780> time<00:04:02.139> so

wasn't observed necessarily for women
now<00:04:45.820> there<00:04:46.510> were<00:04:46.600> differences<00:04:46.900> between<00:04:47.290> the

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
now there were differences between the

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.700 
now there were differences between the
vegetarian<00:04:48.280> groups<00:04:48.580> that<00:04:48.910> were<00:04:49.200> was<00:04:50.200> talking

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
vegetarian groups that were was talking

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.159 
vegetarian groups that were was talking
about<00:04:50.770> for<00:04:51.190> example<00:04:51.510> British<00:04:52.510> vegetarians

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
about for example British vegetarians

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.290 
about for example British vegetarians
and<00:04:53.380> us<00:04:53.680> Adventists<00:04:54.490> vegetarians<00:04:55.090> eat

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
and us Adventists vegetarians eat

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.150 
and us Adventists vegetarians eat
differently<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.930> Adventists<00:04:56.590> consume<00:04:56.980> more

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
differently the Adventists consume more

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.980 
differently the Adventists consume more
fiber<00:04:57.460> and<00:04:57.669> vitamin<00:04:58.000> C<00:04:58.150> than<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.419> BRICS<00:04:58.660> and

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
fiber and vitamin C than the BRICS and

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.810 
fiber and vitamin C than the BRICS and
the<00:04:59.500> British<00:04:59.770> vegetarians<00:05:00.370> didn't<00:05:00.700> have

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
the British vegetarians didn't have

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.460 
the British vegetarians didn't have
lower<00:05:01.060> mortality<00:05:01.419> rates<00:05:01.990> than<00:05:02.139> their

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
lower mortality rates than their

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.920 
lower mortality rates than their
non-vegetarian<00:05:03.370> counterparts<00:05:03.910> so<00:05:04.510> the<00:05:04.630> type

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
non-vegetarian counterparts so the type

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.990 
non-vegetarian counterparts so the type
of<00:05:04.960> vegetarian<00:05:05.560> you<00:05:05.919> decide<00:05:06.220> to<00:05:06.340> become<00:05:06.490> or

plant-eater you decide to come does make

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.550 
plant-eater you decide to come does make
a<00:05:09.760> difference<00:05:10.240> now<00:05:10.810> in<00:05:11.050> an<00:05:11.200> interview

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560
