 sales team to templar represents 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.959
 translated Alexis Medvedev offscreen 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.460
 text demyanoff.spb.ru smarter day by 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.980
 of the day 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.169
 weird tracked locomotive hi this 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.330
 to the truth you are able to channel day from 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.720
 day now i'm in the room to either he 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.099
 winner of a science fair 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.820
 this is because you participated in that video with 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:33.520
 cat so much so than we are today, I zaymomsya 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.670
 then shared with you later these 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.649
 lego engines cool stuff when i 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.350
 I called you said I want you 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.080
 built me ​​something for the video yes it is 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.600
 caterpillar lego engine running from 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.310
 batteries 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.440
 he moves the wheel axle 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.760
 caterpillars fist driving this whole thing and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.770
 ratchet which allows the tracks 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.230
 moving to one point is cool when 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.089
 you turn off the ratchet everything stops 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.939
 work so you connect it yes 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.850
 she presses herself yes it's cool 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.799
 I've always been attracted by locomotives 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.139
 why to either need all these engines 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.850
 so today in our program we 

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:17.499
 consider the tracked movement 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.049
 locomotive but for this we need 

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:22.179
 go to the amazon jungle this one 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.859
 group of caterpillar do something strange 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:28.630
 let's get smarter day by day 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.880
 look gordon found great 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.829
 a caterpillar that simply represents 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.709
 a macro organism of small 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.770
 caterpillars and they all move as one 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:37.770
 whole 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.499
 Yes, it looks wonderful 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.020
 they all stop and think 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:51.969
 lump sum gerson like this 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:55.740
 in general can be called without a concept, see 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:59.009
 they all stop at the same time 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.009
 some miracles 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.560
 if at school you are asked to watch 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.140
 fish or birds usually ahead 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.300
 flocks turn out to be the leading leader 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.730
 watching the caterpillars during their stops and 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.940
 pondering you will notice that it is sometimes 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.319
 transmitted from the end to the beginning 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.540
 really weird interesting what's behind 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:45.030
 cycles and rhythms control the movement i don't 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.030
 I know you just look very unusual 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.640
 with 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.829
 mark yourself video review 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.409
 with caterpillars and watch moves or 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.750
 the top two times faster than the lower or the same 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.549
 it depends on the number of their layers when 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.129
 they move like three times faster 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.290
 only when i started playing league models 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.420
 I realized that not only the second and third 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.579
 caterpillar level moves faster and what 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.860
 this is their whole group for 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.200
 demonstrate this we will arrange lego race 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.720
 from this side I take one caterpillar with 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.700
 other side their whole group each 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.269
 time i'm going to move one caterpillar over 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.909
 click 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.010
 and move the bottom on click as well as those 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.260
 who spins on top with one click 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:45.959
 look at the hay tracks you are ready 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:48.359
 attention start in this our little 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.609
 races you can see that single 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.430
 the caterpillar moves slower than the caterpillar 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.409
 from the group so we have two levels means 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.690
 is it that together they move twice 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.670
 faster no it's wrong do 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.379
 mathematical calculations and write in 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.000
 comments on how much they are faster 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.400
 just think of something 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.049
 what if we have three levels or 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.030
 more how much efficiency 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.790
 is added to the real caterpillar at 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.599
 adding the level of the coolest of all is how they 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.880
 stop at the same time then they 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:21.630
 start moving again like 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.820
 tactile communication thank you 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.190
 learned a new way caterpillars with us and 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.440
 thank you if the buza game is left with me 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.030
 Now I will study your instructions as 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.400
 walk the details league barefoot 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.270
 I hope everything is fine, I am more to you 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.479
 nothing should 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:41.460
 fruits all the way all the best to you you 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:44.000
 get smarter day by day I'm for 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.800
 to call it a brood of caterpillars 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 brood and how would you call it gordon 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.000
 small case 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.910
 what hurts 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.430
 of course then you can do more crazy 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.850
 pieces up to 10 minutes to have a year 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.890
 get on yes it's cool let's 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.630
 let's go through twenty pounds to find 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:16.840
 still that release is prepared obverse and 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:20.340
 studios conscious translation approach 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.340
 accept your orders
