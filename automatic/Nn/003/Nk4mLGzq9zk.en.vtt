Anderson how's it going it's going very
well<00:00:40.340> we're<00:00:40.730> so<00:00:40.910> happy<00:00:41.210> to<00:00:41.300> be<00:00:41.390> able<00:00:41.510> to<00:00:41.660> be

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
well we're so happy to be able to be

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.299 
well we're so happy to be able to be
talking<00:00:42.140> about<00:00:42.199> three<00:00:42.620> bodies<00:00:42.920> again<00:00:43.129> in<00:00:43.250> the

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
talking about three bodies again in the

talking about three bodies again in the
modulus<00:00:43.730> boots<00:00:43.940> it's<00:00:44.120> been<00:00:44.239> a<00:00:44.269> long<00:00:44.540> time

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
modulus boots it's been a long time

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.390 
modulus boots it's been a long time
coming<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:45.290> I<00:00:45.440> think<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.830> lot<00:00:45.949> of<00:00:46.100> people<00:00:46.340> are

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
coming so I think a lot of people are

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.430 
coming so I think a lot of people are
gonna<00:00:46.489> be<00:00:46.670> psyched<00:00:46.910> absolutely<00:00:47.900> absolutely

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
gonna be psyched absolutely absolutely
