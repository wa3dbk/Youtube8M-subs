your business and your public persona or

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.170 
your business and your public persona or
I<00:00:48.960> think<00:00:49.620> maybe<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.860> felt<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.640> way<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> little

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
I think maybe I felt that way a little

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.689 
I think maybe I felt that way a little
bit<00:00:51.329> because<00:00:52.320> when<00:00:52.590> people<00:00:52.710> are<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.520> your

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
bit because when people are it's your

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.260 
bit because when people are it's your
mother

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
mother

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.580 
mother
I<00:00:54.300> mean<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:54.930> that's<00:00:55.079> what<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.500> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
I mean that's that's what you have to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.590 
I mean that's that's what you have to
imagine<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.039> when<00:00:56.190> people<00:00:56.309> are<00:00:56.520> saying<00:00:57.480> things

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
imagine is when people are saying things

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.779 
imagine is when people are saying things
about<00:00:57.899> your<00:00:58.109> mother<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.100> very<00:00:59.370> personal

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
about your mother it's a very personal

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.060 
about your mother it's a very personal
thing<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:01.320> know<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.559> Jaime<00:01:01.800> said<00:01:01.949> it

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
thing so you know like Jaime said it

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.179 
thing so you know like Jaime said it
this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.210> not<00:01:03.329> who<00:01:03.570> my<00:01:04.379> mother<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.680> it
