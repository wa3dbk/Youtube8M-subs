00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
through the bottom of seidel and then

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.400 
through the bottom of seidel and then
we'll<00:00:47.460> loosely<00:00:47.820> install<00:00:48.120> two<00:00:48.450> square<00:00:48.960> nuts

we'll loosely install two square nuts
now<00:00:50.309> we're<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.610> leave<00:00:50.700> these<00:00:50.789> loose

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
now we're going to leave these loose

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.360 
now we're going to leave these loose
because<00:00:51.780> eventually<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.320> crossbar<00:00:52.860> will

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
because eventually the crossbar will

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.819 
because eventually the crossbar will
slide<00:00:53.660> into<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.809> hardware<00:00:55.170> once<00:00:55.649> again

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
slide into this hardware once again

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.830 
slide into this hardware once again
we'll<00:00:55.949> do<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.219> both<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.399> them<00:00:56.690> alright<00:00:57.690> now

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
we'll do it for both of them alright now

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.299 
we'll do it for both of them alright now
at<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.109> point<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.800> go<00:00:58.949> ahead<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.129> take<00:00:59.280> one

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
at this point we go ahead and take one

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.400 
at this point we go ahead and take one
of<00:00:59.430> uprights<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.120> install<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.989> into<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.320> of

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
of uprights and install it into one of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.590 
of uprights and install it into one of
the<00:01:01.469> base<00:01:01.620> assemblies<00:01:02.219> now<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> good<00:01:03.539> idea

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
the base assemblies now it's a good idea

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.450 
the base assemblies now it's a good idea
to<00:01:03.899> take<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> knob<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> base<00:01:05.100> assembly

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
to take the knob on the base assembly

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.090 
to take the knob on the base assembly
and<00:01:05.850> loosen<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:07.439> we'll<00:01:07.830> go<00:01:08.010> ahead

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and loosen it up and then we'll go ahead

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.190 
and loosen it up and then we'll go ahead
and<00:01:08.280> take<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.060> upright<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.689> install<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
and take the upright and install it

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.870 
and take the upright and install it
we're<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.860> look<00:01:11.010> from<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> bottom<00:01:11.670> side

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
we're going to look from the bottom side

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.330 
we're going to look from the bottom side
so<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:12.900> see<00:01:13.110> what<00:01:13.590> needs<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.830> line<00:01:14.040> up<00:01:14.189> so

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
so you can see what needs to line up so

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.210 
so you can see what needs to line up so
we<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.549> assemble<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.860> well<00:01:16.860> flip<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.130> over

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
we can assemble it well flip it over

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.070 
we can assemble it well flip it over
till<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.580> see<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.759> numbers<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:18.960> we'll

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
till you can see the numbers then we'll

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.240 
till you can see the numbers then we'll
go<00:01:19.140> ahead<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.350> line<00:01:19.500> up<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.680> edge<00:01:19.860> with<00:01:20.100> one

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
go ahead and line up the edge with one

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.770 
go ahead and line up the edge with one
of<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.369> numbers<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.270> case<00:01:21.540> we're<00:01:21.689> gonna

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
of the numbers in this case we're gonna

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.170 
of the numbers in this case we're gonna
use<00:01:21.840> number<00:01:22.200> 28<00:01:22.830> alright<00:01:23.430> then<00:01:23.939> we'll<00:01:23.970> take

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
use number 28 alright then we'll take

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.330 
use number 28 alright then we'll take
the<00:01:24.270> knob<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:25.619> hand<00:01:25.890> tighten<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.220> back

even it out from left to right make sure
it's<00:05:02.059> even<00:05:02.300> on<00:05:02.360> both<00:05:02.509> sides<00:05:03.099> and<00:05:04.099> then<00:05:04.249> we'll

00:05:04.329 --> 00:05:04.339 
it's even on both sides and then we'll

it's even on both sides and then we'll
go<00:05:04.459> ahead<00:05:04.520> and<00:05:04.610> tighten<00:05:04.909> down<00:05:04.939> to<00:05:05.119> hard<00:05:05.300> where

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
go ahead and tighten down to hard where

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.859 
go ahead and tighten down to hard where
our<00:05:07.009> first<00:05:07.189> half<00:05:07.459> is<00:05:07.669> installed<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:08.449> ready<00:05:08.539> to

00:05:08.859 --> 00:05:08.869 
our first half is installed and ready to

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:10.719 
our first half is installed and ready to
go<00:05:09.020> now<00:05:09.649> we'll<00:05:09.800> go<00:05:09.889> ahead<00:05:09.919> and<00:05:10.189> install<00:05:10.520> the

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
go now we'll go ahead and install the

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.760 
go now we'll go ahead and install the
back<00:05:10.909> half<00:05:11.289> basically<00:05:12.289> it's<00:05:12.499> going<00:05:12.679> to

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
back half basically it's going to

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.579 
back half basically it's going to
assemble<00:05:12.979> the<00:05:13.159> same<00:05:13.459> exact<00:05:13.849> way<00:05:14.139> however<00:05:15.139> the

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:15.589 
assemble the same exact way however the

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:18.129 
assemble the same exact way however the
base<00:05:15.800> rails<00:05:16.099> will<00:05:16.490> be<00:05:16.550> oriented<00:05:17.029> the<00:05:17.749> opposite

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
base rails will be oriented the opposite

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.769 
base rails will be oriented the opposite
way<00:05:18.289> to<00:05:18.830> allow<00:05:18.949> the<00:05:19.909> rack<00:05:20.089> to<00:05:20.240> be<00:05:20.300> as<00:05:20.389> wide<00:05:20.599> as

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:20.779 
way to allow the rack to be as wide as

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.239 
way to allow the rack to be as wide as
possible<00:05:20.990> when<00:05:21.559> it's<00:05:21.679> installed<00:05:21.889> on<00:05:22.189> the

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:22.249 
possible when it's installed on the

possible when it's installed on the
truck<00:05:22.429> and<00:05:22.789> with<00:05:23.360> that<00:05:23.599> they'll<00:05:23.929> finish<00:05:24.349> it
