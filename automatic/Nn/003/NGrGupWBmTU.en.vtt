you're<00:01:34.829> using<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.310> slide<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.700> inside<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.540> TPU

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
you're using and slide it inside the TPU

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.960 
you're using and slide it inside the TPU
material<00:01:37.470> then<00:01:37.890> take<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.280> aluminum<00:01:38.460> bumper

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
material then take the aluminum bumper

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.420 
material then take the aluminum bumper
and<00:01:39.150> slide<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.659> back<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.860> very<00:01:40.890> easy

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and slide it back on it's a very easy

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.460 
and slide it back on it's a very easy
process<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.299> said<00:01:42.329> however<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.259> very

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
process like I said however it's a very

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.380 
process like I said however it's a very
tight<00:01:43.890> fit<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.490> you're<00:01:44.909> gonna<00:01:45.090> need<00:01:45.240> to

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
tight fit so you're gonna need to

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.450 
tight fit so you're gonna need to
finagle<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.259> wiggle<00:01:46.560> around<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> little

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
finagle and wiggle around be a little

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.069 
finagle and wiggle around be a little
bit<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.640> bumper<00:01:47.970> until<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.450> feel<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.780> slide

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
bit of bumper until you feel it slide

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.530 
bit of bumper until you feel it slide
into<00:01:49.320> place<00:01:49.790> unlike<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.909> spigen<00:01:51.299> Neo<00:01:51.329> Hybrid

and putting on the case the iPhone
six-plus<00:02:13.070> variant<00:02:13.490> is<00:02:13.580> much<00:02:14.030> much<00:02:14.270> harder<00:02:14.630> to

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
six-plus variant is much much harder to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.990 
six-plus variant is much much harder to
take<00:02:14.930> off<00:02:15.140> than<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.770> iPhone<00:02:16.130> 6<00:02:16.460> and<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.790> note

take off than the iPhone 6 and the note
4<00:02:17.330> I'm<00:02:17.810> not<00:02:17.990> sure<00:02:18.170> why<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.440> is<00:02:18.680> but<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.340> a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
4 I'm not sure why that is but it is a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.640 
4 I'm not sure why that is but it is a
much<00:02:19.790> much<00:02:20.060> tighter<00:02:20.360> fit<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.260> was<00:02:21.440> unable

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
much much tighter fit and I was unable

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.680 
much much tighter fit and I was unable
to<00:02:21.860> slide<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.520> bumper<00:02:22.880> off<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.360> TPU

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
to slide the bumper off of the TPU

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.390 
to slide the bumper off of the TPU
material<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:24.350> order<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.680> take<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.040> case<00:02:25.220> off

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
material in order to take the case off

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.820 
material in order to take the case off
instead<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.540> had<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.810> be<00:02:26.959> very<00:02:27.320> very<00:02:27.530> careful

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
instead I had to be very very careful

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.670 
instead I had to be very very careful
and<00:02:28.220> slide<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.030> case<00:02:29.209> off<00:02:29.480> while<00:02:30.080> keeping<00:02:30.530> the

and slide the case off while keeping the
bumper<00:02:31.040> on<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:32.000> let's<00:02:32.180> talk<00:02:32.330> about<00:02:32.390> the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
bumper on so let's talk about the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.210 
bumper on so let's talk about the
construction<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.380> this<00:02:33.530> case<00:02:33.830> on<00:02:34.100> the

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
construction of this case on the

edge there where the Lightning port is
kind<00:05:40.700> of<00:05:40.760> just<00:05:40.940> dug<00:05:41.210> into<00:05:41.419> my<00:05:41.630> pinky<00:05:42.169> and<00:05:42.200> I<00:05:42.350> got

kind of just dug into my pinky and I got

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.020 
kind of just dug into my pinky and I got
a<00:05:42.530> little<00:05:42.710> bit<00:05:42.890> uncomfortable<00:05:43.610> from<00:05:43.669> time<00:05:43.940> to

time with the note 4 I don't feel that

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.730 
time with the note 4 I don't feel that
happening<00:05:46.970> so<00:05:47.210> I<00:05:47.450> guess<00:05:47.870> it's<00:05:48.050> just<00:05:48.110> whatever

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
happening so I guess it's just whatever

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.680 
happening so I guess it's just whatever
position<00:05:49.130> I'm<00:05:49.490> resting<00:05:49.970> my<00:05:50.000> pinkie<00:05:50.540> down

there<00:05:50.900> however<00:05:51.470> I<00:05:51.590> do<00:05:51.770> find<00:05:52.100> it<00:05:52.190> a<00:05:52.250> little<00:05:52.340> bit

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
there however I do find it a little bit

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.310 
there however I do find it a little bit
more<00:05:52.669> comfortable<00:05:52.970> on<00:05:53.270> the<00:05:53.390> neck<00:05:53.419> 4<00:05:53.840> so

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
more comfortable on the neck 4 so

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.170 
more comfortable on the neck 4 so
ultimately<00:05:54.740> it<00:05:55.130> comes<00:05:55.280> down<00:05:55.430> to<00:05:55.580> do<00:05:56.120> I
