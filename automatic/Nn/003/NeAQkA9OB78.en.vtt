assume almost intuitively that you're

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.900 
assume almost intuitively that you're
sort<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:13.550> operating<00:03:14.550> out<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.850> mind<00:03:15.239> and

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
sort of operating out of the mind and

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.479 
sort of operating out of the mind and
although<00:03:17.910> we<00:03:18.480> we<00:03:19.079> cannot<00:03:19.470> think<00:03:19.829> our<00:03:20.130> way<00:03:20.430> to

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
although we we cannot think our way to

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.130 
although we we cannot think our way to
love<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.170> mind<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.500> not<00:03:22.769> capable<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:24.840> and

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
love the mind is not capable of that and

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.520 
love the mind is not capable of that and
yet<00:03:25.470> we<00:03:26.130> can<00:03:26.340> educate<00:03:26.579> ourselves<00:03:27.530> with

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
yet we can educate ourselves with

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.539 
yet we can educate ourselves with
spiritual<00:03:29.130> books<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:30.590> intention<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:33.230> begin
