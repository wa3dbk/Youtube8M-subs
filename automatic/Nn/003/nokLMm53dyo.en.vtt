fit<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> bolt<00:00:18.270> does<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:19.230> measured<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.220> length

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
fit the bolt does I measured the length

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.210 
fit the bolt does I measured the length
of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> bolt<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.029> needed<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:22.160> drilled<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
of the bolt that I needed I drilled the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.000 
of the bolt that I needed I drilled the
hole<00:00:23.460> out<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.650> so<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.859> could<00:00:25.980> be

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
hole out so that it so that it could be

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.589
