boot<00:03:14.470> like<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.100> just<00:03:15.160> make<00:03:15.460> sure<00:03:15.700> that

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
boot like this is I just make sure that

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.700 
boot like this is I just make sure that
the<00:03:16.060> buckle<00:03:16.360> parts<00:03:16.660> completely<00:03:17.230> clear<00:03:17.470> that

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
the buckle parts completely clear that

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.030 
the buckle parts completely clear that
the<00:03:17.800> wires<00:03:18.040> are<00:03:18.630> disengaged<00:03:19.630> from<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:20.080> clips

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
the wires are disengaged from the clips

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.490 
the wires are disengaged from the clips
on<00:03:21.220> front<00:03:21.490> of<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.670> buckle<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.870> way<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.110> start

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
on front of the buckle and way I start

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.200 
on front of the buckle and way I start
off<00:03:23.590> as<00:03:23.830> I<00:03:23.920> felt<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.310> gauge<00:03:24.460> of<00:03:24.490> Bank<00:03:24.880> ample

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
off as I felt the gauge of Bank ample

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.990 
off as I felt the gauge of Bank ample
way<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:26.470> is<00:03:26.590> much<00:03:26.800> easier<00:03:26.830> if<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.520> food<00:03:27.700> gets

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
way this is much easier if the food gets

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.420 
way this is much easier if the food gets
used<00:03:28.270> and<00:03:28.630> this<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:28.900> I've<00:03:29.890> had<00:03:30.010> quite<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.280> few
