time<00:00:16.410> but<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.770> will<00:00:16.859> do<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.039> quickly<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.910> is

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
time but it will do it quickly this is

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.439 
time but it will do it quickly this is
basically<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.690> whole<00:00:18.840> thing<00:00:19.970> I'd<00:00:20.970> be<00:00:21.029> good<00:00:21.330> if

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
you could make it color-coded that this

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.060 
you could make it color-coded that this
one<00:00:24.119> isn't<00:00:24.300> I'd<00:00:24.900> be<00:00:25.140> much<00:00:25.289> better<00:00:25.619> looking<00:00:25.920> at

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
one isn't I'd be much better looking at
