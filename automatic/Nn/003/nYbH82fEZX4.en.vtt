let's<00:04:08.530> say<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:08.739> can<00:04:08.920> band-aid<00:04:09.400> them<00:04:09.519> closed

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.680 

I<00:04:14.769> don't<00:04:15.489> know<00:04:15.579> what<00:04:15.879> things<00:04:16.120> really<00:04:18.690> will

I don't know what things really will

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.629 
I don't know what things really will
have<00:04:19.840> to<00:04:19.989> maybe<00:04:20.199> try<00:04:20.949> to<00:04:21.039> do<00:04:21.220> something<00:04:21.459> with

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
have to maybe try to do something with

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:22.140 
have to maybe try to do something with
that

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
that

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.230 
that
I<00:04:23.340> can't<00:04:24.340> leave<00:04:24.520> them<00:04:24.610> like<00:04:24.669> this<00:04:24.970> we'll<00:04:25.210> lose

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
I can't leave them like this we'll lose

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.779 
I can't leave them like this we'll lose
more<00:04:25.600> than<00:04:25.750> that<00:04:25.900> one<00:04:26.080> egg<00:04:29.039> part<00:04:30.039> of<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.220> risk

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
more than that one egg part of the risk

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:35.959 
more than that one egg part of the risk
of<00:04:30.970> doing<00:04:31.150> business

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:35.969 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:50.529 

man<00:04:36.659> they're<00:04:36.959> really<00:04:36.989> glued<00:04:37.679> together<00:04:40.129> and

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:58.879 

we're<00:04:51.539> at<00:04:51.629> the<00:04:51.809> embryo<00:04:52.019> I<00:04:52.579> think<00:04:57.889> probably

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
we're at the embryo I think probably

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:10.339 
we're at the embryo I think probably
unlikely<00:04:59.519> it'll<00:04:59.849> make<00:05:00.059> it<00:05:06.919> now<00:05:08.479> take<00:05:09.479> that<00:05:09.719> egg

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
unlikely it'll make it now take that egg

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.299 
unlikely it'll make it now take that egg
I<00:05:11.659> know<00:05:12.659> I've<00:05:13.019> absolutely<00:05:13.229> had<00:05:13.709> a<00:05:13.860> meal<00:05:14.129> before

00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:14.309 
I know I've absolutely had a meal before

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:19.850 
I know I've absolutely had a meal before
a<00:05:14.729> little<00:05:16.729> okay<00:05:17.729> who<00:05:18.329> knows<00:05:18.649> we'll<00:05:19.649> try

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
a little okay who knows we'll try

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.269 
a little okay who knows we'll try
anything<00:05:20.389> once

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:22.279 
anything once

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:27.469 
anything once
hopefully<00:05:23.279> that<00:05:23.459> was<00:05:23.610> just<00:05:23.789> a<00:05:23.879> hat<00:05:26.479> hopefully

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
hopefully that was just a hat hopefully

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.139 
hopefully that was just a hat hopefully
it<00:05:27.569> was<00:05:27.629> nothing<00:05:28.049> it'll<00:05:28.259> make<00:05:28.469> it<00:05:28.909> so<00:05:29.909> Tim's

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:30.149 
it was nothing it'll make it so Tim's

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:32.179 
it was nothing it'll make it so Tim's
