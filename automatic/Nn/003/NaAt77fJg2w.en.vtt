00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello live suburban 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.330
 puzzles and and leading protection for Valeria 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.719
 Your consultant for natural agricultural engineering 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.210
 this spring summer and autumn we will be together with 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.910
 you solve your problems spring 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.550
 we come to the anonymous window waiting for us our 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.770
 green pets need to see just 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.590
 Do they have enough in different plants 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.449
 different nutritional needs I suggest 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.609
 you to use 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.710
 universal drug that and under 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.900
 feeds the plants and decontaminate from 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.739
 fungi soil and stimulate them 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:40.350
 development is done so take a pinch 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.600
 shine 2 sprinkle quite a bit then 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.399
 we mix the top layer a little 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.680
 water as a rule 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.960
 the cause of the weakened state of plants 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.629
 not in nutrition but in 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.390
 lack of light even if you have a southern 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.760
 window to plants of light is clearly not enough 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.760
 I suggest either to install a special up 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.680
 Svetka either use the drug n 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.100
 at 101 which relieves stress and by 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.229
 illumination for this we take the drug on 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.780
 liter of water literally need 2 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.369
 one two droplets lovers plant 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.200
 seedlings in January I want to demonstrate 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.630
 the fact is this pepper is planted with germinated 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.030
 seeds on March 14 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.590
 notice the condition he was 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.080
 planted carp pills therefore 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.060
 developed very quickly cucumbers it 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.970
 seedlings are ready for planting 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.369
 her age is not more than three weeks 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.280
 normal age of tomato seedlings 50 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.890
 55 days and you are now in April you bought 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.570
 the rhizome of some perennial as his 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.190
 will definitely need to land in 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.350
 pot in many plants 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.840
 there is no nutrient supply in the roots 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.060
 so long sit in such here 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.370
 tea bags they can not they will dry 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.380
 as practice shows very much 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.420
 plant development holds back volume 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.080
 pot do not forget on time 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.210
 replant the plant in large containers 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.240
 When transplanting plants it is very important not 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.730
 injure their root system therefore 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.180
 I like the most in capacity 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.610
 which the bottom is pulled out and peat 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.160
 pills it is important to replant while 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.770
 only you see that through the wall tour of 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.170
 pill begin to penetrate the roots you 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.130
 period repot already in greater 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.130
 cup 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.890
 planting most seedlings in April 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.849
 flower crops such as the sharp scene 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.959
 brahikome 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:38.200
 gazanii and other cabbages plant early 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.910
 for planting i recommend 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.099
 to use such cassettes 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.629
 fill them with our beloved lively 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:50.410
 shine zemko do in each cell 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:53.049
 hole then we lightly seal 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.690
 soil over them and pour a little 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:03:00.090
 the amount of water for such a seedling 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.090
 Magazine will be enough tablespoon
