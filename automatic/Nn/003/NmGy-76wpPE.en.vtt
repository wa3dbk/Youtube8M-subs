millimeters or 3.5 millimeter socket and

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.170 
millimeters or 3.5 millimeter socket and
you've<00:00:41.559> got<00:00:41.800> an<00:00:41.890> extension<00:00:42.520> lead<00:00:42.699> in<00:00:42.879> the<00:00:42.969> pack

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
you've got an extension lead in the pack

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:51.119 
you've got an extension lead in the pack
usually<00:00:43.719> 3<00:00:43.960> meters<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:46.199> you<00:00:47.850> plug<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:50.129> socket

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
usually 3 meters and you plug the socket

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.180 
usually 3 meters and you plug the socket
into<00:00:51.609> the<00:00:51.699> camera<00:00:52.120> after<00:00:53.109> installing<00:00:53.920> the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
into the camera after installing the

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.130 
into the camera after installing the
battery<00:00:54.609> it's<00:00:54.820> important<00:00:55.390> you<00:00:55.660> have<00:00:55.809> to<00:00:55.960> wait

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
battery it's important you have to wait

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:04.770 
battery it's important you have to wait
30<00:00:56.949> to<00:00:57.250> 60<00:00:57.640> seconds<00:00:58.149> for<00:00:58.329> the<00:01:00.120> PIR<00:01:01.120> to<00:01:03.600> warm<00:01:04.600> up

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
30 to 60 seconds for the PIR to warm up

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.170 
30 to 60 seconds for the PIR to warm up
it<00:01:05.199> basically<00:01:05.740> allows<00:01:05.950> 30<00:01:06.490> seconds<00:01:06.970> for

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
it basically allows 30 seconds for

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.120 
it basically allows 30 seconds for
people<00:01:07.210> to<00:01:07.450> walk<00:01:07.690> out<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.110> zone<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:09.009> it's

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
people to walk out the zone and it's

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.490 
people to walk out the zone and it's
designed<00:01:09.490> into<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:09.880> component<00:01:12.990> after<00:01:13.990> 30

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
designed into the component after 30

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.969 
designed into the component after 30
seconds<00:01:15.009> warm<00:01:15.700> up<00:01:15.909> you<00:01:16.659> can<00:01:16.960> turn<00:01:17.710> on<00:01:17.950> your

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
seconds warm up you can turn on your

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.330 
seconds warm up you can turn on your
camera<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.759> then<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.869> PIR<00:01:20.380> will<00:01:21.159> be

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
camera and then the PIR will be

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.550 
camera and then the PIR will be
activated<00:01:21.820> by<00:01:22.720> movement<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:26.170> can<00:01:26.409> be

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
activated by movement that can be

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.490 
activated by movement that can be
anything<00:01:26.829> as<00:01:27.070> small<00:01:27.250> as<00:01:27.610> spero<00:01:27.970> a<00:01:28.299> fox<00:01:28.990> a<00:01:29.290> cat

the<00:01:35.500> PIR<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:38.110> red<00:01:38.290> light<00:01:38.500> can<00:01:38.829> be<00:01:39.899> disabled

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
the PIR the red light can be disabled

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.440 
the PIR the red light can be disabled
you<00:01:41.710> basically<00:01:42.130> open<00:01:42.340> up<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.880> camera<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
you basically open up the camera and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.230 
you basically open up the camera and
there<00:01:46.450> are<00:01:46.570> two<00:01:46.920> tiny<00:01:47.920> dip<00:01:48.189> switches<00:01:48.490> here<00:01:48.880> one

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
there are two tiny dip switches here one

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.810 
there are two tiny dip switches here one
turns<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.689> PIR<00:01:50.170> off<00:01:50.380> one<00:01:51.310> turns<00:01:51.610> it<00:01:51.790> from

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
turns the PIR off one turns it from

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.179 
turns the PIR off one turns it from
sensitive<00:01:52.600> back<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.409> normal<00:01:53.770> sensitivity

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
sensitive back to normal sensitivity

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:55.859 
sensitive back to normal sensitivity
which<00:01:54.610> normal<00:01:55.000> people<00:01:55.240> want<00:01:55.420> where<00:01:55.810> they

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
which normal people want where they

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.209 
which normal people want where they
don't<00:01:55.960> want<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.200> cats<00:01:56.409> and<00:01:56.590> dogs<00:01:56.770> that<00:01:56.950> set<00:01:57.100> off

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
don't want to cats and dogs that set off

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:04.850 
don't want to cats and dogs that set off
the<00:01:57.369> PIR<00:02:01.079> be<00:02:02.079> very<00:02:02.409> careful<00:02:02.860> when<00:02:03.009> you<00:02:03.189> re<00:02:04.180> just

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
the PIR be very careful when you re just

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.430 
the PIR be very careful when you re just
dr.<00:02:05.860> disturb<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.700> wires<00:02:06.909> when<00:02:07.869> you<00:02:08.020> put<00:02:08.229> the

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
dr. disturb the wires when you put the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.200 
dr. disturb the wires when you put the
camera<00:02:09.130> casing<00:02:09.580> back<00:02:10.270> together<00:02:11.040> there

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
camera casing back together there

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.010 
camera casing back together there
release<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.920> casing

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
release the casing

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.490 
release the casing
you<00:02:15.170> pop<00:02:16.070> that<00:02:16.100> open<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:17.690> if<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:17.960> want<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.320> use

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
you pop that open and if you want to use

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.850 
you pop that open and if you want to use
it<00:02:18.680> for<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.890> longer<00:02:19.070> period<00:02:19.400> of<00:02:19.640> time<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:21.470> would

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
it for a longer period of time I would

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.790 
it for a longer period of time I would
say<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:22.310> would<00:02:22.520> work<00:02:22.670> for<00:02:23.060> about<00:02:23.380> five<00:02:24.380> hours

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
say this would work for about five hours

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.760 
say this would work for about five hours
on<00:02:24.980> one<00:02:25.790> battery<00:02:26.060> charge<00:02:26.410> but<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:27.590> basically

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
on one battery charge but you basically

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.110 
on one battery charge but you basically
insert<00:02:28.490> red<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.480> black<00:02:30.190> 12<00:02:31.190> volts<00:02:31.490> plus<00:02:31.850> and

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
insert red and black 12 volts plus and

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.240 
insert red and black 12 volts plus and
minus<00:02:32.420> into<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.200> first<00:02:33.440> two<00:02:33.680> sockets<00:02:33.950> which

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
minus into the first two sockets which

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.480 
minus into the first two sockets which
are<00:02:36.070> labeled<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:39.140> unit<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.650> not<00:02:39.890> weatherproof

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
are labeled the unit is not weatherproof

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.850 
are labeled the unit is not weatherproof
however<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.510> will<00:02:41.840> post<00:02:42.230> them<00:02:42.530> in<00:02:42.650> these

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
however I will post them in these

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.800 
however I will post them in these
microwave<00:02:43.610> retainers<00:02:44.240> which<00:02:45.430> do<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.730> PIR<00:02:47.480> we'll

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
microwave retainers which do a PIR we'll

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.460 
microwave retainers which do a PIR we'll
work<00:02:48.020> through<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:49.690> however<00:02:50.690> whether<00:02:51.170> that

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
work through that however whether that

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.080 
work through that however whether that
will<00:02:51.620> survive<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.160> British<00:02:52.370> personal<00:02:52.760> system

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
will survive the British personal system

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:02.690 
will survive the British personal system
I<00:02:53.210> haven't<00:02:53.540> actually
