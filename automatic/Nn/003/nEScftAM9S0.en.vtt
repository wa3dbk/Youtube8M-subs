00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.540
 that dominique strauss-kahn did not violate this woman yet after 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.720
 many researches I can tell you that he did and that it was 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.500

 dominique strauss-kahn calls 25 turns 8 these rockets a base 100 49 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:26.109

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.310
 is not it 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.090
 we know through all these steps we could already predict everything and 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.650
 we did not want to accompany my friends and my friends 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.999

 the 4 and the echoes adding for the millennium of the birth of dominique 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.390
 Strauss-Kahn 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.990
 what awaits her and we get 22 strange my friends when we know 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.699
 than 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.650
 the group of correspondents 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.520
 to the letter v 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.370

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.210
 birth of dominique strauss-kahn who is a new man the nine equals 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.120
 at hatten 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.340
 edwin zenny medical ethics 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.640
 we will continue because that's not all because I said no to turn screw 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.460
 social 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.250
 we dare 62 - 49 62-49 this regard the press 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.719
 the apts represent the highest figure equals the letter 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.370
 go to school excuse me I'm racing 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.370
 and moreover we had to bet all the same the little touch barred 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.660
 only his year and rent a resonance with the lawyers of us 62 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.399
 let's do the dow jones +1 5 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.450
 who come from here within a week 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.980
 we want it 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.080
 honzik let's add the coffee of his memories 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.910
 and I tell myself that the moment the dock and we add the 6 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.980
 we sail he argues that life is worth 15 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.440
 the figure of 15 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.310
 which equals in guinea 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.469
 his letter m 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.190
 to the letter 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.810
 go chips 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.750
 violent 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.260
 eh yes could not predict his life with his high did not see anything coming that's 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.320
 outrageous but that's not all they must also predict the date of the 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.550
 rape 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.230
 dominique strauss-kahn 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.230
 that's what we commonly call english descartes 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:13.139
 there are too many douai equivalent descartes 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:14.579
 each phase 4 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.609
 the elite 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.539
 and consistency 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:22.439
 but curiously we also see their convenience we could already we do not 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.699
 could already predict the year around 2000 at losc they said that 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.869
 we could predict that the serial rapist lille in 2011 but it's not 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:32.849
 all we have the leafs letter and the short e-letter we do the 18-24 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.019
 that's why on the life of my friends what did we do we get to 14 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.419
 14 strange when we know that the real date and the 14th of 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.039
 we are going to use 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:47.629
 our choice 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.840
 we can reuse them once my friends 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.840
 we can 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.179
 nothing 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:01.499
 18 spam plus nothing divide by 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:05.429
 Rate 4 is equal to 5 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.119
 May 14 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:15.439
 tomorrow 11 we could know 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.049
 in all this circuit he would have a need for discipline of the lfp 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.649
 which would take place on the 14th 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:25.089
 10 5 2011 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:27.189
 everything that was planned but his friends 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:28.040
 all were planned
