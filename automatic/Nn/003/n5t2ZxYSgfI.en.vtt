hello<00:00:06.230> in<00:00:06.470> this<00:00:06.770> video<00:00:06.980> I'm<00:00:07.370> going<00:00:07.549> to<00:00:07.640> do<00:00:07.759> a

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
hello in this video I'm going to do a

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.299 
hello in this video I'm going to do a
comparison<00:00:08.420> between<00:00:08.780> the<00:00:09.230> rode<00:00:09.590> videomic<00:00:10.040> pro

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
comparison between the rode videomic pro

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.740 
comparison between the rode videomic pro
and<00:00:11.059> the<00:00:11.450> new<00:00:11.660> aperture<00:00:12.469> v-mic<00:00:13.190> d2<00:00:14.120> when

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
and the new aperture v-mic d2 when

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.209 
and the new aperture v-mic d2 when
they're<00:00:14.900> being<00:00:15.049> used<00:00:15.139> as<00:00:15.589> camera<00:00:16.040> top

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
they're being used as camera top

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.249 
they're being used as camera top
microphones<00:00:16.759> for<00:00:17.000> pieces<00:00:17.330> like<00:00:17.660> this<00:00:17.810> pieces

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:18.259 
microphones for pieces like this pieces

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.170 
microphones for pieces like this pieces
to<00:00:18.410> camera<00:00:18.650> now<00:00:19.040> at<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.250> moment<00:00:19.430> I'm<00:00:19.759> not

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
to camera now at the moment I'm not

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.670 
to camera now at the moment I'm not
speaking<00:00:20.450> on<00:00:20.689> either<00:00:20.810> of<00:00:21.050> those<00:00:21.169> mics<00:00:21.439> acaba

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
speaking on either of those mics acaba

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.310 
speaking on either of those mics acaba
Sennheiser<00:00:22.489> mic<00:00:22.759> just<00:00:23.119> up<00:00:23.300> here<00:00:23.329> but<00:00:24.110> what<00:00:24.230> I'm

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
Sennheiser mic just up here but what I'm

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.710 
Sennheiser mic just up here but what I'm
gonna<00:00:24.470> do<00:00:24.739> is<00:00:24.950> put<00:00:25.250> the<00:00:25.369> mics<00:00:25.579> on<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:26.329> camera

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
gonna do is put the mics on the camera

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.620 
gonna do is put the mics on the camera
which<00:00:26.899> is<00:00:27.050> there<00:00:27.619> obviously<00:00:28.309> it's<00:00:28.880> one<00:00:29.270> point

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
which is there obviously it's one point

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.450 
which is there obviously it's one point
three<00:00:29.840> meters<00:00:30.380> away<00:00:30.410> from<00:00:30.680> me<00:00:31.099> which<00:00:31.309> is

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
three meters away from me which is

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.790 
three meters away from me which is
further<00:00:32.000> than<00:00:32.329> ideally<00:00:33.050> one<00:00:33.380> would<00:00:33.410> like<00:00:33.739> a

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
further than ideally one would like a

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.889 
further than ideally one would like a
microphone<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.610> be<00:00:34.790> but<00:00:35.239> that's<00:00:35.510> how<00:00:35.719> this

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
microphone to be but that's how this

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.200 
microphone to be but that's how this
room<00:00:36.140> is<00:00:36.290> set<00:00:36.469> up<00:00:36.620> that's<00:00:36.860> how<00:00:37.160> the<00:00:37.700> camera<00:00:38.089> is

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
room is set up that's how the camera is

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.549 
room is set up that's how the camera is
set<00:00:38.359> up<00:00:38.539> and<00:00:38.750> therefore<00:00:39.199> it's<00:00:39.379> a

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
set up and therefore it's a

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.130 
set up and therefore it's a
representative<00:00:40.219> example<00:00:40.969> of<00:00:41.089> how<00:00:41.870> it<00:00:42.019> would

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
representative example of how it would

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.319 
representative example of how it would
be<00:00:42.350> if<00:00:42.589> you<00:00:42.859> use<00:00:43.100> those<00:00:43.309> mics<00:00:43.609> on<00:00:43.820> top<00:00:43.999> of<00:00:44.120> your

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
be if you use those mics on top of your

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.509 
be if you use those mics on top of your
camera<00:00:44.570> at<00:00:44.870> that<00:00:45.170> sort<00:00:45.469> of<00:00:45.589> distance<00:00:46.039> so<00:00:46.280> once

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
camera at that sort of distance so once

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.660 
camera at that sort of distance so once
we've<00:00:46.670> heard<00:00:46.940> from<00:00:47.480> both<00:00:47.600> mics<00:00:48.499> over<00:00:48.739> there<00:00:49.489> I

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
we've heard from both mics over there I

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.060 
we've heard from both mics over there I
will<00:00:49.999> then<00:00:50.269> do<00:00:50.480> another<00:00:50.780> test<00:00:51.170> with<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:51.859> mics

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
will then do another test with the mics

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.430 
will then do another test with the mics
at<00:00:52.249> sort<00:00:52.460> of<00:00:52.489> handheld<00:00:53.120> distance<00:00:53.899> as<00:00:54.050> if<00:00:54.289> you

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
at sort of handheld distance as if you

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.290 
at sort of handheld distance as if you
were<00:00:54.559> doing<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:55.039> sort<00:00:55.249> of<00:00:55.309> vlog<00:00:55.670> type<00:00:55.999> thing

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
were doing a sort of vlog type thing

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.270 
were doing a sort of vlog type thing
with<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:56.600> camera<00:00:56.809> just<00:00:57.469> about<00:00:57.710> what's<00:00:58.069> that

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
with the camera just about what's that

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.479 
with the camera just about what's that
70<00:00:59.149> 80<00:00:59.300> centimetres<00:00:59.989> away<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:00.829> first<00:01:01.249> of<00:01:01.399> all

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
70 80 centimetres away so first of all

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.750 
70 80 centimetres away so first of all
then<00:01:01.730> let's<00:01:02.120> hear<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:02.539> rode<00:01:02.780> videomic<00:01:03.440> pro<00:01:03.760> at

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
then let's hear the rode videomic pro at

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.280 
then let's hear the rode videomic pro at
1.3<00:01:05.690> meters

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
1.3 meters

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.649 
1.3 meters
this<00:01:07.220> then<00:01:07.400> is<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.670> sound<00:01:07.940> of<00:01:08.120> the<00:01:08.180> rode

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
this then is the sound of the rode

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.470 
this then is the sound of the rode
videomic<00:01:09.170> pro<00:01:09.530> now<00:01:10.190> I<00:01:10.220> haven't<00:01:10.580> put<00:01:10.760> in<00:01:10.910> its

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
videomic pro now I haven't put in its

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.070 
videomic pro now I haven't put in its
base<00:01:12.050> cut<00:01:12.440> filter<00:01:12.980> I've<00:01:13.130> got<00:01:13.340> it<00:01:13.430> on<00:01:13.610> 0<00:01:14.000> DB<00:01:14.810> gain

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
base cut filter I've got it on 0 DB gain

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.570 
base cut filter I've got it on 0 DB gain
output<00:01:15.620> because<00:01:15.800> you<00:01:15.890> can<00:01:16.070> switch<00:01:16.340> it<00:01:16.490> to

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
output because you can switch it to

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.210 
output because you can switch it to
minus<00:01:16.910> 10<00:01:17.090> or<00:01:17.120> plus<00:01:17.390> 20<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.440> any<00:01:18.740> amplification

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
minus 10 or plus 20 so any amplification

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.700 
minus 10 or plus 20 so any amplification
is<00:01:19.700> being<00:01:19.940> done<00:01:20.210> by<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.510> camcorder<00:01:21.260> which<00:01:21.560> in

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
is being done by the camcorder which in

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.910 
is being done by the camcorder which in
this<00:01:21.800> case<00:01:22.070> is<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.370> Canon<00:01:22.820> X<00:01:23.270> a<00:01:23.540> 20<00:01:24.230> the<00:01:24.680> room

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
this case is a Canon X a 20 the room

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.830 
this case is a Canon X a 20 the room
acoustics<00:01:25.190> in<00:01:25.670> here<00:01:25.700> are<00:01:25.910> pretty<00:01:26.240> awful<00:01:26.750> it

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
acoustics in here are pretty awful it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.570 
acoustics in here are pretty awful it
sounds<00:01:26.870> like<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.350> bathroom<00:01:27.860> it's<00:01:28.040> lots<00:01:28.220> of<00:01:28.340> flat

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
sounds like a bathroom it's lots of flat

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.640 
sounds like a bathroom it's lots of flat
walls<00:01:28.820> flat<00:01:29.210> ceiling<00:01:29.660> it<00:01:30.020> does<00:01:30.290> give<00:01:30.530> the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
walls flat ceiling it does give the

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.100 
walls flat ceiling it does give the
sailor<00:01:30.920> suit<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.430> hollowness<00:01:32.300> and<00:01:32.330> echinus

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
sailor suit and hollowness and echinus

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.830 
sailor suit and hollowness and echinus
to<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.560> but<00:01:34.130> really<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.790> prime<00:01:35.060> consideration

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
to it but really the prime consideration

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.810 
to it but really the prime consideration
is<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.620> mic<00:01:36.770> able<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.220> pick<00:01:37.610> me<00:01:37.790> up

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
is is the mic able to pick me up

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.090 
is is the mic able to pick me up
reasonably<00:01:38.720> clearly<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:39.500> as<00:01:39.590> I<00:01:39.740> say<00:01:39.920> the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
reasonably clearly and as I say the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.390 
reasonably clearly and as I say the
distance<00:01:40.460> is<00:01:40.840> 1.3<00:01:41.840> meters<00:01:42.260> from<00:01:42.680> me<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
distance is 1.3 meters from me to the

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.280 
distance is 1.3 meters from me to the
microphone<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:44.360> that's<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.690> rode<00:01:44.870> videomic

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
microphone so that's the rode videomic

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.340 
microphone so that's the rode videomic
pro<00:01:45.470> on<00:01:46.070> there<00:01:46.550> swap<00:01:46.880> in<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.210> aperture<00:01:47.390> v-mic

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
pro on there swap in the aperture v-mic

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.330 
pro on there swap in the aperture v-mic
d2<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.220> let's<00:01:49.640> hear<00:01:49.820> how<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.090> sounds<00:01:51.160> so<00:01:52.160> now

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
d2 and let's hear how that sounds so now

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.370 
d2 and let's hear how that sounds so now
you're<00:01:52.670> listening<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:53.120> me<00:01:53.270> on<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.570> aperture<00:01:53.930> v

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
you're listening to me on the aperture v

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.970 
you're listening to me on the aperture v
mike<00:01:54.620> d2<00:01:55.340> same<00:01:55.760> distance<00:01:56.240> away<00:01:56.500> 1.3<00:01:57.500> meters

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
mike d2 same distance away 1.3 meters

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.820 
mike d2 same distance away 1.3 meters
and<00:01:58.280> again<00:01:59.240> I've<00:01:59.600> not<00:01:59.900> put<00:02:00.110> in<00:02:00.230> its<00:02:00.380> low-cut

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
and again I've not put in its low-cut

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.560 
and again I've not put in its low-cut
filter<00:02:00.890> it's<00:02:01.520> not<00:02:01.760> wearing<00:02:02.180> its<00:02:02.300> fluffy

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
filter it's not wearing its fluffy

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.310 
filter it's not wearing its fluffy
Windjammer<00:02:03.440> and<00:02:04.540> this<00:02:05.540> is<00:02:05.690> what<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:05.960> sounds

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
Windjammer and this is what it sounds

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.229 
Windjammer and this is what it sounds
like<00:02:06.380> same<00:02:06.800> acoustics<00:02:07.430> so<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.850> question<00:02:08.149> is

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
like same acoustics so the question is

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.969 
like same acoustics so the question is
can<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:08.509> tell<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.869> difference<00:02:08.899> between<00:02:09.229> the

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
can you tell the difference between the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.280 
can you tell the difference between the
road<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.489> this<00:02:11.000> microphone<00:02:11.269> are<00:02:11.720> just<00:02:11.870> people

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
road and this microphone are just people

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.899 
road and this microphone are just people
on<00:02:12.349> talking<00:02:12.769> for<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:12.980> couple<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.310> seconds<00:02:13.670> so

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
on talking for a couple of seconds so

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:15.580 
on talking for a couple of seconds so
you<00:02:13.969> have<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.180> bit<00:02:14.390> more<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.200> sound<00:02:15.409> of<00:02:15.499> my

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
you have a bit more of the sound of my

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.770 
you have a bit more of the sound of my
voice<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.859> check<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.459> against<00:02:16.879> and<00:02:17.030> then<00:02:17.599> what

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
voice to check it against and then what

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.760 
voice to check it against and then what
I'll<00:02:17.930> do<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.200> put<00:02:18.560> both<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.249> mics<00:02:19.459> on

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
I'll do is put both the mics on

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.410 
I'll do is put both the mics on
or<00:02:19.890> camcorder<00:02:20.400> as<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.580> say<00:02:20.820> at<00:02:20.970> arm's<00:02:21.360> length

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
or camcorder as I say at arm's length

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.570 
or camcorder as I say at arm's length
and<00:02:21.870> we'll<00:02:22.320> hear<00:02:22.500> how<00:02:22.680> they<00:02:22.830> sound<00:02:22.860> in<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.430> more

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
and we'll hear how they sound in a more

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.970 
and we'll hear how they sound in a more
close-up<00:02:24.360> scenario<00:02:25.050> right<00:02:25.380> that'll<00:02:25.710> do<00:02:25.830> for

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
close-up scenario right that'll do for

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.150 
close-up scenario right that'll do for
now

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
now

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.810 
now
that<00:02:26.430> was<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.670> aperture<00:02:27.000> v-mic<00:02:27.630> d2<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.640> now

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
that was the aperture v-mic d2 so now

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.810 
that was the aperture v-mic d2 so now
I'm<00:02:29.970> filming<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.480> on<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.750> Canon<00:02:30.840> XF<00:02:31.800> 200<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:32.670> is

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
I'm filming this on a Canon XF 200 it is

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.940 
I'm filming this on a Canon XF 200 it is
at<00:02:33.090> arm's<00:02:33.570> length<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:34.230> sort<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.500> length<00:02:34.740> you'd

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
at arm's length a sort of length you'd

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.130 
at arm's length a sort of length you'd
hole<00:02:35.160> if<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.490> were<00:02:35.580> doing<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.970> handheld<00:02:36.630> vlog

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
hole if you were doing a handheld vlog

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.750 
hole if you were doing a handheld vlog
or<00:02:37.380> something<00:02:37.770> like<00:02:37.860> this<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.310> you're

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
or something like this and you're

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.850 
or something like this and you're
listening<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.180> me<00:02:39.300> now<00:02:39.480> on<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.870> rode<00:02:40.230> videomic

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
listening to me now on the rode videomic

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.130 
listening to me now on the rode videomic
pro<00:02:41.300> microphone<00:02:42.300> again<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.810> settings

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
pro microphone again the settings

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.810 
pro microphone again the settings
haven't<00:02:43.410> changed<00:02:43.710> on<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.950> microphone<00:02:44.400> itself

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
haven't changed on the microphone itself

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.330 
haven't changed on the microphone itself
it's<00:02:45.360> on<00:02:45.540> top<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:45.990> camera<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:46.530> strictly

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
it's on top of the camera so strictly

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.730 
it's on top of the camera so strictly
it's<00:02:47.580> slightly<00:02:48.060> pointing<00:02:48.630> over<00:02:48.870> my<00:02:48.990> head<00:02:49.260> but

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
it's slightly pointing over my head but

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.710 
it's slightly pointing over my head but
that<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.070> how<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.280> would<00:02:50.610> be<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:50.880> suppose<00:02:51.390> if<00:02:51.600> you

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
that is how it would be I suppose if you

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.200 
that is how it would be I suppose if you
were<00:02:51.750> doing<00:02:51.990> this<00:02:52.560> kind<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:52.980> thing<00:02:53.190> but<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.180> is

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
were doing this kind of thing but it is

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.410 
were doing this kind of thing but it is
much<00:02:54.540> closer<00:02:54.930> now<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.860> my<00:02:56.130> mouth<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.640> this<00:02:57.180> is

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
much closer now to my mouth and this is

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.280 
much closer now to my mouth and this is
what<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.750> sounds<00:02:58.080> like

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
what it sounds like

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.650 
what it sounds like
so<00:02:58.590> I'll<00:02:58.710> swap<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.280> for<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.850> aperture<00:03:00.270> V<00:03:00.480> mic

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
so I'll swap that for the aperture V mic

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.110 
so I'll swap that for the aperture V mic
d2<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.470> we'll<00:03:01.860> hear<00:03:02.130> how<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.550> sounds<00:03:02.610> in

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
d2 and we'll hear how that sounds in

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.870 
d2 and we'll hear how that sounds in
comparison<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.990> this<00:03:04.890> then<00:03:05.130> is<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.460> aperture

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
comparison and this then is the aperture

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.630 
comparison and this then is the aperture
V<00:03:06.360> mic<00:03:06.600> d2<00:03:07.200> again<00:03:07.590> being<00:03:07.860> recorded<00:03:08.220> into<00:03:08.610> a

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
Canon XF 200 the distance has remained

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.450 
Canon XF 200 the distance has remained
unchanged<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.840> camera<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.320> only<00:03:13.500> an<00:03:13.800> arm's

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
unchanged the camera is only an arm's

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.580 
unchanged the camera is only an arm's
length<00:03:14.520> away<00:03:14.880> from<00:03:15.420> me<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.990> microphone<00:03:16.380> just

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
length away from me the microphone just

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.530 
length away from me the microphone just
on<00:03:16.770> tops<00:03:17.160> are<00:03:17.370> pointing<00:03:17.730> wrists<00:03:17.910> slightly

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
on tops are pointing wrists slightly

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.780 
on tops are pointing wrists slightly
over<00:03:18.810> my<00:03:18.930> head<00:03:19.200> but<00:03:19.710> it<00:03:19.860> is<00:03:19.980> much<00:03:20.280> closer<00:03:20.640> than

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
over my head but it is much closer than

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.630 
over my head but it is much closer than
it<00:03:20.970> was<00:03:21.120> in<00:03:21.360> that<00:03:21.510> first<00:03:21.870> test<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.620> what<00:03:23.520> does

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
it was in that first test and what does

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.000 
it was in that first test and what does
it<00:03:23.670> sound<00:03:24.030> like<00:03:24.090> well<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.540> verdict<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.709> one

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
it sound like well that verdict is one

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.860 
it sound like well that verdict is one
that<00:03:26.160> only<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.550> can<00:03:26.790> reach<00:03:27.000> how<00:03:27.540> does<00:03:27.750> it

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
that only you can reach how does it

00:03:27.870 --> 00:04:40.670 
that only you can reach how does it
compare<00:03:28.050> to<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.380> rode<00:03:28.650> videomic<00:03:29.100> pro

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.280 

so<00:04:41.680> that's<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.160> aperture<00:04:42.669> v-mic<00:04:43.240> d2<00:04:43.780> against

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
so that's the aperture v-mic d2 against

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.040 
so that's the aperture v-mic d2 against
the<00:04:44.410> rode<00:04:44.680> videomic<00:04:45.220> pro<00:04:45.430> and<00:04:46.180> also<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.720> go<00:04:46.870> of

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
the rode videomic pro and also the go of

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.930 
the rode videomic pro and also the go of
course<00:04:47.260> during<00:04:47.680> that<00:04:47.830> music<00:04:48.280> sample

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
course during that music sample

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.170 
course during that music sample
I'd<00:04:49.270> say<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.690> videomic<00:04:50.229> pro<00:04:50.580> sounds<00:04:51.580> sort<00:04:52.120> of

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
I'd say the videomic pro sounds sort of

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.020 
I'd say the videomic pro sounds sort of
deeper<00:04:52.810> richer<00:04:53.350> base<00:04:53.919> here<00:04:54.250> I<00:04:54.639> don't<00:04:54.699> know<00:04:54.970> if

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
deeper richer base here I don't know if

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.460 
deeper richer base here I don't know if
that's<00:04:55.180> because<00:04:55.479> they've<00:04:55.630> implemented<00:04:56.080> some

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
that's because they've implemented some

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.939 
that's because they've implemented some
sort<00:04:56.650> of<00:04:56.680> EQ<00:04:57.220> in<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.520> mic<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:58.500> aperture<00:04:59.500> v-mic

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
sort of EQ in the mic the aperture v-mic

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.640 
sort of EQ in the mic the aperture v-mic
d2<00:05:00.460> sounds<00:05:00.940> brighter<00:05:01.360> possibly<00:05:02.350> slightly

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
d2 sounds brighter possibly slightly

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.340 
d2 sounds brighter possibly slightly
tinea<00:05:03.490> and<00:05:03.729> if<00:05:03.940> you<00:05:04.030> listen<00:05:04.300> carefully<00:05:04.750> during

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
tinea and if you listen carefully during

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.379 
tinea and if you listen carefully during
the<00:05:05.470> really<00:05:05.620> quiet<00:05:05.979> sections<00:05:06.610> then<00:05:07.090> you<00:05:07.210> can

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
the really quiet sections then you can

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.060 
the really quiet sections then you can
hear<00:05:07.570> that<00:05:07.720> it's<00:05:07.840> a<00:05:08.020> little<00:05:08.380> bit<00:05:08.500> here<00:05:08.800> a

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
hear that it's a little bit here a

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.310 
hear that it's a little bit here a
little<00:05:09.250> bit<00:05:09.430> noisier<00:05:09.970> as<00:05:10.090> well<00:05:10.360> but<00:05:10.840> by<00:05:11.169> and

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
little bit noisier as well but by and

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.810 
little bit noisier as well but by and
large<00:05:11.350> when<00:05:11.770> you're<00:05:11.889> actually<00:05:12.190> speaking<00:05:12.460> you
