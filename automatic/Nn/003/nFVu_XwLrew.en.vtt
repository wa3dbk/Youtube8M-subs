inside here but I'm going right in

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.420 
inside here but I'm going right in
between<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.590> bones<00:02:56.800> so<00:02:57.070> when<00:02:57.190> you<00:02:57.250> poke

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
through the bark it should feel like

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.510 
through the bark it should feel like
melted<00:02:59.260> butter<00:02:59.470> on<00:02:59.710> the<00:03:00.040> probe<00:03:00.250> you're<00:03:00.400> not
