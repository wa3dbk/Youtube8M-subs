00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.820 

okay<00:01:51.460> cool<00:01:51.840> lag<00:01:52.840> in<00:01:52.990> about<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.230> little<00:01:53.410> bit<00:01:53.590> but

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
okay cool lag in about a little bit but

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:03.780 
okay cool lag in about a little bit but
that's<00:01:54.100> it's<00:01:55.060> fine<00:02:02.220> if<00:02:03.220> more<00:02:03.400> people<00:02:03.640> don't

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
that's it's fine if more people don't

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:16.590 
that's it's fine if more people don't
know<00:02:03.880> ah<00:02:08.310> ok<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.850> we're<00:02:16.000> losing<00:02:16.270> by<00:02:16.300> quite<00:02:16.570> a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
know ah ok so we're losing by quite a

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.730 
know ah ok so we're losing by quite a
bit<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:19.150> think<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:19.960> a<00:02:19.990> timed<00:02:20.350> match

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
bit I I think this is a timed match

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:29.270 
bit I I think this is a timed match
instead<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.460> a<00:02:23.580> like<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.610> score<00:02:25.240> with<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.420> cap<00:02:25.720> so
