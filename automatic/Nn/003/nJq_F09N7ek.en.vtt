considered in fact as this one the
better-looking<00:01:53.729> power<00:01:54.360> bank<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.689> we've

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
better-looking power bank so we've

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.719 
better-looking power bank so we've
actually<00:01:54.899> seen<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.560> recent<00:01:55.920> memory<00:01:56.070> there's

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
actually seen in recent memory there's

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.520 
actually seen in recent memory there's
some<00:01:56.969> grips<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.659> back<00:01:57.810> which<00:01:58.049> which

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
tells you how much battery is left so

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:06.920 
tells you how much battery is left so
you<00:02:06.000> should<00:02:06.119> time<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.450> lose<00:02:06.600> one<00:02:06.810> you're

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
you should time that you lose one you're

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.510 
you should time that you lose one you're
going<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.110> lose<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.439> percentage<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.190> juice

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
going to lose a percentage of the juice

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.339 
going to lose a percentage of the juice
again<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> size<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:09.690> actually<00:02:09.929> pretty<00:02:10.050> slim

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349

and the wireless charging will
automatically<00:02:43.590> start<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.610> it's<00:02:44.820> pretty<00:02:44.940> easy

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
automatically start so it's pretty easy

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.640 
automatically start so it's pretty easy
to<00:02:45.300> use<00:02:45.330> as<00:02:45.630> far<00:02:45.870> as<00:02:45.959> functionality<00:02:46.140> is

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
to use as far as functionality is

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.530 
to use as far as functionality is
concerned<00:02:46.770> now<00:02:47.670> something<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.090> will<00:02:48.209> say<00:02:48.360> about

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
concerned now something I will say about

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.970 
concerned now something I will say about
the<00:02:48.660> wireless<00:02:48.870> charging<00:02:49.260> though<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.770> takes

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
the wireless charging though is it takes

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.830 
the wireless charging though is it takes
longer<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.550> wirelessly<00:02:50.970> charge<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.480> using<00:02:51.750> a

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
longer to wirelessly charge and using a

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.540 
longer to wirelessly charge and using a
wired<00:02:52.110> connection<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.100> if<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.250> do<00:02:53.370> want<00:02:53.520> to

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
wired connection so if you do want to

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.979 
wired connection so if you do want to
use<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.700> Qi<00:02:54.090> charging<00:02:54.480> it's<00:02:54.630> going<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.810> take

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
use a Qi charging it's going to take

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.690 
use a Qi charging it's going to take
about<00:02:55.110> four<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.770> five<00:02:55.950> hours<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.370> fully

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
key once and the charging process should

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.340 
key once and the charging process should
start<00:03:14.489> after<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.970> few<00:03:15.120> seconds<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:16.260> will

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
start after a few seconds and it will

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.740 
start after a few seconds and it will
continuously<00:03:16.739> charge<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.340> tap<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.640> juice<00:03:18.480> on

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
continuously charge and tap the juice on

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.509 
continuously charge and tap the juice on
the<00:03:18.959> actual<00:03:19.320> phone<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.620> full<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.070> then<00:03:20.400> the

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
the actual phone is full and then the

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.160 
the actual phone is full and then the
charging<00:03:20.850> will<00:03:20.970> automatically<00:03:21.360> stop<00:03:21.630> again

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
charging will automatically stop again

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.570 
charging will automatically stop again
you<00:03:22.260> can<00:03:22.380> simultaneously<00:03:22.530> charge<00:03:23.160> two

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
you can simultaneously charge two

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.910 
you can simultaneously charge two
devices<00:03:23.690> for<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.780> USB<00:03:25.200> ports<00:03:25.560> at<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.739> same

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
devices for the USB ports at the same

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.289 
devices for the USB ports at the same
time<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.280> can<00:03:26.400> actually<00:03:26.549> charge<00:03:26.820> up<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.030> three

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
time you can actually charge up to three

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.330 
time you can actually charge up to three
products<00:03:27.660> however<00:03:27.840> at<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.200> same<00:03:28.380> time<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:29.130> we

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
products however at the same time so we

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.220 
products however at the same time so we
can<00:03:29.459> charge<00:03:29.610> one<00:03:29.940> product<00:03:30.269> on<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.480> Qi<00:03:30.780> one<00:03:31.080> and

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
can charge one product on the Qi one and

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.020 
can charge one product on the Qi one and
then<00:03:31.380> two<00:03:31.560> products<00:03:31.950> using<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.250> USB<00:03:32.700> outputs

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
then two products using the USB outputs

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.000 
then two products using the USB outputs
so<00:03:33.480> it's<00:03:33.600> actually<00:03:33.750> very<00:03:34.019> very<00:03:34.320> efficient<00:03:34.830> in

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
so it's actually very very efficient in

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.710 
so it's actually very very efficient in
that<00:03:35.070> sense<00:03:35.519> at<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.120> end<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.420> day<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.510> have

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
that sense at the end of the day I have

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.630 
that sense at the end of the day I have
to<00:03:36.750> say<00:03:36.989> that<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.320> Qi<00:03:37.620> mobile<00:03:38.040> charger<00:03:38.400> power

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
to say that the Qi mobile charger power

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.220 
to say that the Qi mobile charger power
bank<00:03:38.910> by<00:03:39.299> mobile<00:03:39.630> POW<00:03:39.750> it's<00:03:39.959> actually<00:03:40.200> a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
bank by mobile POW it's actually a
