biggest<00:02:12.100> call<00:02:12.400> from<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.610> world<00:02:12.790> but<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.570> me

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
biggest call from the world but to me

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.930 
biggest call from the world but to me
again<00:02:14.590> not<00:02:14.920> being<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.190> biggest<00:02:15.430> golfer<00:02:15.790> and

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
again not being the biggest golfer and

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.699 
again not being the biggest golfer and
just<00:02:16.390> my<00:02:16.480> own<00:02:16.540> personal<00:02:16.660> pain<00:02:17.080> this<00:02:17.470> looks

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
just my own personal pain this looks

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.410 
just my own personal pain this looks
like<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:17.890> really<00:02:18.160> cool<00:02:18.430> product<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.180> think

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
like a really cool product and I think

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.449 
like a really cool product and I think
for<00:02:19.540> twenty<00:02:19.930> dollars<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.470> is<00:02:21.010> like<00:02:21.220> a

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
for twenty dollars it is like a

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.030 
for twenty dollars it is like a
no-brainer<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:22.570> maybe<00:02:22.989> try<00:02:23.290> out<00:02:23.440> for<00:02:23.680> yourself

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
no-brainer to maybe try out for yourself

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.460 
no-brainer to maybe try out for yourself
and/or<00:02:24.420> give<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.540> as<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.690> stocking<00:02:26.140> stuffer<00:02:26.170> or

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
and/or give it as a stocking stuffer or

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.140 
and/or give it as a stocking stuffer or
