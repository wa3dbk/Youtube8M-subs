blade for the blade I'm going to use the

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.350 
blade for the blade I'm going to use the
same<00:01:44.170> aluminum<00:01:44.740> wire<00:01:45.070> but<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:46.119> could<00:01:46.240> also

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
same aluminum wire but you could also

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.910 
same aluminum wire but you could also
switch<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.780> copper<00:01:47.200> wire<00:01:47.380> if<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.619> wanted<00:01:47.830> to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.089 

the<00:02:55.010> last<00:02:55.250> step<00:02:55.549> is<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.760> create<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.269> sails<00:02:56.569> a

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
the last step is to create the sails a

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.259 
the last step is to create the sails a
variety<00:02:58.099> of<00:02:58.129> lightweight<00:02:58.609> paper<00:02:58.879> could<00:02:59.209> be

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
variety of lightweight paper could be

00:02:59.269 --> 00:02:59.920 
variety of lightweight paper could be
used

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
used

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.589 
used
I<00:02:59.959> like<00:03:00.560> foil<00:03:00.950> paper<00:03:01.219> because<00:03:02.030> it's<00:03:02.209> easy<00:03:02.510> to

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
I like foil paper because it's easy to

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.440 
I like foil paper because it's easy to
band<00:03:02.900> around<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.379> wire<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:04.010> can<00:03:04.909> be<00:03:05.060> reshaped

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
band around the wire and can be reshaped

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.750 
band around the wire and can be reshaped
later<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:07.430> make<00:03:07.609> a<00:03:07.639> sail<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.299> fold<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.409> and<00:03:09.980> cut<00:03:10.700> a

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
later to make a sail I fold it and cut a

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:18.179 
later to make a sail I fold it and cut a
shape<00:03:11.439> so<00:03:12.439> that<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.620> have<00:03:12.889> two<00:03:13.219> matching<00:03:13.849> sides

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.189 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:25.479 

cover<00:03:19.189> the<00:03:19.340> inside<00:03:19.819> with<00:03:20.090> some<00:03:20.239> glue<00:03:22.389> and<00:03:24.489> wrap

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
cover the inside with some glue and wrap

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:40.670 
cover the inside with some glue and wrap
it<00:03:26.650> around<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:28.459> wire<00:03:29.199> like<00:03:30.199> this

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.690 

once<00:03:41.670> everything<00:03:42.329> is<00:03:42.450> dry<00:03:43.250> adjust<00:03:44.250> all<00:03:44.519> the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
once everything is dry adjust all the

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.240 
once everything is dry adjust all the
wire<00:03:44.879> blades<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.689> all<00:03:45.840> of<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.110> sails<00:03:46.409> so<00:03:47.099> that

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
wire blades and all of the sails so that

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.100 
wire blades and all of the sails so that
they<00:03:47.340> don't<00:03:47.430> run<00:03:47.549> into<00:03:47.819> each<00:03:48.060> other<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.540> they

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
they don't run into each other and they

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.220 
they don't run into each other and they
can<00:03:49.140> catch<00:03:49.439> the<00:03:49.650> air<00:03:49.769> currents<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:51.750> sculpture

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
can catch the air currents the sculpture

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.020 
can catch the air currents the sculpture
may<00:03:52.439> be<00:03:52.500> finished<00:03:52.860> by<00:03:53.189> decorating<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.790> sails

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
may be finished by decorating the sails

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.899 
may be finished by decorating the sails
with<00:03:54.239> marker<00:03:54.659> or<00:03:55.129> covering<00:03:56.129> the<00:03:56.220> base<00:03:56.400> with
