 bad that they sell in the Chinese like you 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.420
 I said in the previous documentary video 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.190
 try to compete almost exclusively with 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.680
 It will be on the market consoles 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.510
 desktop to early 90s is already 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.119
 he had taken out his peripheral cd for his 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.350
 16 bit console therefore nintendo 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.350
 I could not stay behind 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.890
 james bond 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.160
 we travel back to the year 1991 according to 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.900
 wikipedia in this year the following happened 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.460
 on June 23 is published the 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.930
 video game sonic the hedgehog starring 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.520
 for this character that will become 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.350
 sega mascot on August 13 goes out to 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.520
 the super nintendo sale in america in 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.440
 October goes on sale the first 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.120
 copy of hobby consoles and the 12th 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.230
 December is launched for the first time in 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.150
 Japan the peripheral will be gives me cd 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.860
 those from nintendo were starting to 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.600
 realize that the CD offered a 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.909
 format that was cheaper and had more 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.680
 cartridge capacity better 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.290
 soundtracks and a lot cinematic 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.909
 richest they definitely offered the same 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.070
 that pc games something that up 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.630
 now the cartridges could not give the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.689
 user 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.090
 in that year 1991 in the consumer 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.799
 electronics show that it was like the e3 of 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.170
 the nintendo era claimed that it was 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.509
 working with sony to get ahead 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.539
 your console project grant the 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.220
 nintendo playstation project 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.830
 curiously the day after having 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.780
 announced this they broke the agreement 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.880
 they left everyone wondering with 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.130
 this decision and not only that but 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.350
 it also seemed that the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.030
 idea of ​​being able to use cds with your super 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.820
 nintendo like in these two designs that 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.560
 you see on the screen the gossips say 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.130
 that the contract was too favorable 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.690
 for sony and even abusive for it the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.360
 president of nintendo 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.340
 hiroshi yamauchi shelved the 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.470
 issue in the blink of an eye as well 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.910
 nintendo did not want a cedé any 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.130
 I wanted a super cd with a chip 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.900
 Built-in to save items somewhat 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.760
 that apart from not being pirateable to sony 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.500
 he did not like anything since there was 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.660
 affirmed that a possible videoconsole of 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.970
 sony had compatibility with the super 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.620
 nintendo cd and this prevented him from 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.420
 measured while also saving a 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.880
 ace up your sleeve or an agreement with philips 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.100
 for which he was sued by sonny and 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.310
 which we will talk about later 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.530
 in 1993 the agreements are resumed 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.120
 to create that nintendo ce of the three 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.860
 companies to carry out this were 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.330
 are and I had already worked with 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.070
 nintendo and philips of which we had 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.740
 spoken before the plan was to present 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.510
 super nintendo cd in 1993 until then 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.520
 would work on the project for nintendo 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.470
 in exchange for being able to improve it and sell it 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.880
 subsequently using even the 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.620
 licenses of some of the games 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.900
 nintendo in the end everyone won 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.910
 money with this cake had already been 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.530
 announced its technical specifications 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.200
 as you can see them on the screen and 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.700
 even its price that would be around 200 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.590
 Dollars 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.150
 but now let's talk about philips and 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.489
 of the disastrous career he did in the 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.989
 world of phillips game consoles 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.670
 took advantage of those agreements with nintendo 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.200
 to get the cd and a market 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.060
 product that was pretty bad not only 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.700
 for its price more than 400 dollars but 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.390
 for the low quality of their video games 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.620
 thanks to your agreement with nintendo 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.810
 they were able to market these 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.670
 video games or telmario a game of upload 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.620
 levels through some super doors 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.060
 mario world that never came to nail 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.610
 and that it had a design similar to the super 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.280
 mario world and three cell video games 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.670
 first cell link the face of 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.459
 softball cell of one of fame long and 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.140
 cells adventure both the cells and 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.700
 the marios were lousy games we're going to 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.700
 see a small gameplay that proves it 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.080
 yes 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.080
 i 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.580
 Y 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.580
 all right 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.870
 for me 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.120
 It must be said that Phillips lost more than 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.669
 a trillion with b dollars with this 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.289
 video game console you have to also say how 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.449
 it is obvious that this project super clean 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.770
 12 of failure and that thanks to it 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.990
 we have today in the market the 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.910
 playstation and all the sony hits 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.710
 philips learned the lesson and luckily 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.259
 He did not return another video console with 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.940
 the one that torment us without saying goodbye 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.770
 guys, I hope you liked it so much 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.949
 the video like to give it a like us 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.990
 we see in the next documentary and if still 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:16.850
 you are not subscribed to do it already and so we 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.850
 you will lose it until later
