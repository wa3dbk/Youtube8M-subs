00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
played a lot of black ops and the psg1

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.300 
played a lot of black ops and the psg1
and<00:00:15.929> they'll<00:00:16.170> 96<00:00:16.650> are<00:00:16.770> pretty<00:00:16.949> hard<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.100> use

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
other snipers in any game just because

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.150 
other snipers in any game just because
the<00:00:21.449> way<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.840> sniping<00:00:22.260> isn't<00:00:22.560> black<00:00:22.710> ops<00:00:22.949> so

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160

Cal<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.890> know<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.160> definitely<00:00:35.489> hard<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.700> use

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
