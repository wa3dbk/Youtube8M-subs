00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
 so but hello everyone my name is vladimir 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.700
 Cossacks 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.390
 that last year in 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.790
 last year before-turns 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.590
 a half two years ago I decided 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.010
 try to do business 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.310
 the first thing started is me 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.740
 interested in 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:26.690
 interested in the direction and such a niche 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:31.390
 like meat in bulk , first of all there 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.390
 weight sold volumes are large 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.230
 throwing one or two rubles on the cost 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.770
 one kilogram can be earned 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.560
 normal money about 500 thousand 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.950
 maybe even 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.560
 amounts went up to a million two 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.310
 million i.e. again this 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.530
 business all depends on sales 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.480
 there is a good check 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.370
 tasty and fun to work in principle 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.260
 when you see that how much you 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.610
 falls from this second 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.410
 just enough you can start in 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.280
 this niche but there again there is everything 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.410
 as well as your problems again 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:18.200
 before you start what i did for 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:20.630
 start first thing posted just 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.080
 ad on google direct on Yandex 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.670
 adwords basically Yandex direct of course 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.670
 there was an announcement 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.220
 the announcement was such that the meat is in bulk 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.700
 wholesale meat 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.720
 so then of course I first studied everything 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.030
 what you need here 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.270
 placed an ad on yandex direct 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.340
 that meat is sold in bulk 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:54.370
 otherwise it was natural to call me 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:57.680
 asked question you beef stew 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.910
 cold freezing at first i'm not at all 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.540
 understood what and what 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.690
 but again just the answer solution 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.760
 all questions are very easy 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.790
 call your competitor and ask all 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.420
 the same questions that you get up 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:17.510
 This is very simple cool such 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.560
 method up to this solution and 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.030
 answers to a question to answers to questions 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.450
 can use in any business 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.250
 it turns out 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.660
 no problem cool 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.570
 pump very fast 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.260
 in two days you can learn all the details 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.960
 below 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.870
 what exactly is meat in meat 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.320
 recycled why is it needed and what 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.360
 people buy it and so after 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.460
 send calls started looking for a supplier 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.740
 phoned 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.069
 also through direct of course through Yandex 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.340
 direct 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.499
 all companies and we asked them 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.920
 clarify of course during a conversation we 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:03:00.290
 asked how they work and work 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.900
 whether with an agent where companies are 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.819
 working with an agent sent to us 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.969
 agency contract so that we of course 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.239
 signed sent and we did not 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:13.129
 because before the deal we have not reached 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:18.109
 why is it that before the deal when we have 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:19.420
 there was an order of 100 tons monthly need 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.230
 send tons 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.520
 Caucasus 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.060
 Caucasus and Krasnodar Territory 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.880
 then there was such a plug our supplier 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.840
 Bid already with our wrap 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.739
 very interesting for our buyer 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.700
 dilemmas and the problem was that 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.459
 customer 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.700
 I wanted him to come first meat 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.890
 either by 50% prepayment or by 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.960
 partial 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.560
 and the seller wanted to pay was 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.599
 absolutely in the end 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.390
 solution to this problem of course was to 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.489
 The buyer arrived at the supplier looked 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.000
 meat if someone is happy already 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.410
 ordered on the spot paid 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.900
 it turns out would send there but 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.319
 again the customer did not want to go by 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.530
 to us 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.610
 game over 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.100
 question 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.870
 It turned out a few transactions 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.489
 about two or three deals with us so 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:26.850
 broken off we stopped doing it 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:28.729
 it turned out interesting was won to the same 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.099
 market 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.930
 not really liked the principle can be on 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:35.749
 This money is simple but not 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.099
 like not rushing reluctance and then further 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:39.099
 so they stopped doing
