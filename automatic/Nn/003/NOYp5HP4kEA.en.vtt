00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
hits me with the fighting move which is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.380 
hits me with the fighting move which is
also<00:01:54.689> fantastic<00:01:55.219> because<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.399> resist<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.210> as

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
also fantastic because I resist that as

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.420 
also fantastic because I resist that as
well<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.600> think<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.320> keep<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.250> mind

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
well I think I can keep that in mind

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.850 
well I think I can keep that in mind
when<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.939> into<00:02:00.149> my<00:02:00.479> Pokemon<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.530> i<00:02:01.560> think

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
when going into my Pokemon so i think

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.830 
when going into my Pokemon so i think
i'm<00:02:02.130> at<00:02:02.310> i'm<00:02:02.549> at<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> vantage<00:02:03.119> here<00:02:03.479> for<00:02:03.659> sure

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
i'm at i'm at a vantage here for sure

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.200 
i'm at i'm at a vantage here for sure
because<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.860> know<00:02:04.979> typing<00:02:05.490> advantage<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.180> i

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
because you know typing advantage so i

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.380 
because you know typing advantage so i
think<00:02:06.420> i<00:02:06.659> went<00:02:06.869> for<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.049> psychic<00:02:07.469> assuming<00:02:08.340> that

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
think i went for a psychic assuming that

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.940 
think i went for a psychic assuming that
if<00:02:09.390> he<00:02:09.660> switched<00:02:09.989> out<00:02:10.229> into<00:02:10.590> something<00:02:10.920> that

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
if he switched out into something that

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.860 
if he switched out into something that
resisted<00:02:11.489> fire<00:02:11.730> text<00:02:12.270> then

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
resisted fire text then

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.449 
resisted fire text then
maybe<00:02:13.049> psychic<00:02:13.500> would<00:02:13.650> hit<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.950> for<00:02:14.129> neutral

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
maybe psychic would hit it for neutral

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.030 
maybe psychic would hit it for neutral
so<00:02:14.730> considering<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.810> lot<00:02:16.019> speed<00:02:16.440> I'm<00:02:16.739> just

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
started off from Ruby so I got into it

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.690 
started off from Ruby so I got into it
pretty<00:04:53.640> late<00:04:54.150> so<00:04:54.890> he<00:04:55.890> goes<00:04:55.980> into<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:58.310> why<00:04:59.310> did

pretty late so he goes into the why did

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.930 
pretty late so he goes into the why did
I<00:04:59.820> switch<00:05:00.210> out<00:05:00.450> he<00:05:00.780> was<00:05:00.930> paralyzed<00:05:01.530> I<00:05:01.920> pro<00:05:02.400> no

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
to resist the the move again this time

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.620 
to resist the the move again this time
obviously<00:05:14.610> it's<00:05:14.970> not<00:05:15.000> going<00:05:15.180> to<00:05:15.270> go<00:05:15.360> for<00:05:15.540> you

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.970 
hood thing goes up so I when's my
Lucario<00:05:45.120> right<00:05:45.330> now<00:05:45.510> and<00:05:45.810> i<00:05:46.200> was<00:05:46.380> thinking<00:05:46.830> i

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
Lucario right now and i was thinking i

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.080 
Lucario right now and i was thinking i
can<00:05:47.190> safely<00:05:47.520> get<00:05:48.180> off<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.360> swords<00:05:49.020> dance<00:05:49.320> and

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
can safely get off the swords dance and

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.300 
can safely get off the swords dance and
luckily<00:05:51.090> for<00:05:51.510> me<00:05:51.660> he<00:05:51.690> misses<00:05:51.990> Focus<00:05:52.650> Blast<00:05:52.680> as

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
luckily for me he misses Focus Blast as

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.370 
luckily for me he misses Focus Blast as
you<00:05:53.670> can<00:05:53.790> tell<00:05:53.850> Focus<00:05:54.480> Blast<00:05:54.510> still<00:05:55.140> has<00:05:55.350> a

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
you can tell Focus Blast still has a

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.100 
you can tell Focus Blast still has a
shitty<00:05:55.950> accuracy<00:05:56.880> from<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.300> last<00:05:57.510> generation

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
shitty accuracy from the last generation

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.030 
shitty accuracy from the last generation
so<00:05:58.830> I<00:05:59.070> guess<00:05:59.580> that's<00:05:59.820> nothing<00:06:00.330> new<00:06:00.360> and<00:06:01.040> he

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
so I guess that's nothing new and he

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.160 
so I guess that's nothing new and he
assumed<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.700> house<00:06:02.820> and<00:06:03.180> go<00:06:03.300> for<00:06:03.480> that<00:06:03.570> so<00:06:03.930> I

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
assumed the house and go for that so I

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.190 
assumed the house and go for that so I
guess<00:06:04.580> mispredictions<00:06:05.580> except<00:06:06.120> now<00:06:06.300> like<00:06:06.960> I

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
guess mispredictions except now like I

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.760 
guess mispredictions except now like I
can't<00:06:07.590> really<00:06:07.670> I<00:06:08.670> have<00:06:09.120> I<00:06:09.360> can't<00:06:09.870> hit<00:06:10.110> him<00:06:10.140> for

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
can't really I have I can't hit him for

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.570 
can't really I have I can't hit him for
bone<00:06:11.070> rush<00:06:11.780> obviously<00:06:12.780> so<00:06:13.290> i<00:06:13.320> thought<00:06:13.530> i<00:06:13.890> could

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
bone rush obviously so i thought i could

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.250 
bone rush obviously so i thought i could
eat

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260
