fisher-price<00:01:46.610> logo<00:01:47.610> they<00:01:48.329> had<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> couple<00:01:48.810> of

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
fisher-price logo they had a couple of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.200 
fisher-price logo they had a couple of
other<00:01:49.170> instruments<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.520> matched<00:01:50.820> this

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
other instruments that that matched this

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.510 
other instruments that that matched this
it<00:01:51.479> was<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:51.780> part<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.140> series<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.799> think

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
it was like part of a series I think

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.350 
it was like part of a series I think
they<00:01:53.670> had<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> um<00:01:54.240> some<00:01:55.110> kind<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.470> horn<00:01:56.360> you

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
they had a um some kind of a horn you

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.149 
they had a um some kind of a horn you
know<00:01:57.390> or<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.140> know<00:01:58.259> they<00:01:58.409> had<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> head<00:01:59.009> of

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
know or you know they had the head of

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.580 
know or you know they had the head of
guitar<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.549> think<00:01:59.729> like<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> fake<00:02:00.689> guitar<00:02:00.899> but

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
guitar I think like a fake guitar but

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.490 
guitar I think like a fake guitar but
anyway<00:02:02.030> this<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.180> an<00:02:03.329> actual<00:02:03.780> playable

all the result of maybe one or two
broken<00:05:10.690> contacts<00:05:11.350> again<00:05:12.040> I'm<00:05:12.280> gonna<00:05:12.370> take<00:05:12.730> an

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
broken contacts again I'm gonna take an

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.080 
broken contacts again I'm gonna take an
IDE<00:05:13.330> our<00:05:13.630> drive<00:05:13.960> cable<00:05:14.410> and<00:05:14.950> repurpose<00:05:15.760> it<00:05:15.880> to

replace the existing ribbon cable

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.080 
replace the existing ribbon cable
I<00:05:19.860> believe<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.040> width<00:05:21.280> will<00:05:21.520> fit<00:05:21.820> and<00:05:21.970> maybe

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:53.950 
been looking for another one on eBay I

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:59.430 
been looking for another one on eBay I
can't<00:06:54.880> find<00:06:55.180> anyone<00:06:55.600> anything<00:06:56.200> like<00:06:56.410> this<00:06:58.440> it

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
can't find anyone anything like this it

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.280 
can't find anyone anything like this it
seems<00:06:59.770> that<00:06:59.950> most<00:07:00.160> of<00:07:00.430> the<00:07:00.720> kid<00:07:01.720> one<00:07:02.140> of<00:07:02.230> the

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.290 
seems that most of the kid one of the

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.830 
seems that most of the kid one of the
reasons<00:07:02.590> this<00:07:02.710> had<00:07:02.890> a<00:07:02.920> very<00:07:03.160> short<00:07:03.460> production

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 
reasons this had a very short production

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.030 
reasons this had a very short production
cycle<00:07:04.840> I<00:07:04.900> think<00:07:04.960> it<00:07:05.200> was<00:07:05.290> only<00:07:05.410> about<00:07:05.530> three<00:07:05.920> or

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:06.040 
cycle I think it was only about three or

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.760 
cycle I think it was only about three or
four<00:07:06.250> years<00:07:06.540> is<00:07:07.540> because<00:07:07.780> most<00:07:08.080> kids<00:07:08.410> didn't

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
four years is because most kids didn't

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.920 
four years is because most kids didn't
want<00:07:08.950> these<00:07:09.220> they<00:07:09.280> wanted<00:07:10.000> the<00:07:10.090> Casio<00:07:10.630> tones

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
want these they wanted the Casio tones

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.630 
want these they wanted the Casio tones
which<00:07:11.230> said<00:07:11.440> you<00:07:11.680> could<00:07:12.160> make<00:07:12.280> funny<00:07:12.550> sounds

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:12.640 
which said you could make funny sounds

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.890 
which said you could make funny sounds
with<00:07:13.210> them<00:07:13.330> and<00:07:13.420> you<00:07:13.480> could<00:07:13.570> do<00:07:13.690> a<00:07:13.720> lot<00:07:13.840> more

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:13.900 
with them and you could do a lot more

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.540 
with them and you could do a lot more
with<00:07:14.200> a<00:07:14.230> Casio<00:07:14.710> tone<00:07:14.950> you<00:07:15.100> know<00:07:15.190> was<00:07:15.340> better

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550 
with a Casio tone you know was better

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.620 
with a Casio tone you know was better
quality<00:07:16.120> I<00:07:16.360> think<00:07:17.970> so<00:07:18.970> these<00:07:19.120> didn't<00:07:19.390> really

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:19.630 
quality I think so these didn't really

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.210 
quality I think so these didn't really
sell<00:07:19.870> very<00:07:20.080> well<00:07:20.170> from<00:07:20.770> what<00:07:20.950> I<00:07:20.980> can<00:07:21.070> tell<00:07:23.220> my

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.120 
one and I think the reason I got this
was<00:07:37.960> because<00:07:38.260> they<00:07:38.350> used<00:07:38.500> to<00:07:38.590> play<00:07:38.740> with<00:07:38.950> one

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.130

was because they used to play with one
