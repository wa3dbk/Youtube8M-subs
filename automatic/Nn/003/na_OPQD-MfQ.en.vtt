and<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.320> know<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.500> think<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.250> enjoy<00:01:44.399> that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
and you know I think that I enjoy that

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.160 
and you know I think that I enjoy that
but<00:01:45.090> definitely<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.659> much<00:01:45.780> as<00:01:45.960> these<00:01:46.110> two

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
but definitely not as much as these two

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.620 
but definitely not as much as these two
and<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.280> don't<00:01:47.340> think<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.790> was<00:01:47.880> blown<00:01:48.210> as<00:01:48.420> much

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
and I don't think it was blown as much

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.420 
and I don't think it was blown as much
up<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:49.170> these<00:01:49.380> two<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.399> course

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
up as these two and then of course

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.190 
up as these two and then of course
washio<00:01:51.270> frozen<00:01:51.810> came<00:01:52.020> out<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:54.840> must<00:01:55.110> have

washio frozen came out and it must have

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.899

came<00:02:00.149> out<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.840> again<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.530> know<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.979> blew<00:02:02.219> up

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
came out and again you know it blew up

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.800 
came out and again you know it blew up
her<00:02:02.549> forms<00:02:02.850> talking<00:02:03.240> about<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.540> everyone

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
her forms talking about it everyone

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.660 
her forms talking about it everyone
loved<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.469> it's<00:02:04.680> all<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:04.979> doesn't<00:02:05.430> that

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
loved it and it's all this doesn't that

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.490 
loved it and it's all this doesn't that
this<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.930> all<00:02:07.079> frozen

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
this is all frozen

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.410 
this is all frozen
I<00:02:07.590> thought<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.009> know<00:02:08.129> what<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.670> might<00:02:09.209> love

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
I thought you know what I might love

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
I thought you know what I might love
this<00:02:09.629> even<00:02:09.929> more<00:02:10.170> than

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
this even more than

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.380 
this even more than
tangle<00:02:10.830> that's<00:02:11.160> why<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.310> thought<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.090> reason

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
tangle that's why I thought the reason

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.940 
tangle that's why I thought the reason
it<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.630> remind<00:02:12.870> me<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.140> Tamil<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.530> because<00:02:13.830> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it can remind me of Tamil is because the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.280 
it can remind me of Tamil is because the
character<00:02:14.310> designs<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.690> way<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:15.990> it

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
character designs and the way if it

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.110 
character designs and the way if it
looks<00:02:16.560> kind<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:16.980> has<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.220> same<00:02:17.400> vibe<00:02:17.670> as<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
looks kind of has the same vibe as the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.210 
looks kind of has the same vibe as the
way<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:18.450> tangle<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.620> horse<00:02:19.890> here

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
way that tangle is and the horse here

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.660 
way that tangle is and the horse here
entangled<00:02:20.910> Maximus<00:02:22.280> straightaway<00:02:23.280> as<00:02:23.430> soon

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
entangled Maximus straightaway as soon

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.980 
entangled Maximus straightaway as soon
as<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.880> see<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.060> horse<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.480> hands<00:02:24.810> his

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
as you see that horse that hands his

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.020 
as you see that horse that hands his
right<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.200> think<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.500> when<00:02:26.460> they<00:02:26.580> knocked<00:02:26.790> Ana

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
right I think that when they knocked Ana

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.270 
right I think that when they knocked Ana
into<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.450> boat<00:02:27.660> looks<00:02:28.380> just<00:02:28.590> like<00:02:28.770> him<00:02:29.070> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
into the boat looks just like him the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.730 
into the boat looks just like him the
horse<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.730> all<00:02:29.940> very<00:02:30.120> similar<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.500> just

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
horse is all very similar and it just

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.920 
horse is all very similar and it just
reminds<00:02:31.980> you're<00:02:32.130> tangled<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.840> think

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
reminds you're tangled and so I think

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.690 
reminds you're tangled and so I think
it's<00:02:34.170> easier<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.530> compare<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.950> two<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.340> I

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
it's easier to compare the two and I

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.100 
it's easier to compare the two and I
think<00:02:35.940> that's<00:02:36.060> well<00:02:36.270> it's<00:02:36.450> whole<00:02:36.600> comparison

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
think that's well it's whole comparison

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.920 
think that's well it's whole comparison
of<00:02:37.230> them<00:02:37.320> both<00:02:37.500> as<00:02:37.680> come<00:02:37.890> from<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:39.180> because

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
of them both as come from and because

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.510 
of them both as come from and because
they're<00:02:40.140> kind<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.470> similar<00:02:40.710> and<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.130> style<00:02:41.370> is

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
they're kind of similar and the style is

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.310 
they're kind of similar and the style is
similar<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.180> they<00:02:42.420> were<00:02:42.540> about<00:02:42.780> princesses

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
similar and they were about princesses

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.830 
similar and they were about princesses
even<00:02:43.620> though<00:02:43.710> different<00:02:43.890> stories<00:02:44.690> but<00:02:45.690> they

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
even though different stories but they

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.900 
even though different stories but they
do<00:02:45.990> both<00:02:46.140> have<00:02:46.380> kind<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.680> family<00:02:47.010> orient<00:02:47.670> as

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
do both have kind of family orient as

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.840 
do both have kind of family orient as
well<00:02:48.180> um<00:02:49.140> but<00:02:49.830> with<00:02:50.010> tangled<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.490> guess<00:02:50.640> had<00:02:50.820> a

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
well um but with tangled I guess had a

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.630 
well um but with tangled I guess had a
bit<00:02:51.030> more<00:02:51.080> romance<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.470> suppose<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.490> guess

start to finish

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.740 
start to finish
whereas<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.280> found<00:03:44.850> what<00:03:45.030> frozen<00:03:45.450> there<00:03:45.570> was<00:03:45.690> a

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
whereas I found what frozen there was a

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.009 
whereas I found what frozen there was a
cover<00:03:45.930> bit<00:03:46.110> so<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.320> was<00:03:46.440> like<00:03:46.910> yeah<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.840> know

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
cover bit so I was like yeah you know

I'm<00:03:49.590> loving<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.250> film<00:03:50.489> but<00:03:50.730> there's<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.000> couple

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
I'm loving the film but there's a couple

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.600 
I'm loving the film but there's a couple
bits<00:03:51.360> which<00:03:51.600> I<00:03:51.780> could<00:03:52.080> would<00:03:52.920> have<00:03:53.070> missed<00:03:53.340> if

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
bits which I could would have missed if

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.000 
bits which I could would have missed if
that<00:03:53.760> makes<00:03:53.940> sense<00:03:54.000> also<00:03:54.870> problem<00:03:55.739> I<00:03:55.830> have<00:03:55.980> a

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
that makes sense also problem I have a

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.400 
that makes sense also problem I have a
frozen<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:57.480> course<00:03:57.540> it's<00:03:57.900> kind<00:03:57.989> of<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.140> tale<00:03:58.290> of

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
frozen of course it's kind of a tale of

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.140 
frozen of course it's kind of a tale of
Snow<00:03:58.500> Queen<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:59.100> hang<00:03:59.459> on<00:03:59.550> this<00:03:59.670> cross<00:03:59.880> bitch

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
Snow Queen and hang on this cross bitch

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.890 
Snow Queen and hang on this cross bitch
and<00:04:00.300> Rapunzel

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
and Rapunzel

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.990 
and Rapunzel
I<00:04:00.930> think<00:04:01.860> frozen<00:04:02.190> is<00:04:02.250> kind<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.489> a<00:04:02.550> loosely

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
I think frozen is kind of a loosely

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.070 
I think frozen is kind of a loosely
based<00:04:03.090> on<00:04:03.300> The<00:04:03.390> Snow<00:04:03.450> Queen<00:04:03.600> though<00:04:03.900> I'm<00:04:03.959> not

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
based on The Snow Queen though I'm not

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.640 
based on The Snow Queen though I'm not
sure<00:04:04.140> how<00:04:04.730> exactly<00:04:05.730> is<00:04:05.970> but<00:04:06.510> at<00:04:07.170> frozen<00:04:07.530> I

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
sure how exactly is but at frozen I

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.860 
sure how exactly is but at frozen I
think<00:04:07.860> has<00:04:08.040> some<00:04:08.070> kind<00:04:08.459> of<00:04:08.519> certain<00:04:09.510> holes

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
think has some kind of certain holes

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.699 
think has some kind of certain holes
that<00:04:10.739> I'm<00:04:10.890> always<00:04:11.160> like<00:04:11.430> ah<00:04:11.550> and<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:13.080> this<00:04:13.380> you

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
that I'm always like ah and and this you

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.140 
that I'm always like ah and and this you
know<00:04:13.800> I<00:04:13.830> didn't<00:04:14.220> think<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.580> think<00:04:14.790> if<00:04:14.910> they<00:04:15.000> will

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
know I didn't think I think if they will

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.370 
know I didn't think I think if they will
try<00:04:15.390> to<00:04:15.450> incorporate<00:04:15.720> some<00:04:16.049> of<00:04:16.080> these<00:04:16.169> things

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
try to incorporate some of these things

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.720 
try to incorporate some of these things
in<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.560> movie<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:17.010> would<00:04:17.160> just<00:04:17.340> be<00:04:17.430> too<00:04:17.549> long

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
in the movie it would just be too long

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.099 
in the movie it would just be too long
too<00:04:17.910> complicated<00:04:18.239> so<00:04:18.450> I'm<00:04:18.600> not<00:04:18.720> saying<00:04:18.960> they

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
too complicated so I'm not saying they

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:19.440 
too complicated so I'm not saying they
should

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
should

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.810 
should
I'm<00:04:19.750> just<00:04:20.260> saying<00:04:20.470> for<00:04:20.830> me<00:04:20.980> personally<00:04:21.310> that's

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
why maybe I'm more early in towards

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.190 
why maybe I'm more early in towards
tangled<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.820> that's<00:04:24.940> was<00:04:25.120> what<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.600> would<00:04:25.930> like

the<00:06:33.919> first<00:06:34.220> half<00:06:34.520> of<00:06:34.580> the<00:06:34.699> movie<00:06:35.180> it's<00:06:35.900> kind<00:06:36.139> of

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
the first half of the movie it's kind of

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:40.240 
the first half of the movie it's kind of
superior<00:06:36.620> to<00:06:36.740> the<00:06:36.970> the<00:06:37.970> the<00:06:38.960> middle<00:06:39.229> and<00:06:40.039> then

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
superior to the the the middle and then

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.790 
superior to the the the middle and then
obviously<00:06:40.460> that's<00:06:40.699> a<00:06:40.819> very<00:06:40.849> end<00:06:41.240> so<00:06:41.990> you<00:06:42.710> know

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
obviously that's a very end so you know

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.649 
obviously that's a very end so you know
you've<00:06:42.949> got<00:06:43.099> some<00:06:43.250> really<00:06:43.610> might<00:06:44.150> blow<00:06:44.419> me

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:44.659 
you've got some really might blow me

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:46.600 
you've got some really might blow me
away<00:06:44.689> moments<00:06:45.349> but<00:06:45.830> it's<00:06:46.009> time<00:06:46.189> called<00:06:46.460> I

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
away moments but it's time called I

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.540 
away moments but it's time called I
think<00:06:46.759> it's<00:06:47.060> kind<00:06:47.300> of<00:06:47.389> pretty<00:06:48.219> steady

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
think it's kind of pretty steady

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.939 
think it's kind of pretty steady
you<00:06:50.300> never<00:06:50.509> really<00:06:50.840> blew<00:06:51.139> me<00:06:51.349> away<00:06:51.379> but<00:06:51.919> I

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:51.949 
you never really blew me away but I

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:54.730 
you never really blew me away but I
loved<00:06:52.689> it<00:06:53.689> consistently<00:06:54.289> where's<00:06:54.530> your

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
loved it consistently where's your

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.200 
loved it consistently where's your
frozen<00:06:54.889> house<00:06:55.099> like<00:06:55.219> wow<00:06:55.340> I<00:06:55.610> love<00:06:55.849> it<00:06:55.939> so<00:06:55.969> much

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
frozen house like wow I love it so much

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.520 
frozen house like wow I love it so much
but<00:06:56.389> maybe<00:06:56.539> that's<00:06:56.750> because<00:06:56.870> sometimes<00:06:57.229> a

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
but maybe that's because sometimes a

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.929 
but maybe that's because sometimes a
really<00:06:57.800> very<00:06:57.919> way<00:06:58.099> that<00:06:58.310> the<00:06:58.400> other<00:06:58.550> moments

00:06:58.929 --> 00:06:58.939 
really very way that the other moments

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:02.830 
really very way that the other moments
were<00:06:59.090> not<00:06:59.810> as<00:07:00.520> good<00:07:01.520> or<00:07:01.729> more<00:07:02.180> disappointing<00:07:02.750> I

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 
were not as good or more disappointing I

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.469 
were not as good or more disappointing I
suppose<00:07:03.099> so<00:07:04.099> overall<00:07:04.969> I<00:07:05.560> would<00:07:06.560> probably<00:07:07.479> vote

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 
suppose so overall I would probably vote

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:12.010 
suppose so overall I would probably vote
this<00:07:08.750> one<00:07:08.960> over<00:07:09.860> this<00:07:09.979> one<00:07:10.039> and<00:07:10.780> that's<00:07:11.780> just

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 
this one over this one and that's just

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.930 
this one over this one and that's just
kind<00:07:12.440> of<00:07:12.500> why<00:07:12.680> if<00:07:13.069> that<00:07:13.129> makes<00:07:13.430> any<00:07:13.580> sense<00:07:13.699> so

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
kind of why if that makes any sense so

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.339
