 peggy 18 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.770
 hello I'm alex amancio creative director 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.940
 of aces enrolled today we are going to teach you 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.940
 a robbery mission 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.280
 chambers 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.720
 thefts are a specific type of 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.990
 cooperative mission different from the 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.830
 sisterhood missions that we already presented 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.860
 they have to infiltrate 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.960
 stealthily in a very guarded place 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.260
 get the treasure and steal it without you 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.000
 see let's use common sense a 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.470
 of the four cooperative skills 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.960
 that gives us a better view of the 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.030
 situation as you can see there are a lot of 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.470
 guards patrolling the cemetery like this 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.050
 that we must adapt the way 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.300
 approach us according to your position and route of 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.009
 patrol luckily the route of this 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.470
 guard takes you to near a lot of 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.869
 straw there are two guards behind the 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.890
 mausoleum we will coordinate to make a 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.810
 synchronized murder well done 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.430
 you can not use the bells of 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.570
 alert and prevent the guards from asking 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.570
 reinforcements and they detect us 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.460
 it's not me 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.250
 there is the chest the missions of theft 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.080
 they have random elements like the 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.690
 location of the chest the number of 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.250
 guards and their positions we will use 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.250
 the strategy to clear the room 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.409
 Now that we have the treasure, we have to 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.459
 escape from the area without being seen 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:21.379
 remember that the more times you 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.379
 detect more the prize is reduced 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.689
 5 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.060

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.930

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.950
 thefts are missions with a high 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.140
 replayability due to its factors 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.849
