00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
we usually have two practices a week but

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.660 
we usually have two practices a week but
for<00:00:27.779> now<00:00:27.900> because<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.349> Ramadan<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.400> cut

for now because it's Ramadan so we cut

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:39.060

we already trained like four times a
week<00:00:58.989> I<00:01:05.220> don't<00:01:06.220> think<00:01:06.790> anyone<00:01:07.630> will<00:01:07.780> fit<00:01:08.140> the

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
week I don't think anyone will fit the

week I don't think anyone will fit the
size<00:01:08.440> Alice<00:01:08.890> because<00:01:09.840> cheerleading<00:01:10.840> is

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
size Alice because cheerleading is

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.020 
size Alice because cheerleading is
already<00:01:11.380> known<00:01:11.530> as<00:01:11.649> a<00:01:11.860> spark<00:01:12.190> and<00:01:12.399> by<00:01:12.820> now

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
already known as a spark and by now

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.580 
already known as a spark and by now
people<00:01:13.240> should<00:01:13.539> already<00:01:13.780> understand<00:01:14.380> that

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
people should already understand that

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.070 
people should already understand that
it's<00:01:15.280> by<00:01:15.550> choice<00:01:15.820> whether<00:01:16.390> you<00:01:16.539> want<00:01:16.690> to<00:01:16.930> join

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
it's by choice whether you want to join

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.260 
it's by choice whether you want to join
cheerleading<00:01:17.590> or<00:01:17.740> not<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.220> if<00:01:18.670> their<00:01:18.910> parents

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
cheerleading or not and if their parents

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.940 
cheerleading or not and if their parents
is<00:01:19.360> okay<00:01:19.660> with<00:01:19.810> it<00:01:19.899> and<00:01:20.050> your<00:01:20.259> family<00:01:20.590> is<00:01:20.710> okay

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950

with<00:01:21.100> it<00:01:21.190> and<00:01:21.369> I<00:01:21.580> don't<00:01:22.060> think<00:01:22.270> there's<00:01:22.750> a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
with it and I don't think there's a

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.630 
with it and I don't think there's a
problem<00:01:23.020> with<00:01:23.320> that<00:01:23.470> if<00:01:24.160> you<00:01:24.310> have<00:01:24.340> passion

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
problem with that if you have passion

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.490 
problem with that if you have passion
for<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.180> then<00:01:25.360> you<00:01:25.600> should<00:01:25.810> just<00:01:26.050> go<00:01:26.170> for<00:01:26.470> it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
for it then you should just go for it

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.029 
for it then you should just go for it
and<00:01:26.950> if<00:01:27.700> that<00:01:28.330> makes<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:28.869> happy<00:01:29.289> then<00:01:29.530> you

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
and if that makes you happy then you

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:43.320 
and if that makes you happy then you
should<00:01:30.460> just<00:01:30.700> continue

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.350
