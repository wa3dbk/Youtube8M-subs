control at 88 dribbling al you know the
main<00:01:44.500> things<00:01:44.740> that<00:01:44.799> stand<00:01:45.039> out<00:01:45.250> for<00:01:45.490> him<00:01:45.610> and

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
main things that stand out for him and

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.730 
main things that stand out for him and
they're<00:01:46.329> the<00:01:46.420> only<00:01:46.539> ones<00:01:46.750> in<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.320> green<00:01:47.500> power

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
they're the only ones in the green power

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.649 
they're the only ones in the green power
the<00:01:47.950> long<00:01:48.130> shots<00:01:48.430> should<00:01:48.700> be<00:01:48.939> however<00:01:49.539> you

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
the long shots should be however you

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.389 
the long shots should be however you
know<00:01:49.750> he<00:01:49.840> is<00:01:49.930> a<00:01:49.960> left<00:01:50.229> wing<00:01:50.409> so<00:01:50.649> I<00:01:50.860> guess<00:01:51.100> that's

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
know he is a left wing so I guess that's

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.100 
know he is a left wing so I guess that's
why<00:01:51.579> they've<00:01:51.759> downgraded<00:01:51.939> a<00:01:52.329> little<00:01:52.600> bit<00:01:52.719> but

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
why they've downgraded a little bit but

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.749 
why they've downgraded a little bit but
he<00:01:53.259> has<00:01:53.380> scored<00:01:53.530> so<00:01:53.920> many<00:01:54.100> long<00:01:54.280> shots<00:01:54.490> for<00:01:54.549> me

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
he has scored so many long shots for me

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.670 
he has scored so many long shots for me
and<00:01:54.789> it's<00:01:55.420> just<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.630> very<00:01:55.899> very<00:01:55.960> very<00:01:56.229> good

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
and it's just a very very very good

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.429 
and it's just a very very very good
player<00:01:56.920> all<00:01:57.219> around<00:01:57.310> boy<00:01:58.030> I<00:01:58.210> do<00:01:58.270> believe<00:01:58.630> his

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
player all around boy I do believe his

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.770 
player all around boy I do believe his
long<00:01:59.590> term<00:01:59.829> should<00:01:59.979> be<00:02:00.039> 80<00:02:00.399> plus<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.030> as<00:02:01.630> you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
long term should be 80 plus and as you

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.000 
long term should be 80 plus and as you
can<00:02:01.899> see<00:02:01.930> just<00:02:02.140> scrolling<00:02:02.439> down<00:02:02.560> slowly<00:02:03.039> and

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
can see just scrolling down slowly and

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.650 
can see just scrolling down slowly and
it's<00:02:04.250> not<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.760> best<00:02:04.850> apparently<00:02:05.300> Turkish<00:02:05.570> as

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
it's not the best apparently Turkish as

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.510 
it's not the best apparently Turkish as
you<00:02:05.720> can<00:02:05.840> see<00:02:05.960> is<00:02:06.110> only<00:02:06.260> 65<00:02:06.710> penalties<00:02:07.280> but<00:02:07.430> I'm

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
you can see is only 65 penalties but I'm

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.000 
you can see is only 65 penalties but I'm
not<00:02:07.670> too<00:02:07.880> sure<00:02:08.119> where<00:02:08.570> that's<00:02:08.720> judged<00:02:09.050> Sarah

the header.php in the defender wherever

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.129 
the header.php in the defender wherever
i<00:04:36.650> was<00:04:36.800> playing<00:04:37.009> and<00:04:37.729> you<00:04:38.660> know<00:04:38.720> he<00:04:38.930> actually

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
i was playing and you know he actually

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.260 
i was playing and you know he actually
went<00:04:39.440> ahead<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:40.009> know<00:04:40.130> his<00:04:40.490> defensive<00:04:40.910> I'm

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
went ahead I you know his defensive I'm

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.700 
went ahead I you know his defensive I'm
not<00:04:41.509> actually<00:04:41.780> sure<00:04:41.960> what<00:04:42.199> his<00:04:42.320> head<00:04:42.470> in<00:04:42.560> is

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
not actually sure what his head in is

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.230 
not actually sure what his head in is
now<00:04:42.919> I<00:04:42.949> think<00:04:43.100> it's<00:04:43.250> like<00:04:43.430> it's<00:04:43.910> only<00:04:44.060> it's

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
now I think it's like it's only it's

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.810 
now I think it's like it's only it's
like<00:04:44.389> 68<00:04:44.930> or<00:04:45.199> something<00:04:45.530> like<00:04:45.620> that<00:04:45.680> but<00:04:46.250> you

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
like 68 or something like that but you

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.219 
like 68 or something like that but you
know<00:04:46.849> he<00:04:47.090> still<00:04:47.330> seems<00:04:47.539> to<00:04:47.690> win<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:47.870> lot<00:04:48.199> of

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
know he still seems to win a lot of

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.960 
know he still seems to win a lot of
headers<00:04:48.620> and<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:48.949> makes<00:04:49.130> no<00:04:49.310> sense<00:04:49.370> really<00:04:49.729> but

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
headers and it makes no sense really but

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.430 
headers and it makes no sense really but
you<00:04:50.300> know<00:04:50.330> I'm<00:04:50.630> not<00:04:50.870> really<00:04:51.050> gonna<00:04:51.199> put

we're<00:05:04.520> going<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:04.699> see<00:05:04.789> now<00:05:04.940> is<00:05:05.060> just<00:05:05.270> an

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
we're going to see now is just an

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.180 
we're going to see now is just an
absolute<00:05:05.509> beautiful<00:05:06.320> left-footed<00:05:06.740> finesse

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
absolute beautiful left-footed finesse

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.219 
absolute beautiful left-footed finesse
right<00:05:07.789> footed<00:05:08.060> not<00:05:08.479> for<00:05:08.660> this<00:05:08.720> actually<00:05:09.080> I

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
right footed not for this actually I

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:10.719 
right footed not for this actually I
thought<00:05:09.650> it<00:05:09.770> was<00:05:09.889> I<00:05:09.949> think<00:05:10.310> it's<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.490> next

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
thought it was I think it's the next

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:11.860 
thought it was I think it's the next
step<00:05:10.849> that<00:05:11.030> is<00:05:11.120> the<00:05:11.180> left<00:05:11.389> foot<00:05:11.479> finesse<00:05:11.840> that

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
step that is the left foot finesse that

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.689 
step that is the left foot finesse that

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
over the keeper but that was a very nice

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.640 
over the keeper but that was a very nice
shot<00:05:16.340> power<00:05:16.550> example<00:05:17.419> you<00:05:17.900> know<00:05:17.990> just<00:05:18.199> blow
