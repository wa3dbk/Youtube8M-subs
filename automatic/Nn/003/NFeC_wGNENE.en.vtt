hi<00:00:00.989> guys<00:00:01.260> all<00:00:01.560> my<00:00:01.709> hair<00:00:01.920> with<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.159> Nexus<00:00:02.610> 5<00:00:02.909> now

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
hi guys all my hair with the Nexus 5 now

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:04.970 
hi guys all my hair with the Nexus 5 now
in<00:00:03.990> this<00:00:04.110> video<00:00:04.290> I<00:00:04.470> want<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.710> show<00:00:04.920> you

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
in this video I want to show you

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.880 
in this video I want to show you
something<00:00:05.490> called<00:00:05.640> process<00:00:06.330> stats<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.859> can

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
something called process stats you can

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.700 
something called process stats you can
access<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:08.610> using<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.269> settings<00:00:10.139> menu<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.679> go

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
access it using the settings menu you go

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.490 
access it using the settings menu you go
down<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.309> bottom<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.940> developer<00:00:12.870> options

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
down to the bottom to developer options

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.860 
down to the bottom to developer options
and<00:00:13.620> then<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.219> can<00:00:14.340> access<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.969> through<00:00:15.120> and

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
and then you can access it through and

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.620 
and then you can access it through and
this<00:00:16.440> menu<00:00:16.740> process<00:00:17.340> starts<00:00:17.699> now<00:00:18.210> basically

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
this menu process starts now basically

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.380 
this menu process starts now basically
what<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.260> many<00:00:19.590> does<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.340> allows<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.210> to

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
what this many does is it allows you to

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.630 
what this many does is it allows you to
see<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:21.840> applications<00:00:22.529> are<00:00:22.740> using<00:00:23.189> how<00:00:23.430> much

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
see what applications are using how much

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.670 
see what applications are using how much
of<00:00:23.880> your<00:00:24.060> memory<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.840> means<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.470> can

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
of your memory this means that you can

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.429 
of your memory this means that you can
force<00:00:26.070> an<00:00:26.420> application<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.660> terminate<00:00:28.230> for

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
force an application to terminate for

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.830 
force an application to terminate for
example<00:00:29.099> if<00:00:29.189> you're<00:00:29.340> using<00:00:29.840> multiple

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
example if you're using multiple

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.260 
example if you're using multiple
applications<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.740> one<00:00:31.980> application<00:00:32.700> forces

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
applications and one application forces

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.319 
applications and one application forces
your<00:00:33.540> phone<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:34.320> very<00:00:34.620> slow<00:00:35.100> then<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.790> my

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
your phone to go very slow then that my

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.650 
your phone to go very slow then that my
chances<00:00:36.690> are<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.320> application<00:00:37.950> is

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
chances are that that application is

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.880 
chances are that that application is
using<00:00:39.660> too<00:00:39.840> much<00:00:39.989> memory<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.680> whatever

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
using too much memory for whatever

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.979 
using too much memory for whatever
reason<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.550> go<00:00:41.820> into<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.270> application

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
reason you can go into this application

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.950 
reason you can go into this application
see<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:43.680> application<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.690> using<00:00:45.690> that

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
see what application is using that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.619 
see what application is using that
memory<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.590> then<00:00:47.129> terminate<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.480> you've

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
memory and then terminate it and you've

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.540 
memory and then terminate it and you've
got<00:00:48.660> some<00:00:48.960> options<00:00:49.110> here<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> top<00:00:49.980> which

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
got some options here on the top which

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.959 
got some options here on the top which
basically<00:00:51.329> give<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> ability<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
basically give you the ability to

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.860 
basically give you the ability to
determine<00:00:53.969> determine<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:55.550> duration<00:00:56.550> of

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
determine determine the duration of

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.799 
determine determine the duration of
stats<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.140> within<00:00:58.800> 3<00:00:59.129> hours<00:00:59.160> within<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.059> 6<00:01:00.329> 6

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
stats so within 3 hours within the 6 6

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.609 
stats so within 3 hours within the 6 6
hours<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.920> 12<00:01:02.340> hours<00:01:02.879> there<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.899> full<00:01:04.290> day

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
hours the 12 hours there and a full day

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.250 
hours the 12 hours there and a full day
and<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:05.729> you've<00:01:05.850> got<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.119> option<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.689> show

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and then you've got the option to show

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.560 
and then you've got the option to show
system<00:01:08.040> applications<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.150> these<00:01:09.390> are

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
system applications so these are

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.690 
system applications so these are
something<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.140> would<00:01:10.560> stay<00:01:11.369> away<00:01:11.670> from

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
something that I would stay away from

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.700 
something that I would stay away from
because<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.540> know<00:01:12.750> system<00:01:13.110> applications

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
because you know system applications

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.679 
because you know system applications
need<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.070> run<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.330> something<00:01:15.570> that

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
need to be run but it's something that

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.510 
need to be run but it's something that
you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> look<00:01:16.439> at<00:01:16.590> if<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:17.280> phone<00:01:17.490> has

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
you can have a look at if your phone has

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.820 
you can have a look at if your phone has
a<00:01:18.030> virus<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.570> some<00:01:18.750> kind<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:20.659> use<00:01:21.659> USS<00:01:22.590> is

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
a virus of some kind and you use USS is

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.109 
a virus of some kind and you use USS is
basically<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.630> ability<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.200> see<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.490> you

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
basically the ability to see if you

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.060 
basically the ability to see if you
would<00:01:27.420> terminate<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.320> certain<00:01:28.920> application

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
would terminate a certain application

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.870 
would terminate a certain application
how<00:01:29.909> much<00:01:30.119> memory<00:01:30.420> would<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.960> freed<00:01:31.470> right<00:01:32.340> so

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
how much memory would be freed right so

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.030 
how much memory would be freed right so
basically<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.810> app<00:01:33.930> D<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.530> figures<00:01:34.829> should

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
basically the app D the figures should

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.980 
basically the app D the figures should
remain<00:01:35.400> around<00:01:35.759> about<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> same<00:01:36.329> cause<00:01:36.689> in

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
remain around about the same cause in

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.069 
remain around about the same cause in
theory<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.759> example<00:01:38.790> an<00:01:39.390> application<00:01:39.960> is

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
theory if for example an application is

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.679 
theory if for example an application is
using<00:01:40.259> 10%<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.790> RAM<00:01:41.970> when<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.479> terminate

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
using 10% of the RAM when you terminate

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.649 
using 10% of the RAM when you terminate
it<00:01:43.110> 10%<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.159> RAM<00:01:44.310> will<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.610> free<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.540> that's

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
it 10% of the RAM will be free so that's

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.359 
it 10% of the RAM will be free so that's
something<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> look<00:01:47.220> at

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
something that you can have a look at

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.219 
something that you can have a look at
and<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.610> course<00:01:47.909> stats<00:01:48.270> types<00:01:48.600> gives<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and of course stats types gives you the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.350 
and of course stats types gives you the
ability<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.649> look<00:01:49.799> at<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.640> applications<00:01:51.240> that

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
ability to look at the applications that

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.929 
ability to look at the applications that
run<00:01:51.570> are<00:01:51.869> run<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.040> background<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
run are run in the background the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.209 
run are run in the background the
foreground<00:01:54.390> or<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.049> catch<00:01:55.259> ones<00:01:55.649> that

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
foreground or just to catch ones that

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.020 
foreground or just to catch ones that
are<00:01:56.630> waiting<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.439> access<00:01:58.950> them<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.969> if

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
are waiting for you to access them so if

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.149

for example Google Play services now the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
for stop is disabled here so you can't

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.460 
for stop is disabled here so you can't
actually<00:02:08.629> terminate<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:10.020> particular

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
actually terminate this particular

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.010 
actually terminate this particular
process<00:02:11.220> however<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.120> can<00:02:12.300> see<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.810> average

Ram

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.760 
Ram
it<00:02:14.160> uses<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.090> maximum<00:02:15.540> ram<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.260> has<00:02:16.470> used

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
it uses and the maximum ram it has used

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.620 
it uses and the maximum ram it has used
and<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.460> running<00:02:17.700> time<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.330> it's<00:02:18.480> on

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
and the running time so it's on

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.680 
and the running time so it's on
virtually<00:02:19.080> all<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.410> time<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:21.210> background

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
virtually all the time in the background

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.840 
virtually all the time in the background
and<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.770> basically<00:02:22.890> gives<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.550> all<00:02:23.640> these

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
and it basically gives you all these

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.900 
and it basically gives you all these
options<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.450> what<00:02:24.990> it<00:02:25.140> uses<00:02:25.650> what<00:02:26.190> services<00:02:26.790> it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
options of what it uses what services it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.180 
options of what it uses what services it
uses<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:27.900> was<00:02:28.140> just<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.440> quick<00:02:28.590> look<00:02:28.950> at

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
uses so that was just a quick look at

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.610 
uses so that was just a quick look at
how<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.730> can<00:02:30.030> check<00:02:30.300> what<00:02:30.510> applications<00:02:31.230> use

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
how you can check what applications use

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.070 
how you can check what applications use
how<00:02:32.220> much<00:02:32.460> of<00:02:32.670> your<00:02:32.970> RAM<00:02:33.240> thanks<00:02:33.720> for<00:02:33.810> watching

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
how much of your RAM thanks for watching

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.200 
how much of your RAM thanks for watching
guys
