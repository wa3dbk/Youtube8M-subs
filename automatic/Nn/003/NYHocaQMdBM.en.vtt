is for one to four ounces I would say

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.600 
is for one to four ounces I would say
the<00:01:28.149> sweet<00:01:28.420> spots<00:01:28.750> probably<00:01:29.590> in<00:01:29.890> two<00:01:30.429> to<00:01:30.580> three

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
ounce range but you could definitely get

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.880 
ounce range but you could definitely get
animal<00:01:33.100> like<00:01:33.520> about<00:01:33.789> an<00:01:33.939> ounce<00:01:34.119> for<00:01:34.539> a<00:01:34.890> dial

little bit over three ounces on a bigger
plug<00:01:39.549> this<00:01:40.479> rod<00:01:40.750> would<00:01:40.899> handle<00:01:41.229> it<00:01:41.350> easily<00:01:43.319> in

addition<00:01:44.679> to<00:01:44.830> how<00:01:45.130> well<00:01:45.399> it<00:01:45.610> casts<00:01:46.149> and<00:01:46.330> just

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
addition to how well it casts and just

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.930 
addition to how well it casts and just
how<00:01:46.899> comfortable<00:01:47.380> it<00:01:47.500> was<00:01:47.649> I<00:01:48.220> was<00:01:48.759> real

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
how comfortable it was I was real

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.760 
how comfortable it was I was real
impressed<00:01:49.240> with<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:50.080> fact<00:01:50.289> that<00:01:50.530> for<00:01:50.740> a

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
impressed with the fact that for a

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.800 
impressed with the fact that for a
two-piece<00:01:51.250> rod<00:01:51.580> you<00:01:52.299> forget<00:01:52.630> it's<00:01:52.750> a

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
two-piece rod you forget it's a

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.100 
two-piece rod you forget it's a
two-piece<00:01:53.200> right<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:54.659> part<00:01:55.659> where<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:55.929> comes

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
two-piece right the part where it comes

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.960 
two-piece right the part where it comes
apart<00:01:56.500> that's<00:01:56.770> called<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.130> ferrule<00:01:57.549> that's

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
apart that's called the ferrule that's

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
apart that's called the ferrule that's
down<00:01:58.450> closer<00:01:58.959> to<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.319> handle<00:01:59.649> so<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.750> rod

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
down closer to the handle so the rod

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.539 
down closer to the handle so the rod
bends<00:02:02.289> and<00:02:02.439> I<00:02:02.500> think<00:02:02.649> you<00:02:02.709> could<00:02:02.860> see<00:02:03.069> that<00:02:03.220> on

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
bends and I think you could see that on

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.169 
bends and I think you could see that on
the<00:02:03.640> video<00:02:03.939> it's<00:02:04.179> a<00:02:04.420> nice<00:02:04.689> uniform<00:02:05.049> then<00:02:05.560> so

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
the video it's a nice uniform then so

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.460 
the video it's a nice uniform then so
it's<00:02:07.179> got<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.420> convenience<00:02:07.899> of<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.080> two-piece

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
it's got the convenience of a two-piece

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.749 
it's got the convenience of a two-piece
rod<00:02:08.739> but<00:02:08.950> it<00:02:09.039> really<00:02:09.190> fishes<00:02:09.580> like<00:02:09.729> a

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
rod but it really fishes like a

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.280 
rod but it really fishes like a
one-piece<00:02:10.209> rod<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.970> rod<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.269> rated<00:02:13.540> for<00:02:13.690> 15<00:02:14.140> to

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
one-piece rod the rod is rated for 15 to

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.410 
one-piece rod the rod is rated for 15 to
30<00:02:14.320> pound<00:02:14.799> test<00:02:14.890> line<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.519> would<00:02:15.850> definitely<00:02:16.329> be

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
30 pound test line I would definitely be

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.180 
30 pound test line I would definitely be
