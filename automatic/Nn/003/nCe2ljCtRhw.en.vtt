00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.170
 hello dear iso friends here is the 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.750
 Cash and I welcome you to a new one 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.310
 elder scrolls online video and today 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.859
 Let's look at an addon again 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.900
 which I personally very interesting 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.090
 and above all very informative and 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.910
 you probably also needed us 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.870
 press rc for ours 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.019
 Characteristics or our 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.640
 attributes we can forgive yes we 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.250
 already see the addon here namely that 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.379
 addon soft cap info and we know it 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.000
 already if you have an attribute especially 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.290
 fast increases or especially many 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.269
 For example, purely investing points 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.540
 this endurance at a night blade 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:55.030
 then it is so often the attributes 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.799
 become orange or some 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.619
 starts and thus this no longer 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.729
 be leveled or increased slower 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:03.010
 be different 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.080
 The old and soft cap info makes you feel at home 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.840
 principle of one namely it indicates us 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.330
 what our soft cap is to where we go 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.100
 can increase whole until it starts yes 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.720
 to lose value we are 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.270
 for example, here I have six 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.160
 points with level 33 in magicka 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.610
 invests that means I have 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.250
 a total of 817 magica mainz often captures cap 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.260
 but only at 1245 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.000
 different in endurance regeneration 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.250
 this is already orange for me and that 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.350
 means as the info reveals it is a 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.000
 attribute greatly improved so much 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.830
 It gets more and more difficult through more 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.510
 increase additional benefits 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.400
 maybe you should recognize yours 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.020
 change your equipment or your skills 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.970
 and attributes reconsider one 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.260
 more uniform distribution more advantageous 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.690
 we could see here I have 54 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.479
 +2 of endurance regeneration the plus 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.670
 two is also from the addon and back 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.280
 we have a 52 stand it means 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.760
 mainz often cap is 52 but i am 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.950
 already at 54 and this red +2 means 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.840
 in principle, the loss or shows the 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.870
 loss I make I lose 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.629
 namely +2 endurance regeneration in the 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.520
 fight currently because I'm over the soft cap 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.800
 I personally find that one 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.180
 very interesting addon is there like that 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.890
 much better estimate 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.620
 how to assemble your equipment 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.299
 or even its attributes distribute that 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.500
 of course there are not only here 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.019
 above but also down here for 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.579
 weapon damage armor magic resistance 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.109
 magic show did not personally know 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.909
 For example, not that there is a software 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.459
 I found app for the weapon damage there 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.799
 personally very interesting and up 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.560
 every case worth knowing the whole in the 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.370
 whole addon is very small very fast 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.260
 downloaded 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.629
 in our article you will find the exact 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.909
 description what you do with it all 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.139
 I can install it like this 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:51.150
 I wish you a nice day until 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.150
 See you next time your cover
