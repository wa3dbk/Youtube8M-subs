welcome<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.530> my<00:00:01.620> unboxing<00:00:01.829> and<00:00:02.220> first<00:00:02.399> look<00:00:02.639> at

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
welcome to my unboxing and first look at

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.490 
welcome to my unboxing and first look at
something<00:00:03.090> that<00:00:03.210> I<00:00:03.419> personally<00:00:03.780> feel<00:00:04.230> pretty

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
something that I personally feel pretty

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.660 
something that I personally feel pretty
strongly<00:00:04.830> about<00:00:05.100> if<00:00:05.250> you<00:00:05.339> guys<00:00:05.460> have<00:00:05.640> been

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
strongly about if you guys have been

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.789 
strongly about if you guys have been
watching<00:00:06.089> me<00:00:06.210> for<00:00:06.450> any<00:00:06.569> length<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.290> time<00:00:07.350> you

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
watching me for any length of time you

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.709 
watching me for any length of time you
probably<00:00:07.950> are<00:00:08.370> aware<00:00:08.490> already<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.599> I'm<00:00:09.690> a

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
probably are aware already that I'm a

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.509 
probably are aware already that I'm a
bit<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.230> silence<00:00:10.679> freak<00:00:10.920> when<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.190> comes<00:00:11.370> to

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
bit of a silence freak when it comes to

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.810 
bit of a silence freak when it comes to
computers<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.210> very<00:00:12.990> few<00:00:13.290> things<00:00:13.670> get<00:00:14.670> my

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
computers and very few things get my

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.080 
computers and very few things get my
motor<00:00:15.059> running<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.839> same<00:00:16.049> extent<00:00:16.470> that

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
motor running to the same extent that

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.330 
motor running to the same extent that
fanless<00:00:18.090> power<00:00:18.539> supplies<00:00:19.080> do<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.160> one

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
fanless power supplies do so this one

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.730 
fanless power supplies do so this one
right<00:00:20.550> here<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.029> from<00:00:21.270> Rosewell<00:00:21.930> which<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.710> a

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
right here is from Rosewell which is a

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.560 
right here is from Rosewell which is a
brand<00:00:23.039> you've<00:00:23.250> probably<00:00:23.490> never<00:00:24.000> seen<00:00:24.390> me

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
brand you've probably never seen me

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.109 
brand you've probably never seen me
feature<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.199> channel<00:00:25.470> before<00:00:26.119> but

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
feature on this channel before but

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.060 
feature on this channel before but
there's<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.869> first<00:00:27.900> time<00:00:28.170> for<00:00:28.320> everything

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
there's a first time for everything

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.150 
there's a first time for everything
and<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.730> silent<00:00:30.539> night<00:00:30.650> 500<00:00:31.650> watt<00:00:31.800> 80

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
and this is the silent night 500 watt 80

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.110 
and this is the silent night 500 watt 80
+<00:00:32.780> platinum<00:00:33.829> fanless<00:00:34.829> power<00:00:35.100> supply<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
+ platinum fanless power supply so the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.990 
+ platinum fanless power supply so the
idea<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.530> could<00:00:37.739> actually<00:00:37.770> power<00:00:38.670> a

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
idea is that you could actually power a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.200 
idea is that you could actually power a
gaming<00:00:39.719> grade<00:00:40.020> machine<00:00:40.640> with<00:00:41.640> even<00:00:41.940> something

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
the entire 500 watts of output so this

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.229 
the entire 500 watts of output so this
is<00:01:01.739> pretty<00:01:01.920> common<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.760> very<00:01:03.059> high

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
is pretty common to see on very high

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.969 
is pretty common to see on very high

platinum<00:01:05.369> because<00:01:05.460> most<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> time<00:01:06.390> they

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
platinum because most of the time they

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.710 
platinum because most of the time they
are<00:01:06.900> using<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.799> 12<00:01:08.130> volt<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.610> 5<00:01:08.939> volt<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.210> 3.3

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
are using a 12 volt to 5 volt and 3.3

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.320 
are using a 12 volt to 5 volt and 3.3

order<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.689> achieve<00:01:12.900> those<00:01:13.140> other<00:01:13.439> rails<00:01:13.799> so

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
order to achieve those other rails so

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.039 
order to achieve those other rails so
that's<00:01:14.640> why<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.880> 12<00:01:15.210> volt<00:01:15.360> rail<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.659> capable

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
that's why the 12 volt rail is capable

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.450 
that's why the 12 volt rail is capable
of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> entire<00:01:16.650> output<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.310> so

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
of the entire output of it so

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.800 
of the entire output of it so

achieve all of the safety ratings and
design<00:01:31.950> requirements<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.850> then<00:01:33.030> they<00:01:33.150> are

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
design requirements and then they are

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.580 
design requirements and then they are
bringing<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> market

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
bringing it to market

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.380 
bringing it to market

have<00:01:41.130> never<00:01:41.549> seen<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:43.500> silent<00:01:44.399> power<00:01:44.790> supply

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
have never seen on a silent power supply

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.200 
have never seen on a silent power supply
normally<00:01:46.320> you're<00:01:46.890> lucky<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.430> they<00:01:47.549> include<00:01:47.880> 2

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
normally you're lucky if they include 2

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.840 
normally you're lucky if they include 2
PCIe<00:01:48.689> connectors<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.829> inside<00:01:50.220> here<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.579> find<00:01:50.700> a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
PCIe connectors so inside here we find a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.660 
PCIe connectors so inside here we find a
user's<00:01:51.149> manual<00:01:51.710> which<00:01:52.710> basically<00:01:53.130> says<00:01:53.490> all

the<00:01:53.759> stuff<00:01:53.970> that's<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.329> packaging

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
the stuff that's on the packaging

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.789 
the stuff that's on the packaging
already<00:01:55.250> nice<00:01:56.719> closed<00:01:57.719> cell<00:01:57.990> foam<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.770> you

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
already nice closed cell foam so you

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.050 
already nice closed cell foam so you
don't<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.520> worry<00:01:59.670> about<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.969> getting

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
don't have to worry about it getting

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
a 500 watt power supply so I don't think

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.399 
a 500 watt power supply so I don't think
it's<00:02:17.780> an<00:02:17.930> issue<00:02:18.400> then<00:02:19.400> we<00:02:19.999> have<00:02:20.299> Z<00:02:21.170> power

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
it's an issue then we have Z power

it's an issue then we have Z power

gold<00:02:35.780> Evo<00:02:36.469> I<00:02:36.769> believe<00:02:37.129> it's<00:02:37.340> called<00:02:37.549> from

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
gold Evo I believe it's called from

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.690 
gold Evo I believe it's called from
Silverstone<00:02:38.689> with<00:02:39.349> that<00:02:39.709> sort<00:02:40.069> of<00:02:40.129> textured

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
Silverstone with that sort of textured

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.879 
Silverstone with that sort of textured
black<00:02:40.969> finish<00:02:41.120> not<00:02:42.049> only<00:02:42.290> does<00:02:42.439> it<00:02:42.469> make<00:02:42.680> it

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:42.889 
black finish not only does it make it

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.309 
black finish not only does it make it
look<00:02:43.219> outstanding<00:02:43.969> but<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.269> also<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.989> much

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
look outstanding but it also is much

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.009 
look outstanding but it also is much
more<00:02:45.530> durable<00:02:45.980> than<00:02:46.669> a<00:02:47.090> than<00:02:47.629> a<00:02:47.659> flatter

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
more durable than a than a flatter

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.330 
more durable than a than a flatter
finish<00:02:48.349> so<00:02:48.439> what<00:02:48.590> they've<00:02:48.709> done<00:02:48.739> is<00:02:48.889> in<00:02:49.129> order

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
finish so what they've done is in order

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.949 
finish so what they've done is in order
to<00:02:49.430> make<00:02:49.579> keep<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.879> from<00:02:50.000> just<00:02:50.209> being<00:02:50.389> shiny

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
to make keep it from just being shiny

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.349 
to make keep it from just being shiny
they've<00:02:51.560> textured<00:02:52.159> it<00:02:52.310> but<00:02:52.639> it's<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.909> glossy

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
they've textured it but it's a glossy

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.839 
they've textured it but it's a glossy
paint<00:02:53.659> so<00:02:54.260> glossy<00:02:54.949> paints<00:02:55.280> are<00:02:55.400> inherently

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
paint so glossy paints are inherently

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.819 
paint so glossy paints are inherently
more<00:02:56.150> durable<00:02:56.659> than<00:02:56.840> flat<00:02:57.169> paints<00:02:57.530> because

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
more durable than flat paints because

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.379 
more durable than flat paints because
they<00:02:57.980> have<00:02:58.099> more<00:02:58.310> resin<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:58.879> less<00:02:59.060> of

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
they have more resin and less of

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:00.990 
they have more resin and less of
whatever<00:02:59.659> the<00:02:59.870> other<00:02:59.989> things<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:00.409> paint<00:03:00.620> are

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
whatever the other things in paint are

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.149 
whatever the other things in paint are
but<00:03:02.000> what<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.329> means<00:03:02.569> is<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:03.379> will<00:03:03.620> be<00:03:03.799> it'll

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
but what that means is it will be it'll

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.860 
but what that means is it will be it'll
be<00:03:04.280> more<00:03:04.699> scratch<00:03:04.969> resistant<00:03:05.540> while<00:03:05.689> also

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
be more scratch resistant while also

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.479 
be more scratch resistant while also
just<00:03:06.230> looking<00:03:06.560> awesome<00:03:06.769> so<00:03:07.129> there<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:07.340> go

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
just looking awesome so there you go

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.610 
just looking awesome so there you go
you've<00:03:08.120> got<00:03:08.299> lots<00:03:08.659> of<00:03:08.870> ventilation<00:03:09.079> now

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
you've got lots of ventilation now

be installed one way and one way one way
only<00:03:14.239> so<00:03:15.049> right<00:03:15.799> here<00:03:16.010> you've<00:03:16.159> got

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
only so right here you've got

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.640 
only so right here you've got
ventilation<00:03:17.269> holes<00:03:17.480> Oliver<00:03:18.139> on<00:03:18.229> the<00:03:18.319> outside

ventilation holes Oliver on the outside

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.159 
ventilation holes Oliver on the outside
and<00:03:18.889> then<00:03:19.310> here<00:03:19.669> you've<00:03:20.060> got<00:03:20.389> what<00:03:20.750> is<00:03:20.930> a

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
and then here you've got what is a

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.039 
and then here you've got what is a
heatsink<00:03:21.739> so<00:03:22.280> presumably<00:03:22.729> the<00:03:23.629> internal

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
heatsink so presumably the internal

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.479 
heatsink so presumably the internal
components<00:03:24.530> are<00:03:24.620> connected<00:03:25.009> to<00:03:25.129> that<00:03:25.250> somehow

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
components are connected to that somehow

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.099 
components are connected to that somehow
I<00:03:25.849> actually<00:03:26.090> can't<00:03:26.479> see<00:03:26.629> how<00:03:26.750> they've<00:03:26.900> done<00:03:26.930> it

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
I actually can't see how they've done it

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.589 
I actually can't see how they've done it
yes<00:03:27.979> there<00:03:28.220> we<00:03:28.310> go<00:03:28.430> so<00:03:28.939> there<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.299> have<00:03:29.329> heat

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
yes there we go so there you have heat

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.819 
yes there we go so there you have heat
sinks<00:03:29.840> coming<00:03:30.079> up<00:03:30.169> from<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.379> bottom<00:03:30.530> up<00:03:30.799> to

the<00:03:30.949> heatsink<00:03:31.310> on<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.489> top<00:03:31.669> and<00:03:31.819> then<00:03:32.209> it<00:03:32.329> also

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:32.479 
the heatsink on the top and then it also

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.409 
the heatsink on the top and then it also
acts<00:03:32.840> as<00:03:33.109> a<00:03:33.199> passive<00:03:33.919> exhaust<00:03:34.459> so<00:03:34.909> you<00:03:35.090> can<00:03:35.239> see

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
acts as a passive exhaust so you can see

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.719 
acts as a passive exhaust so you can see
that<00:03:35.599> so<00:03:36.019> some<00:03:36.530> of<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.739> air<00:03:36.889> is<00:03:37.129> going<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.459> be

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:37.729 
that so some of the air is going to be

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.240 
that so some of the air is going to be
just<00:03:37.970> passively<00:03:38.739> wafted<00:03:39.739> up<00:03:39.829> through<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.129> top

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
just passively wafted up through the top

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.129 
just passively wafted up through the top
of<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.489> power<00:03:40.699> supply<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.329> that'll<00:03:41.840> be<00:03:41.930> in

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
of the power supply and that'll be in

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.460 
of the power supply and that'll be in
taked<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.799> take<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.579> in<00:03:43.729> along<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:44.509> sides<00:03:44.840> now

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
taked to take it in along the sides now

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.140 
taked to take it in along the sides now
in<00:03:45.590> terms<00:03:45.739> of<00:03:45.919> pre-attached<00:03:46.489> connectors

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
in terms of pre-attached connectors

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.719 
in terms of pre-attached connectors
we've<00:03:47.750> got<00:03:48.049> a<00:03:48.409> fairly<00:03:48.979> basic<00:03:49.099> complement<00:03:49.669> so

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:49.729 
we've got a fairly basic complement so

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:50.830 
we've got a fairly basic complement so
this<00:03:49.849> is<00:03:49.970> what<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.150> would<00:03:50.329> normally<00:03:50.449> call<00:03:50.810> a

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
this is what I would normally call a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.050 
this is what I would normally call a
semi<00:03:51.229> modular<00:03:51.709> power<00:03:51.859> supply<00:03:52.129> where<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:52.879> has

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
semi modular power supply where it has

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.360 
semi modular power supply where it has
your<00:03:53.419> basic<00:03:53.840> stuff<00:03:54.500> that<00:03:54.829> you'll<00:03:55.009> probably

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
your basic stuff that you'll probably

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.170 
your basic stuff that you'll probably
need<00:03:56.139> 99%<00:03:57.139> of<00:03:57.229> the<00:03:57.349> time<00:03:57.560> pre-attached<00:03:58.519> so

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
need 99% of the time pre-attached so

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.809 
need 99% of the time pre-attached so
there's<00:03:59.389> your<00:03:59.509> 24<00:03:59.959> pin<00:04:00.139> connector<00:04:00.819> there's

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
there's your 24 pin connector there's

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.339 
there's your 24 pin connector there's
your<00:04:02.030> 4<00:04:02.209> plus<00:04:02.419> 4<00:04:02.659> and<00:04:02.959> then<00:04:03.500> there<00:04:03.889> are<00:04:04.040> 2<00:04:05.349> 6

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
your 4 plus 4 and then there are 2 6

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.530 
your 4 plus 4 and then there are 2 6
plus<00:04:06.590> 2's<00:04:06.889> so<00:04:07.430> that'll<00:04:07.699> power<00:04:07.849> one<00:04:08.120> graphics

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
plus 2's so that'll power one graphics

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.479 
plus 2's so that'll power one graphics
card<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:08.930> then<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.439> rest<00:04:09.620> of<00:04:09.799> it<00:04:09.919> is<00:04:10.069> all<00:04:10.280> done

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
card and then the rest of it is all done

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.909 
card and then the rest of it is all done
with<00:04:10.729> modular<00:04:11.209> cables<00:04:11.780> so<00:04:12.379> they<00:04:12.530> include<00:04:12.859> a

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
with modular cables so they include a

nice little ROS will pack that has

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.800 
nice little ROS will pack that has
everything<00:04:16.310> else<00:04:16.579> you'll<00:04:16.849> need<00:04:17.209> they're<00:04:17.630> not

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
everything else you'll need they're not

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.180 
everything else you'll need they're not
expecting<00:04:18.259> you<00:04:18.349> to<00:04:18.380> hook<00:04:18.590> up<00:04:18.739> a<00:04:18.829> bajillion

expecting you to hook up a bajillion

expecting you to hook up a bajillion
things<00:04:19.639> to<00:04:19.820> this<00:04:19.940> so<00:04:20.180> they<00:04:20.269> only<00:04:20.449> include

I<00:04:21.169> would<00:04:21.590> have<00:04:21.680> liked<00:04:21.919> to<00:04:22.039> see<00:04:22.279> two<00:04:22.610> SATA

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909 
I would have liked to see two SATA

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.719 
I would have liked to see two SATA
harnesses<00:04:23.479> and<00:04:23.719> oh<00:04:24.560> no<00:04:24.620> this<00:04:25.159> is<00:04:25.279> a<00:04:25.310> mixed<00:04:25.610> one

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
harnesses and oh no this is a mixed one

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.190 
harnesses and oh no this is a mixed one
ok<00:04:26.060> that's<00:04:26.240> not<00:04:26.360> so<00:04:26.570> bad

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
ok that's not so bad

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.170 
ok that's not so bad
oh<00:04:27.260> okay<00:04:28.070> that's<00:04:28.160> kind<00:04:28.340> of<00:04:28.370> clever<00:04:28.520> okay<00:04:29.120> so

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
oh okay that's kind of clever okay so

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.750 
oh okay that's kind of clever okay so
they've<00:04:29.450> got<00:04:29.690> a<00:04:29.960> three<00:04:30.740> molex<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.340> one<00:04:31.460> floppy

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
they've got a three molex and one floppy

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.260 
they've got a three molex and one floppy
connector<00:04:32.270> one<00:04:32.560> they<00:04:33.560> have<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:34.100> two<00:04:34.580> SATA<00:04:34.910> and

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
connector one they have a two SATA and

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.570 
connector one they have a two SATA and
two<00:04:35.720> molex<00:04:36.200> connector<00:04:36.650> one<00:04:36.800> so<00:04:37.190> this<00:04:37.340> would<00:04:37.460> be

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
two molex connector one so this would be

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.890 
two molex connector one so this would be
really<00:04:37.730> useful<00:04:38.150> if<00:04:38.240> you<00:04:38.360> have<00:04:38.540> a<00:04:38.570> case<00:04:38.870> that

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
really useful if you have a case that

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.750 
really useful if you have a case that
has<00:04:39.290> like<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.680> basement<00:04:39.950> like<00:04:40.340> something<00:04:40.640> like

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
has like a basement like something like

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.210 
has like a basement like something like
a<00:04:40.790> TJ<00:04:41.180> oh<00:04:41.210> seven<00:04:41.630> where<00:04:42.290> you<00:04:42.740> want<00:04:42.950> to<00:04:43.070> have

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
a TJ oh seven where you want to have

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.920 
a TJ oh seven where you want to have
sort<00:04:43.580> of<00:04:43.610> a<00:04:43.700> couple<00:04:43.970> drives<00:04:44.210> down<00:04:44.420> there<00:04:44.720> maybe

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
sort of a couple drives down there maybe

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.480 
sort of a couple drives down there maybe
a<00:04:45.050> water<00:04:45.290> cooling<00:04:45.680> pump<00:04:45.860> or<00:04:46.010> whatever<00:04:46.250> else<00:04:46.430> so

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
a water cooling pump or whatever else so

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.650 
a water cooling pump or whatever else so
you're<00:04:46.580> gonna<00:04:46.700> have<00:04:46.850> a<00:04:46.880> mixture<00:04:47.240> of<00:04:47.360> what's

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
you're gonna have a mixture of what's

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.200 
you're gonna have a mixture of what's
connected<00:04:48.050> to<00:04:48.170> it<00:04:48.290> and<00:04:48.440> then<00:04:48.950> finally<00:04:49.220> a<00:04:49.580> quad

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
connected to it and then finally a quad

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.420 
connected to it and then finally a quad
SATA<00:04:50.750> harness<00:04:51.350> that<00:04:51.560> you<00:04:51.650> can<00:04:51.800> run<00:04:52.010> to<00:04:52.220> your

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
SATA harness that you can run to your

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
drive cage or wherever else that you're

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.120 
drive cage or wherever else that you're
actually<00:04:54.020> gonna<00:04:54.230> plug<00:04:54.500> in<00:04:54.590> a<00:04:54.650> bunch<00:04:54.830> of<00:04:54.890> drives

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
actually gonna plug in a bunch of drives

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.190 
actually gonna plug in a bunch of drives
and<00:04:55.400> last<00:04:55.910> but<00:04:56.060> not<00:04:56.210> least<00:04:56.480> you've<00:04:56.990> got

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
and last but not least you've got

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.430 
and last but not least you've got
another<00:04:57.740> dual<00:04:58.460> six<00:04:59.060> plus<00:04:59.330> two<00:04:59.600> pin<00:04:59.870> connector

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
another dual six plus two pin connector

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.370 
another dual six plus two pin connector
so<00:05:00.650> that<00:05:00.830> will<00:05:01.310> take<00:05:01.490> up<00:05:01.730> all<00:05:01.880> four<00:05:02.420> of<00:05:02.630> the
