you see the cards and how fast they go
through<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.010> scanner<00:00:26.599> having<00:00:27.599> both<00:00:27.779> sides

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
through the scanner having both sides

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.040 
through the scanner having both sides
scan<00:00:28.470> because<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:29.849> my<00:00:30.269> students<00:00:30.810> in

11 12 13 14 and then 15 so here I
created<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.710> folder<00:02:00.920> video<00:02:01.520> that<00:02:02.000> has<00:02:02.300> all<00:02:03.200> the

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
created a folder video that has all the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.290 
created a folder video that has all the
kind<00:02:03.650> of<00:02:03.740> cards<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.190> were<00:02:04.370> going<00:02:04.670> in<00:02:04.790> here<00:02:05.090> so
