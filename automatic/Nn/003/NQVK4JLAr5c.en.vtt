00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.800
 Welcome to a tour in your body when you are under stress. 

00:00:05.825 --> 00:00:07.825
 When under stress, your body reacts instantly. 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.050
 There are 12 dramatic changes in it. 

00:00:13.975 --> 00:00:17.575
 Your heart - every time in a state of stress 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.900
 your heart beats faster, the load on the heart muscle is great. 

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:25.925
 Blood pressure rises, 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.050
 because the heart is pumping extra blood, oxygen and sugars to the muscles, 

00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:37.175
 to provide energy to the body. Remember that under stress the processes in your body are being activated as a real battle. 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.000
 Your body adjusts to physical survival - no matter that you are not under a real physical threat, 

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:47.025
 but under emotional - the stress and stress of our breathless daily life. 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.150
 Blood pressure continues to rise, 

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:55.975
 because your body constricts blood vessels to prevent fatal loss of blood in the event of an injury. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 The blood thickens and forms clots in the circulatory system, 

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:05.925
 which obstruct the free circulation of blood in the body. 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.050
 This is another way your body protects you in the event of an injury. 

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:16.975
 In a nutshell, your bloodstream reacts as if you were really physically injured. 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.800
 The digestive system - stress dramatically affects digestion. 

00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:26.425
 Stress-stricken body slows down your functions 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.750
 of all systems that do not have to react in a state of threat to the organism. 

00:01:30.775 --> 00:01:35.375
 At this point, your body is not interested in eating the food. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.300
 Only interested in preserving life, so withdraws blood from the digestive system 

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:42.325
 as secondary in importance at the time of survival. 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.350
 This may result in the accumulation of excess weight, 

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:47.375
 regardless of our efforts to eat properly and maintain physical activity. 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400
 So even if you eat properly, your body is unable 

00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:57.725
 to digest the optimally accepted food because the digestive system is delayed. 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.650
 This can also lead to increased acidity in the stomach. 

00:02:01.175 --> 00:02:04.975
 Not surprisingly, the televisions are full of ads 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 of medicines for stomach problems. 

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:14.725
 It is extremely important to be able to manage the stress so that we can 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.050
 your digestive system properly processes the nutrients. 

00:02:19.075 --> 00:02:23.175
 Otherwise, the food you eat just stays and gets stuck in the body until you 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.000
 you continue to take food, further exacerbating the digestive system. 

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:35.925
 Your immune system - like the digestive, the immune system is also suppressed. 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.850
 Under stress, your body is less committed to fighting disease. 

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:44.075
 His main work is focused on survival in the momentary threat he perceives and counts as a stronger signal, you require a reaction. 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.200
 This makes us much more susceptible to various diseases 

00:02:48.225 --> 00:02:51.725
 and we have a greatly reduced resource to fight them. 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.750
 When we are worried or stressed by something, we do not accidentally use the phrase "I will get sick!" 

00:02:57.775 --> 00:03:01.175
 Yes, such a situation can really get you sick. 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:10.300
 Your breathing - When under stress, your breathing changes from calm, slow and deeply diaphragm breathing 

00:03:10.325 --> 00:03:12.825
 to a quick, shallow breast breath. 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.150
 This burden your lungs, leads to hyperventilation. 

00:03:17.175 --> 00:03:21.175
 Feeling anxious and panic attacks also lead to shallow breathing. 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.400
 In challenging moments, advise the other "Breathe deep!" 

00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:30.025
 Now you know - this is because we breathe when we breathe 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.150
 and deprive the body of the amount of oxygen it needs to be in good shape. 

00:03:36.075 --> 00:03:46.075
 Sweating in English has the expression "Do not sweat for small things!" - refers to people who worry about the smallest thing. 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.600
 In stress we can sweat profusely. 

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:51.025
 Nervous and worrying people sweat more often. 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.050
 Even minor momentary annoyance is able to make us sweat. 

00:03:55.075 --> 00:03:57.675
 Your body sweats to cool the body. 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.100
 Under stress you are demanding extraordinary activity from your body 

00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:08.125
 And our body responds with sweat - to protect us from overheating, which can cause serious internal damage. 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.450
 Your muscles - your muscles invade extra blood to give them more strength. 

00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:19.875
 When this happens, we strain our muscles to a limit for which they are not trained. 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.500
 This can lead to injuries, prolonged exhaustion and pain. 

00:04:24.525 --> 00:04:29.825
 We know that the best way to have strong muscles is to train them regularly, 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.450
 not by pumping extra blood to the muscles and overloading them with stress. 

00:04:33.475 --> 00:04:39.175
 And blood sugar - blood sugar levels rise to deliver extra energy to your body. 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.600
 Not every organism is able to function adequately with increased blood sugar. 

00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:46.225
 And this leads to serious health problems. 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:54.050
 Hormones Aging - Your body reduces the production of anti-aging hormones. 

00:04:54.075 --> 00:04:56.975
 As a result, we get older. 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.700
 Your reproductive system and sex hormones - if your reproductive system 

00:05:03.725 --> 00:05:08.525
 is suppressed and produces fewer sex hormones, reduces libido. 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.750
 Stress directly affects the hormones responsible for sexual arousal. 

00:05:12.775 --> 00:05:17.775
 Stress hormones - in a state of stress your body produces a lot of increased values 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.900
 of the stress hormones - adrenaline and noradrenaline. They signal our body that it is under threat. 

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:29.225
 This causes anxiety and fear, resulting in a lack of concentration. 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.150
 These same hormones increase blood pressure, sweat and suppress the digestive system. 

00:05:35.175 --> 00:05:39.975
 At the same time they activate those systems in our body that can inject the extraordinary forces of the body to cope with the critical situation. 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Your body also produces cortisol - the main stress hormone. 

00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:52.125
 Cortisol increases blood sugar, can cause fat in the abdomen 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.150
 and is directly responsible for delaying digestion, declining immunity, 

00:05:55.175 --> 00:06:00.875
 problems in the reproductive system and speeds up the aging process.
