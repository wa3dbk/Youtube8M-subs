close enough to where you can click X

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.859 
close enough to where you can click X
rather<00:01:27.320> than<00:01:27.470> walk<00:01:28.070> up<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.460> it

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:41.359

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.199 

your<00:02:13.990> shield<00:02:14.260> depletes<00:02:14.740> really<00:02:15.069> fast<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.580> want

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
your shield depletes really fast I want

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.160 
your shield depletes really fast I want
to<00:02:16.360> recommend<00:02:17.170> doing<00:02:17.470> this<00:02:17.709> but<00:02:18.840> I'm<00:02:19.840> not<00:02:19.900> that

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
to recommend doing this but I'm not that

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:43.410

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
I mean you could always walk around the

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.120 
I mean you could always walk around the
map<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.260> way<00:02:47.380> we<00:02:47.500> came<00:02:47.680> back<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.040> the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
beginning and come across the bridges

00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:12.260 
beginning and come across the bridges
over<00:02:51.250> there

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270
