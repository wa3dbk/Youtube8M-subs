of each one is separate and works very
well<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.959> if<00:03:46.109> we<00:03:46.199> turn<00:03:46.319> it<00:03:46.470> over<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:47.459> steering

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
well and if we turn it over the steering

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.089 
well and if we turn it over the steering
is<00:03:48.389> excellent<00:03:48.810> -<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.349> you<00:03:49.409> can<00:03:49.530> see<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:49.859> the

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
is excellent - and you can see that the

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.069 
is excellent - and you can see that the
rear<00:03:50.310> four<00:03:50.579> axles<00:03:51.209> are<00:03:51.359> linked<00:03:51.509> together<00:03:51.659> and

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
rear four axles are linked together and

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.439 
rear four axles are linked together and
do<00:03:52.769> stay<00:03:53.040> in<00:03:53.069> a<00:03:53.250> proportional<00:03:53.729> manner<00:03:53.970> and

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
do stay in a proportional manner and

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.860 
do stay in a proportional manner and
also<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.870> first<00:03:55.109> axle<00:03:55.560> can<00:03:56.129> also<00:03:56.280> steer<00:03:56.759> at<00:03:57.180> to

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
also the first axle can also steer at to

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.409 
also the first axle can also steer at to
a<00:03:57.900> small<00:03:58.169> amount<00:03:58.409> and<00:03:59.180> therefore<00:04:00.180> when<00:04:00.299> you've

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
a small amount and therefore when you've

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.270 
a small amount and therefore when you've
set<00:04:00.629> the<00:04:00.720> steering<00:04:01.139> and<00:04:01.319> push<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.680> trailer<00:04:02.099> it

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
set the steering and push the trailer it

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.670 
set the steering and push the trailer it
really<00:04:02.489> does<00:04:02.669> track<00:04:03.049> the<00:04:04.049> steering<00:04:04.409> in<00:04:04.590> an

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
really does track the steering in an

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.580 
really does track the steering in an
excellent<00:04:04.979> way<00:04:05.159> so<00:04:06.120> that's<00:04:06.359> been<00:04:06.780> engineered

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
excellent way so that's been engineered

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.890 
excellent way so that's been engineered
and<00:04:07.769> implemented<00:04:08.400> really<00:04:09.329> well<00:04:09.509> there's

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
and implemented really well there's

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.589 
and implemented really well there's
another<00:04:10.139> feature<00:04:10.349> on<00:04:10.849> actual<00:04:11.849> one<00:04:12.030> of<00:04:12.299> the

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
trailer which is that you can actually

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.210 
trailer which is that you can actually
lock<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.449> out<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:16.019> service<00:04:16.289> and<00:04:16.709> there's<00:04:17.190> a

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
lock it out of service and there's a

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.279 
lock it out of service and there's a
tiny<00:04:17.430> little<00:04:17.669> clip<00:04:18.000> just<00:04:18.599> on<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.989> axle

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
tiny little clip just on the axle

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.860

then

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
then

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.890 
then
axl<00:04:24.040> one<00:04:24.160> is<00:04:24.310> slightly<00:04:24.820> higher<00:04:25.240> than<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.690> rest

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
axl one is slightly higher than the rest

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.050 
axl one is slightly higher than the rest
and<00:04:26.320> you<00:04:26.620> can<00:04:26.740> see<00:04:26.860> that<00:04:27.010> when<00:04:27.580> you<00:04:27.610> roll<00:04:27.850> it

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
and you can see that when you roll it

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.360 
and you can see that when you roll it
actually<00:04:28.570> one<00:04:28.690> doesn't<00:04:28.990> move<00:04:29.370> another

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
actually one doesn't move another

unscrew<00:04:37.000> them<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.360> when<00:04:37.480> you<00:04:37.570> do<00:04:37.720> that<00:04:37.920> you

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
unscrew them and when you do that you

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.550 
unscrew them and when you do that you
are<00:04:38.950> left<00:04:39.250> with<00:04:39.340> a<00:04:39.460> smooth<00:04:39.790> cylinder<00:04:40.560> which

are left with a smooth cylinder which
looks<00:04:41.770> good<00:04:42.040> rather<00:04:42.670> than<00:04:42.820> a<00:04:43.060> screw<00:04:43.600> thread

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900

and they extend far enough to be able to
support<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.650> trailer<00:04:48.040> and<00:04:48.250> there's<00:04:48.940> another

them to to do both sides of the model

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.960 
them to to do both sides of the model
and<00:05:19.180> complete<00:05:19.540> it<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:20.620> fit<00:05:20.980> of<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.580> posts

into<00:05:22.690> the<00:05:22.810> deck<00:05:22.990> is<00:05:23.140> pretty<00:05:23.350> good<00:05:23.590> these<00:05:23.800> days

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
into the deck is pretty good these days

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.650 
into the deck is pretty good these days
and<00:05:24.460> so<00:05:24.580> they<00:05:24.670> don't<00:05:24.850> wave<00:05:25.000> about<00:05:25.240> too<00:05:25.450> much

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
and so they don't wave about too much

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:36.020 
and so they don't wave about too much
and<00:05:26.010> look<00:05:27.010> quite<00:05:27.190> effective<00:05:27.580> when<00:05:27.730> they're<00:05:27.880> in

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.490 

the<00:05:37.030> last<00:05:37.240> thing<00:05:37.390> to<00:05:37.510> do<00:05:37.630> is<00:05:37.870> to<00:05:38.050> join<00:05:38.230> the

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
the last thing to do is to join the

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.830 
the last thing to do is to join the
tractor<00:05:39.010> and<00:05:39.160> the<00:05:39.220> trailer<00:05:39.340> and<00:05:39.880> the<00:05:40.390> kingpin

tractor and the trailer and the kingpin

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.570 
tractor and the trailer and the kingpin
on<00:05:40.960> the<00:05:41.080> trailer<00:05:41.320> just<00:05:41.560> clips<00:05:42.010> into<00:05:42.190> place

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
on the trailer just clips into place

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.090 
on the trailer just clips into place
on<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:43.270> fifth<00:05:43.810> wheel<00:05:43.990> of<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:44.500> tractor<00:05:44.950> and

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
on the fifth wheel of the tractor and

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.250 
on the fifth wheel of the tractor and
then<00:05:45.700> they're<00:05:45.850> nicely<00:05:46.030> joined<00:05:46.420> and<00:05:46.690> can<00:05:46.900> work

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
then they're nicely joined and can work

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.910 
then they're nicely joined and can work
well<00:05:47.500> together

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
well together

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.950 
well together
and<00:05:48.490> if<00:05:48.580> you<00:05:48.670> want<00:05:48.850> you<00:05:48.970> could<00:05:49.060> try<00:05:49.270> and<00:05:49.420> join

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
and if you want you could try and join

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.110 
and if you want you could try and join
up<00:05:50.080> the<00:05:50.110> airlines<00:05:50.590> if<00:05:50.860> you're<00:05:51.010> got<00:05:51.880> a<00:05:51.910> bit<00:05:52.030> of

up the airlines if you're got a bit of

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.140 
up the airlines if you're got a bit of
skill<00:05:52.360> there<00:05:52.590> and<00:05:53.590> you<00:05:53.770> can<00:05:53.890> also<00:05:54.010> get<00:05:54.880> quite<00:05:55.120> a
