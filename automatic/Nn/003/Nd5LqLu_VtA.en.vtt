00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
this build since it's not gonna cause

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.190 
this build since it's not gonna cause
from<00:00:40.920> anything<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.460> can<00:00:42.180> really<00:00:42.360> not<00:00:42.930> have

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
from anything and can really not have

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.500 
from anything and can really not have
too<00:00:43.440> much<00:00:43.559> cooling<00:00:44.000> but<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.090> has<00:00:45.180> two<00:00:45.390> small

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
too much cooling but it has two small

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.830 
too much cooling but it has two small
fans<00:00:45.840> my<00:00:46.410> guess<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.920> 60<00:00:47.370> millimeter<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
fans my guess is 60 millimeter it's a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.590 
fans my guess is 60 millimeter it's a
metal<00:00:49.230> frame<00:00:49.950> feels<00:00:50.730> good<00:00:51.000> yeah<00:00:51.300> he's<00:00:51.449> got

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
metal frame feels good yeah he's got

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.439 
metal frame feels good yeah he's got
some<00:00:51.629> weight<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.850> it's<00:00:53.850> got<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> 3-pin

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
some weight to it it's got a 3-pin

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.069 
some weight to it it's got a 3-pin
connector<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.469> motherboard<00:00:57.079> there's

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
connector to the motherboard there's

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.799 
connector to the motherboard there's
also<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.920> mole<00:00:59.760> life's<00:00:59.940> adapter<00:01:00.390> which<00:01:00.629> i<00:01:00.750> will

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
also a mole life's adapter which i will

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.299 
also a mole life's adapter which i will
be<00:01:01.020> using<00:01:01.140> because<00:01:01.739> i<00:01:01.829> don't<00:01:01.980> want<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.219> throw

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
be using because i don't want to throw

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.960 
be using because i don't want to throw
it<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.550> one<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.820> run<00:01:02.969> at<00:01:03.149> full<00:01:03.449> power<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:05.610> just

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
it on one to run at full power so just

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.410

find<00:01:37.470> my<00:01:37.619> ram<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.100> i'll<00:01:38.390> put<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.770> there's

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
find my ram and i'll put it in there's

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.350 
find my ram and i'll put it in there's
one<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.979> my<00:01:42.470> one<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.500> my<00:01:43.560> dim

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.090 

if<00:01:47.360> we<00:01:47.510> put<00:01:47.689> it<00:01:47.780> in<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.020> first<00:01:48.350> slot<00:01:48.590> on<00:01:48.830> my

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
if we put it in the first slot on my

00:01:49.100 --> 00:02:09.609 
if we put it in the first slot on my
mother

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:17.690 

so<00:02:10.310> chin<00:02:10.849> up<00:02:10.970> little<00:02:11.030> moose

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.970 

once<00:02:18.700> it's<00:02:18.850> on<00:02:18.910> there<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.240> just<00:02:19.390> screw<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.780> in

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
once it's on there you just screw it in

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:39.600 
once it's on there you just screw it in
it'll<00:02:20.980> tighten

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.910 

and<00:02:40.610> there<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.270> just<00:02:41.960> like<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.530> holds

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
and there it is just like that it holds

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.620 
and there it is just like that it holds
in<00:02:43.100> a<00:02:43.130> good<00:02:43.490> i<00:02:43.520> wouldn't<00:02:44.090> call<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.300> perfectly

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
in a good i wouldn't call it perfectly

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.400 
in a good i wouldn't call it perfectly
sturdy<00:02:44.960> but<00:02:45.370> what<00:02:46.370> it<00:02:46.490> look<00:02:46.610> like<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:48.080> can<00:02:48.230> see

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
sturdy but what it look like you can see

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.740 
sturdy but what it look like you can see
the<00:02:48.530> clearance<00:02:48.920> from<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.280> cpu<00:02:50.000> socket<00:02:50.630> but

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
the clearance from the cpu socket but

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.600 
the clearance from the cpu socket but
also<00:02:51.470> note<00:02:51.770> that<00:02:51.800> i<00:02:51.980> can<00:02:52.130> slide<00:02:52.310> this<00:02:52.460> over

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
also note that i can slide this over

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.010 
also note that i can slide this over
some<00:02:52.880> more<00:02:53.090> quite<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.930> bit<00:02:53.990> actually<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.900> it's

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
some more quite a bit actually so it's

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.970 
some more quite a bit actually so it's
plenty<00:02:57.230> clearance<00:02:57.530> for<00:02:57.620> an<00:02:57.680> aftermarket

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
plenty clearance for an aftermarket

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:05.500 
plenty clearance for an aftermarket

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
cooler straight from this angle you can

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.080 
cooler straight from this angle you can
see<00:03:05.660> how<00:03:05.780> high<00:03:06.020> up<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.770> is<00:03:07.220> above<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.490> RAM<00:03:07.790> if

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
see how high up it is above the RAM if

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.740 
see how high up it is above the RAM if
you<00:03:08.690> have<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:08.900> big<00:03:09.970> heat<00:03:10.970> spreader<00:03:11.270> on<00:03:11.450> your<00:03:11.600> ram

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
you have a big heat spreader on your ram

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.000 
you have a big heat spreader on your ram
you<00:03:11.989> can<00:03:12.020> you<00:03:12.230> can<00:03:12.380> raise<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.650> up<00:03:12.709> higher<00:03:12.980> you

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
you can you can raise it up higher you

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.030 
you can you can raise it up higher you
can<00:03:13.340> raise<00:03:13.489> it<00:03:13.640> up<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:15.560> can<00:03:15.709> make<00:03:15.830> it<00:03:15.950> about

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
can raise it up to you can make it about

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.610 
can raise it up to you can make it about
that<00:03:16.100> far<00:03:16.430> off<00:03:16.459> your<00:03:16.760> RAM<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:19.989> it's<00:03:20.989> 58

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
that far off your RAM so it's 58

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.610 
that far off your RAM so it's 58
depending<00:03:22.580> on<00:03:22.670> how<00:03:22.790> high<00:03:22.940> you<00:03:23.000> need<00:03:23.239> it<00:03:23.560> no<00:03:24.560> of

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
depending on how high you need it no of

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.440 
depending on how high you need it no of
course<00:03:24.650> once<00:03:25.040> it's<00:03:25.160> on<00:03:25.250> they<00:03:25.430> just<00:03:25.760> plug<00:03:26.360> it

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
course once it's on they just plug it

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.449 
course once it's on they just plug it
into<00:03:26.570> molex<00:03:26.959> or<00:03:27.260> use<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.470> header<00:03:27.950> on<00:03:28.160> board

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
into molex or use a header on board

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.750 
into molex or use a header on board
whatever<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.270> need<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.420> do<00:03:29.600> and<00:03:30.459> that's<00:03:31.459> that

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
it's nice it's free it's not costing

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.660 
it's nice it's free it's not costing
anything<00:03:34.970> else<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:36.250> thought<00:03:37.250> I'd<00:03:37.340> show<00:03:37.520> it<00:03:37.550> to

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
anything else so thought I'd show it to

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.770 
anything else so thought I'd show it to
you<00:03:38.050> but<00:03:39.050> uh<00:03:39.080> until<00:03:39.650> next<00:03:39.920> time<00:03:40.390> stay<00:03:41.390> tuned

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
you but uh until next time stay tuned

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.670 
you but uh until next time stay tuned
for<00:03:42.110> more<00:03:42.380> videos<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.770> have<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.370> good<00:03:43.580> one
