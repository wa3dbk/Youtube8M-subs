00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 well my name is gerardo herrera 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.280
 corral I am a researcher in the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.360
 cinvestav physics department 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.590
 Research and studies center 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.260
 ipe n advanced and I work here as 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.000
 researcher for 20 years in the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.500
 area particle physics 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.350
 in the experimental part I have 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.720
 projects in experimental physics and in 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.210
 particular in projects with the great 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.230
 hadron collider in the center of 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.230
 investigations not created 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.449
 let's see an application of the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.460
 equation of the line in something that has 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.820
 to do with our universe and that has 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.070
 what to do with the most recent measurements 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:51.010
 on the origin and on time 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.989
 and how old is our universe and 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.750
 this has to do with hubble 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.900
 edwin hubble is an astronomer 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.200
 American began to measure the 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.510
 distance and speed with which the 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.390
 objects away from us in the 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.650
 space moved away from us 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.330
 after observing other objects he 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.610
 put to make a graph like the one 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.550
 we see here where in one of the axes 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.260
 redshift appears and the 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.290
 another placed the distance that is 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.450
 could determine the distance at which 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.180
 they found the stars the galaxies 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.180
 the nebulas or other objects that were 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.280
 known at the time and for each 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.070
 of these objects given the distance 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.690
 determined the redshift of the 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.040
 light that came from is what does it mean 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.680
 the redshift is something that 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.960
 we can understand in terms of the effect 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.830
 Doppler the Doppler effect is actually 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.450
 very familiar to us we can what 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.430
 we can perceive when a mermaid passes 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.670
 and when it approaches or moves away 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.700
 we can hear how the sound changes 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.509
 of frequency listen as the noise 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.280
 of the mermaid 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.039
 change the frequency when it moves away from 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.099
 us this change in frequency 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.290
 of the sound also appears in the light and 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.580
 it's known as such redshift 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.640
 luck that in the astronomical objects 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.470
 who are away from us 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.720
 there is a redshift what indicates 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.019
 clearly they are moving away from 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.400
 our planet and when one does this 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.360
 graphic like he did 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.340
 edwin hubble in 1924 he realized 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.190
 that there is a linear relationship between 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.099
 distance and the rate at which they move 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.200
 these objects moving away from us 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.090
 such an object is at a 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.340
 million light years away from 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.709
 our planet moves away from us to 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.630
 20 kilometers per second while 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.660
 one that is two million 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.519
 Light-years away will go away to 40 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.430
 kilometers per second and so 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.799
 successively when you observe objects 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.069
 very far from us in the 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.859
 limit of the visible universe 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.019
 about 14,000 million light-years 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.180
 these move away at a very speed 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.590
 close to the light and in the 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.340
 current events have been observed 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.739
 objects the furthest away that have been 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.139
 observed that they are moving away 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.510
 from us at twice the speed of 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:21.840
 the light in such a way that it is possible 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.810
 then draw a straight line that 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:29.069
 It has a certain slope 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:32.250
 as we all know from the equation of 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.709
 straight line in which the coefficient is 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.200
 the slope of that straight line and that 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.849
 pending is the hubble constant that 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.040
 It is approximately 70 kilometers 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.569
 second for each mega part of distance 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.090
 to which the object is 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.569
 then with this and observing so 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.999
 more systematic more objects is possible 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.450
 draw a graph like the one 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:04:00.819
 we observe in this in this graph in the 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.129
 that we have in the vertical axis the rate 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.980
 of expansion and on the horizontal axis the 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.530
 time then we have here the present 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.379
 and we have here different points that are 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.079
 experimental points as long as they are 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.930
 data of objects that are at a 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.729
 some distance from us and those who 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.720
 that rate of expansion has been measured 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:25.080
 that we discussed earlier we can 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.240
 observe there that is that these objects 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.669
 describe a straight line that is to say 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.110
 we can pass a straight line 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.390
 for all those points 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.210
 and in that way with that straight line 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.730
 we can extract the slope we can 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.680
 extract the hubble constant and we can 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.750
 also do an exercise of 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.790
 extrapolations this is necessary 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.340
 Take this phenomenon into consideration 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.370
 of inflation and this can be observed in 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.380
 this curve that already very close to the origin 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.140
 of the universe begins to curve itself 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.440
 moves away from the behavior that a 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.140
 straight line to bend and give us the 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.010
 moment zero the moment when the 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.710
 universe suffered this inflation and the 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.440
 moment in which the universe originated 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.440
 13,800 million years ago this is 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.140
 an example of a very application 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.420
 interesting from the straight line of the 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.330
 extrapolation that is a concept 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:26.630
 simple that you are learning and 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.940
 that can have huge potential and 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.790
 a huge capacity to understand something 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.980
 so fundamental so deep and so 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.470
 interesting as is the origin of 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.530
 universe 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.530
 Another central topic of study is the 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:45.160
 understanding of nature and is 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.970
 impossible to understand nature without 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.300
 mathematics for some mysterious reason 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:54.310
 but fascinating is the language of the 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.210
 mathematics the language that nature 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.810
 has adopted to express itself then 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.150
 we have to 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.950
 to understand that language if we want 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.230
 understand how it is that nature 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.630
 it works if we want to understand what they are 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.570
 the fundamental principles if we want 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.760
 understand the deepest intimacy of 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.340
 universe we have to do it through 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.490
 mathematics because for some reason 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:23.050
 nature the universe chose the 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.050
 math to express yourself
