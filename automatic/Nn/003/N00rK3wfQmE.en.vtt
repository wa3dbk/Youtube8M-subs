a deck for thirty dollars alone other

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.780 
a deck for thirty dollars alone other
places<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.109> think<00:04:11.069> it's<00:04:11.190> a<00:04:11.250> really<00:04:11.310> good<00:04:11.519> deal

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
places I think it's a really good deal

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.390 
places I think it's a really good deal
because<00:04:12.209> you<00:04:13.169> get<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.829> trucks<00:04:14.989> with<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.019> logo

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
because you get the trucks with the logo

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.509 
because you get the trucks with the logo
that<00:04:17.400> are<00:04:17.489> black<00:04:17.959> which<00:04:18.959> is<00:04:18.989> cool<00:04:19.289> and<00:04:19.530> they're

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
that are black which is cool and they're

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.399 
that are black which is cool and they're
definitely<00:04:20.910> not<00:04:21.120> tactic<00:04:21.659> trucks<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.140> shape

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
definitely not tactic trucks to shape

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.040 
definitely not tactic trucks to shape
totally<00:04:23.070> different<00:04:23.250> as<00:04:23.880> you'll<00:04:24.570> see<00:04:24.810> if<00:04:24.930> you

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
totally different as you'll see if you

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.200 
totally different as you'll see if you
get<00:04:25.200> some<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:26.250> wheels

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
get some the wheels

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.700 
get some the wheels

say close-up urethane on them and
they're<00:04:29.669> black<00:04:29.880> which<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:30.900> cool<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.350> they

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
they're black which is cool and they

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.800 
they're black which is cool and they
have<00:04:31.710> a<00:04:31.740> metal<00:04:32.100> center<00:04:33.000> on<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.750> wheels<00:04:33.930> also

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
have a metal center on the wheels also

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.350 
have a metal center on the wheels also
so<00:04:36.810> it's<00:04:36.990> metal<00:04:37.410> that<00:04:37.800> comes<00:04:38.580> in<00:04:38.729> contact<00:04:38.940> with

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
so it's metal that comes in contact with

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.990 
so it's metal that comes in contact with
the<00:04:39.449> axle<00:04:39.900> I<00:04:40.110> think<00:04:41.069> it<00:04:41.190> makes<00:04:41.340> them<00:04:41.460> roll<00:04:41.729> a

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
the axle I think it makes them roll a

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.870 
the axle I think it makes them roll a
little<00:04:42.419> better<00:04:42.720> I<00:04:42.930> don't<00:04:43.229> know<00:04:43.819> it<00:04:44.819> might

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
little better I don't know it might

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.860 
little better I don't know it might
maybe<00:04:45.810> it's<00:04:46.020> just<00:04:46.080> me<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:48.389> super<00:04:48.720> cool

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
maybe it's just me and the super cool

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.350 
maybe it's just me and the super cool
deck<00:04:49.110> with<00:04:49.349> the<00:04:49.440> logo<00:04:49.620> and<00:04:50.009> the<00:04:50.039> two<00:04:50.970> pieces<00:04:51.150> of

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.469 
deck with the logo and the two pieces of
grip<00:04:51.690> make<00:04:52.020> it<00:04:52.199> worth<00:04:52.370> $27<00:04:53.370> when<00:04:54.150> you<00:04:54.240> can<00:04:54.360> go

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
grip make it worth $27 when you can go

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.939 
grip make it worth $27 when you can go

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
2775 I think it's a pretty good deal so

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.540 
2775 I think it's a pretty good deal so
and<00:05:03.599> it's<00:05:03.960> fast<00:05:04.169> shipping<00:05:04.560> I<00:05:04.740> was<00:05:05.190> worried<00:05:05.460> it

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
and it's fast shipping I was worried it

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.950 
and it's fast shipping I was worried it
would<00:05:05.729> take<00:05:05.910> a<00:05:05.940> long<00:05:06.150> time<00:05:06.210> because<00:05:06.630> it's

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
would take a long time because it's

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.710 
would take a long time because it's
coming<00:05:07.320> from<00:05:07.440> France<00:05:07.800> nope<00:05:08.729> I<00:05:08.940> ordered<00:05:09.419> it<00:05:09.570> on

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
coming from France nope I ordered it on

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.629 
coming from France nope I ordered it on
the<00:05:09.840> 8th<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.229> it<00:05:10.320> came<00:05:10.470> to<00:05:10.650> 13th<00:05:11.070> like<00:05:11.310> i<00:05:11.430> said

so<00:05:28.020> i<00:05:28.970> definitely<00:05:29.970> recommend<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.750> close-up

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
so i definitely recommend the close-up

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
generation 3 look at the dips it's got a

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.610 
generation 3 look at the dips it's got a
really<00:05:34.889> nice<00:05:35.130> feel<00:05:35.460> to<00:05:35.490> it<00:05:35.870> I've<00:05:36.870> heard<00:05:37.199> from<00:05:37.470> a

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
really nice feel to it I've heard from a

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.260 
really nice feel to it I've heard from a
lot<00:05:37.740> of<00:05:37.800> people<00:05:37.919> that<00:05:38.340> they<00:05:38.550> don't<00:05:38.789> like<00:05:38.849> close

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
lot of people that they don't like close

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.029 
lot of people that they don't like close
up<00:05:39.300> maybe<00:05:40.259> it<00:05:40.409> was<00:05:40.530> an<00:05:40.620> earlier<00:05:40.949> generation

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
up maybe it was an earlier generation

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.189 
up maybe it was an earlier generation
but<00:05:41.849> you<00:05:41.970> guys<00:05:42.120> really<00:05:42.419> need<00:05:42.690> to<00:05:42.840> check<00:05:43.050> these

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199
