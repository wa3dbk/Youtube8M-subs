00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
some repairs in the structure so we got

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.910 
some repairs in the structure so we got
to<00:00:46.660> see<00:00:46.809> firsthand<00:00:47.170> some<00:00:47.530> of<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.710> maintenance

to this level of competency it was very

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.810 
to this level of competency it was very
slow<00:01:52.170> learning<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:53.220> lot<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.700> is

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
slow learning and a lot of this is

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.520 
slow learning and a lot of this is
muscle<00:01:54.060> memory<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.720> practice<00:01:55.110> makes<00:01:55.320> perfect

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
muscle memory so practice makes perfect

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.249

skipping the first leaf another piece is
put<00:02:19.350> down

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
put down

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.190 
put down
and<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.060> Stemmons<00:02:22.360> twisted<00:02:22.780> around<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.050> beam

once again skipping the first leaf four

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.860 
once again skipping the first leaf four
accounted<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:28.239> new<00:02:28.390> piece<00:02:28.569> is<00:02:28.690> put
