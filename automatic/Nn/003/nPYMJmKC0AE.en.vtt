00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
explodes so immediately it's on to the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.220 
explodes so immediately it's on to the
next<00:00:38.820> healer<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.570> reason<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.840> like<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.050> kill

next healer the reason I like to kill
healers<00:00:40.590> first<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.129> because<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.550> makes<00:00:41.820> those

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
healers first is because it makes those

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.840 
healers first is because it makes those
those<00:00:42.660> DPS<00:00:43.170> go<00:00:43.379> down<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> lot<00:00:43.890> faster<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.640> you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
those DPS go down a lot faster so you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.729 
those DPS go down a lot faster so you
focus<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.390> healers<00:00:45.629> down<00:00:45.870> now<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.500> get<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
focus the healers down now we get to

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.319 
focus the healers down now we get to

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
favorites uh-huh and it's and like I

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.300 
favorites uh-huh and it's and like I
said<00:02:39.840> it's<00:02:40.080> often<00:02:40.410> very<00:02:40.440> effective<00:02:41.130> but<00:02:41.250> I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
said it's often very effective but I

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.500 
said it's often very effective but I
wouldn't<00:02:41.610> necessarily<00:02:41.700> recommend<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.420> you

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
wouldn't necessarily recommend that you

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.750 
wouldn't necessarily recommend that you
do<00:02:42.630> this<00:02:42.750> all<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.050> time<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.920> don't<00:02:44.490> know<00:02:44.550> if

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
do this all the time but I don't know if

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.910 
do this all the time but I don't know if
you<00:02:45.210> can<00:02:45.360> keep<00:02:45.510> about<00:02:45.750> four<00:02:46.170> or<00:02:46.200> five<00:02:46.350> members

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
you can keep about four or five members

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.710 
you can keep about four or five members
of<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.160> opposing<00:02:47.370> team<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.940> their<00:02:48.420> graveyard

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
of the opposing team in their graveyard

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.750 
of the opposing team in their graveyard
it<00:02:49.320> means<00:02:49.560> they're<00:02:49.770> not<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.070> map<00:02:50.310> capping

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
it means they're not on the map capping

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.640 
it means they're not on the map capping
objectives<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:51.450> unfortunately<00:02:52.320> we<00:02:52.470> do<00:02:52.620> have

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
objectives and unfortunately we do have

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.500 
objectives and unfortunately we do have
like<00:02:52.920> seven<00:02:53.370> people<00:02:53.550> camping<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> graveyard

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
like seven people camping the graveyard

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.090 
like seven people camping the graveyard
right<00:02:54.630> now<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:54.959> doesn't<00:02:55.170> really<00:02:55.230> turn<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
right now so it doesn't really turn the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.860 
right now so it doesn't really turn the
numbers<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.550> our<00:02:56.610> favor<00:02:56.910> but<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.570> know<00:02:57.660> if<00:02:57.750> you

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
enough control to map at this point that

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.930 
enough control to map at this point that
hopefully<00:03:07.650> we<00:03:07.740> can<00:03:07.890> spare<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.459> lot<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.820> people
