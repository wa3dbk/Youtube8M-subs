and<00:03:39.410> this<00:03:40.410> endura<00:03:40.910> was<00:03:41.910> designed<00:03:42.360> for<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.870> usn

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
as we talked about earlier i think the

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.010

colored<00:04:41.940> ones<00:04:42.120> are<00:04:42.599> more<00:04:43.260> fun

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
colored ones are more fun

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.790 
colored ones are more fun
so<00:04:44.889> all<00:04:45.759> in<00:04:46.000> all<00:04:46.120> I<00:04:46.180> give<00:04:46.479> these<00:04:46.660> knives<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:47.229> 10
