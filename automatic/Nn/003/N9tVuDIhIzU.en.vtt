00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
was the opportunity for Southampton with

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.789 
was the opportunity for Southampton with
it<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.600> think<00:03:29.720> they<00:03:29.989> were<00:03:30.049> trying<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.350> park<00:03:30.650> the

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
it I think they were trying to park the

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.580 
it I think they were trying to park the
bus<00:03:30.980> but<00:03:31.790> we<00:03:31.940> somehow<00:03:32.239> leave<00:03:32.989> this<00:03:33.230> ground

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
bus but we somehow leave this ground

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.210 
bus but we somehow leave this ground
with<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.609> 2-2<00:03:35.239> draw<00:03:35.269> in<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:35.959> single<00:03:36.319> point<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.799> will

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
with a 2-2 draw in a single point I will

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.759

Christian<00:04:07.400> benteke<00:04:07.730> I<00:04:08.150> don't<00:04:08.599> think<00:04:08.810> so

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
Christian benteke I don't think so

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.170 
Christian benteke I don't think so
