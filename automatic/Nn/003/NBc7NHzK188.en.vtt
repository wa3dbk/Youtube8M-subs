my macbook pro as well I'm going to be
using<00:00:50.120> these<00:00:50.390> video<00:00:50.990> card<00:00:51.230> right<00:00:51.380> here

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
using these video card right here

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.220 
using these video card right here
the<00:00:52.370> Triton<00:00:52.760> UV<00:00:53.540> 200<00:00:54.170> which<00:00:54.800> has<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:56.230> expansion

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
the Triton UV 200 which has a expansion

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.170 
the Triton UV 200 which has a expansion
up<00:00:57.380> to<00:00:57.530> four<00:00:57.800> different<00:00:58.430> monitors<00:00:58.940> so<00:00:59.090> I'm

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
up to four different monitors so I'm

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.610 
up to four different monitors so I'm
going<00:00:59.330> to<00:00:59.360> be<00:00:59.450> using<00:00:59.570> three<00:00:59.960> monitors<00:01:00.200> only

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
going to be using three monitors only

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.800 
going to be using three monitors only
and<00:01:01.310> I'm<00:01:01.520> going<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.700> test<00:01:01.910> it<00:01:02.060> out<00:01:02.150> today<00:01:02.540> and

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
and I'm going to test it out today and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.679 
and I'm going to test it out today and
make<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:03.740> whole<00:01:03.920> connection<00:01:04.189> which<00:01:05.180> also

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
make the whole connection which also

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.330 
make the whole connection which also
make<00:01:05.900> a<00:01:05.930> review<00:01:06.290> on<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:06.590> on<00:01:06.799> another<00:01:07.100> video

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
make a review on that on another video

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.910 
make a review on that on another video
but<00:01:07.909> let's<00:01:08.090> go<00:01:08.210> ahead<00:01:08.299> and<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:09.320> unboxing<00:01:09.829> on

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
but let's go ahead and the unboxing on

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:30.780 
but let's go ahead and the unboxing on
these

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.350 

here<00:01:31.790> we<00:01:31.909> go

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
here we go

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.399 
here we go
so<00:01:34.600> let's<00:01:35.600> say<00:01:35.750> we<00:01:35.930> get<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.550> installation<00:01:37.550> CD

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
so let's say we get a installation CD

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.050 
so let's say we get a installation CD
well<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:42.680> manual<00:01:43.159> here<00:01:43.369> or<00:01:43.610> some

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
well the the manual here or some

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.210 
well the the manual here or some
instructions<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:45.110> set<00:01:45.409> up<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.710> stand<00:01:46.040> I

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
instructions it set up the stand I

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.760 
instructions it set up the stand I
believe<00:01:46.520> yeah<00:01:47.170> it's<00:01:48.170> just<00:01:48.290> pretty<00:01:48.560> much

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
believe yeah it's just pretty much

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.430 
believe yeah it's just pretty much
indicating<00:01:49.520> how<00:01:50.360> do<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.539> solve<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.899> base<00:01:51.080> for

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
indicating how do you solve the base for

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.190 
indicating how do you solve the base for
the<00:01:51.700> monitor<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.090> what<00:01:53.690> are<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.929> connections

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
the monitor and what are the connections

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.350 
the monitor and what are the connections
that<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:54.979> can<00:01:55.160> use<00:01:55.420> these<00:01:56.420> only<00:01:56.720> uses<00:01:58.210> DVI<00:01:59.210> and

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
that you can use these only uses DVI and

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.430 
that you can use these only uses DVI and
VGA<00:01:59.690> does<00:02:00.470> not<00:02:00.710> support<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.399> HDMI<00:02:02.259> you<00:02:03.259> can

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
VGA does not support the HDMI you can

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.270 
VGA does not support the HDMI you can
always<00:02:03.679> get<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.890> adapter<00:02:04.759> for<00:02:04.970> its<00:02:05.090> HDMI<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.899> DVI

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
always get a adapter for its HDMI to DVI

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.669 
always get a adapter for its HDMI to DVI
so<00:02:07.280> it's<00:02:07.940> nice<00:02:08.119> they<00:02:08.360> even<00:02:08.690> include<00:02:09.259> a<00:02:09.380> take<00:02:09.649> a

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
so it's nice they even include a take a

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.280 
so it's nice they even include a take a
little<00:02:10.220> cloth<00:02:10.519> here<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:11.420> clean<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.840> monitor

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
I think it's really really like ice so

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.180 
I think it's really really like ice so
here<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.180> is<00:03:17.390> oh<00:03:20.170> my<00:03:21.170> gosh<00:03:21.410> I'm<00:03:21.620> impressive

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
here it is oh my gosh I'm impressive

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.589

this thing is so light and look how

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.800 
this thing is so light and look how
clean<00:03:23.870> this<00:03:24.020> is<00:03:24.550> and<00:03:25.550> that's<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.420> reason<00:03:26.690> why

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
clean this is and that's the reason why

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.300 
clean this is and that's the reason why
I<00:03:26.840> picked<00:03:27.140> it<00:03:27.260> up<00:03:27.349> because<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:27.860> really<00:03:28.160> don't

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
I picked it up because I really don't

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.430 
I picked it up because I really don't
want<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:28.580> have<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:29.030> huge<00:03:29.569> you<00:03:29.870> know<00:03:29.959> back<00:03:30.170> on<00:03:30.200> the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
want to have a huge you know back on the

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.420 
want to have a huge you know back on the
monitor<00:03:30.970> besides<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.180> know<00:03:32.239> some<00:03:32.600> LEDs<00:03:33.280> for<00:03:34.280> the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
monitor besides I know some LEDs for the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.330 
monitor besides I know some LEDs for the
price<00:03:34.670> range<00:03:35.440> Simon<00:03:36.440> Lee<00:03:36.560> these<00:03:36.770> they<00:03:37.069> still

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
price range Simon Lee these they still

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.550 
price range Simon Lee these they still
have<00:03:37.550> some<00:03:37.940> little<00:03:38.660> box<00:03:38.959> here<00:03:39.200> for<00:03:39.260> the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
have some little box here for the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.920 
have some little box here for the
connections<00:03:40.130> what<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.060> like<00:03:41.269> about<00:03:41.450> this<00:03:41.690> motor

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
connections what I like about this motor

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.420 
connections what I like about this motor
and<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.200> reason<00:03:42.500> why<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:42.650> picked<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.099> up<00:03:43.220> is

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
and the reason why I picked it up is

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.770 
and the reason why I picked it up is
because<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.849> connections<00:03:44.300> are<00:03:44.450> actually

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
because the connections are actually

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.930 
because the connections are actually
right<00:03:44.959> here<00:03:44.989> in<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.319> back<00:03:45.519> I'll<00:03:46.519> be<00:03:46.670> making
