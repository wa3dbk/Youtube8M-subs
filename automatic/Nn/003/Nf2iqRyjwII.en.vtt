00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
in stamp class one of my students said

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.310 
in stamp class one of my students said
oh<00:00:39.519> it's<00:00:39.820> too<00:00:40.000> bad<00:00:40.120> we<00:00:40.390> don't<00:00:40.600> have<00:00:40.750> gold

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320

oh it's too bad we don't have gold
glimmer<00:00:41.769> paper<00:00:42.269> so<00:00:43.269> we<00:00:43.600> came<00:00:43.989> up<00:00:44.019> with<00:00:44.350> an<00:00:44.469> idea

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
glimmer paper so we came up with an idea

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.670 
glimmer paper so we came up with an idea
of<00:00:44.950> coloring<00:00:45.880> the<00:00:46.030> glimmer<00:00:46.270> paper<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.410> that<00:00:47.440> we

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
of coloring the glimmer paper so that we

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.069 
of coloring the glimmer paper so that we
could<00:00:47.829> have<00:00:48.040> more<00:00:48.340> than<00:00:48.550> just<00:00:48.610> two<00:00:49.059> colors<00:00:49.270> so

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
could have more than just two colors so

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.049 
could have more than just two colors so
you<00:00:50.110> can<00:00:50.350> see<00:00:50.530> here<00:00:50.800> we've<00:00:50.980> used<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.610> silver

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
you can see here we've used the silver

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.950 
you can see here we've used the silver
and<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.300> red<00:00:52.600> but<00:00:52.899> we<00:00:52.930> also<00:00:53.200> made<00:00:53.620> gold<00:00:54.010> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and the red but we also made gold and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.180 
and the red but we also made gold and
then<00:00:55.960> I<00:00:55.989> thought<00:00:56.350> well<00:00:56.590> wouldn't<00:00:56.950> it<00:00:57.039> be

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
then I thought well wouldn't it be

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.060 
then I thought well wouldn't it be

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
we decided were the easiest for coloring

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.390 
we decided were the easiest for coloring

your scrap and your ink pad this is the
silver<00:01:23.110> glimmer<00:01:23.439> paper<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:24.159> a<00:01:24.610> sponge<00:01:24.939> dauber

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
silver glimmer paper and a sponge dauber

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.490 
silver glimmer paper and a sponge dauber
and<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:26.500> just<00:01:26.710> dog<00:01:27.010> like<00:01:27.430> this<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.960> is<00:01:29.200> more

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
mustard and as you can see that's what's

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.100 
mustard and as you can see that's what's
giving<00:01:32.619> me<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.070> gold<00:01:33.340> color<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.840> that's

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
giving me the gold color so that's

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.969 
giving me the gold color so that's
really<00:01:35.350> pretty<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:36.040> then<00:01:36.720> use<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:38.229> ornament

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
really pretty and then use the ornament

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.319 
really pretty and then use the ornament
punch<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:42.610> you<00:01:42.729> have<00:01:42.909> a<00:01:42.939> really<00:01:43.210> pretty

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
punch and then you have a really pretty

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.660 
punch and then you have a really pretty
gold<00:01:43.840> ornament<00:01:44.380> isn't<00:01:45.250> that<00:01:45.280> pretty<00:01:45.490> in

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
gold ornament isn't that pretty in

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.359 
gold ornament isn't that pretty in
sparkly<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:47.140> that<00:01:47.259> was<00:01:47.439> one<00:01:47.650> way<00:01:47.799> we<00:01:47.979> did<00:01:48.159> it

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
sparkly so that was one way we did it

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.080 
sparkly so that was one way we did it
and<00:01:48.579> then<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.750> other<00:01:49.780> way<00:01:50.380> would<00:01:51.070> be<00:01:51.130> again

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
and then the other way would be again

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.810 
and then the other way would be again
with<00:01:52.360> your<00:01:52.509> silver<00:01:52.960> glimmer<00:01:53.200> paper<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:54.610> can

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
with your silver glimmer paper you can

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.190 
with your silver glimmer paper you can
use<00:01:55.090> one<00:01:55.390> of<00:01:55.420> our<00:01:55.720> ink<00:01:56.350> pad<00:01:56.770> lids<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:58.200> re-inker

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
use one of our ink pad lids and re-inker

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.830 
use one of our ink pad lids and re-inker
I've<00:01:59.439> dropped<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.250> reinker<00:02:00.850> into<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.600> lid

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
I've dropped the reinker into the lid

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.929 
I've dropped the reinker into the lid
and<00:02:02.170> then<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:02.680> can<00:02:02.860> use<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.250> aqua<00:02:03.729> painter

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
and then you can use the aqua painter

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.510 
and then you can use the aqua painter
and<00:02:04.479> simply<00:02:04.990> squeeze<00:02:05.409> out<00:02:05.680> some<00:02:05.710> of<00:02:06.189> the<00:02:06.310> water

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
and simply squeeze out some of the water

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.030 
and simply squeeze out some of the water
and<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.940> can<00:02:10.209> paint<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:10.869> this<00:02:11.230> is<00:02:11.470> great<00:02:11.829> if

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
and you can paint and this is great if

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.259 
and you can paint and this is great if
you're<00:02:12.310> trying<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.850> do<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.180> really<00:02:13.630> large<00:02:14.049> area

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
you're trying to do a really large area

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.060 
you're trying to do a really large area
it<00:02:16.269> would<00:02:16.420> be<00:02:16.600> much<00:02:16.780> quicker<00:02:17.140> than<00:02:17.350> if<00:02:17.799> you

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
it would be much quicker than if you

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.320 
it would be much quicker than if you
were<00:02:18.220> trying<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.640> sponge

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
were trying to sponge

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.440
