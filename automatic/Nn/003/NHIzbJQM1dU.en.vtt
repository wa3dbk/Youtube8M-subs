00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.590 
bicker and dinner now now in my opinion
that's<00:02:09.310> like<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.789> equivalent<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:10.210> a<00:02:10.300> golden

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
that's like the equivalent of a golden

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.750 
that's like the equivalent of a golden
apple<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:11.080> very<00:02:11.350> overpowered<00:02:11.860> I<00:02:12.160> mean<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.730> know

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
apple and very overpowered I mean I know

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.670 
apple and very overpowered I mean I know
it's<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.360> crafted<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.930> equivalent<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.380> 12

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
it's you crafted the equivalent of 12

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.420 
it's you crafted the equivalent of 12

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
arts

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.490 
arts
but<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.909> get<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.120> equivalent<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.629> 30<00:02:16.930> back

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
but you get the equivalent of 30 back

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.740 
but you get the equivalent of 30 back
and<00:02:17.829> in<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.549> sec<00:02:18.849> so<00:02:19.090> that's<00:02:19.239> kind<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.540> over

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
and in a sec so that's kind of over

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.649 
and in a sec so that's kind of over
about<00:02:19.930> let's<00:02:20.290> eat<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:21.060> okay<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.269> in<00:02:22.359> the<00:02:22.450> same

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
about let's eat it okay and in the same

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.959 
about let's eat it okay and in the same

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
fashion but with raw pork you can get

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:30.300 
fashion but with raw pork you can get
raw<00:02:25.269> bacon<00:02:25.540> as<00:02:26.049> i<00:02:27.010> will<00:02:27.129> show<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.340> now<00:02:29.310> which

can tell unknown on okay next thing
we'll<00:02:36.790> move<00:02:36.939> on<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.239> should<00:02:37.510> probably<00:02:37.750> be<00:02:37.900> and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
we'll move on to should probably be and

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.649 
we'll move on to should probably be and
I<00:02:38.709> saved<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.040> best<00:02:39.129> for<00:02:39.370> last<00:02:39.400> but<00:02:39.730> for<00:02:39.879> now<00:02:40.030> we

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
I saved the best for last but for now we

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.039 
I saved the best for last but for now we
were<00:02:40.750> going<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.079> oats<00:02:41.489> now<00:02:42.489> as<00:02:42.700> I<00:02:42.819> said<00:02:42.969> before

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
were going to oats now as I said before

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.530 
were going to oats now as I said before
these<00:02:44.049> are<00:02:44.469> the<00:02:44.889> equivalent<00:02:45.159> of<00:02:45.549> cookies<00:02:46.000> but

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
these are the equivalent of cookies but

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.740 
these are the equivalent of cookies but
a<00:02:46.840> healthier<00:02:47.799> version<00:02:48.120> but<00:02:49.120> there's<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.629> twist

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
a healthier version but there's a twist

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.890 
a healthier version but there's a twist
instead<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.680> getting<00:02:50.829> eight<00:02:51.159> you<00:02:51.639> get<00:02:51.819> six<00:02:52.150> so

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
instead of getting eight you get six so

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.879 
instead of getting eight you get six so
you<00:02:52.959> are<00:02:53.079> from<00:02:53.200> guanghui<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.590> top<00:02:53.739> of<00:02:53.829> the
