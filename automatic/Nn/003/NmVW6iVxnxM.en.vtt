00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
and water I got water heater elements

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.589 
and water I got water heater elements
inside<00:00:17.779> of<00:00:18.080> it<00:00:19.330> for<00:00:20.330> the<00:00:20.390> heating<00:00:20.689> elements

inside of it for the heating elements

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.060 
inside of it for the heating elements
and<00:00:23.599> I<00:00:23.720> ordered<00:00:24.079> a<00:00:24.169> hydrometer<00:00:24.650> and

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
and I ordered a hydrometer and

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.540 
and I ordered a hydrometer and
thermometer<00:00:25.669> see<00:00:26.599> it

got the right amount of moisture got a
little<00:01:54.240> moisture<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.720> my<00:01:54.840> door<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.439> see<00:01:59.090> but

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
little moisture on my door you see but

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.240 
little moisture on my door you see but
I'm<00:02:00.210> holding<00:02:00.420> 100<00:02:00.929> degrees<00:02:01.229> at<00:02:01.500> 60%<00:02:02.280> humidity

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
I'm holding 100 degrees at 60% humidity

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.289 
I'm holding 100 degrees at 60% humidity
I've<00:02:05.250> been<00:02:05.399> holding<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:06.000> about<00:02:06.060> three

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
I've been holding this for about three

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.690 
I've been holding this for about three
days<00:02:06.600> now<00:02:06.929> so<00:02:07.259> everything<00:02:07.920> looks<00:02:08.069> good

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
days now so everything looks good

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.809 
days now so everything looks good
got<00:02:09.690> flecks<00:02:10.019> of<00:02:10.140> glass<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.619> front<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
got flecks of glass in the front for the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.539 
got flecks of glass in the front for the
window

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.069 

I<00:02:16.579> would<00:02:17.209> open<00:02:17.329> it<00:02:17.480> up<00:02:17.629> and<00:02:17.719> show<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:17.900> the

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
I would open it up and show you the

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.750 
I would open it up and show you the
inside<00:02:18.260> I'm<00:02:18.890> not<00:02:19.069> going<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.310> do<00:02:19.400> because<00:02:19.459> it

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
inside I'm not going to do because it

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.940 
inside I'm not going to do because it
lets<00:02:19.909> all<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.239> moisture<00:02:20.629> out<00:02:20.719> but<00:02:20.989> I<00:02:21.560> used<00:02:21.859> to

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
lets all the moisture out but I used to

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:32.500 
lets all the moisture out but I used to
water<00:02:22.370> heater<00:02:22.640> elements<00:02:24.579> and<00:02:25.579> I<00:02:27.370> used<00:02:31.510> 120

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
water heater elements and I used 120

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.440 
water heater elements and I used 120
volt<00:02:32.750> coal<00:02:33.700> contactor<00:02:34.700> from<00:02:35.239> air

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
volt coal contactor from air

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.979 
volt coal contactor from air
conditioning<00:02:35.480> unit<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:37.189> reduce<00:02:37.519> my<00:02:37.700> voltage

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.599 

so<00:02:41.989> we'll<00:02:42.230> be<00:02:42.349> putting<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:42.680> much<00:02:42.829> voltage<00:02:43.129> on

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
so we'll be putting so much voltage on

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:49.000 
so we'll be putting so much voltage on
my<00:02:44.139> thermostat<00:02:46.569> and<00:02:47.569> when<00:02:48.049> it<00:02:48.200> kicks<00:02:48.500> on<00:02:48.709> you

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
my thermostat and when it kicks on you

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.839 
my thermostat and when it kicks on you
can<00:02:49.129> see<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.400> light<00:02:49.609> kick<00:02:49.939> down<00:02:51.790> show<00:02:52.790> you

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
can see the light kick down show you

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.649 
can see the light kick down show you
this<00:02:53.120> your<00:02:54.760> heating<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.120> then<00:02:56.239> it'll<00:02:56.450> kick

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
this your heating and then it'll kick

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.720 
this your heating and then it'll kick
back<00:02:56.870> off<00:02:57.109> the<00:02:57.290> light<00:02:57.439> goes<00:02:57.680> off

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.690 

should<00:03:02.450> kick<00:03:02.660> off<00:03:02.840> any<00:03:03.080> second

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:15.020 

II<00:03:07.200> at<00:03:08.200> all<00:03:08.940> right<00:03:10.140> so<00:03:11.140> I<00:03:11.610> mostly<00:03:12.610> how<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.910> does

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
II at all right so I mostly how it does

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.520 
II at all right so I mostly how it does
that's<00:03:16.030> my<00:03:16.209> Turner<00:03:16.660> automated<00:03:17.230> Turner<00:03:17.440> I

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
that's my Turner automated Turner I

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.830 
that's my Turner automated Turner I
wired<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:18.069> into<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.580> contact<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:19.450> this<00:03:19.629> always

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
wired it into the contact so this always

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.760 
wired it into the contact so this always
turn<00:03:20.410> on<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.980> hot<00:03:21.099> side<00:03:22.800> on<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:23.980> contact<00:03:24.459> side
