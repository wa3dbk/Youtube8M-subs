pack<00:05:32.040> here<00:05:32.310> oh<00:05:32.460> my<00:05:33.120> god<00:05:33.300> oh<00:05:36.500> I<00:05:37.500> don't<00:05:37.950> know<00:05:38.100> I<00:05:38.340> i

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
pack here oh my god oh I don't know I i

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.570 
pack here oh my god oh I don't know I i
I'll<00:05:39.450> have<00:05:39.690> to<00:05:39.810> get<00:05:39.930> more<00:05:40.080> excited<00:05:40.460> once<00:05:41.460> I

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
I'll have to get more excited once I

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.159 
I'll have to get more excited once I
start<00:05:41.789> opening<00:05:42.090> up<00:05:42.210> some<00:05:42.479> of<00:05:42.570> the<00:05:42.690> higher

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169

start opening up some of the higher
quality<00:05:43.680> packs<00:05:44.000> so<00:05:45.000> I<00:05:45.030> think<00:05:45.180> I<00:05:45.390> put<00:05:45.660> some<00:05:45.930> of

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
quality packs so I think I put some of

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.960 
quality packs so I think I put some of
the<00:05:46.140> contract<00:05:46.860> things<00:05:47.100> into<00:05:47.340> my<00:05:47.460> consumables

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
the contract things into my consumables

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.730 
the contract things into my consumables
and<00:05:48.150> then<00:05:48.750> I'll<00:05:48.870> quick<00:05:49.110> sell<00:05:49.350> the<00:05:49.440> rest<00:05:49.620> of

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
and then I'll quick sell the rest of

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.200 
and then I'll quick sell the rest of
these<00:05:49.830> because<00:05:50.160> they're<00:05:50.340> not<00:05:50.490> really<00:05:50.789> worth

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
these because they're not really worth

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.650 
these because they're not really worth
anything<00:05:51.620> the<00:05:52.620> pc<00:05:53.220> market<00:05:53.250> for<00:05:54.060> cards<00:05:54.510> is

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
anything the pc market for cards is

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.390 
anything the pc market for cards is
pretty<00:05:54.870> interesting<00:05:54.990> since<00:05:55.350> i<00:05:55.590> think<00:05:56.220> there

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
pretty interesting since i think there

i won this chemistry style and I needed

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.320 
i won this chemistry style and I needed
this<00:06:14.400> chemistry<00:06:14.880> style<00:06:15.210> for<00:06:15.630> my<00:06:15.750> last<00:06:16.940> task<00:06:17.940> in

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
a 70 and 100 for chemistry so it's

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.399 
a 70 and 100 for chemistry so it's
pretty<00:06:33.930> good<00:06:34.640> there's<00:06:35.640> our<00:06:35.849> 13<00:06:36.390> of<00:06:36.510> 13<00:06:36.539> tasks
