hi<00:00:00.510> today<00:00:01.500> we're<00:00:01.680> going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.890> talk<00:00:02.070> about

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
hi today we're going to talk about

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.990 
hi today we're going to talk about
tuning<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:02.820> violin<00:00:03.560> there<00:00:04.560> are<00:00:04.830> two<00:00:05.279> ways<00:00:05.580> on

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
tuning the violin there are two ways on

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.890 
tuning the violin there are two ways on
the<00:00:06.330> instrument<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:07.049> tune<00:00:07.290> we<00:00:08.280> have<00:00:08.630> the<00:00:09.630> pegs

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
the instrument to tune we have the pegs

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.980 
the instrument to tune we have the pegs
at<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> top<00:00:10.650> by<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.580> scroll<00:00:12.030> these<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.719> use

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
at the top by the scroll these you use

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.320 
at the top by the scroll these you use
when<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.440> instrument<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:14.330> pretty

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
when the instrument is pretty

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.660 
when the instrument is pretty
drastically<00:00:16.049> out<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.320> tune<00:00:16.560> where<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.430> peg

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
drastically out of tune where the peg

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.910 
drastically out of tune where the peg
has<00:00:17.910> slipped<00:00:18.330> or<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> string<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.199> slack<00:00:19.529> and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
has slipped or the string and slack and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.210 
has slipped or the string and slack and
you<00:00:19.949> really<00:00:20.640> need<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.880> adjust<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.779> lot<00:00:22.289> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
you really need to adjust it a lot the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.950 
you really need to adjust it a lot the
other<00:00:23.250> thing<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.510> have<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
other thing that we have on the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.830 
other thing that we have on the
instrument<00:00:25.380> are<00:00:25.529> fine<00:00:26.220> tuners<00:00:26.699> on<00:00:26.939> some

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
instrument are fine tuners on some

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.870 
instrument are fine tuners on some
instruments<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.590> see<00:00:28.800> only<00:00:29.039> one<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.460> these<00:00:29.640> on

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
instruments you see only one of these on

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.740 
instruments you see only one of these on
the<00:00:29.970> e-string<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.529> other<00:00:31.830> instruments

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.369 

they're<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:37.020> each<00:00:37.800> string<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.960> thing<00:00:40.200> that

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
they're on each string the thing that

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.740 
they're on each string the thing that
you<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.860> watch<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.280> for<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.300> fine

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
you have to watch out for is the fine

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.610 
you have to watch out for is the fine
tuner<00:00:43.230> being<00:00:43.590> screwed<00:00:44.190> all<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.640> way<00:00:44.820> in

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
tuner being screwed all the way in

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.310 
tuner being screwed all the way in
sometimes<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.129> cause<00:00:48.320> scratching

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
sometimes that can cause scratching

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.639 
sometimes that can cause scratching
underneath<00:00:49.770> if<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.840> mechanism<00:00:52.379> underneath

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
underneath if the mechanism underneath

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.130 
underneath if the mechanism underneath
touches<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> top<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> instrument<00:00:54.079> so<00:00:55.079> you

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
touches the top of the instrument so you

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.689 
touches the top of the instrument so you
need<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.530> loosen<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:56.039> up<00:00:56.190> which<00:00:56.430> would<00:00:56.579> be

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
need to loosen it up which would be

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.660 
need to loosen it up which would be
turning<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.180> counterclockwise<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:59.190> loosen<00:00:59.340> it

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
turning it counterclockwise to loosen it

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.510 
turning it counterclockwise to loosen it
and<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.969> also<00:01:00.120> makes<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.629> string<00:01:00.899> go<00:01:01.590> under

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
and that also makes the string go under

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.240 
and that also makes the string go under
pitch<00:01:02.789> if<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.780> turn<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.080> clockwise<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.619> raises

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
pitch if you turn it clockwise it raises

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.560 
pitch if you turn it clockwise it raises
the<00:01:05.430> pitch<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:09.110> first<00:01:10.110> when<00:01:10.680> you're<00:01:10.770> tuning

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
the pitch so first when you're tuning

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.340 
the pitch so first when you're tuning
with<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.780> pegs

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.150 

there<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.500> another<00:01:16.950> thing<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:18.650> pay<00:01:19.650> attention

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
there is another thing to pay attention

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.840 
there is another thing to pay attention
to<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.550> is<00:01:21.150> pegs<00:01:21.810> are<00:01:22.020> held<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.530> by

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
to and that is pegs are held in by

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.020 
to and that is pegs are held in by
friction

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
friction

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.260 
friction
so<00:01:24.780> sometimes<00:01:25.410> they<00:01:25.590> slip<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.040> if<00:01:27.000> they<00:01:27.210> do

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
so sometimes they slip and if they do

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.340 
so sometimes they slip and if they do
you<00:01:27.750> need<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:29.010> careful<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.900> push<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.110> peg

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
you need to be careful to push the peg

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.890 
you need to be careful to push the peg
in<00:01:31.590> while<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.280> tune<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.480> put<00:01:36.720> your

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
in while you tune so that you put your

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.780 
in while you tune so that you put your
hand<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> other<00:01:37.620> side<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.160> scroll<00:01:38.490> to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
hand on the other side of the scroll to

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.790 
hand on the other side of the scroll to
support<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.570> scroll<00:01:39.870> so<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.290> doesn't<00:01:40.590> put<00:01:40.770> too

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
support the scroll so it doesn't put too

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.950 
support the scroll so it doesn't put too
much<00:01:41.010> pressure<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.580> as<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.180> push<00:01:42.510> the<00:01:42.540> peg

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
much pressure on it as you push the peg

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.240 
much pressure on it as you push the peg
in<00:01:43.260> and<00:01:43.530> turn<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.280> up<00:01:48.470> that<00:01:49.470> way<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.830> peg<00:01:50.040> is

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
in and turn it up that way the peg is

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.910 
in and turn it up that way the peg is
seated<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:51.000> firmly<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:52.470> will<00:01:52.710> need<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
seated in there firmly you will need a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.420 
seated in there firmly you will need a
tuner<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.670> tune<00:01:54.440> so<00:01:55.440> whichever<00:01:55.979> method<00:01:56.190> you

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
tuner to tune so whichever method you

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.490 
tuner to tune so whichever method you
use<00:01:56.790> whether<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.540> digital<00:01:57.720> tuner<00:01:58.140> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
use whether it's a digital tuner a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.120 
use whether it's a digital tuner a
tuning<00:01:59.070> fork<00:01:59.310> or<00:01:59.550> a<00:01:59.610> pitch<00:01:59.940> pipe<00:02:00.410> then<00:02:01.410> you<00:02:01.890> use

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
tuning fork or a pitch pipe then you use

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.700 
tuning fork or a pitch pipe then you use
that<00:02:02.370> for<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.300> you<00:02:03.990> tune<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> rest<00:02:04.530> of

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
that for the a and you tune the rest of

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.219 
that for the a and you tune the rest of
the<00:02:04.830> strings<00:02:05.100> from<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.640> or<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.050> have<00:02:07.200> a

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the strings from the a or if you have a

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.780 
the strings from the a or if you have a
digital<00:02:07.440> tuner<00:02:07.830> you<00:02:08.070> can<00:02:08.250> use<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.550> for<00:02:08.700> all

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
digital tuner you can use that for all

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.660 
digital tuner you can use that for all
the<00:02:08.940> strings<00:02:09.240> and<00:02:09.570> I<00:02:10.410> will<00:02:10.619> cover<00:02:10.830> each<00:02:11.280> one<00:02:11.550> of

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the strings and I will cover each one of

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.060 
the strings and I will cover each one of
those<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:12.090> separate<00:02:12.660> videos<00:02:13.020> but<00:02:13.380> for<00:02:13.410> now<00:02:13.770> I'm

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
those in separate videos but for now I'm

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.949 
those in separate videos but for now I'm
just<00:02:14.130> going<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.850> use<00:02:15.000> one<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.390> those<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.780> tune

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
just going to use one of those to tune

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.810 
just going to use one of those to tune
the<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.530> tune<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.430> rest<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
the a and tune the rest of the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.729 
the a and tune the rest of the
instruments<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.420> can<00:02:18.600> see<00:02:18.810> how<00:02:18.989> that<00:02:19.050> how

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
instruments so you can see how that how

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:29.180 
instruments so you can see how that how
that's<00:02:19.920> done<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:26.959> this<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:28.200> actually<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:28.920> in

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
that's done and this a actually is in

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.699 
that's done and this a actually is in
tune<00:02:29.550> now<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.450> tuned<00:02:31.019> it<00:02:31.170> with<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.500> peg

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
tune now that I tuned it with the peg

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.070 
tune now that I tuned it with the peg
here<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.380> use<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.150> tune<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.750> rest<00:02:36.930> of

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
here and I use the a to tune the rest of

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.140 
here and I use the a to tune the rest of
the<00:02:37.170> strings<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.160> use<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.820> like<00:02:39.120> a

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
the strings so you use the a like a

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.820 
the strings so you use the a like a
reference<00:02:39.600> pitch<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.200> would<00:02:40.350> dress<00:02:40.650> with

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
reference pitch and I would dress with

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.170 
reference pitch and I would dress with
the<00:02:40.920> strings<00:02:41.160> are<00:02:41.280> tuned<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:41.670> fifths

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:58.050 

Oh

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.280 

here's<00:02:59.060> where<00:02:59.269> use<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.599> fine<00:02:59.780> tune<00:03:00.019> around

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
here's where use the fine tune around

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.140 
here's where use the fine tune around
the<00:03:00.409> e

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.720 

by<00:03:07.150> turning<00:03:07.569> that<00:03:07.769> clockwise<00:03:08.769> I<00:03:09.159> raised<00:03:09.459> the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
by turning that clockwise I raised the

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.110 
by turning that clockwise I raised the
pitch<00:03:09.909> so<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.299> e<00:03:10.329> was<00:03:10.780> in<00:03:10.959> tune<00:03:11.200> with<00:03:11.409> the<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.620> if

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
pitch so the e was in tune with the a if

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.789 
pitch so the e was in tune with the a if
you<00:03:13.120> have<00:03:13.329> a<00:03:13.359> violin<00:03:13.989> that<00:03:14.140> does<00:03:14.319> not<00:03:14.500> have

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
you have a violin that does not have

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.099 
you have a violin that does not have
four<00:03:15.099> fine<00:03:15.340> tuners<00:03:15.819> then<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.689> have<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:17.019> use

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
four fine tuners then you have to use

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.020 
four fine tuners then you have to use
the<00:03:17.260> pegs<00:03:17.500> for<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:17.980> G<00:03:18.159> and<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.400> D<00:03:18.430> as<00:03:18.730> well<00:03:18.909> as

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
the pegs for the G and the D as well as

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.720 
the pegs for the G and the D as well as
the<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.319> there<00:03:20.319> is<00:03:20.530> almost<00:03:20.799> always<00:03:21.189> a<00:03:21.459> fine

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
the a there is almost always a fine

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.270 
the a there is almost always a fine
tuner<00:03:22.060> on<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.329> e<00:03:22.359> however<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.280> normally

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
tuner on the e however and normally

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.309 
tuner on the e however and normally
that's<00:03:24.489> what<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:24.819> use<00:03:25.090> when<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.540> tune<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:26.290> e

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
that's what you use when you tune the e

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.949 
that's what you use when you tune the e
very<00:03:27.310> rarely<00:03:27.639> do<00:03:27.969> you<00:03:28.000> need<00:03:28.269> to<00:03:28.420> use<00:03:28.569> the<00:03:28.750> peg

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
very rarely do you need to use the peg

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.879 
very rarely do you need to use the peg
for<00:03:29.379> the<00:03:29.469> E<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:30.840> in<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:31.930> next<00:03:32.109> videos<00:03:32.469> then<00:03:32.859> we

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
for the E and in the next videos then we

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.709 
for the E and in the next videos then we
will<00:03:33.250> talk<00:03:33.430> about<00:03:33.489> each<00:03:34.060> one<00:03:34.959> of<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.379> tuners
