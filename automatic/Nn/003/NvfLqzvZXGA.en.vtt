00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
to the ro933 because it looked a little

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.550 
to the ro933 because it looked a little
more<00:02:18.640> similar<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.090> what<00:02:19.390> Val<00:02:19.600> Kilmer<00:02:20.019> uses<00:02:20.380> and

more similar to what Val Kilmer uses and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.949 
more similar to what Val Kilmer uses and
more<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:20.829> a<00:02:20.920> compact<00:02:21.519> m4<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.450> if<00:02:22.630> you're

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
more of a compact m4 but if you're

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.479 
more of a compact m4 but if you're
looking<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.290> emulate<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.739> movie<00:02:24.010> while<00:02:24.280> also

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
looking to emulate the movie while also

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.390 
looking to emulate the movie while also
doing<00:02:24.820> well<00:02:25.209> I'd<00:02:25.600> advise<00:02:26.109> you<00:02:26.380> use<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.680> m416

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
doing well I'd advise you use the m416

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.880 
doing well I'd advise you use the m416
instead<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:28.450> won't<00:02:28.690> totally<00:02:28.989> nerd<00:02:29.350> out<00:02:29.530> on<00:02:29.709> you

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
instead I won't totally nerd out on you

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.640 
instead I won't totally nerd out on you
but<00:02:30.160> just<00:02:30.489> look<00:02:30.790> at<00:02:30.970> this<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.540> ro933<00:02:32.140> does

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
but just look at this the ro933 does

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.920 
but just look at this the ro933 does
much<00:02:32.890> less<00:02:33.250> damage<00:02:33.730> over<00:02:34.269> a<00:02:34.299> shorter<00:02:34.780> distance

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
much less damage over a shorter distance

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.259 
much less damage over a shorter distance
and<00:02:35.440> has<00:02:35.739> a<00:02:35.769> lower<00:02:36.130> rate<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.400> fire<00:02:36.519> so<00:02:37.120> it's

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
and has a lower rate of fire so it's

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.970 
and has a lower rate of fire so it's
basically<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.810> huge<00:02:38.109> piece<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.440> garbage<00:02:38.620> at

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
basically a huge piece of garbage at

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.620 
basically a huge piece of garbage at
least<00:02:39.190> in<00:02:39.310> hardline<00:02:39.640> because<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.150> kills<00:02:40.390> the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
least in hardline because it kills the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.470 
least in hardline because it kills the
slowest<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.290> all<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.739> ARS<00:02:42.310> now<00:02:42.640> obviously<00:02:43.150> if

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
slowest of all the ARS now obviously if

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.780 
slowest of all the ARS now obviously if
the<00:02:43.690> exact<00:02:44.109> opposite<00:02:44.680> in<00:02:44.920> heat<00:02:45.190> because<00:02:45.579> val

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
the exact opposite in heat because val

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.640 
the exact opposite in heat because val
kilmer<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.299> pretty<00:02:46.569> much<00:02:46.750> invincible<00:02:47.109> and

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
kilmer is pretty much invincible and

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.530 
kilmer is pretty much invincible and
impervious<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.250> anything<00:02:48.819> that's<00:02:48.970> similar<00:02:49.329> to

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
impervious to anything that's similar to

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.110 
impervious to anything that's similar to
bullets<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.500> he<00:02:50.530> has<00:02:50.680> laser<00:02:51.040> aim<00:02:51.340> accuracy<00:02:51.790> at

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
bullets and he has laser aim accuracy at

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.330 
bullets and he has laser aim accuracy at
the<00:02:52.390> same<00:02:52.720> time<00:02:53.079> I'd<00:02:53.530> also<00:02:53.709> like<00:02:53.889> to<00:02:54.040> add<00:02:54.160> that

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
the same time I'd also like to add that

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.670 
the same time I'd also like to add that
running<00:02:54.579> it<00:02:54.699> authentically<00:02:55.209> like

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
running it authentically like

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.319 
running it authentically like
movie<00:02:55.890> without<00:02:56.040> any<00:02:56.189> sort<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.730> attachments

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
movie without any sort of attachments

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.390 
movie without any sort of attachments
makes<00:02:57.569> things<00:02:57.840> much<00:02:58.290> more<00:02:58.590> difficult<00:02:58.650> but<00:02:59.340> I

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
makes things much more difficult but I

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.679 
makes things much more difficult but I
can<00:02:59.579> definitely<00:02:59.730> tell<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.540> it's

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
can definitely tell you that it's

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.709 
can definitely tell you that it's
passable<00:03:01.349> I<00:03:01.650> mean<00:03:01.859> granted<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.939> m16<00:03:03.480> beats

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:03.719 
passable I mean granted the m16 beats

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.440 
passable I mean granted the m16 beats
you<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.200> AKM<00:03:04.590> beats<00:03:04.859> you<00:03:05.129> the<00:03:05.310> m416<00:03:05.969> beats<00:03:06.299> you

you the AKM beats you the m416 beats you

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.360 
you the AKM beats you the m416 beats you
as<00:03:06.629> do<00:03:06.810> most<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.109> the<00:03:07.200> mechanic<00:03:07.590> weapons<00:03:07.920> but

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
as do most of the mechanic weapons but

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.039 
as do most of the mechanic weapons but
if<00:03:08.459> you're<00:03:08.579> crafty<00:03:09.090> enough<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.450> player<00:03:09.719> you

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
if you're crafty enough of a player you

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.319 
if you're crafty enough of a player you
can<00:03:10.439> make<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.069> work<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.579> certainly<00:03:12.030> will<00:03:12.180> be

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
can make it work you certainly will be

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.569 
can make it work you certainly will be
racking<00:03:12.780> up<00:03:12.870> all<00:03:13.019> kinds<00:03:13.769> of<00:03:13.829> kill<00:03:14.040> streaks<00:03:14.370> and

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
racking up all kinds of kill streaks and

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.580 
racking up all kinds of kill streaks and
sitting<00:03:14.969> on<00:03:15.090> top<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.389> scoreboard<00:03:15.629> but<00:03:16.409> the

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
sitting on top of the scoreboard but the

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.709 
sitting on top of the scoreboard but the
800<00:03:16.980> rounds<00:03:17.219> per<00:03:17.250> minute<00:03:17.489> is<00:03:17.760> not<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.359> worst

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:18.719 
800 rounds per minute is not the worst

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:20.270 
800 rounds per minute is not the worst
thing<00:03:19.079> in<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.200> world<00:03:19.469> but<00:03:19.769> don't<00:03:19.980> let<00:03:20.069> me<00:03:20.159> fool

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
thing in the world but don't let me fool

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.129 
thing in the world but don't let me fool
you<00:03:20.519> basically<00:03:21.000> everything<00:03:21.599> about<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:21.930> gun

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
you basically everything about this gun

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.129 
you basically everything about this gun
is<00:03:22.409> at<00:03:22.799> best<00:03:23.159> mediocre<00:03:23.819> but<00:03:24.569> on<00:03:24.689> the<00:03:24.780> maps<00:03:24.959> like

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
is at best mediocre but on the maps like

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.599 
is at best mediocre but on the maps like
bank<00:03:25.319> job<00:03:25.500> in<00:03:25.530> downtown<00:03:26.010> if<00:03:26.159> you<00:03:26.250> pick<00:03:26.459> your

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
bank job in downtown if you pick your

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.580 
bank job in downtown if you pick your
engagement<00:03:27.060> carefully<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.780> should<00:03:27.810> be<00:03:28.319> fine

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
engagement carefully you should be fine

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.800 
engagement carefully you should be fine
just<00:03:29.069> don't<00:03:29.609> try<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.819> spray<00:03:30.209> everyone<00:03:30.599> down

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
just don't try to spray everyone down

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.899 
just don't try to spray everyone down
like<00:03:31.109> Chris<00:03:31.500> or<00:03:31.829> you'll<00:03:32.069> definitely<00:03:32.730> get

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
like Chris or you'll definitely get

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.909 
like Chris or you'll definitely get
yourself<00:03:33.030> shot<00:03:33.569> in<00:03:33.689> the<00:03:33.750> face<00:03:34.019> now<00:03:34.590> before<00:03:34.889> I

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
yourself shot in the face now before I

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.530 
yourself shot in the face now before I
get<00:03:35.069> into<00:03:35.189> the<00:03:35.310> second<00:03:35.639> weapon<00:03:35.730> I'd<00:03:36.120> also<00:03:36.299> like

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
get into the second weapon I'd also like

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.629 
get into the second weapon I'd also like
to<00:03:36.689> add<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:37.079> he<00:03:37.260> actually<00:03:37.859> teaches<00:03:38.159> us<00:03:38.489> a

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
to add that he actually teaches us a

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.729 
to add that he actually teaches us a
valuable<00:03:39.150> lesson<00:03:39.599> about<00:03:39.629> hardline<00:03:40.260> which<00:03:40.590> is

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
valuable lesson about hardline which is

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.800 
valuable lesson about hardline which is
actually<00:03:41.159> quite<00:03:41.370> simple<00:03:41.669> just<00:03:42.180> like<00:03:42.269> Dan<00:03:42.599> Cook

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
actually quite simple just like Dan Cook

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.869 
actually quite simple just like Dan Cook
said<00:03:43.109> it's<00:03:43.439> always<00:03:43.739> that<00:03:44.129> last-second

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
said it's always that last-second

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.280 
said it's always that last-second
replacement<00:03:44.909> guy<00:03:45.569> that<00:03:45.870> will<00:03:46.019> goof

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
replacement guy that will goof

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.349 
replacement guy that will goof
everything<00:03:47.129> up<00:03:47.280> for<00:03:47.549> you<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:48.030> I'm<00:03:48.120> sure<00:03:48.269> you

guys remember this guy right don't ever

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.949 
guys remember this guy right don't ever

let this guy into your squad that guy's
the<00:03:55.169> equivalent<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:55.829> those<00:03:55.980> clowns<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.549> see

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
the equivalent of those clowns you see

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
final score of the movie this one is

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.900 
final score of the movie this one is
actually<00:05:31.740> pretty<00:05:31.890> special<00:05:32.400> because<00:05:32.640> he<00:05:32.790> does

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
actually pretty special because he does

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
actually pretty special because he does
quite<00:05:33.090> a<00:05:33.210> bit<00:05:33.390> of<00:05:33.480> running<00:05:33.630> and<00:05:33.810> gunning

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
quite a bit of running and gunning

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.960 
quite a bit of running and gunning
through<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.410> plaza<00:05:34.680> almost<00:05:35.370> as<00:05:35.520> if<00:05:35.730> he's

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
through the plaza almost as if he's

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.430 
through the plaza almost as if he's
actually<00:05:36.210> playing<00:05:36.690> a<00:05:36.810> first-person<00:05:37.200> shooter

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
actually playing a first-person shooter

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.320 
actually playing a first-person shooter
like<00:05:37.800> hardline<00:05:38.310> but<00:05:38.610> as<00:05:38.760> for<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.030> weapon<00:05:39.270> in

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
like hardline but as for the weapon in

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.630 
like hardline but as for the weapon in
the<00:05:39.390> game<00:05:39.600> it's<00:05:40.020> really<00:05:40.320> not<00:05:41.130> that<00:05:41.190> great

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
the game it's really not that great

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.520 
the game it's really not that great
especially<00:05:42.240> without<00:05:42.510> attachments<00:05:43.200> it<00:05:43.320> is

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
especially without attachments it is

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.250 
especially without attachments it is
genuinely<00:05:44.190> not<00:05:44.850> very<00:05:45.360> impressive<00:05:46.020> now

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
genuinely not very impressive now

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.960 
genuinely not very impressive now
obviously<00:05:46.680> most<00:05:47.340> of<00:05:47.490> you<00:05:47.580> don't<00:05:47.790> have<00:05:47.880> it

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
obviously most of you don't have it

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.460 
obviously most of you don't have it
unlocked<00:05:48.270> because<00:05:48.510> it's<00:05:48.810> only<00:05:48.960> available<00:05:49.110> via

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
unlocked because it's only available via

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.680 
unlocked because it's only available via
the<00:05:49.770> operator<00:05:50.280> syndicate<00:05:50.820> assignment<00:05:50.880> but

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
the operator syndicate assignment but

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.230 
the operator syndicate assignment but
allow<00:05:51.870> me<00:05:52.020> to<00:05:52.110> tell<00:05:52.290> you<00:05:52.380> right<00:05:52.530> now<00:05:53.240> totally

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.560 
allow me to tell you right now totally
not<00:05:54.510> worth<00:05:54.870> it<00:05:55.140> not<00:05:55.470> worth

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.630 

not<00:05:59.570> at<00:05:59.780> all<00:05:59.930> worth<00:06:00.260> and<00:06:00.650> it's<00:06:01.010> pretty<00:06:01.310> simple

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
not at all worth and it's pretty simple

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.240 
not at all worth and it's pretty simple
as<00:06:01.970> to<00:06:02.240> why<00:06:02.420> basically<00:06:03.200> it<00:06:03.410> has<00:06:03.560> very<00:06:03.830> average

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
as to why basically it has very average

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.240 
as to why basically it has very average
damage<00:06:04.580> average<00:06:05.570> range<00:06:05.900> and<00:06:06.260> a<00:06:06.440> terrible<00:06:07.040> rate

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
damage average range and a terrible rate

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.760 
damage average range and a terrible rate
of<00:06:07.370> fire<00:06:07.610> that's<00:06:08.030> right<00:06:08.480> now<00:06:09.200> I<00:06:09.230> know<00:06:09.380> many<00:06:09.590> of

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
of fire that's right now I know many of

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.290 
of fire that's right now I know many of
you<00:06:09.830> will<00:06:10.040> try<00:06:10.160> to<00:06:10.220> push<00:06:10.490> back<00:06:10.730> on<00:06:10.790> me<00:06:11.090> saying

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
you will try to push back on me saying

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.510 
you will try to push back on me saying
that<00:06:11.510> it<00:06:11.600> has<00:06:11.720> 51<00:06:12.140> rounds<00:06:12.680> which<00:06:12.830> is<00:06:12.980> much<00:06:13.250> more

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
that it has 51 rounds which is much more

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.220 
that it has 51 rounds which is much more
than<00:06:13.730> any<00:06:14.000> of<00:06:14.150> the<00:06:14.240> other<00:06:14.390> assault<00:06:14.750> rifles<00:06:14.780> but

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
than any of the other assault rifles but

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.080 
than any of the other assault rifles but
in<00:06:15.350> my<00:06:15.470> book<00:06:15.740> that's<00:06:16.130> completely<00:06:16.760> irrelevant

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
in my book that's completely irrelevant

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.690 
in my book that's completely irrelevant
it<00:06:17.780> simply<00:06:18.260> doesn't<00:06:18.530> kill<00:06:18.890> fast<00:06:19.190> enough<00:06:19.550> and

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
it simply doesn't kill fast enough and

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.370 
it simply doesn't kill fast enough and
you're<00:06:19.880> probably<00:06:20.120> dead<00:06:20.600> before<00:06:20.810> you<00:06:21.020> can<00:06:21.140> fire

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
you're probably dead before you can fire

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.380 
you're probably dead before you can fire
all<00:06:21.620> those<00:06:21.770> rounds<00:06:22.010> anyways<00:06:22.580> so<00:06:23.030> when<00:06:23.150> people

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
all those rounds anyways so when people

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.090 
all those rounds anyways so when people
always<00:06:23.510> tell<00:06:23.780> me<00:06:23.870> in<00:06:23.930> my<00:06:23.960> stream<00:06:24.320> oh<00:06:24.470> my<00:06:24.590> god

like having five billion dollars handed

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.340 
like having five billion dollars handed
to<00:06:34.430> you<00:06:34.520> on<00:06:34.640> your<00:06:34.790> deathbed<00:06:35.000> sure<00:06:35.720> it's<00:06:36.050> handy

be<00:06:38.510> able<00:06:38.630> to<00:06:38.780> use<00:06:39.050> the<00:06:39.380> majority<00:06:40.070> of<00:06:40.190> it<00:06:40.370> before

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
be able to use the majority of it before

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.640 
be able to use the majority of it before
you<00:06:40.790> die<00:06:41.210> but<00:06:41.780> I<00:06:41.840> guess<00:06:42.020> it<00:06:42.170> is<00:06:42.320> still<00:06:42.530> pretty

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650
