00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
about her complete background however we

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.780 
about her complete background however we

know that she was surrendered at the

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.569 
know that she was surrendered at the

unfortunate I think the only thing

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.130 
unfortunate I think the only thing
holding<00:00:42.280> Shelby<00:00:42.850> back<00:00:43.030> is<00:00:43.240> her<00:00:43.480> age<00:00:43.690> when

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.140 
holding Shelby back is her age when
people<00:00:44.440> here<00:00:44.620> ten<00:00:44.860> years<00:00:44.890> old<00:00:45.250> it<00:00:45.520> scares<00:00:45.880> them

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
but I had a cat who lived to be 23 and

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.790 
but I had a cat who lived to be 23 and
it's<00:00:49.240> not<00:00:49.390> that<00:00:49.570> uncommon<00:00:49.900> so<00:00:50.320> she's<00:00:50.530> got
