putting it on the big sister let me see
I<00:04:14.070> suspect<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.209> might<00:04:15.330> be<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.510> bit<00:04:15.660> small

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.790 

let<00:04:19.680> me<00:04:20.010> see<00:04:20.250> if<00:04:20.370> I<00:04:20.459> pull<00:04:20.700> it<00:04:20.730> over<00:04:21.560> don't<00:04:22.560> think

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
let me see if I pull it over don't think

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.290 
let me see if I pull it over don't think
the<00:04:22.890> elastic<00:04:23.340> is<00:04:23.430> going<00:04:23.670> to<00:04:23.790> stretch<00:04:24.030> far

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
the elastic is going to stretch far

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.340 
the elastic is going to stretch far
enough<00:04:24.330> so<00:04:24.960> I<00:04:25.850> will<00:04:26.850> try<00:04:27.120> it<00:04:27.270> on<00:04:27.810> one<00:04:28.140> of<00:04:28.170> the

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
enough so I will try it on one of the

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.310 
enough so I will try it on one of the
babies<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:29.250> think<00:04:29.910> it<00:04:30.030> might<00:04:30.210> be<00:04:30.240> knocked<00:04:31.170> over

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
big sistering and I think it might be

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.150 
big sistering and I think it might be
the<00:04:32.790> right<00:04:32.970> size<00:04:33.270> for<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.600> babies<00:04:33.990> so<00:04:34.860> coming

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
to focus into the baby and let me see

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.960 
to focus into the baby and let me see
