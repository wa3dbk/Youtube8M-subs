throw it through the X it may take you

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.000 
throw it through the X it may take you
several<00:00:42.070> throw<00:00:42.489> throws<00:00:43.000> to<00:00:43.210> do<00:00:43.360> this<00:00:44.010> lower

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
several throw throws to do this lower

off the tennis ball and tie it to the
hula<00:00:49.600> hoop<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:51.160> this<00:00:51.309> example<00:00:51.670> we<00:00:52.030> are<00:00:52.059> using

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
hula hoop for this example we are using

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.420 
hula hoop for this example we are using
yellow<00:00:52.809> ribbon<00:00:53.170> instead<00:00:53.590> of<00:00:53.710> fishing<00:00:54.039> line<00:00:54.190> so

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
yellow ribbon instead of fishing line so

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.690 
yellow ribbon instead of fishing line so
that<00:00:55.030> you<00:00:55.090> can<00:00:55.270> see<00:00:55.420> it<00:00:55.539> better<00:00:55.719> now<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:57.520> one

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
that you can see it better now that one

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.700 
that you can see it better now that one
is<00:00:57.730> tied<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:58.300> the<00:00:58.390> hoop<00:00:58.600> take<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.410> other<00:00:59.620> end

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
is tied to the hoop take the other end

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.439 
is tied to the hoop take the other end
and<00:01:00.010> find<00:01:00.190> something<00:01:00.430> stable<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:00.969> tie<00:01:01.149> it<00:01:01.210> to

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
and find something stable to tie it to

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.709 
and find something stable to tie it to
for<00:01:02.320> us<00:01:02.500> we<00:01:02.980> have<00:01:03.100> a<00:01:03.129> press<00:01:03.430> box<00:01:03.640> up<00:01:03.940> high<00:01:04.149> with

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:04.719 
for us we have a press box up high with

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:07.429 
for us we have a press box up high with
two<00:01:04.929> metal<00:01:05.079> supports<00:01:05.590> that<00:01:05.709> we<00:01:05.829> can<00:01:06.009> tie<00:01:06.189> to

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
two metal supports that we can tie to

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.649 
two metal supports that we can tie to
repeat<00:01:08.439> this<00:01:08.590> process<00:01:08.859> four<00:01:09.429> times<00:01:09.729> having

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
repeat this process four times having

repeat this process four times having
four<00:01:10.929> strings<00:01:11.289> makes<00:01:11.560> it<00:01:11.679> easy<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:12.039> keep<00:01:12.279> the

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:12.459 
four strings makes it easy to keep the

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:14.999 
four strings makes it easy to keep the

sitting on a table this allows us to

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.460 
sitting on a table this allows us to
work<00:01:55.530> without<00:01:55.770> being<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.370> the<00:01:56.400> floor<00:01:56.760> in<00:01:57.470> this
