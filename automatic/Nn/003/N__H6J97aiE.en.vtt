00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.469 
him a striker and there you can see he
has<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.380> 91<00:01:25.979> pace<00:01:26.369> however<00:01:26.640> he<00:01:27.030> has<00:01:27.270> dropped

down to the 69 rating overall which will

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.240 
down to the 69 rating overall which will
probably<00:01:29.790> hurt<00:01:30.689> his<00:01:31.110> value<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.950> purely

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
probably hurt his value just purely

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.100 
probably hurt his value just purely
because<00:01:32.400> he<00:01:32.700> won't<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.240> rare<00:01:33.509> as<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:33.810> he<00:01:33.960> was

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
because he won't be as rare as if he was

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.560 
because he won't be as rare as if he was
a<00:01:34.140> high<00:01:34.500> rated<00:01:35.040> player<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:36.060> we've<00:01:36.270> looked<00:01:36.390> at

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
a high rated player so we've looked at

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.840 
a high rated player so we've looked at
the<00:01:36.630> 8a<00:01:37.020> our<00:01:37.259> next<00:01:37.590> player<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.829> going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.400> dr

it's dropped off on pace and passing but

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.540 
it's dropped off on pace and passing but
it's<00:02:09.990> also<00:02:10.260> gained<00:02:10.590> on<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.160> likes<00:02:11.370> of

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430

for the army and it's quite

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.540 
for the army and it's quite

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
next up we have a bond what everyone was

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.820 
next up we have a bond what everyone was
so<00:02:39.060> worried<00:02:40.050> that<00:02:40.080> he<00:02:40.260> was<00:02:40.410> going<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.680> be<00:02:40.800> a

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
so worried that he was going to be a

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.130 
so worried that he was going to be a
left<00:02:41.070> winger<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.550> year<00:02:41.850> but<00:02:42.330> thankfully<00:02:42.990> he

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
left winger this year but thankfully he

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.890 
left winger this year but thankfully he
is<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.380> striker<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.520> can<00:02:44.670> see<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.120> he's

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
is a striker and you can see that he's

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.600 
is a striker and you can see that he's
probably<00:02:46.170> one<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.709> strongest<00:02:46.920> silvers<00:02:47.459> on

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
probably one of the strongest silvers on

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.190 
probably one of the strongest silvers on
the<00:02:47.730> game<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.150> think<00:02:48.450> he's<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.630> most<00:02:48.750> expensive

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the game I think he's the most expensive

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.140 
the game I think he's the most expensive
silver<00:02:49.650> there<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.070> at<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.310> moment<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.850> you

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
silver there is at the moment and you

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.760 
silver there is at the moment and you
can<00:02:51.300> see<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.630> he<00:02:51.810> has<00:02:51.930> 90<00:02:52.350> pace<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.709> year

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
can see that he has 90 pace this year

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.640 
can see that he has 90 pace this year
however<00:02:53.580> last<00:02:53.760> he<00:02:53.940> he<00:02:54.090> had<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.209> 93<00:02:54.810> pace<00:02:55.080> so

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
however last he he had a 93 pace so

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.260 
however last he he had a 93 pace so
whether<00:02:56.070> it'll<00:02:56.250> be<00:02:56.370> as<00:02:56.520> good<00:02:56.730> as<00:02:56.820> he<00:02:56.910> was<00:02:57.060> last

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
whether it'll be as good as he was last

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.820 
whether it'll be as good as he was last
is<00:02:57.540> we'll<00:02:58.050> have<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.320> wait<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.590> see<00:02:58.620> he's

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
is we'll have to wait and see he's

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.160 
is we'll have to wait and see he's
dropped<00:02:59.070> one<00:02:59.220> rating<00:02:59.640> point<00:02:59.880> as<00:03:00.000> well<00:03:00.239> but<00:03:00.720> you

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
dropped one rating point as well but you

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.780 
dropped one rating point as well but you
know<00:03:01.290> he's<00:03:01.470> been<00:03:01.620> slowly<00:03:01.950> dropping<00:03:02.340> over<00:03:02.700> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
know he's been slowly dropping over the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.810 
know he's been slowly dropping over the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.330 
came on to the game for Crystal Palace
decent<00:03:39.990> pace<00:03:40.140> he's<00:03:40.350> been<00:03:40.530> very<00:03:40.770> always<00:03:41.160> had

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
decent pace he's been very always had

which<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.900> strange<00:03:46.260> considering<00:03:46.740> it's<00:03:47.010> gone

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
which is strange considering it's gone

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.800 
which is strange considering it's gone
from<00:03:47.280> like<00:03:47.490> a<00:03:47.520> striker<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.180> right<00:03:48.420> wing<00:03:48.630> and

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
from like a striker to a right wing and

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.970 
from like a striker to a right wing and
you'd<00:03:48.930> expect<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.380> right<00:03:49.560> winger<00:03:49.740> to<00:03:49.890> be

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
you'd expect the right winger to be

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.190 
you'd expect the right winger to be
doing<00:03:50.250> more<00:03:50.550> defensive<00:03:51.090> work<00:03:51.270> than<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.840> striker

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
doing more defensive work than a striker

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.750 
doing more defensive work than a striker
but<00:03:52.530> you<00:03:52.770> know<00:03:52.890> he's<00:03:53.070> dropped<00:03:53.310> off<00:03:53.460> on<00:03:53.610> that
