anticipated retractable stairs now I

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.160 
anticipated retractable stairs now I
posted<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.759> video<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.000> while<00:00:12.150> ago<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.929> lot<00:00:13.110> of

posted a video a while ago and a lot of
you<00:00:13.259> guys<00:00:13.290> wondering<00:00:13.830> how<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.920> make<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:14.549> i

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
you guys wondering how to make this so i

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.970 
you guys wondering how to make this so i
made<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.750> basic<00:00:16.350> setup<00:00:16.590> what<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.859> should

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
made this basic setup what it should

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.429 
made this basic setup what it should
look<00:00:17.010> like<00:00:17.130> as<00:00:17.690> that<00:00:18.690> before<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.109> step<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.380> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
look like as that before you step in the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.439 
look like as that before you step in the
pressure<00:00:19.590> plate<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.100> wait<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:21.240> walk

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
pressure plate and you wait and you walk

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.070 
pressure plate and you wait and you walk
up<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.660> stairs<00:00:23.390> now<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> make<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.810> it's

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
up the stairs now to make this it's

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.790 
up the stairs now to make this it's
quite<00:00:25.410> simple<00:00:26.269> what<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.390> want<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.660> do<00:00:28.429> is<00:00:29.429> a

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
quite simple what you want to do is a

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.660 
quite simple what you want to do is a
set<00:00:31.800> up<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.040> line<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.399> stairs<00:00:32.640> as<00:00:32.880> so

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.259 

and<00:00:37.120> then<00:00:37.359> you<00:00:37.449> want<00:00:37.570> to<00:00:37.719> add<00:00:39.000> sticky<00:00:40.000> plates

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
and then you want to add sticky plates

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.810 
and then you want to add sticky plates
to<00:00:40.539> the<00:00:40.570> side<00:00:40.899> of<00:00:41.050> each<00:00:41.140> stair<00:00:41.469> and<00:00:41.710> then<00:00:42.699> on

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
to the side of each stair and then on

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.889 
to the side of each stair and then on
top<00:00:42.969> of<00:00:43.030> each<00:00:43.149> tick<00:00:43.329> you<00:00:43.420> playground<00:00:43.809> the

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
top of each tick you playground the

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.950 
top of each tick you playground the
block<00:00:44.170> with<00:00:44.649> a<00:00:44.680> redstone<00:00:45.070> line<00:00:45.780> going<00:00:46.780> all<00:00:46.839> the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
block with a redstone line going all the

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.930 
block with a redstone line going all the
way<00:00:47.019> down<00:00:48.839> it's<00:00:49.839> pretty<00:00:50.050> basic<00:00:50.260> setup<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.879> if

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
way down it's pretty basic setup so if

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.020 
way down it's pretty basic setup so if
you<00:00:52.089> look<00:00:52.239> at<00:00:52.359> it<00:00:52.420> you<00:00:52.539> can<00:00:52.570> figure<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:52.960> out<00:00:53.049> and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
you look at it you can figure it out and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.479 
you look at it you can figure it out and
the<00:00:55.030> wire<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.600> underlying<00:00:56.229> make<00:00:57.070> it<00:00:57.159> go<00:00:57.250> under

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
the wire the underlying make it go under

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.060 
the wire the underlying make it go under
here<00:00:58.079> alright<00:00:59.079> then<00:00:59.199> both<00:00:59.379> go<00:00:59.589> under<00:00:59.799> and<00:00:59.979> then

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
here alright then both go under and then

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:08.010 
here alright then both go under and then
I<00:01:00.299> set<00:01:01.299> up<00:01:01.390> for<00:01:05.250> former<00:01:06.250> Peters<00:01:06.580> so<00:01:07.360> it<00:01:07.869> makes

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
I set up for former Peters so it makes

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.070 
I set up for former Peters so it makes
it<00:01:08.140> so<00:01:08.289> that<00:01:08.320> uh<00:01:08.640> whoops<00:01:09.690> so<00:01:10.690> it<00:01:10.780> makes<00:01:10.899> it<00:01:11.020> that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
it so that uh whoops so it makes it that

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.370 
it so that uh whoops so it makes it that
uh<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:13.060> you<00:01:13.659> have<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.899> stand<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.259> pressure

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
uh it you have to stand the pressure

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.130 
uh it you have to stand the pressure
plate<00:01:14.649> for<00:01:15.009> a<00:01:15.039> few<00:01:15.429> seconds<00:01:15.819> or<00:01:16.060> else<00:01:16.240> you<00:01:16.960> just

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
plate for a few seconds or else you just

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.740 
plate for a few seconds or else you just
step<00:01:17.259> in<00:01:17.350> for<00:01:17.470> one<00:01:17.619> second<00:01:17.920> or<00:01:18.009> work<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.450> I

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
step in for one second or work and I

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.139 
step in for one second or work and I
have<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:20.319> Redstone<00:01:20.890> coming<00:01:21.220> up<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.580> one<00:01:21.819> block

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
have the Redstone coming up to one block

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.240 
have the Redstone coming up to one block
under<00:01:22.659> where<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.840> pressure<00:01:23.020> plates<00:01:23.289> are<00:01:23.440> so

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
under where the pressure plates are so

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.340 
under where the pressure plates are so
basically<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.610> circuit<00:01:24.880> starts<00:01:25.030> like<00:01:25.240> this

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
basically the circuit starts like this

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.090 
basically the circuit starts like this
it<00:01:26.459> creates<00:01:27.459> a<00:01:27.670> circuit<00:01:28.590> which<00:01:29.590> generates

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
it creates a circuit which generates

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.210 
it creates a circuit which generates
from<00:01:30.700> there<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:31.030> here<00:01:31.360> it<00:01:32.319> comes<00:01:32.619> down<00:01:32.799> this

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
from there to here it comes down this

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.419 
from there to here it comes down this
trail<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:35.350> goes<00:01:35.409> needs<00:01:35.830> appear<00:01:36.069> it<00:01:36.310> goes

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
trail that goes needs appear it goes

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.889 
trail that goes needs appear it goes
repeaters<00:01:36.880> takes<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.149> few<00:01:37.360> seconds<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:37.780> go

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
repeaters takes a few seconds to go

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.870 
repeaters takes a few seconds to go
through<00:01:38.080> each<00:01:38.110> one<00:01:38.789> then<00:01:39.789> goes<00:01:40.000> up<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.299> stairs

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.029 

and<00:01:42.969> boom<00:01:43.840> activate<00:01:44.560> activate<00:01:44.710> activate

activate and I'll push up the stairs and

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.929 
activate and I'll push up the stairs and
make<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.460> stairs<00:01:49.450> out<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:50.469> set<00:01:50.680> them<00:01:50.799> out<00:01:50.939> now

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
make a stairs out and set them out now

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.179 
make a stairs out and set them out now
right<00:01:52.119> now<00:01:52.299> if<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.479> look<00:01:52.570> at<00:01:52.659> this<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:52.869> mean<00:01:53.189> so

I'm very difficult to get up you swell

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.090 
I'm very difficult to get up you swell
up<00:01:55.929> here<00:01:56.140> so<00:01:57.039> that's<00:01:57.159> why<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.369> added<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:59.100> you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
up here so that's why I added the you

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:08.150 
up here so that's why I added the you
add<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.429> blocks<00:02:00.700> on<00:02:00.939> top<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.829> the<00:02:02.979> stairs

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.700 

oops<00:02:09.630> if<00:02:10.630> you<00:02:10.810> have<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:10.990> blocks<00:02:11.230> on<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.530> top

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
oops if you have the blocks on the top

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.190 
oops if you have the blocks on the top
of<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.890> stairs

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
of the stairs

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.290 
of the stairs
and<00:02:13.590> there's<00:02:13.980> no<00:02:14.160> way<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.610> people<00:02:14.849> can<00:02:15.150> get

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
and there's no way that people can get

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.900 
and there's no way that people can get
up
