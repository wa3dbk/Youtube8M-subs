00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
being in the Caribbean is that they have

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.400 
being in the Caribbean is that they have
no<00:00:26.369> natural<00:00:26.519> predators<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.869> local<00:00:28.230> fish

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
that fear response when they encountered

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.970 
that fear response when they encountered
a<00:00:42.690> lionfish<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> way<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.680> they<00:00:43.770> would

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
a lionfish in the way that they would

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.220 
a lionfish in the way that they would
with<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> large<00:00:44.489> grouper<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.239> example<00:00:45.690> all

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
with a large grouper for example all

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.660 
with a large grouper for example all
right<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.559> got<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> lionfish<00:00:47.039> here<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.550> is

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
right so we got a lionfish here this is

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.220 
right so we got a lionfish here this is
quite<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> small<00:00:48.149> one<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.780> wanted<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.079> show

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
here community researcher tide is going

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.380 
here community researcher tide is going
to<00:01:33.689> show<00:01:34.409> how<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> fillet<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.369> fish<00:01:35.430> some

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
to show how to fillet this fish some

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.870 
to show how to fillet this fish some
people<00:01:36.659> cut<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> spines<00:01:37.200> off<00:01:37.759> we're<00:01:38.759> not

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
people cut the spines off we're not

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.370 
people cut the spines off we're not
going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.479> personally<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.290> don't

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
going to do that personally I don't

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.050 
going to do that personally I don't
think<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.040> necessary<00:01:41.549> if<00:01:41.820> you're

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
think that it's necessary if you're

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.960 
think that it's necessary if you're
filleting<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> fish<00:01:43.520> carefully<00:01:44.520> incorrectly

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
filleting the fish carefully incorrectly

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.639 
filleting the fish carefully incorrectly
going<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> right<00:01:45.600> way<00:01:45.659> then<00:01:46.290> there<00:01:46.470> shouldn't

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
going the right way then there shouldn't

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.160 
going the right way then there shouldn't
be<00:01:46.740> any<00:01:46.920> need<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.570> increase<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> risk<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.990> you

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
be any need to increase the risk of you

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.660 
be any need to increase the risk of you
hurting<00:01:49.649> yourself<00:01:50.040> while<00:01:50.399> you're<00:01:50.490> cutting

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
hurting yourself while you're cutting

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.270 
hurting yourself while you're cutting
off<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:50.970> spines<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.799> keep<00:01:52.979> cutting<00:01:53.250> it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
off the spines so just keep cutting it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.999 
off the spines so just keep cutting it
nice<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.549> clean<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.119> bone<00:01:54.180> there<00:01:54.860> this<00:01:55.860> is

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
nice and clean to the bone there this is

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.520
