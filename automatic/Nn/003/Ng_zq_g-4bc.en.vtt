00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.260
 hi i am andre and this is the blue one 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.940
 assent measures a smartphone under the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.450
 tablets, or a tablet to the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.450
 smartphones 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.900
 included with the meent is a headset 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.410
 a charger a micro usb cable and it 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.410
 device itself 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.320
 if the huawei measurement holds your hands 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.920
 Immediately stands out that he is really huge 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.939
 is 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.070
 that is of course due to the large 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.660
 screen it is finely finished with a 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.250
 kind of rubbery finish at the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.910
 back so you have a good grip 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.160
 have 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.390
 ok you have it in your hand you are anyway 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.799
 still have fairly good grip 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.659
 instantly get the idea that it is out of your hands 

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:41.729
 will slide the front wind one more 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:43.680
 front facing camera and a speaker grill 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:45.690
 its 6.1 inch screen with a hd ready 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.159
 resolution of 720 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.309
 then we will look at the bottom there 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.479
 a microphone and a micro-usb port 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.640
 go to find the right-hand side 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.049
 volume keys and the on and off button on 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.839
 at the top we find a headset port 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:59.280
 and two the microphone and the SIM card slot 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.979
 on the left we find a micro 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.199
 find the sd card slot on the back 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.030
 we still have the camera with flash 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.439
 it is an 8 megapixel camera and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.070
 at the bottom right you will find another one 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.110
 speaker grill and the incitement terms with 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.970
 and we will use it immediately stands out 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.500
 that of course he runs on android 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.810
 and in this case on android 4 point one 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.610
 point 2 we also see that there is a skin of it 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.900
 where we ourselves are about to the skin 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.910
 is quite interesting he is different 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.740
 themes that you can choose from then 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.700
 can then download again 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.980
 you can also do the themes yourself 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.930
 and what is striking is that none 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.160
 has a separate screen where all applications 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.570
 end up in 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.190
 but you just scroll through 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.380
 to the to the following tabs 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.760
 all applications end up there 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.770
 bit she will actually have 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.540
 as seen at apple 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.190
 of course this can also manage through 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.930
 you can pinch different ones again 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.330
 add tabs and the home tab 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.220
 assign can also again according to even 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.780
 back to what is naturally the most 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.400
 the eye catches is the screen with eps 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.840
 panel let's see how 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.770
 that looks like a movie in it 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.060
 start with its 720 p screen and we 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.300
 can also immediately see how that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.300
 looks like 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.830
 also belong the same as the sound we see 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.930
 that the screen just really really sharp 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.080
 It's a shame in itself 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.180
 is not a full hd screen but it is late 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.440
 see everything very clearly 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.510
 so if you also see it just looks 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.680
 beautiful and go back again 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.840
 well for the rest everything is running very well 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.760
 smoothly and quickly through the one and a half 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.590
 gerrits quad-core processor that is in it 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.360
 is also found here in notification screen 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.700
 some more additions and some 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.170
 interesting is that it 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.430
 settings screen is standard as see 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.320
 I actually only have a few small ones 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.120
 settings here that run setting 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.040
 for dolby digital plus for the sound 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.960
 but if they click on everything then see 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.880
 we just come back and see everything again 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.160
 then some adjustments in terms of woe 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.020
 as scroll down here 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.520
 here activities with a hand of 4 can 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.340
 so contracted that certain things 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.780
 easier to get the opinion with one 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.880
 hand operate in the device because you 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.260
 of course yes not with your thumb everywhere 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.860
 can end up if you minus a hand 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.270
 likes 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.560
 sconnie different options 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.060
 make that easier also to it 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.080
 customize the keyboard 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.630
 no, I can also do it again 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.220
 turn on a floating key that turns on 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.840
 got a test that floats to it 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.120
 who can drop here if you like 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.500
 click on it you can do something very quickly 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.450
 write a text message or example 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.770
 example has the cook open later 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.959
 there you can at your own discretion you can 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.440
 put it somewhere and the kitchen again 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.300
 turn of 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.709
 you are still a gloss if you like it 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.330
 and then reacts for example 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.160
 also on your nail 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.739
 the screen and of course also if you 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.570
 wear a glove 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.519
 we now also take a look at the 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.989
 photo functionality make my photos 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.769
 You can of course just press the photo button 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.820
 to press 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.320
 photos immediately end up in the 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.060
 Galleries can also focus on it 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.260
 Click the screen here to the 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.820
 find a number of options at the top 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.620
 of course the front facing camera too 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.209
 just take a look at them 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.430
 great for skype 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.290
 just looks sharp and clear well 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.300
 if we take a look at the pvc room 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.880
 8 megapixel camera photos are not 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.560
 super awesome its not too bad too 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.630
 just call it yes a bit one 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.010
 medium actually and we see another one here 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.930
 number of extra options that we can offer here 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.390
 and we also take a look at it 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.550
 the video 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.980
 we now see a video clip with the 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.860
 measures the movies recorded the maximum 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.790
 resolution of 1080 p and the sound comes 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.790
 from the device itself 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.170
 measuring the assent does not have one 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.180
 full hd screen and i also like that 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.440
 seen some more optimizations with 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.440
 regarding the large screen 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.960
 The battery of the Meent is exceptional 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.210
 good 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.320
 after a day of using this barely below 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.600
 the 50 percent 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.340
 in addition, an eps panel is a pleasure to be 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.090
 look at it and finally it is 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.480
 device also well put together with 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.060
 to be 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.650
 6.1-inch screen, the measurement will not be for 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.970
 suitable for everyone 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.260
 despite having a very large screen 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.510
 I think it's more like one 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.760
 smartphone than a tablet and in this 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.650
 niche market of large smartphones puts 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.169
 just a very nice product 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.240
 Do you want the quay assent measurement go

 See you next time
