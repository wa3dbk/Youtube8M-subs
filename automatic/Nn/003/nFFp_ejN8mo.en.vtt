I<00:02:34.180> think<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.630> could<00:02:35.470> be<00:02:35.560> wrong<00:02:35.680> on<00:02:35.830> that

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
I think I could be wrong on that

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.310 
I think I could be wrong on that
Amy<00:02:36.670> puts<00:02:36.880> out<00:02:37.000> like<00:02:37.120> 38<00:02:37.420> hundred<00:02:37.600> watts<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.170> a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
Amy puts out like 38 hundred watts and a

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.980 
Amy puts out like 38 hundred watts and a
half<00:02:38.560> ohm<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.250> three<00:02:39.490> and<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.670> half<00:02:39.850> K<00:02:40.210> puts<00:02:40.810> out

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
half ohm the three and a half K puts out

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.840 
half ohm the three and a half K puts out
four<00:02:41.260> thousand<00:02:41.890> six<00:02:42.100> hundred<00:02:42.190> watts<00:02:42.520> at<00:02:42.670> half

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
four thousand six hundred watts at half

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.600 
four thousand six hundred watts at half
own<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.960> that<00:02:44.320> means<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.190> puts<00:02:45.340> out<00:02:45.460> eight

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
own so that means it puts out eight

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.190 
own so that means it puts out eight
hundred<00:02:45.880> Watts<00:02:46.030> more<00:02:46.180> at<00:02:46.300> half<00:02:46.450> ohm<00:02:46.690> now<00:02:46.900> this

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
hundred Watts more at half ohm now this

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.390 
hundred Watts more at half ohm now this
thing<00:02:47.380> should<00:02:47.530> probably<00:02:47.680> put<00:02:47.860> more<00:02:48.040> than<00:02:48.340> that

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
thing should probably put more than that

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.160 
thing should probably put more than that
out<00:02:48.640> but<00:02:49.240> let's<00:02:49.420> just<00:02:49.630> say<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.810> puts<00:02:49.900> out<00:02:50.080> about

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
out but let's just say it puts out about

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.070 
out but let's just say it puts out about
the<00:02:50.350> same<00:02:50.530> at<00:02:50.710> half<00:02:50.830> owned<00:02:51.070> extra<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.930> this

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
the same at half owned extra so this

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.870 
the same at half owned extra so this
thing<00:02:53.290> should<00:02:53.500> do<00:02:53.710> six<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.160> half<00:02:54.190> K<00:02:54.610> at<00:02:54.760> her

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
thing should do six and a half K at her

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.320 
thing should do six and a half K at her
phone

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330

now<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.750> will<00:02:56.080> be<00:02:56.200> wiring<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.740> at<00:02:56.890> half<00:02:57.190> own<00:02:58.230> but

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
now I will be wiring it at half own but

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.410 
now I will be wiring it at half own but
obviously<00:02:59.800> with<00:03:00.010> box<00:03:00.250> raise<00:03:00.550> voltage<00:03:01.120> drop

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
obviously with box raise voltage drop

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.260 
obviously with box raise voltage drop
this<00:03:01.959> thing<00:03:02.020> should<00:03:02.380> still<00:03:02.800> because<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.850> even

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
this thing should still because it even

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.030 
this thing should still because it even
if<00:03:04.360> it<00:03:04.450> rises<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.870> 1<00:03:05.110> ohm<00:03:05.260> that's<00:03:05.620> fifty<00:03:05.950> eight

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
if it rises to 1 ohm that's fifty eight

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.680 
if it rises to 1 ohm that's fifty eight
hundred<00:03:06.070> watts<00:03:06.459> then<00:03:06.850> we<00:03:06.940> lose<00:03:07.150> some<00:03:07.330> voltage

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
hundred watts then we lose some voltage

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.930 
hundred watts then we lose some voltage
should<00:03:08.290> be<00:03:08.350> able<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.680> put<00:03:08.860> out<00:03:08.950> five<00:03:09.160> K<00:03:09.400> even

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
should be able to put out five K even

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.330 
should be able to put out five K even
with<00:03:10.300> voltage<00:03:10.690> in<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.470> mid<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.520> high<00:03:12.550> 12<00:03:14.340> so

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
with voltage in the mid to high 12 so

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.890 
with voltage in the mid to high 12 so
that<00:03:15.700> thing<00:03:15.940> was<00:03:16.120> probably<00:03:16.239> putting<00:03:16.570> out<00:03:16.750> with

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
that thing was probably putting out with

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.890 
that thing was probably putting out with
voltage<00:03:17.640> drop<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:18.880> box<00:03:19.209> rise<00:03:19.420> probably<00:03:19.840> in

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
voltage drop and box rise probably in

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.720 
voltage drop and box rise probably in
here<00:03:20.050> 2k<00:03:20.470> this<00:03:21.100> thing<00:03:21.250> can<00:03:21.340> be<00:03:21.430> put<00:03:21.580> in<00:03:21.640> there

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
here 2k this thing can be put in there

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.850 
here 2k this thing can be put in there
near<00:03:21.910> five<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:22.959> thing<00:03:23.170> will<00:03:23.380> do<00:03:23.560> over

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
near five so this thing will do over

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.520 
near five so this thing will do over
double<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.580> power<00:03:25.060> of<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.270> Colossus<00:03:25.660> now<00:03:26.260> I

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
double the power of the Colossus now I

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.440 
double the power of the Colossus now I
was<00:03:27.160> looking<00:03:27.310> at<00:03:27.520> a<00:03:27.580> few<00:03:27.730> other<00:03:27.850> amps<00:03:28.180> I<00:03:28.270> was

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
was looking at a few other amps I was

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.350 
was looking at a few other amps I was
looking<00:03:28.660> at<00:03:28.780> at<00:03:28.870> lens<00:03:29.080> off<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.590> seventh<00:03:29.950> K

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
looking at at lens off the seventh K

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.330 
looking at at lens off the seventh K
that's<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.540> half<00:03:31.840> ohm<00:03:32.080> 7<00:03:32.500> K<00:03:32.650> as<00:03:32.860> I<00:03:32.980> said<00:03:33.130> this<00:03:33.250> is

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
that's a half ohm 7 K as I said this is

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.500 
that's a half ohm 7 K as I said this is
probably<00:03:33.430> around<00:03:33.700> six<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.090> half<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.390> half

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
probably around six and a half and half

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.600 
probably around six and a half and half
own<00:03:34.690> so<00:03:34.870> very<00:03:35.110> similar<00:03:35.350> a<00:03:35.650> few<00:03:36.190> things<00:03:36.400> that

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
own so very similar a few things that

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.250 
own so very similar a few things that
don't<00:03:36.940> have<00:03:37.390> this<00:03:37.630> has<00:03:37.750> got<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.930> clicking

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
don't have this has got a clicking

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.780 
don't have this has got a clicking
indicator<00:03:38.650> on<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:38.860> base<00:03:39.130> of<00:03:39.160> control<00:03:39.640> um

something<00:03:40.360> I<00:03:40.420> really<00:03:40.690> like<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:41.830> the<00:03:42.100> lands<00:03:42.910> I

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
something I really like that the lands I

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.430 
something I really like that the lands I
did<00:03:43.269> not<00:03:43.420> have<00:03:43.600> you're<00:03:43.989> probably<00:03:44.019> looking<00:03:44.410> at

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
did not have you're probably looking at

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.740 
did not have you're probably looking at
that<00:03:44.590> thinking<00:03:44.860> that<00:03:45.250> Colossus<00:03:46.150> is<00:03:46.330> almost<00:03:46.570> as

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
that thinking that Colossus is almost as

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.229 
that thinking that Colossus is almost as
big<00:03:46.900> it's<00:03:47.530> not<00:03:47.680> as<00:03:47.800> long<00:03:48.010> but<00:03:48.250> it's<00:03:48.370> fatter<00:03:48.610> now

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
big it's not as long but it's fatter now

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.530 
big it's not as long but it's fatter now
this<00:03:49.540> thing<00:03:49.780> weighs<00:03:50.019> probably<00:03:50.820> 50<00:03:51.820> 60<00:03:51.850> percent

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
this thing weighs probably 50 60 percent

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.560

more<00:03:52.570> for<00:03:53.260> status<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:54.220> lot<00:03:54.610> solid<00:03:55.030> or<00:03:55.090> amp<00:03:55.239> and

it's<00:03:56.110> just<00:03:56.320> the<00:03:56.470> thing<00:03:56.739> is<00:03:56.860> that<00:03:57.130> thing<00:03:57.310> is

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
it's just the thing is that thing is

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.190 
it's just the thing is that thing is
nowhere<00:03:57.910> near<00:03:57.970> as<00:03:58.150> efficient<00:03:58.630> as<00:03:58.780> this<00:03:58.959> is

nowhere near as efficient as this is
that's<00:03:59.830> why<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.220> thing<00:04:00.459> weighs<00:04:00.640> that's<00:04:01.150> why

that's why that thing weighs that's why

that's why that thing weighs that's why
that<00:04:01.390> thing's<00:04:01.570> so<00:04:01.720> big<00:04:02.019> and<00:04:02.260> only<00:04:02.950> puts<00:04:03.130> out<00:04:03.250> 3

that thing's so big and only puts out 3
K<00:04:04.359> this<00:04:04.720> thing<00:04:04.900> will<00:04:05.019> put<00:04:05.170> out<00:04:05.290> easily<00:04:05.739> six<00:04:06.040> and

we<00:04:33.060> saw<00:04:33.210> hardly<00:04:33.540> use<00:04:33.720> low-pass<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:35.010> phase<00:04:35.370> and

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
we saw hardly use low-pass and phase and

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.360 
we saw hardly use low-pass and phase and
remote<00:04:36.750> input<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.830> then<00:04:37.950> we've<00:04:38.040> also<00:04:38.190> got

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
remote input and then we've also got

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.970 
remote input and then we've also got
down<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:39.000> current<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:40.260> output<00:04:40.290> master<00:04:40.920> an

down the current the output master an

down the current the output master an
input<00:04:41.310> slave<00:04:41.520> so<00:04:41.760> this<00:04:42.060> can<00:04:42.990> be<00:04:43.020> strapped<00:04:43.500> so

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
input slave so this can be strapped so

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.380 
input slave so this can be strapped so
you<00:04:44.010> can<00:04:44.100> get<00:04:44.220> two<00:04:44.340> of<00:04:44.370> these<00:04:44.580> strap<00:04:45.270> them

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
you can get two of these strap them

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.690 
you can get two of these strap them
together<00:04:45.860> if<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:46.950> was<00:04:47.070> going<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.250> strap<00:04:47.520> them

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
together if I was going to strap them

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.250 
together if I was going to strap them
you'd<00:04:47.850> strap<00:04:48.120> them<00:04:48.270> at<00:04:48.360> one<00:04:48.510> home<00:04:48.660> which<00:04:49.140> is

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
you'd strap them at one home which is

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.730 
you'd strap them at one home which is
like<00:04:49.440> halfway<00:04:49.680> meet<00:04:50.840> so<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:52.140> will<00:04:52.380> probably<00:04:52.530> be

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
like halfway meet so I will probably be

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.140 
like halfway meet so I will probably be
getting<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:52.980> second<00:04:53.310> in<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.430> future<00:04:53.730> when<00:04:54.120> I

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
getting a second in the future when I

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.720 
getting a second in the future when I
wore<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:54.570> jackaroo<00:04:55.610> but<00:04:56.610> anyway<00:04:56.820> guys<00:04:58.730> I've

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
wore the jackaroo but anyway guys I've

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.110 
wore the jackaroo but anyway guys I've
been<00:04:59.910> running<00:05:00.180> that<00:05:00.330> Colossus<00:05:00.840> for<00:05:02.120> over

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
been running that Colossus for over

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.860 
been running that Colossus for over
almost<00:05:03.300> a<00:05:03.720> year<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.610> for<00:05:05.610> about<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:05.850> last<00:05:06.420> six

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
almost a year and for about the last six

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.080 
almost a year and for about the last six
eight<00:05:07.380> months<00:05:07.740> so<00:05:07.890> I've<00:05:08.280> needed<00:05:08.550> more<00:05:08.820> power

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
eight months so I've needed more power

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.280 
eight months so I've needed more power
so<00:05:09.900> this<00:05:10.170> is<00:05:10.290> definitely<00:05:10.580> an<00:05:11.580> upgrade<00:05:11.700> a<00:05:12.330> much

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
so this is definitely an upgrade a much

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.940 
so this is definitely an upgrade a much
more<00:05:13.500> quality<00:05:13.919> amp<00:05:14.130> and<00:05:14.780> power<00:05:15.780> for<00:05:15.990> money<00:05:16.169> I

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
more quality amp and power for money I

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.950 
more quality amp and power for money I
got<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.400> half<00:05:17.580> owned<00:05:17.760> warranty<00:05:18.270> and<00:05:18.660> I

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
got the half owned warranty and I

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.180 
got the half owned warranty and I
obviously<00:05:19.050> got<00:05:19.320> a<00:05:19.380> ship<00:05:19.590> to<00:05:19.620> Australia<00:05:20.130> from

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
obviously got a ship to Australia from

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.940 
obviously got a ship to Australia from
America<00:05:20.730> and<00:05:21.180> it<00:05:21.600> cost<00:05:21.750> me<00:05:21.840> under<00:05:22.110> $1,300

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
America and it cost me under $1,300

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.200 
America and it cost me under $1,300
that's<00:05:23.340> not<00:05:24.240> bad<00:05:25.550> if<00:05:26.550> I<00:05:26.669> wanted<00:05:26.850> to<00:05:26.940> go<00:05:27.000> by

or oily next week we'll have the bench
from<00:06:17.820> the<00:06:17.880> base<00:06:18.030> car<00:06:18.270> yes<00:06:18.780> the<00:06:18.930> specs<00:06:19.200> of<00:06:19.290> the

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
from the base car yes the specs of the

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.540 
from the base car yes the specs of the
amp<00:06:19.640> and<00:06:20.640> the<00:06:20.760> RMS<00:06:21.800> righty<00:06:22.800> so<00:06:23.400> I've<00:06:23.490> been

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
amp and the RMS righty so I've been

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.240 
amp and the RMS righty so I've been
wiring<00:06:23.820> 1/2<00:06:24.240> own<00:06:24.510> but<00:06:24.810> with<00:06:25.020> box<00:06:25.290> wise<00:06:25.500> you

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
wiring 1/2 own but with box wise you

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.680 
wiring 1/2 own but with box wise you
know<00:06:26.280> which<00:06:26.850> should<00:06:27.060> it'll<00:06:27.300> probably<00:06:27.450> end<00:06:27.570> up

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
know which should it'll probably end up

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.590 
know which should it'll probably end up
rising<00:06:27.930> to<00:06:28.200> one<00:06:28.410> or<00:06:28.740> more<00:06:28.970> but<00:06:29.970> that<00:06:30.150> means<00:06:30.330> I

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
rising to one or more but that means I

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.070 
rising to one or more but that means I
can<00:06:30.960> easily<00:06:31.530> give<00:06:32.520> my<00:06:32.670> subs<00:06:33.120> double<00:06:33.660> the<00:06:33.900> power

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
can easily give my subs double the power

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.270 
can easily give my subs double the power
they're<00:06:34.320> getting<00:06:34.530> now<00:06:34.710> and<00:06:35.450> for<00:06:36.450> the<00:06:36.510> future

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
they're getting now and for the future

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.740 
they're getting now and for the future
something<00:06:38.280> from<00:06:38.790> their<00:06:38.940> range<00:06:39.180> have<00:06:39.420> also<00:06:39.540> got

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
something from their range have also got

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.010 
something from their range have also got
some<00:06:39.780> new<00:06:39.990> components<00:06:40.560> I<00:06:40.620> like<00:06:40.770> to
