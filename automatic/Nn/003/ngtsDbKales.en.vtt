00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.770
 hi to all and today actually I 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.910
 am going to make a video to explain the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.830
 dietary supplements what 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.390
 I use year-round and also in 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.010
 same time in passing I was presenting 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.269
 those who ask me what are 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.750
 the basics actually for the supplements 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.310
 food 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.500
 so I'll tell you what I 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.420
 finds it indispensable for the person 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.910
 who started bodybuilding who practice 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.680
 for some time so in fact I have 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.559
 chose the myprotein range press that these 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.940
 some is something that is 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.210
 not doing that is good quality 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.160
 despite however england delivery 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.930
 is relatively fast so if you 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.010
 order on Monday before the end of the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.629
 week you have in your box to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.199
 letters the order so I find that 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.399
 it is the service the price plus the expenses 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.570
 port by lyon which are offered to 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.649
 from 60 euros 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.109
 I find that it is she is 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.520
 relatively interesting after the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.559
 product quality I got 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.189
 informed a little bit I looked at the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.500
 labels 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.900
 it's very very good so it's very 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.420
 ok for the price I do not think we 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.590
 find better after that I'm going to you 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.350
 present what I consume so 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.560
 especially the complements 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.539
 which I consider indispensable 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.789
 for progression in bodybuilding or 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.880
 to achieve goals 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.770
 so that's actually I'm still staying on 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.350
 the same bases to me I take the 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.939
 protein isolate so it's the poorest 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.340
 in calories and the richest in 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.409
 protein games using it make me 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.939
 periodically so that is to say that I 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.159
 does not consume a lot of protein 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.209
 in the day but I use rather if 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.649
 you want for after training 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.659
 when I have one when I'm doing 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.250
 periods when I annoy a little bit so 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.170
 that's okay if you want 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.200
 to bring me anyway a contribution in 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.200
 protein 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.340
 relatively important while I am 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.110
 to the diet so here after I use the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.140
 omega-3 year-round so that's 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.720
 the health benefits of omega 3 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.540
 we count them more there is a lot 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.459
 recent studies that have shown that 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.570
 even for the athlete e for the person 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.430
 wishing to lose weight 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.340
 it was essential therefore acids 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.930
 essential fats after I use the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.930
 md mittens is so vitamin d 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.790
 it's the same one for years the 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.630
 recommended intake was very very 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.360
 very very below our needs so 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.640
 vitamin d which has a lot a lot 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.160
 more about health too and for 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.900
 the athlete too so that's some 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.100
 thing that I consume all year and 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.709
 which I highly recommend 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.790
 after the vitamin c that I order by 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.380
 period I I I actually take I 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.590
 order on their site periodically 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.910
 to be able to have some to make me 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.640
 small that in fact each period of 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.680
 the year so and it's pretty effective 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.190
 when one is on a diet too to manage 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.860
 the stress 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.950
 I found that there was an advantage and 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.959
 for the psychological the diet and and 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.750
 well helped with vitamin c 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.860
 after I take my caffeine so the coffee 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.260
 signed a recent 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.450
 a recent article on the internet that has 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.190
 showed that in fact sufficient intake of 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.530
 caffeine before workout allowed 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.090
 to increase its strength so depending on 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.360
 his body weight there was a calculation 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.950
 to do 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.490
 so I'll let you go on the 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.320
 site 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.240
 caffeine when you're on a diet is 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.750
 particularly happy of origin without 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.610
 carbohydrates 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.010
 I find that the benefits are very 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.490
 very very very very interesting after 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.020
 Benedict 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.150
 what I advise is to take 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.060
 before the training preference 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.920
 center to have a carbohydrate intake 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.260
 to be able to make the most of the cathine 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.820
 so that's it said I got 200 mg so 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.040
 the two men is interesting one can 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.590
 increase it by eating capsules in 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.000
 two each has his technique but I 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.190
 really find the caf id it's some 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.570
 thing that is for me is great 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.910
 important when we are in the regions for 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.390
 make intense sessions increase his 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.000
 strength 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.530
 and if you want to actually we do not have the 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.960
 canton this word region we tend to 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.550
 lose motivation to workout on 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.300
 convinced to have less strength 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:13.870
 I find that caffeine is a lot to 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.700
 overcome this lack of motivation etc 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.230
 after creatine so the same 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.360
 creatine we present more the creative 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.459
 for the sportsman it's something that 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.550
 I take the year too so about 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.920
 between 5 and 10 g per day divided into 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.810
 very small dose to make no boxer 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.340
 on their site for me I would take 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.900
 monohydrate but you also have some 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.980
 blue creature the beautiful creature that has 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.960
 even better 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.730
 so it's something that's great 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.960
 important for the practitioner 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.820
 bodybuilding not what it is 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.030
 it's really a dietary supplement 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.800
 at the level of the force at level 2 of the 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.710
 muscle mass that can really 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.840
 help you so 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.550
 it's a feeling and in many 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.590
 practitioners who use it is a 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.680
 very effective dietary supplement 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.750
 So here is my clip of 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.220
 dietary supplements to the elder I 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.310
 take in myprotein because they are 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.910
 necessarily the cheapest and the quality 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.040
 is very correct and if you want in 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.920
 did and I did not find on the internet 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.840
 something that gets closer as much 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.370
 than what I expected because their 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.180
 list of dietary supplements she 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.890
 is huge 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.680
 she is huge you always have 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.660
 new they make offers etc 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.090
 so here's after the little bonus that's it 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.010
 I'm on a ketogenic diet so 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.200
 you do not know it's a diet on 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.080
 eat very little to be lucid and where we 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.200
 favors proteins and lipids 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.060
 so I ordered on their website bo 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.190
 would have peanuts so in the end 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.750
 these taxes of 1 kg at least 10 euros 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.910
 you have a pound of peanut butter 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.500
 that I will use for cooking by 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.210
 example of my couple and that I do 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.370
 come back from there to give a 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.890
 little bit a little bit a little bit 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.350
 unpublished so I also use it for 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.210
 other preparations but it's a 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.280
 good quality product that I 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.260
 also recommend and that tastes great 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.730
 so that was my video about 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.320
 dietary supplements that I judge 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.950
 essential to practice it in 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.660
 bodybuilding 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.890
 so I would like to understand the insulation 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.100
 but you can take whey 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.570
 protein after I find it's a 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.400
 base which is pretty correct at the level 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.010
 financial because there for all that 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.130
 so we take that off it's the extra 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.740
 I take for myself if we keep 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.770
 that the indispensable for me we have 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.920
 something that revolves around 70 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.740
 euros so sequels very correct for 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.730
 to have an impact also there so here 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.470
 it is the range of complements 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.330
 food that I consume year-round 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.550
 with variations from time to time 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.410
 so 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.730
 for the next video I will 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.930
 advise of hurt your questions about 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.730
 my site or on facebook as 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.070
 usually and I will try to answer them 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.280
 with the most between impossible go to 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.280
 chip
