00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:11.309
 in a comment it 's from the friend, we talked in the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.440
 in that video of the reset of the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.490
 sensor calibration he says that the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.570
 his car when he called the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.359
 sometimes have trouble connecting and he 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.490
 need to speed up and sometimes 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:33.239
 went a white smoke in the exhaust and 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.090
 also comes with the reason said is can 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.930
 be many things right 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.540
 many problems but one thing that 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.010
 already happened to me and that no 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:56.309
 happens after I did this. 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:58.590
 cleaning here was the following 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.350
 this butterfly gets me impregnated 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.870
 because of the sigh of the oil that comes 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.360
 this way and ends up giving 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.070
 difficulty for the whole match and he 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.890
 end up not calling you need to give a 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.240
 accelerator for it is triggering for 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.119
 powering up the system when you 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.040
 accelerates butterfly force opening there and 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.560
 When I call a butterfly car, they do this. 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.689
 I work here to see her position, right? 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.299
 when you turn on the key you will notice that 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.979
 makes a noise in the sintracomec engine and 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.380
 Butterfly she does here do that 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.930
 work to try to find yourself watching 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.729
 the time you need to accelerate once 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.040
 that this noise does not because why 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.810
 is so impregnated with dirt that the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.759
 Butterfly did she stay the car stayed 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.670
 stopped at night every time a day two 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.979
 days and stayed sticky little engine 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.049
 ended up not having not using it right because the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.560
 It's like a stepper motor that goes 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.990
 here it ended up opening what you do 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.719
 When you accelerate, it opens and 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.740
 releasing may be this but there are others 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.110
 reasons 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.180
 here the gasoline that goes in here is 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.610
 one thing you have to watch because 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.569
 when the water temperature of the car 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.039
 radiator is below 25 degrees 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.110
 always does not matter if the fuel is 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.530
 gasoline or alcohol will connect with the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.110
 gasoline 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.920
 in there then look at the detail in the morning 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.880
 this Sunday are also well 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.790
 clean 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.340
 I usually put here petrol can 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.959
 free advertising right because because she 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.100
 has a larger character 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:35.310
 She is pure and she does not end up not. 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.370
 spoiling so early although many 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.069
 people do not know gasoline and have a 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.200
 30-day durability and it starts to 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.320
 losing the character is common and 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.530
 additive she rot not to pick up 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.370
 Fire goes but it's not the same way then 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.620
 to observe gasoline here and make me 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.459
 to think that here is dirty with oil in your 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.430
 car because of the white smoke 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.440
 when it accelerates this excess that 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.170
 He was locking the butterfly end 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.280
 entering the system follows by these 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.370
 Here I will call connecting and 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.250
 goes inside the doping is there to 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.910
 to the camera doing the burning and it's going to be 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.519
 exhaust and the smell of the fuel is 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.980
 that when you tried to make him pick up 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.620
 the explosion did not occur 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.829
 this fuel will follow by pipe 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.829
 download 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.360
 it will follow the discharge pipe and 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.239
 a catalyst will arrive giving that 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.940
 stink in the river mainly to the 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.640
 when I was talking to me and gave coil 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.470
 gave it a horrible smell because 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.989
 especially when the piston 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.390
 failed and it was not burning then 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.760
 this smell is horrible even a smell 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.730
 very bad that will catalyze when 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.340
 This smell is precisely because it is not 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.780
 seeing a correct burning of the fuel 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.470
 this is not happening this burning 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.560
 total 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.820
 This is what I hope you enjoy, I hope. 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.720
 to have helped in a hotel subject is a 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.720
 hug bye bye
