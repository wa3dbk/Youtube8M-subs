cleaner pool in half the time you know a
friend<00:01:58.659> of<00:01:58.749> mine<00:01:58.869> brought<00:01:59.229> this<00:01:59.499> King<00:02:00.039> Finn

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:00.249 
friend of mine brought this King Finn

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.039 
friend of mine brought this King Finn
over<00:02:00.429> to<00:02:00.579> me<00:02:00.700> and<00:02:00.849> suggested<00:02:01.239> I<00:02:01.299> try<00:02:01.359> it<00:02:01.659> and<00:02:01.899> my

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
over to me and suggested I try it and my

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.929 
over to me and suggested I try it and my
first<00:02:02.289> thought<00:02:02.529> was<00:02:02.679> I<00:02:03.159> don't<00:02:03.459> need<00:02:03.609> this<00:02:03.759> I've

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
first thought was I don't need this I've

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.330 
first thought was I don't need this I've
got<00:02:04.149> a<00:02:04.179> brush<00:02:04.539> I<00:02:04.869> why<00:02:05.469> do<00:02:05.529> I<00:02:05.649> need<00:02:05.739> a<00:02:05.889> new<00:02:05.979> brush

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
got a brush I why do I need a new brush

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.400 
got a brush I why do I need a new brush
that's<00:02:06.579> got<00:02:06.700> some<00:02:06.909> fin<00:02:07.209> on<00:02:07.359> it<00:02:07.539> but<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:08.140> got<00:02:08.319> to

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
that's got some fin on it but I got to

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.350 
that's got some fin on it but I got to
tell<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.710> first<00:02:08.920> time<00:02:09.100> I<00:02:09.130> tried<00:02:09.520> it

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
tell you the first time I tried it

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.940 
tell you the first time I tried it
the<00:02:10.540> difference<00:02:11.290> between<00:02:11.410> this<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:11.800> a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
the difference between this and a

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.860 
the difference between this and a
regular<00:02:11.980> brush<00:02:12.430> is<00:02:12.610> really<00:02:12.850> remarkable<00:02:13.120> this

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
regular brush is really remarkable this

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.200 
regular brush is really remarkable this
creates<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.710> kind<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.340> natural<00:02:15.550> suction

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
creates a kind of a natural suction

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.080 
creates a kind of a natural suction
between<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.870> brush<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.530> wall<00:02:17.800> such<00:02:18.610> that

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
between the brush and the wall such that

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.400 
between the brush and the wall such that
you<00:02:19.180> get<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.450> best<00:02:19.660> cleaning<00:02:19.990> you<00:02:20.200> really

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
you get the best cleaning you really

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.070 
you get the best cleaning you really
possibly<00:02:21.160> could<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.450> use<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.840> least

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
possibly could and you use the least

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.510 
possibly could and you use the least
amount<00:02:23.350> of<00:02:23.470> effort<00:02:23.710> I<00:02:23.800> can<00:02:23.950> clean<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.280> entire

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
amount of effort I can clean the entire

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.360 
amount of effort I can clean the entire

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.550 
using a regular brush to clean that far
side<00:02:38.650> requires<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.430> bend<00:02:39.760> over<00:02:39.940> and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
side requires you to bend over and

strain your back a little bit to try and

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.460 
strain your back a little bit to try and
get<00:02:43.060> everything<00:02:43.180> off<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:43.780> far<00:02:43.990> side<00:02:44.230> but

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
get everything off that far side but

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.140 
get everything off that far side but
with<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.680> king<00:02:44.920> fin<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.610> can<00:02:45.760> literally<00:02:45.970> do

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
with the king fin you can literally do

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.390 
with the king fin you can literally do
it<00:02:46.180> with<00:02:46.300> one<00:02:46.510> hand<00:02:46.540> because<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.380> fin<00:02:47.680> creates

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
it with one hand because the fin creates

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.190 
it with one hand because the fin creates
the<00:02:48.610> pressure<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.330> brush<00:02:49.510> against<00:02:50.140> the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
the pressure of the brush against the

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.720 
the pressure of the brush against the
wall<00:02:50.500> so<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:50.860> don't<00:02:51.100> have<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.370> use<00:02:51.520> the

wall so you don't have to use the

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.420 
wall so you don't have to use the
