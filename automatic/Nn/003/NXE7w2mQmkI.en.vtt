aluminum oxide crystals that would shoot

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
skin they've kind of done away with that

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.359 
skin they've kind of done away with that
because<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.899> controversy<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.829> aluminum

because the controversy of the aluminum

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.929 
because the controversy of the aluminum
that's<00:01:59.969> why<00:02:00.180> they've<00:02:00.420> gone<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:02.189> crystal

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
that's why they've gone to the crystal

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.110 
that's why they've gone to the crystal
