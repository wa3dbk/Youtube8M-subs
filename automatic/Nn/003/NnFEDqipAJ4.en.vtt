00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 and humility in service how sad 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.990
 is to see when we serve in the church or 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.510
 group we strive to please the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.550
 spiritual leaders or the congregation and 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.889
 when someone disappoints us we feel 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.719
 so disappointed that we stopped doing 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.570
 things with that love that in a 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.000
 principle we had rather look for the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.890
 way of resigning alleging that people 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.560
 or leaders do not value our delivery 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.019
 so we look around and do not receive the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.199
 effort credit and we see that we spend 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.510
 unnoticed by others and forget 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.579
 which is to God whom we should please and 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.920
 rather we blame God and we move away 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.989
 of the things he taught us by the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.149
 disappointment that we take with our 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.789
 guides or congregation and we bother 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.980
 with god not with our own pride 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.500
 that motivates us to get away from the service 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.890
 and the worship of the true 1 Corinthians 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.350
 10 31 do everything for the glory of 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.510
 God always the person of Christ 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.660
 Our Lord is the example to follow 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.270
 for us as his disciples without 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.309
 However, many times we discover with 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.870
 pain that our motivation is not 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.390
 precisely that of our 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.540
 This is the tendency to seek it 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.190
 wonderful in our experience 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.800
 we confuse the sense of the heroic with 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.740
 be heroes but is a protagonist or 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.870
 heroic important character is relative 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.660
 to the heroes what narrates or tells 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.120
 great and memorable facts one thing is 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.460
 pass triumphantly through a crisis and 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.280
 quite another is to pass all the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.340
 days glorifying God when there is no 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.770
 no witness no illustrious position 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.860
 none that pays us the least attention 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.020
 if you really are a devotee of the Lord Jesus 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.080
 you have reached the sublime height where 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.910
 nobody thinks about paying attention to what 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.150
 The only thing that is noticeable is that the power of 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.500
 God dwells within you all the time 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.720
 we need the spirit of God in 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.910
 us to make us so absolute and 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.710
 humanely yours to go through all 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.750
 unnoticed 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.610
 we need the holy spirit to 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.070
 do the most humble job for the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.440
 glory of god the proof of life 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.510
 a saint is not human success but the 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.390
 fidelity in life as she is 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.830
 we really make of the success in the work 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.520
 Christian the goal and I do not know 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.920
 let's start the goal is to manifest the 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.020
 glory of god in human life live 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.180
 the hidden life with Christ in God in 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.980
 our human conditions 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.410
 human relations are the conditions 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.870
 true in which the ideal life 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.060
 of God a life must be exhibited 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.060
 victorious Christian is achieved step to 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.160
 I walk on the right path the Christian 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.290
 redeemed who travels the path of 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.360
 obedience commitment and 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.460
 responsibility will be the person who 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.160
 Jesus will use to collaborate with him in the 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.170
 salvation of the world no one can build 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.780
 your own company on the foundation of 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.910
 jesus christ psalm 127 1 the church of 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.370
 power and victory is composed people 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.340
 transformed not only of Christians 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.709
 workers remember the church of 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.780
 ephesus and the father god claim but 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.350
 I have against you that you have left your first 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.510
 love apocalypse 24 so we conclude 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.610
 so that we should not put the emphasis 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.700
 in the work but in the lord of the work 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.890
 obedience commitment and responsibility 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.910
 they are not in this century words that 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.120
 generate a lot 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.310
 If I love especially among young people 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.740
 however nothing can do the Lord of 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.380
 the harvest if he finds great gifts and 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.420
 trained people only these three 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.540
 words should be part of the character 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.230
 Christian who loves God to love God is 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.720
 serve him not in part but totally like that 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.350
 only those who have died with Christ see 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.530
 Galatians 220 can live to serve you 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.600
 they no longer want anything earthly their 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.510
 eyes are set on riches 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.260
 and towards them advance with the 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.270
 eyes on the master amen
