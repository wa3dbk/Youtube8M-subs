00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.700
 hello this time we will prepare 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:24.410
 my way a recipe for chopped or shop 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.840
 it's chorizo ​​with potatoes then this 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.010
 These are our ingredients that 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.830
 we go 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.489
 to occupy 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:38.170
 let's make cookies with drier 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:42.200
 and we occupy wheat flour 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.630
 salt baking powder 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.730
 and the water and we have to take the chorizo 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.610
 and the potatoes or put we're going to do 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.230
 our mass what I'm going to do is 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.220
 put the potatoes while 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.430
 boil 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.500
 because we want to recognize them a little bit 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.990
 so we're just going to leave you 5 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.090
 minutes and we're going to take them out and we're going 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.780
 to chop in very small cubes 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.360
 let's make two cups 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:17.820
 we are going to see also add a 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.820
 a quarter of wheat flour 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.079
 and we're going to put it so we can send 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.079
 half teaspoon 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.710
 in half teaspoon of salt 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.940
 then now 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.850
 let's see how 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.800
 let's see what is to our liking 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.400
 manageable and that does not stick in the 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.400
 hands 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.050
 all of that you already know so right now and that 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.360
 is what we are going to move forward and knead 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.820
 until we have the consistency 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.840
 that we want and that is comfortable for 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.630
 to be able to make our minced xosoft is 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.000
 then, as you can see, our mass was left 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.000
 very well that does not stick to anything 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.560
 our hand then let's do 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:21.990
 our minced here with another machine 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:26.120
 and this base is the size they use here 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.120
 it does not matter then we go 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.420
 to be putting 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.480
 here very as they see I am not able to go 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.310
 seeing right now I think I'm going to 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.000
 pay and without forgetting to tell them that 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.180
 we have to take better that than I have I 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.719
 beans I'm going to let it boil 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.879
 and then I'm going to crush them with 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:49.840
 air conditioner to fit 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.040
 crushed 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.690
 We will keep doing all of our 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.580
 our minced and then already 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.100
 we show you that more more next 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.060
 at that time they were already and what 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.060
 let's do is 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.800
 congratulate them and chop the talks by 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.850
 that has been shown that minced 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.850
 but this one 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.710
 so let's do that and then let's go 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.350
 to prepare 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.170
 sausage with potatoes let them to sting 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:34.450
 our dad 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.450
 in small cubes 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.969
 we want a 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:50.470
 So the first thing we're going to do is 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:53.320
 put our chorizo in our pan 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.330
 as you have I think that also sausage 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.540
 which it is very similar to sausage because 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.540
 this 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.209
 my way 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:13.849
 the toritos do not call their 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.849
 matches and you have to add the covers 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.400
 with qatar 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.400
 to desalinate our 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.840
 and then here 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:35.790
 the early reason and moxos so that we 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.980
 it will help the time and faster 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.639
 then you have to let them go to fire 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.039
 short 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.110
 while we yield to wait what is 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:47.620
 in our potatoes with chorizo ​​we are going to 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.949
 fry some complicated in oil a 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.949
 little 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.629
 suffering a minute 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.170
 if they like it and they do not want to fry us 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:21.590
 excess oil and that's also at 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:25.250
 Every person's taste to us always 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.980
 back we believed so that's decision 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.770
 then you're never going to do 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.920
 Now finish frying and wait for 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.860
 this our chorizo ​​with potatoes and then 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.410
 we are going to show you how we are going to 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.360
 prepare with this way they are already 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.700
 fried our 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:48.730
 our chopped then now let's go 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.730
 to show how we prepare an arch 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.160
 the first one we are going to put a layer of 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.160
 better seeing the gaditano 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.960
 and let's put our chorizo ​​with 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:06.689
 potatoes was very good I tried it 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.209
 pretty delicious 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:15.420
 and we have to not use ourselves of 

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:19.460
 tomatillo and jalapeño pepper with tomato 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.460
 here you can use the effects 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.000
 and we are going to put a little bit of 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.000
 coriander 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:35.280
