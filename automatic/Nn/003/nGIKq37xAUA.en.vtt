00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.620
 and this Mexican's strategy was what 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.420
 contrary that a Mexican was a 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.860
 true that what's going to be said above 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.780
 if prove what they the Mexican 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.190
 he dies in the ring but we 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.830
 we prepared we never gave ourselves to learn 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.510
 we never let our guard down we never leave 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.190
 of throwing punches four or five strokes 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.870
 we take the skin out of the mind I 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.820
 I think we showed it to Barranquilla 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.960
 colombia that Tehran cables do not laugh 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.040
 in no time despite from the 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.340
 critical moments that we went through in the 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.600
 I fought at 1 866 I always was 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.280
 saying why I always blocked it 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.280
 by hand and almost always not 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.170
 and just as the aedile fails a lot and I 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.730
 I think you left me a little and nothing 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.360
 that's not the bell and we continue 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.770
 forward of the just acknowledged 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.710
 it goes for another price 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.260
 I do not think what in this division 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.269
 can not do anything 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.470
 he does not have strong hands like 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.200
 the one that I threw because I know that 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.240
 every hand that got into her felt for 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.670
 very strong that will always be shown 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.990
 weak at times but he 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.700
 he was always strong I also had 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.750
 strong and I showed him that I could 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.750
 hit as he wanted I wanted 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.350
 but yes we are going to jump there was never 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.530
 fought or be jumped fought 8 the last 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.630
 time I also did it here we had until 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.310
 the limit up to 11 I think that in some 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.960
 moment you saw that I lowered the 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.670
 guard but never neglect me always 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.220
 when it finishes blows to each carafe of 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.290
 45 goal against is slowly progressing 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.210
 your record you need to work the body 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.619
 for these great boxers who 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.119
 always works in the body quite 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.799
 like Mexicans and we want to face 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.270
 to many Mexicans if the Mexican 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.440
 it was always about tools 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.240
 body shots half barre all the 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.270
 body and works crossed I gave by the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.320
 back but I tried to block it is 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.000
 fortunately unfortunate in the USA 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.830
 we learned enough lock pretty 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.850
 defenses and we uploaded you assimilate some 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.850
 some body shots 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.909
 with the pain I planted them in a way 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.210
 to the first until the fifth round of 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.210
 sixth 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.250
 we gave 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.250
 a good show Barranquilla 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.770
 at some point if there was a hand because 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.050
 I neglected but could not and in a 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.400
 s time when tigers and we want 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.010
 I like that 'the manolos' strips so 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.090
 strong like that because that style now 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.830
 we only throw him the one to stop 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.090
 control it to throw it several 12 and 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.680
 when he takes revenge when they have it already 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.450
 always I always come 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.739
 came in with the left open to the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.220
 head and if you realized that always 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.220
 it did not work 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.140
 and that I did to intimidate myself I knew 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.460
 that I was I was prepared 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.380
 psychologically also because a lot 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.940
 that just as I hit him he told me that 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.830
 there is no way I was going to be palante in any moment 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.380
 It got me crazy and it did not take me out of my fight 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.790
 I was focused and nothing to do what 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.620
 that I more think that this boxer 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.830
 Mexican I feel good I feel for feels 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.020
 free to 154 and came up to a 160 I think 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.730
 which was the number one rival that you had 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.530
 throughout your career now 66 and I just 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.300
 I recognized the one in the ring I told him that 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.890
 It was the hardest thing I've had for 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.290
 this 16 fight and these three years that 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.030
 I have or be professional that teaching you 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.680
 you left shared that is where you think 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.680
 must then work more to 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.860
 you have to work much more more more 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.760
 force more more more physical works and 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.820
 It strengthens that much what we 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.290
 We urgently need it because I believe 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.260
 that no boxer with this amount 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.220
 blows that I threw to this Mexican 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.140
 I was expecting another boxer and I was not going to 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.600
 can assimilate but we are going to 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.730
 work pretty 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.040
 we will wait next year to rest 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.330
 a little bit and next year to see 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.580
 what the company tells us 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.260
 and hopefully there is the emv not have classified 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.260
 the number 3 as planned 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.930
 I do not think so 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.770
 I think double and then I do not think 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.100
 that go 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.100
 Y 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.700
 one
