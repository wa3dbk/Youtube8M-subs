00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.260 
are sure that both of them are even draw
the<00:00:55.890> line<00:00:56.309> first<00:00:57.770> depending<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.770> how<00:00:59.609> long<00:01:00.030> you

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the line first depending on how long you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.630 
the line first depending on how long you
like<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:02.699> then<00:01:03.559> stretch<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.589> from<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.400> top

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
like it and then stretch it from the top

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.910 
like it and then stretch it from the top
two<00:01:06.510> right<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:08.869> extend<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.380> then<00:01:10.619> fill

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
two right here extend it and then fill

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.240 
two right here extend it and then fill
it<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.220> right<00:01:11.549> here<00:01:11.810> click<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.100> then<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.220> can

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
it in right here click that then you can

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:23.800 
it in right here click that then you can
make<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.670> higher<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:18.540> then

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.679 

extend<00:01:24.680> it<00:01:24.799> more<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.820> inner<00:01:26.060> corner<00:01:26.509> like

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
extend it more is the inner corner like

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.770 
extend it more is the inner corner like
that<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:29.000> then<00:01:30.670> this<00:01:31.670> side<00:01:31.970> here<00:01:32.270> is<00:01:32.420> thick

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
that and then this side here is thick

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.510 
that and then this side here is thick
and<00:01:33.380> then<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:33.619> want<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.829> make<00:01:33.950> sure<00:01:33.979> that<00:01:34.130> this

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
and then you want to make sure that this

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:46.500 
and then you want to make sure that this
side<00:01:34.909> here<00:01:35.299> is<00:01:35.479> thin

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.040 

see<00:01:47.200> how<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.440> inner<00:01:47.770> corner<00:01:48.280> is<00:01:48.370> really<00:01:48.730> thin

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.670 

that's<00:01:52.740> what<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.070> guys<00:01:53.190> want<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.580> try<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.790> do

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
so really the technique the pearly basic

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.230 
so really the technique the pearly basic
to<00:01:58.380> think<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.800> want<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.040> tell<00:01:59.220> you<00:01:59.400> is<00:01:59.610> when

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
to think that I want to tell you is when

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.000 
to think that I want to tell you is when
you're<00:02:00.450> applying<00:02:01.050> and<00:02:01.350> eyeliner<00:02:01.620> on<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
you're applying and eyeliner on the

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.920 
you're applying and eyeliner on the
inner<00:02:02.250> corner<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.180> want<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.420> kind<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.750> just

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
inner corner you want to kind of just

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.850 
inner corner you want to kind of just
touch<00:02:04.230> it<00:02:04.260> like<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.970> not<00:02:05.970> swiping<00:02:06.660> in<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.800> you

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
touch it like that not swiping in so you

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.210 
touch it like that not swiping in so you
want<00:02:08.070> to<00:02:08.130> touch<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.480> inner<00:02:09.630> corners

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
want to touch it like the inner corners

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.800 
want to touch it like the inner corners
so<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.430> get<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.640> very<00:02:11.910> thin<00:02:12.180> line<00:02:12.390> and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
so that you get a very thin line and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.990 
so that you get a very thin line and
then<00:02:13.080> let<00:02:13.350> it<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.620> bit<00:02:13.920> when<00:02:14.250> your<00:02:14.490> think<00:02:14.820> that

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
then let it a bit when your think that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.600 
then let it a bit when your think that
it's<00:02:15.150> all<00:02:15.390> like<00:02:15.750> filled<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:17.010> that's<00:02:17.190> like<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
it's all like filled so that's like the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.780 
it's all like filled so that's like the
basic<00:02:18.050> technique<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.460> can<00:02:20.460> tell<00:02:20.640> you

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
basic technique that I can tell you

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.560 
basic technique that I can tell you
right<00:02:20.880> now<00:02:20.940> now<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.690> just<00:02:21.960> like<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.350> apply<00:02:23.570> load

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
right now now I just like to apply load

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.760 
right now now I just like to apply load
line<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:25.050> my<00:02:25.280> waterline<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.560> completes

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
line on my waterline so that completes

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
complete full up so that comes it's the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.950
