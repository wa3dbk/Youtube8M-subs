00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.500
 the condition 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.290
 of diseases pushes you 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.030
 strongly on his concentration to focus your experience of man on 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.449
 two elements a first built a life opportunity 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.730
 the second is to look precisely at the idea of 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.000
 ddd heal to cure the problems that the active disease 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.470
 I'm Alberto Fontana 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.369
 board member of the telecom foundation 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.680
 he is national president of the Italian union fighting muscular dystrophy 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.680
 lau in viale authors the merit of bringing in Italy 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.040
 the thermal project 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.550
 and I was fortunate to find in this street the lady nielli that the 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.850
 concretized 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.040
 the presence in the presence of the rights of those who live directly with the problem 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.160
 within the telethon foundation 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.230
 represents the possibility d 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.730
 make sure that you check everything that happens inside the 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.620
 scientific research favoring cement diseases 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.460
 and at the same time from that push and that determination afin 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.000
 the little time we have available to be able to give an answer 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.850
 healing cure 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.990
 to these diseases 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.109
 take place in the most + times 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:24.780
 as fast as possible 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.020
 for those who call researchers projects that can go and concreteness e 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.300
 immediate responses to our diseases unfortunately we cannot afford to re 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.710
 wasting time we can't afford to finance bad research 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.280
 sky researcher 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.790
 on time we have secularist that you understand that we your project 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.009
 we want to realize we support it 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.710
 through telecom 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.010
 and must reproduce those situations for which we must have the 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.909
 conviction that we have done 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.799
 we have not taken a step forward in the research scale 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.679
 exclusively of the cook 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.560
 your job your lab but we have supported something more 

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:08.059
 large of which pays 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:09.319
 to victory 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.260
 dd 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.680
 of one of the many 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.150
 of many types of rio muscular dystrophy even if it were not directly mine 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.409
 it would be the greatest joy I believe 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.209
 any people 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.309
 our sofas could be brain condition 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:28.859
 and here it is not in question what kind of dystrophy is discussed 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.339
 what kind of man 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:34.600
 may be able to deal with this brands of must do 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.119
 and to build a research project 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.549
 like what they allow is offering 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.930
 I believe it is the million way to celebrate precisely the capacity of 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.289
 a response not to the specific pathology but 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:50.769
 to the man who lives 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.539
 one of many muscular dystrophy 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.999
 the idea that each of us is 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:58.979
 the replicant 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.579
 therefore be unique 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.149
 this must impose a responsibility on everyone 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:07.109
 in being able to look beyond what can be one's own 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.999
 problems to look beyond your condition a little more 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:17.319
 volunteer today which means accepting invitations to find out what it is 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.470
 ourselves but at the same time 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.549
 what do you think of man 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.989
 peter that it is the most difficult thing that cannot be done 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.989
 in a year you can't do it maybe it won't even take me a lifetime 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:33.099
 troll volunteers the idea of â€‹â€‹being available to others for themselves 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.299
 that I will test it form 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.669
 flower to be able to build 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.229
 the best man that every 5 be near
