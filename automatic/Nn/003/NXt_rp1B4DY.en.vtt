00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.540 

it<00:00:51.289> just<00:00:51.469> stands<00:00:51.739> up<00:00:51.949> it's<00:00:52.100> like<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:52.370> one

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
it just stands up it's like the one

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.549 
it just stands up it's like the one
going<00:00:52.789> away<00:00:52.850> of<00:00:53.149> where<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:53.449> take<00:00:53.870> off<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:54.289> you

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
going away of where you take off and you

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.619 
going away of where you take off and you
can<00:00:54.590> see<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:54.890> whole<00:00:55.219> wall<00:00:55.610> already<00:00:56.030> standing

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
can see the whole wall already standing

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:57.819 
can see the whole wall already standing
up<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.019> you<00:00:57.110> just<00:00:57.260> think<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.530> whole<00:00:57.590> thing

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
up and you just think the whole thing

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.619 
up and you just think the whole thing
could<00:00:57.980> shut<00:00:58.160> down<00:00:58.190> that<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.640> sensors<00:00:59.120> move<00:00:59.420> at

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
could shut down that the sensors move at

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.680 
could shut down that the sensors move at
that<00:00:59.809> perfect<00:01:00.440> pace<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.360> that's<00:01:02.360> why<00:01:02.510> it's

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
that perfect pace and that's why it's
