within four months that would be in you

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.640 
within four months that would be in you
know<00:02:38.490> budget<00:02:38.880> time<00:02:39.090> January<00:02:39.360> hits<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.020> we're

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
know budget time January hits and we're

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.140 
know budget time January hits and we're
month<00:02:40.860> into<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.610> we're<00:02:41.730> at<00:02:41.790> about<00:02:41.880> two

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
month into it and we're at about two

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.790 
month into it and we're at about two
thousand<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:42.810> we're<00:02:43.050> we're<00:02:43.470> falling<00:02:43.740> behind
