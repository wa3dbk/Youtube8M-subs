00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:13.390
 It is an industrial opposite of Rohsin 8 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:18.740
 Today, when repainting the exterior wall and roof 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:25.070
 But when you say so but I have a task of color a love Nee 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:26.110
 I would like to demonstrations of software called color simulation for you to tell 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:33.060
 I will 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:39.000
 It is a child's software It is small and difficult to understand if it is a normal maker's color sample 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.390
 Grab an image of what it feels like to paint the exterior wall and the roof as a whole 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.340
 To receive 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.140
 thing 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.440
 It is one tool 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.660
 Actually now 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.370
 Image processing of a real nerd 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:59.710
 I would like to color the photo 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:02.940
 First of all, it 's part of the back of the house and the rain gutter 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.940
 Put a color on 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.420
 Yeah yeah 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.370
 The whitened booklet is white 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.250
 I tried white 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.050
 It is from now on, it is the outer wall of the second floor 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.650
 Put the color to 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:25.560
 The 2 and the color in the case of your house It Is Well here towards parliament 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.560
 Since it is the body say say that I am able to draw 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.130
 I will lose a little light beige 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:40.560
 It is once a brownish brown eyes a little 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.560
 I will put this 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.550
 is not it 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:55.730
 After that it is a roof, let's stop drinking 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:02:00.700
 Since it has as a whole will continue to you to become a thing of the warm colors of Brown 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:07.120
 I will put a little dark brown 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:10.360
 Haie So you After applying before applying to the fact it is a such a feeling 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.530
 Say that I am grabbed this image 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:19.020
 It will be called color simulation of attending school 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.430
 It is as you understand if you look at this lower right one in this 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.350
 Hundreds of to color 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.190
 I'm in the soft field 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:34.040
 Perhaps usually you can express colors 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:36.520
 For example, it is the color of the roof, so let's write on the bulb soon . 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.520
 If 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.800
 It's like this 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.150
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.630
 It can be changed to any color on the spot 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.700
 Or seem even what kind 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:57.750
 You can do this while you are using something like this 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.030
 It is an image after the finish of the outer wall and the roof 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.190
 Such things 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.440
 Work to get hold 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.150
 I will continue 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:14.060
 Continued 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:18.050
 It also becomes to talk about using color simulation of color 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:25.970
 Roughly of the meeting It is a color simulation 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:32.060
 But I'll grab and have Calligraphy the Toka I direction is the favorite on a personal computer 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:35.760
 If it is only that, there will be a gap of useful expressions 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:43.790
 For example, is a personal computer when the picture surface in excess of 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:46.790
 God and the thing it is different or paper-based so that depending on the type of I is the color monitor 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.540
 It depends on the type of printer and the room 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:54.739
 Because the color is also different, in the end it is 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:58.160
 It is Japan where such simulation and maker are using it 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.880
 It is not only to these things 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.950
 In this form 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:08.950
 We are allowed to create a Japan of large had temperature 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:14.739
 So the size of this a warm ー ー 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.250
 It's about 90 cm by 90 cm 60 cm or so. 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.220
 Ne 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:23.590
 A relatively large one 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:28.690
 I will create this board It is actually your home 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:32.380
 a There is no rain on a sunny day with a cloudy day when it is hit against a wall 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.530
 It is difficult to say when it is morning sun 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.210
 Take the time to check and yeah 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:44.780
 It is the actual color door 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:49.910
 I will work to combine the image of the simulation 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:55.400
 In the house I made in cg earlier , I guess I made a simulation 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:05:02.569
 Although Japan actually made the house who Japan is here 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:05.590
 In the case of your home, there is a request that you want to have a two-tone color 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:10.000
 To combination of two of Sugatsu 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.310
 It was a story that I was very worried, so in this way 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.110
 What 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:22.060
 We made a sample of four meals by combining up and down and actually applied it to a building and confirmed it 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.060
 We have been the work of
