zucchini pasta now in our next video
we're<00:00:10.889> going<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.160> make<00:00:11.309> spirals<00:00:12.240> out<00:00:12.360> of

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
we're going to make spirals out of

we're going to make spirals out of
carrots<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.610> I<00:00:14.610> like<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.000> find<00:00:15.240> thick<00:00:16.139> carrots

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
going to get the exact same result as

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.640 
going to get the exact same result as
you<00:00:57.989> will<00:00:58.170> with<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.500> zucchini<00:01:03.470> but<00:01:04.470> you'll

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
you will with the zucchini but you'll

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
see that you can get some nice strands

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.640 
see that you can get some nice strands
going<00:01:07.760> try<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.790> keep<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.330> carrot<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.750> even<00:01:10.470> and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
going try to keep the carrot is even and

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.770 
going try to keep the carrot is even and
straight<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.189> possible<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.180> that'll<00:01:12.479> get<00:01:12.630> you

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
straight as possible and that'll get you

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:25.740 
straight as possible and that'll get you
the<00:01:12.900> best<00:01:13.020> results
