stores to carry that but what I did i
make<00:01:19.030> my<00:01:19.210> own<00:01:19.240> cable<00:01:19.840> make<00:01:20.230> my<00:01:20.380> own<00:01:20.530> snares

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
make my own cable make my own snares

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.160 
make my own cable make my own snares
basically<00:01:22.870> and<00:01:23.080> like<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.320> said<00:01:23.530> it's<00:01:23.680> a<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:26.020> a

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
basically and like I said it's a it's a

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.570 
basically and like I said it's a it's a
seven<00:01:26.830> by<00:01:26.950> seven<00:01:27.310> 5/64<00:01:28.210> cable<00:01:29.460> basically<00:01:30.460> it's

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
seven by seven 5/64 cable basically it's

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.400 
seven by seven 5/64 cable basically it's
a<00:01:30.610> pickets<00:01:30.970> tank<00:01:31.270> with<00:01:31.480> three<00:01:31.780> holes<00:01:31.990> in<00:01:32.290> it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
a pickets tank with three holes in it

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.530 
a pickets tank with three holes in it
and<00:01:32.680> I'll<00:01:32.860> show<00:01:33.640> you<00:01:33.700> that<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:36.360> bottom<00:01:37.360> hole

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
and I'll show you that the bottom hole

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.500 
and I'll show you that the bottom hole
is<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.260> hole<00:01:38.470> where<00:01:38.800> I<00:01:39.040> actually<00:01:39.520> put<00:01:40.360> the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
is the hole where I actually put the

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.300 
is the hole where I actually put the
snares<00:01:40.810> through<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.200> picket<00:01:41.410> stake<00:01:41.770> in<00:01:41.980> the

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
snares through the picket stake in the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.700 
snares through the picket stake in the
back<00:01:42.550> it's<00:01:43.390> cramped<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:43.960> supported<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:44.590> it's

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
back it's cramped and supported and it's

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.990 
back it's cramped and supported and it's
actually<00:01:45.070> got<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.960> washer<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.280> whenever<00:01:48.880> you

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
actually got a washer so whenever you

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.950 
actually got a washer so whenever you
catch<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.270> raccoon<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.870> will<00:01:49.990> actually<00:01:51.960> twist

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
catch a raccoon it will actually twist

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.190 
catch a raccoon it will actually twist
and<00:01:53.200> slide<00:01:53.440> so<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:54.340> Coon<00:01:54.760> can't<00:01:55.120> blow<00:01:55.930> will

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
and slide so the Coon can't blow will

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.470 
and slide so the Coon can't blow will
allow<00:01:56.470> them<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.680> twist<00:01:56.980> around<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.550> basically

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
allow them to twist around and basically

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.800 
allow them to twist around and basically
the<00:01:58.630> support<00:01:58.810> wire<00:01:59.970> is<00:02:00.970> run<00:02:01.270> through<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.600> top

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
the support wire is run through the top

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.310 
the support wire is run through the top
hole<00:02:02.110> bit<00:02:02.740> around<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.340> back<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:03.640> Rand

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
hole bit around the back and Rand

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.840 
hole bit around the back and Rand
through<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.500> second<00:02:05.950> hole<00:02:06.100> there<00:02:06.460> for<00:02:06.760> the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
through the second hole there for the

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.749 
through the second hole there for the
support<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.530> it<00:02:08.920> runs<00:02:09.099> all<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.369> way<00:02:09.520> up<00:02:09.640> to

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
support and it runs all the way up to

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.110 
support and it runs all the way up to
the<00:02:09.879> wire<00:02:10.060> at<00:02:10.300> top<00:02:10.539> of<00:02:10.629> the<00:02:10.690> wire<00:02:10.869> there<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:12.120> I

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
the wire at top of the wire there and I

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.370 
the wire at top of the wire there and I
use

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
use

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.650 
use
slim<00:02:14.680> locks<00:02:14.950> but<00:02:15.340> there's<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.150> many<00:02:16.270> different

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
slim locks but there's so many different

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.930 
slim locks but there's so many different
kind<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.930> locks<00:02:17.710> out<00:02:17.950> there<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:18.460> work<00:02:18.640> real

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
kind of locks out there that work real

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.660 
kind of locks out there that work real
good<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.410> slim<00:02:20.710> lock<00:02:20.920> seems<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.520> work

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
good but the slim lock seems to work

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.900 
good but the slim lock seems to work
extremely<00:02:21.970> well<00:02:22.270> for<00:02:22.660> me<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:24.160> can<00:02:24.580> use<00:02:24.790> the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
extremely well for me you can use the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.580 
extremely well for me you can use the
washer<00:02:25.240> lock<00:02:25.450> Gragas<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.650> lock<00:02:26.970> but<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.590> the

washer lock Gragas and lock but the the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.380 
washer lock Gragas and lock but the the
slim<00:02:29.860> lock<00:02:30.040> seems<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.490> work<00:02:30.610> extremely<00:02:30.880> well

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
slim lock seems to work extremely well

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.220 
slim lock seems to work extremely well
for<00:02:31.710> this<00:02:32.710> system<00:02:33.160> at<00:02:33.280> least<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:34.230> basically

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
for this system at least and basically

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.930 
for this system at least and basically
what<00:02:35.470> working<00:02:35.650> for<00:02:36.010> people<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.520> just<00:02:36.550> looking

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
what working for people is just looking

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.760 
what working for people is just looking
for<00:02:37.090> trails<00:02:37.390> out<00:02:37.720> there<00:02:37.900> for<00:02:38.110> raccoon<00:02:38.440> trails

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
for trails out there for raccoon trails

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.160 
for trails out there for raccoon trails
and<00:02:39.190> I've<00:02:39.610> got<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.820> simulated<00:02:40.510> trail<00:02:40.810> here<00:02:41.080> in

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
and I've got a simulated trail here in

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.890 
and I've got a simulated trail here in
my<00:02:41.260> yard<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.910> can<00:02:43.060> see<00:02:43.270> this<00:02:43.420> going<00:02:43.690> through

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
my yard you can see this going through

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.210 
my yard you can see this going through
the<00:02:44.020> grass<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.290> can<00:02:44.680> find<00:02:44.890> these<00:02:45.010> type<00:02:45.190> of

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
the grass you can find these type of

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.110 
the grass you can find these type of
animal<00:02:45.670> trails<00:02:46.080> along<00:02:47.080> those<00:02:47.290> creeks<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.970> can

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
animal trails along those creeks you can

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.140 
animal trails along those creeks you can
find<00:02:49.450> them<00:02:49.630> out<00:02:49.720> in<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.930> woods<00:02:50.820> deer<00:02:51.820> trail's

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
find them out in the woods deer trail's

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.070 
find them out in the woods deer trail's
for<00:02:52.480> example<00:02:52.990> raccoons<00:02:53.560> use<00:02:53.830> those<00:02:54.450> but<00:02:55.450> if

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
for example raccoons use those but if

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.870 
for example raccoons use those but if
you're<00:02:56.200> going<00:02:56.350> raccoon<00:02:56.920> specific<00:02:57.580> you<00:02:57.700> might

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
you're going raccoon specific you might

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.830 
you're going raccoon specific you might
actually<00:02:58.060> pick<00:02:58.390> up<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.660> fox<00:02:58.960> or<00:03:00.450> any<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.660> other

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
actually pick up a fox or any the other

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.390 
actually pick up a fox or any the other
type<00:03:02.230> of<00:03:02.260> animals<00:03:02.650> run<00:03:02.800> through<00:03:02.980> there

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
type of animals run through there

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.640 
type of animals run through there
hopefully<00:03:04.120> not<00:03:04.240> possums<00:03:04.750> but<00:03:05.020> it's<00:03:05.140> possible

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
hopefully not possums but it's possible

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.040 
hopefully not possums but it's possible
but<00:03:06.130> I'll<00:03:06.280> show<00:03:06.460> you<00:03:06.520> why<00:03:06.820> what<00:03:07.750> we're<00:03:07.930> going

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
but I'll show you why what we're going

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.300 
but I'll show you why what we're going
to<00:03:08.080> do<00:03:08.260> here<00:03:08.470> in<00:03:08.530> a<00:03:08.590> few<00:03:08.740> minutes

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.890 

basically<00:03:12.660> for<00:03:13.660> raccoons<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:14.380> need<00:03:15.900> you

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
basically for raccoons you need you

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.870 
basically for raccoons you need you
needed<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.380> loop<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.860> be<00:03:21.180> 5<00:03:22.980> 5<00:03:23.980> inches<00:03:24.220> wide<00:03:24.400> so

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
needed the loop to be 5 5 inches wide so

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.940 
needed the loop to be 5 5 inches wide so
basically<00:03:25.330> about<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.660> width<00:03:25.930> what<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.290> do<00:03:26.410> to

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
basically about the width what I do to

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.790 
basically about the width what I do to
measure<00:03:27.490> that<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.780> width<00:03:29.200> of<00:03:29.410> my<00:03:29.530> thumb

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
measure that is the width of my thumb

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.620 
measure that is the width of my thumb
all<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.130> way<00:03:30.280> my<00:03:30.460> index<00:03:30.790> finger<00:03:31.150> about<00:03:31.390> 5

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
all the way my index finger about 5

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.230 
all the way my index finger about 5
inches<00:03:31.870> wide<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.500> about<00:03:33.190> 3<00:03:33.640> inches<00:03:34.000> off<00:03:34.210> the

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
inches wide and about 3 inches off the

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.830 
inches wide and about 3 inches off the
ground

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
ground

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.020 
ground
and<00:03:35.790> basically<00:03:36.790> what<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:37.840> do<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:39.700> hammer

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
and basically what you do you hammer

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.560 
and basically what you do you hammer
that<00:03:40.330> picket<00:03:40.930> stake<00:03:41.260> in<00:03:41.680> but<00:03:42.580> you<00:03:42.700> line<00:03:43.060> the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
that picket stake in but you line the

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.770 
that picket stake in but you line the
snare<00:03:44.070> directly<00:03:45.070> dead<00:03:45.640> center<00:03:46.120> over<00:03:46.510> the

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
snare directly dead center over the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.460 
snare directly dead center over the
middle<00:03:47.200> of<00:03:47.770> that<00:03:48.430> trail<00:03:48.820> dead<00:03:49.630> center<00:03:49.990> middle

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
middle of that trail dead center middle

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.800 
middle of that trail dead center middle
of<00:03:50.710> the<00:03:50.860> trail<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.520> that's<00:03:52.210> what<00:03:52.450> you<00:03:52.570> wanted

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
of the trail and that's what you wanted

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.230 
of the trail and that's what you wanted
about<00:03:53.050> 3<00:03:53.350> inches<00:03:53.590> off<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:53.800> ground<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:57.240> really

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
about 3 inches off the ground and really

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.870 
about 3 inches off the ground and really
just<00:03:58.750> pound<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.650> picket<00:03:59.980> stake<00:04:00.220> in<00:04:00.430> as<00:04:00.700> far

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
just pound that picket stake in as far

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.060 
just pound that picket stake in as far
as<00:04:00.940> you<00:04:01.090> can<00:04:01.210> go<00:04:01.390> but<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:02.140> want<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.740> distance

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
as you can go but you want the distance

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.640 
as you can go but you want the distance
like<00:04:03.310> I<00:04:03.400> said<00:04:03.610> 3<00:04:04.120> 3<00:04:04.810> inches<00:04:05.110> off<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.410> ground

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
like I said 3 3 inches off the ground

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.540 
like I said 3 3 inches off the ground
about<00:04:06.430> 5<00:04:07.000> inches<00:04:07.450> 5<00:04:07.930> inch<00:04:08.140> loop<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.740> you're

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
about 5 inches 5 inch loop and you're

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.140 
about 5 inches 5 inch loop and you're
good<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.820> go

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
good to go

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.320 
good to go
but<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.750> snare<00:04:11.410> itself<00:04:11.830> must<00:04:12.100> be

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
but the snare itself must be

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.540 
but the snare itself must be
perpendicular<00:04:13.330> and<00:04:14.110> dead<00:04:14.650> center<00:04:15.100> with<00:04:15.340> that

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
perpendicular and dead center with that

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.870 
perpendicular and dead center with that
trail<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.180> as<00:04:16.989> you<00:04:17.140> can<00:04:17.260> see<00:04:17.590> this<00:04:18.340> is<00:04:18.520> just<00:04:18.549> an

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
trail and as you can see this is just an

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.530 
trail and as you can see this is just an
example<00:04:19.980> but<00:04:20.980> that<00:04:21.370> trail<00:04:21.820> right<00:04:22.060> there<00:04:22.090> that

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
example but that trail right there that

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.200 
example but that trail right there that
snare

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
snare

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.430 
snare
it's<00:04:24.210> hard<00:04:24.360> to<00:04:24.450> see<00:04:24.630> with<00:04:24.750> this<00:04:24.870> angle<00:04:25.320> but

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
it's hard to see with this angle but

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.000 
it's hard to see with this angle but
that<00:04:25.620> snare<00:04:25.890> is<00:04:26.190> dead<00:04:26.580> center<00:04:27.410> of<00:04:28.410> that<00:04:28.680> trail

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
that snare is dead center of that trail

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.520 
that snare is dead center of that trail
and<00:04:30.080> people<00:04:31.910> this<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.150> lightweight<00:04:33.530> fast

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
and people this is a lightweight fast

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.360 
and people this is a lightweight fast
easy<00:04:35.120> system<00:04:36.120> where<00:04:36.990> you<00:04:37.440> can<00:04:37.590> run<00:04:37.770> hundreds

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
easy system where you can run hundreds

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.750 
easy system where you can run hundreds
of<00:04:38.550> these<00:04:38.780> snares<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:40.260> you<00:04:41.160> can<00:04:41.310> actually<00:04:41.460> put

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
of these snares and you can actually put

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.400 
of these snares and you can actually put
them<00:04:41.850> out<00:04:41.970> before<00:04:42.300> season<00:04:42.810> and<00:04:43.020> that's<00:04:43.170> the

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
them out before season and that's the

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.310 
them out before season and that's the
key<00:04:43.590> if<00:04:43.770> you<00:04:43.830> put<00:04:44.070> these<00:04:44.190> snares<00:04:44.430> out<00:04:45.140> you<00:04:46.140> have

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
key if you put these snares out you have
