we'll have to identify an attack Alex
with<00:00:56.380> dowels<00:00:56.920> car<00:00:57.490> or<00:00:58.150> is<00:00:58.270> that<00:00:58.420> James<00:00:59.080> Nash's

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
with dowels car or is that James Nash's

with dowels car or is that James Nash's
car<00:00:59.830> that's<00:01:00.100> involved<00:01:00.520> in<00:01:00.760> that<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:03.100> can't

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
car that's involved in that you can't

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.250 
car that's involved in that you can't
get<00:01:03.460> through<00:01:03.640> can<00:01:03.880> you<00:01:03.940> how<00:01:04.630> many<00:01:04.809> cars<00:01:05.050> are

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
get through can you how many cars are

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.290 
get through can you how many cars are
then<00:01:05.470> I<00:01:05.680> can't<00:01:06.220> pick<00:01:06.400> them<00:01:06.550> all<00:01:06.670> out<00:01:06.850> you<00:01:07.120> can

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
then I can't pick them all out you can

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.810 
then I can't pick them all out you can
all<00:01:07.420> pick<00:01:07.600> them<00:01:07.720> out<00:01:07.810> maybe<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:09.430> that<00:01:09.460> looks

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
all pick them out maybe but that looks

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.660 
all pick them out maybe but that looks
like<00:01:09.940> it<00:01:10.120> might<00:01:10.150> be<00:01:10.300> a<00:01:10.450> van<00:01:10.660> muller<00:01:11.550> one<00:01:12.550> of

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
like it might be a van muller one of

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.390 
like it might be a van muller one of
those<00:01:12.820> cars<00:01:14.130> or<00:01:15.130> is<00:01:15.280> it<00:01:15.430> maybe<00:01:16.240> not<00:01:17.400> not

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
those cars or is it maybe not not

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.500 
those cars or is it maybe not not
everyone<00:01:18.729> can<00:01:18.850> thread<00:01:19.090> their<00:01:19.240> way<00:01:19.330> through

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
everyone can thread their way through

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.250 
everyone can thread their way through
certainly<00:01:20.020> not<00:01:20.890> what<00:01:21.040> nickel<00:01:21.369> it's<00:01:21.520> is<00:01:21.700> there

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
certainly not what nickel it's is there

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.490 
certainly not what nickel it's is there
and<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:26.650> is<00:01:26.830> really<00:01:27.820> very<00:01:28.690> very<00:01:29.050> bad<00:01:29.259> news

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
and this is really very very bad news

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.300 
and this is really very very bad news
indeed<00:01:31.080> cars<00:01:32.080> trying<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.650> spread<00:01:32.950> their<00:01:33.130> way

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
indeed cars trying to spread their way

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:41.819 
indeed cars trying to spread their way
through<00:01:34.890> what<00:01:35.890> is<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:37.229> scene<00:01:38.229> of

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.709 

resses<00:01:42.829> Gary<00:01:43.130> suspended<00:01:43.789> yeah<00:01:44.060> so<00:01:44.359> we're<00:01:44.539> just

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
resses Gary suspended yeah so we're just

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.270 
resses Gary suspended yeah so we're just
getting<00:01:44.899> word<00:01:45.049> that<00:01:45.319> race<00:01:45.770> is<00:01:45.799> going<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.219> be

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
getting word that race is going to be

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.849 
getting word that race is going to be
suspended<00:01:46.850> it's<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.810> whole<00:01:48.079> will<00:01:48.319> saying<00:01:48.590> down

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
suspended it's a whole will saying down

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:52.209 
suspended it's a whole will saying down
there<00:01:49.100> with<00:01:49.399> so<00:01:49.640> many<00:01:49.759> cars<00:01:50.119> having<00:01:51.049> gone<00:01:52.039> off

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
there with so many cars having gone off

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.480 
there with so many cars having gone off
and<00:01:52.250> quite<00:01:53.179> literally<00:01:53.630> blocked<00:01:53.929> the<00:01:54.490> circuit

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
and quite literally blocked the circuit

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.490 
and quite literally blocked the circuit
and<00:01:56.259> not<00:01:57.259> what<00:01:57.469> we<00:01:57.590> want<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.890> see<00:01:58.130> at<00:01:58.759> all<00:01:59.500> let's

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
and not what we want to see at all let's

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.480 
and not what we want to see at all let's
have<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:00.679> look<00:02:00.829> it's<00:02:01.039> going<00:02:01.159> to<00:02:01.219> be<00:02:01.310> difficult

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
have a look it's going to be difficult

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.999 
have a look it's going to be difficult
to<00:02:01.969> calculating<00:02:02.929> exactly<00:02:03.709> where<00:02:03.859> this

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
to calculating exactly where this

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.539 
to calculating exactly where this
started<00:02:04.579> but<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:06.229> little<00:02:06.409> sideways<00:02:07.039> moment

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
started but the little sideways moment

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.880 
started but the little sideways moment
for<00:02:07.700> Tom<00:02:07.909> Chilton<00:02:08.209> that<00:02:09.019> was<00:02:09.170> not<00:02:09.349> a<00:02:09.379> cause<00:02:09.649> it

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
for Tom Chilton that was not a cause it

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.890 
for Tom Chilton that was not a cause it
was<00:02:10.039> it<00:02:10.250> was<00:02:10.369> further<00:02:10.549> back<00:02:10.789> wasn't<00:02:11.209> it<00:02:11.269> so

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
was it was further back wasn't it so

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.960 
was it was further back wasn't it so
just<00:02:12.769> behind<00:02:13.250> there<00:02:13.989> which<00:02:14.989> is<00:02:15.170> why<00:02:15.760> know<00:02:16.760> what

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
just behind there which is why know what

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.030 
just behind there which is why know what
Mikkel<00:02:17.299> it's<00:02:17.450> got<00:02:18.290> collected<00:02:18.829> as<00:02:18.980> well

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
Mikkel it's got collected as well

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.580 
Mikkel it's got collected as well
another<00:02:22.040> angle<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:22.819> see<00:02:23.110> what<00:02:24.110> happened<00:02:24.440> are

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
another angle to see what happened are

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.860 
another angle to see what happened are
Mikkel<00:02:24.890> its<00:02:25.010> hits<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.400> barrier<00:02:25.870> sloughs

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
Mikkel its hits the barrier sloughs

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.190 
Mikkel its hits the barrier sloughs
across<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.500> circuit<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.099> a<00:02:28.970> huge<00:02:29.480> absorption

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
across the circuit and a huge absorption

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.940 
across the circuit and a huge absorption
of<00:02:30.379> energy<00:02:31.340> as<00:02:31.459> everybody<00:02:31.910> else<00:02:32.120> tries<00:02:32.480> to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
of energy as everybody else tries to

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.729 
of energy as everybody else tries to
avoid<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.750> yeah<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.989> was<00:02:36.019> one<00:02:36.319> after<00:02:36.620> the

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
avoid and yeah it was one after the

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.460 
avoid and yeah it was one after the
other<00:02:36.769> wasn't<00:02:37.129> it<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:38.030> they<00:02:38.180> all<00:02:38.470> just

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
other wasn't it and they all just

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.640 
other wasn't it and they all just
collapsed<00:02:39.980> into<00:02:40.250> each<00:02:40.370> other
