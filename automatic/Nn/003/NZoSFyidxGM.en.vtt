the<00:00:55.140> time<00:00:55.350> very<00:00:55.680> easily<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.629> with

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the time very easily but it's just with

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.040 
the time very easily but it's just with
them<00:00:58.640> online<00:00:59.640> versus<00:01:00.000> plays<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.449> Hut<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.899> it

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
them online versus plays and Hut that it

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.179 
them online versus plays and Hut that it
really<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.440> kind<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.710> screws<00:01:02.609> up<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
really just kind of screws up the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.670 
really just kind of screws up the
matchup<00:01:05.189> system<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.850> little<00:01:06.119> bit<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.290> so

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
matchup system a little bit but so so

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.640 
matchup system a little bit but so so
far<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.010> been<00:01:08.130> good<00:01:08.400> hopefully<00:01:09.360> it'll<00:01:09.650> carry

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
far it's been good hopefully it'll carry

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.460 
far it's been good hopefully it'll carry
over<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.220> once<00:01:11.610> again<00:01:12.290> but<00:01:13.290> we're<00:01:13.380> going
