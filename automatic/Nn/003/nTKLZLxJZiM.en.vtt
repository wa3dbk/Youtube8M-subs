00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the way around the net but I like that

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.210 
the way around the net but I like that
better<00:01:03.019> besides<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.440> also<00:01:04.559> gives<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.129> an

extra half a mesh in depth make sure net
just<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.080> little<00:01:10.320> bit<00:01:10.409> deeper<00:01:10.740> than<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.920> would

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
just a little bit deeper than it would

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:20.520

the only thing I have to do now is tie
the<00:02:55.530> two<00:02:55.860> strings<00:02:56.160> together<00:02:58.160> I'm<00:02:59.160> finished

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
the two strings together I'm finished

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.400 
the two strings together I'm finished
and<00:03:01.560> I'm<00:03:01.710> going<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.950> untie<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:02.340> knot<00:03:03.380> where<00:03:04.380> I

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.670 
did not that I tied it first I'm going
to<00:03:10.020> cut<00:03:10.200> this<00:03:10.380> off<00:03:12.140> then<00:03:13.140> I'm<00:03:13.230> going<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.470> tie

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
to cut this off then I'm going to tie

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.410 
to cut this off then I'm going to tie
these<00:03:13.740> two<00:03:14.160> strings<00:03:14.430> together<00:03:14.610> making<00:03:15.210> one

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
these two strings together making one
