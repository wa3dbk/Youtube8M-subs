get the standard frames which will look
a<00:01:22.200> little<00:01:22.380> bit<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:23.360> keeps<00:01:24.360> might<00:01:24.630> have

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
a little bit like that keeps might have

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.240 
a little bit like that keeps might have
just<00:01:25.580> died<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:27.680> really<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:28.799> what's<00:01:28.950> going<00:01:29.189> on

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250

there<00:01:30.079> isn't<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> battleground<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.650> think

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
there isn't a battleground I think

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.920 
there isn't a battleground I think
that's<00:01:32.130> probably<00:01:32.549> why<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:33.630> anyway<00:01:33.810> they

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
that's probably why see anyway they

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.300 
that's probably why see anyway they
looked<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> little<00:01:34.170> bit<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:35.070> might<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
looked a little bit like that I might a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.999 
looked a little bit like that I might a
really<00:01:35.790> tiny<00:01:36.000> because<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.659> my<00:01:36.869> UI<00:01:37.259> scaling

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
really tiny because I have my UI scaling

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.270 
really tiny because I have my UI scaling
right<00:01:38.430> minimum<00:01:39.439> so<00:01:40.439> now<00:01:40.560> if<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.710> click<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
right minimum so now if you click on the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.940 
right minimum so now if you click on the
eye<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.689> come<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.140> set<00:01:43.409> this

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
eye you can come in here and set this

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.399 
eye you can come in here and set this
option<00:01:44.130> use<00:01:44.610> raid<00:01:44.939> style<00:01:45.390> party<00:01:45.840> frames<00:01:46.110> which

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
option use raid style party frames which

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.480 
option use raid style party frames which
is<00:01:46.530> what<00:01:46.680> I've<00:01:46.799> got<00:01:46.979> set<00:01:47.250> up<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:49.220> you<00:01:50.220> can't

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
is what I've got set up and you can't

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.380 
is what I've got set up and you can't
really<00:01:50.610> see<00:01:50.790> them<00:01:50.909> very<00:01:51.060> well<00:01:51.180> because

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
really see them very well because

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.090 
really see them very well because
they're<00:01:51.600> underneath<00:01:51.899> there<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.500> let's<00:01:52.680> let's

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
they're underneath there so let's let's

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.249 
they're underneath there so let's let's
unlock<00:01:53.759> them<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.270> move<00:01:54.479> them<00:01:54.509> out<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.049> way<00:01:55.229> so

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
unlock them and move them out the way so

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.980 
unlock them and move them out the way so
we<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:57.149> kind<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.420> things<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.899> do

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
we can see the kind of things we can do

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.990 
we can see the kind of things we can do
with<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.469> we<00:01:58.590> can<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.399> scale<00:01:59.729> these

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
with that so we can we can scale these

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.310 
with that so we can we can scale these
up<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.420> certain<00:02:00.659> amount

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
up to a certain amount

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.539 
up to a certain amount
know<00:02:03.320> as<00:02:03.829> big<00:02:04.070> as<00:02:04.189> you<00:02:04.280> want<00:02:04.460> really<00:02:05.140> he'll

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
know as big as you want really he'll

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.699 
know as big as you want really he'll
turn<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.609> borders<00:02:08.090> off<00:02:08.269> display<00:02:08.750> pets<00:02:09.259> and

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
turn the borders off display pets and

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.380 
turn the borders off display pets and
whatnot<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.789> these<00:02:10.910> are<00:02:11.030> actually<00:02:11.300> pretty

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
whatnot and these are actually pretty

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.160 
whatnot and these are actually pretty
good<00:02:11.629> now<00:02:11.810> they<00:02:12.019> they<00:02:12.800> will<00:02:12.980> show<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:14.170> dispel

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
good now they they will show you dispel

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.789 
good now they they will show you dispel
a<00:02:15.200> ball<00:02:15.440> debuffs<00:02:16.129> on<00:02:17.170> party<00:02:18.170> members<00:02:18.500> they

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
a ball debuffs on party members they

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.020 
a ball debuffs on party members they
will<00:02:18.950> show<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.220> whether<00:02:19.610> they've<00:02:19.819> got<00:02:20.000> a

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
will show you whether they've got a

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.869 
will show you whether they've got a
shield<00:02:20.390> on<00:02:20.629> or<00:02:20.930> not<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:22.549> will<00:02:22.640> show<00:02:22.819> you

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
shield on or not and it will show you

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.789 
shield on or not and it will show you
the<00:02:23.000> amount<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.720> effective<00:02:24.290> healing<00:02:24.650> you're

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
the amount of effective healing you're

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.160 
the amount of effective healing you're
going<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:24.980> do<00:02:25.069> when<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.340> do<00:02:25.519> a<00:02:25.549> heel<00:02:26.049> so<00:02:27.049> that's

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
going to do when you do a heel so that's

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.930 
going to do when you do a heel so that's
pretty<00:02:27.349> good<00:02:27.530> so<00:02:27.799> for<00:02:28.099> example<00:02:28.959> if<00:02:29.959> I<00:02:30.790> why<00:02:31.790> he

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
pretty good so for example if I why he

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.050 
pretty good so for example if I why he
says<00:02:32.180> do<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.599> have<00:02:32.750> heel<00:02:33.080> on<00:02:33.319> my<00:02:33.470> bar<00:02:33.790> if<00:02:34.790> we're

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
says do I have heel on my bar if we're

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.140 
says do I have heel on my bar if we're
here<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.510> can<00:02:35.660> kind<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:35.989> see<00:02:36.140> there<00:02:36.849> as<00:02:37.849> well

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
here you can kind of see there as well

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.930 
here you can kind of see there as well
that<00:02:38.650> wasn't<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.680> particularly<00:02:39.980> great<00:02:40.370> example

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
that wasn't a particularly great example

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.009 
that wasn't a particularly great example
but<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.840> get<00:02:42.049> the<00:02:42.170> idea<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.940> see<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.329> yeah

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
but you get the idea you see the yeah

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.479 
but you get the idea you see the yeah
there<00:02:45.200> we<00:02:45.290> go<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.680> because<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.099> was<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.280> quick

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
there we go and because that was a quick

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.430 
there we go and because that was a quick
Heal<00:02:46.700> I've<00:02:46.880> now<00:02:47.060> got<00:02:47.239> a<00:02:47.269> shield<00:02:47.690> on<00:02:47.870> as<00:02:48.200> well

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
Heal I've now got a shield on as well

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.650 
Heal I've now got a shield on as well
let's<00:02:48.739> move<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.010> up<00:02:49.160> there<00:02:49.400> actually<00:02:49.730> I'll

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
let's move that up there actually I'll

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.530 
let's move that up there actually I'll
be<00:02:50.840> a<00:02:50.870> bit<00:02:51.019> easier<00:02:52.180> that's<00:02:53.180> pretty<00:02:53.360> cool

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
be a bit easier that's pretty cool

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.750 
be a bit easier that's pretty cool
though<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:53.900> actually<00:02:54.230> really<00:02:54.890> like<00:02:55.069> the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
though I actually really like the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.500 
though I actually really like the
built-in<00:02:56.590> unit<00:02:57.590> frames<00:02:57.980> now<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.819> it's<00:02:59.329> not

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
built-in unit frames now and it's not

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.119 
built-in unit frames now and it's not
it's<00:02:59.810> not<00:02:59.959> another<00:03:00.260> add-on<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.680> have<00:03:00.980> to

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
it's not another add-on you have to

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.720 
it's not another add-on you have to
update<00:03:01.900> okay<00:03:02.900> talking<00:03:03.200> about<00:03:03.470> ons<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.400> let's

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
update okay talking about ons so let's

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.539 
update okay talking about ons so let's
go<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.000> have<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.180> look<00:03:05.329> at<00:03:05.680> click<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.130> click<00:03:07.400> is

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
go and have a look at click so click is

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:13.420 
go and have a look at click so click is
the<00:03:07.579> thing<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.329> allows<00:03:08.569> you<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:12.190> click<00:03:13.190> on

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
the thing that allows you to click on

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.340 
the thing that allows you to click on
targets<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:14.209> set<00:03:14.389> up<00:03:14.510> key<00:03:14.690> binds<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.200> do

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
targets and set up key binds to do

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.120 
targets and set up key binds to do
certain<00:03:15.709> spells<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:17.840> takes<00:03:18.200> like<00:03:18.560> very<00:03:18.920> little

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
certain spells it takes like very little

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.190 
certain spells it takes like very little
setup<00:03:19.549> which<00:03:19.910> is<00:03:19.940> like<00:03:20.540> I<00:03:20.569> said<00:03:20.780> that's<00:03:20.870> one<00:03:21.109> of

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
setup which is like I said that's one of

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.890 
setup which is like I said that's one of
the<00:03:21.260> reasons<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:21.620> like<00:03:21.829> it<00:03:22.569> so<00:03:23.569> once<00:03:23.690> you've<00:03:23.810> got

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
the reasons I like it so once you've got

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.960 
the reasons I like it so once you've got
it<00:03:23.930> installed<00:03:24.079> if<00:03:25.069> you<00:03:25.250> open<00:03:25.519> up<00:03:25.579> your<00:03:25.639> spell

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
it installed if you open up your spell

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.250 
it installed if you open up your spell
book<00:03:26.000> you'll<00:03:26.329> actually<00:03:26.480> have<00:03:26.720> another<00:03:27.019> tab

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
book you'll actually have another tab

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.080 
book you'll actually have another tab
here<00:03:27.530> which<00:03:27.709> is<00:03:27.859> your<00:03:28.040> click<00:03:28.340> binding

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
here which is your click binding

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.160 
here which is your click binding
configuration<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:31.599> essentially<00:03:32.599> all<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.989> do

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
configuration and essentially all you do

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.319 
configuration and essentially all you do
and<00:03:33.859> I've<00:03:34.069> got<00:03:34.250> some<00:03:34.489> set<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:34.819> here<00:03:35.060> already

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
and I've got some set in here already

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.140 
and I've got some set in here already
but<00:03:35.599> let's<00:03:35.780> say<00:03:35.930> we<00:03:36.019> wanted<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.319> set<00:03:36.620> up<00:03:37.150> fear

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
but let's say we wanted to set up fear

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.620 
but let's say we wanted to set up fear
ward<00:03:38.510> on<00:03:39.139> somebody<00:03:40.130> all<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:40.819> do<00:03:40.970> is<00:03:41.239> you<00:03:41.420> hover

let's just say we wanted to set it up to

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.229 
let's just say we wanted to set it up to
control<00:03:50.419> J<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:51.349> don't<00:03:51.650> think<00:03:52.130> I<00:03:52.250> use<00:03:52.430> ctrl<00:03:52.849> J<00:03:53.090> in

we can we can hover over the unit frame

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.600 
we can we can hover over the unit frame
there<00:04:19.080> now<00:04:20.080> this<00:04:20.230> is<00:04:20.380> my<00:04:20.530> target<00:04:21.010> this<00:04:21.040> is<00:04:21.370> my

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
there now this is my target this is my

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.670 
there now this is my target this is my
targets<00:04:22.060> target<00:04:22.450> if<00:04:22.690> you've<00:04:22.840> got<00:04:22.960> a<00:04:22.990> focus<00:04:23.290> it

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
targets target if you've got a focus it

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.020 
targets target if you've got a focus it
works<00:04:23.920> as<00:04:24.160> well<00:04:24.460> that's<00:04:25.360> my<00:04:25.570> focus<00:04:25.810> their<00:04:27.030> pets

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
works as well that's my focus their pets

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.110 
works as well that's my focus their pets
work<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:28.720> of<00:04:29.110> course<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.490> raid<00:04:30.820> frames

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
work and of course the the raid frames

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.270 
work and of course the the raid frames
and<00:04:31.360> party<00:04:31.630> frames<00:04:31.840> work<00:04:32.080> as<00:04:32.230> well<00:04:32.410> so<00:04:33.130> if<00:04:33.190> we

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
and party frames work as well so if we

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.750 
and party frames work as well so if we
now<00:04:33.490> go<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.790> hit<00:04:33.940> control<00:04:34.390> J<00:04:35.430> you<00:04:36.430> can<00:04:36.580> see

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
now go and hit control J you can see

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.450 
now go and hit control J you can see
there<00:04:37.000> I've<00:04:37.540> got<00:04:37.570> fee<00:04:37.960> award<00:04:38.200> on<00:04:38.320> me<00:04:38.500> it's

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
there I've got fee award on me it's

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.760 
there I've got fee award on me it's
really<00:04:39.640> that<00:04:39.820> simple<00:04:39.850> I<00:04:40.570> guess<00:04:41.260> it<00:04:41.410> you

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
really that simple I guess it you

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.050 
really that simple I guess it you
probably<00:04:42.010> don't<00:04:42.430> know<00:04:42.520> how<00:04:42.670> good<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:42.970> is

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
probably don't know how good it is

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.130 
probably don't know how good it is
unless<00:04:43.510> you've<00:04:43.690> actually<00:04:43.750> tried<00:04:44.110> to

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
unless you've actually tried to

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.010 
unless you've actually tried to
configure<00:04:44.590> healbot<00:04:44.980> or<00:04:45.280> grid<00:04:45.580> which<00:04:46.360> I<00:04:46.690> just

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
configure healbot or grid which I just

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.370 
configure healbot or grid which I just
think<00:04:47.740> is<00:04:48.460> terrible

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
think is terrible

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.510 
think is terrible
so<00:04:50.380> if<00:04:50.440> anything<00:04:50.650> you<00:04:50.830> really<00:04:51.070> need<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.400> watch

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
so if anything you really need to watch

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.380 
so if anything you really need to watch
out<00:04:51.790> for<00:04:51.820> is<00:04:53.490> by<00:04:54.490> default<00:04:55.060> like

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
out for is by default like

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.850 
out for is by default like
right-clicking<00:04:55.990> on<00:04:56.170> one<00:04:56.380> of<00:04:56.410> these<00:04:56.560> frames

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
right-clicking on one of these frames

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.750 
right-clicking on one of these frames
brings<00:04:57.340> up<00:04:57.550> its<00:04:57.760> right-click<00:04:58.510> options<00:04:59.250> so<00:05:00.250> I

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
brings up its right-click options so I

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.150 
brings up its right-click options so I
think<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:01.570> can<00:05:01.810> configure<00:05:02.290> right-click<00:05:02.919> but

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
think you can configure right-click but

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.190 
think you can configure right-click but
I<00:05:03.190> guess<00:05:03.520> not<00:05:03.760> so<00:05:04.090> we've<00:05:04.390> got<00:05:04.600> you<00:05:04.960> know<00:05:05.080> I've

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
I guess not so we've got you know I've

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.790 
I guess not so we've got you know I've
got<00:05:05.380> kind<00:05:05.560> of<00:05:06.780> shift<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:07.990> right<00:05:08.140> click<00:05:08.200> and

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
got kind of shift and right click and

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.140 
got kind of shift and right click and
other<00:05:09.190> things<00:05:09.460> like<00:05:09.640> that<00:05:09.880> because<00:05:10.120> sometimes

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
other things like that because sometimes

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.460 
other things like that because sometimes
you<00:05:10.540> do<00:05:10.630> actually<00:05:10.750> need<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:11.050> right-click<00:05:11.230> on

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
you do actually need to right-click on

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.280 
you do actually need to right-click on
people<00:05:11.970> so<00:05:12.970> I'll<00:05:13.060> see<00:05:13.180> anything<00:05:13.510> you<00:05:13.930> can<00:05:14.110> get
