doesn't have to be broken down here and
then<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.729> travels<00:01:53.909> through<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.329> liver<00:01:54.540> and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
then it travels through the liver and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.910 
then it travels through the liver and
then<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.930> travels<00:01:55.079> through<00:01:55.320> here<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:55.829> it

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
finally gets into the muscle and then

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.520 
finally gets into the muscle and then
it's<00:01:57.780> got<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.899> go<00:01:58.049> through<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.290> cell<00:01:58.500> wall

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
it's got to go through the cell wall

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.539 
it's got to go through the cell wall
then<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.040> got<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.219> go<00:01:59.280> through<00:01:59.460> the

then it's got to go through the
mitochondria<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.180> by<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.360> time<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.719> gets

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
mitochondria and by the time it gets

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.179 
mitochondria and by the time it gets
there<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> dude<00:02:01.560> I've<00:02:01.799> been<00:02:01.829> waiting

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
there it's like a dude I've been waiting

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.200 
there it's like a dude I've been waiting
20<00:02:02.340> minutes<00:02:02.820> I'm<00:02:03.719> done<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.350> race<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.710> over<00:02:05.210> but

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
20 minutes I'm done the race is over but

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.700 
20 minutes I'm done the race is over but
if<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.390> fat<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.719> inside<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.380> muscle<00:02:07.530> cell

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
if the fat is inside of the muscle cell

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.920 
if the fat is inside of the muscle cell
boom<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:09.090> right<00:02:09.149> there<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.929> ready<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.709> go

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
boom it's right there and ready to go

boom it's right there and ready to go
how<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.110> put<00:02:13.290> fat<00:02:13.500> inside<00:02:13.830> of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
how do you put fat inside of

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.830 
how do you put fat inside of
muscle<00:02:14.689> aerobic<00:02:15.830> exercise
