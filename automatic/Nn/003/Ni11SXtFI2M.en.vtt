00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
hey guys hope you're all doing well here
today with another disappointing

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.559
products video unfortunately I suppose
because these products just don't work

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.549
for me or they're just not what I
thought they would be and I definitely

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.660
wanted to let you guys know about them
this is my third disappointing products

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.050
video I'll put a link to the other two
that I've done in the description bar if

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.730
you guys haven't seen them yet you seem
to like them because you know it's all

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.910
fine and good for me to rave about
products and let you guys know all my

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.410
favorites but I think it's also good for
me to let you guys know what products

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.489
haven't worked for me as well in case
you're looking at purchasing them so

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.870
hopefully you guys like this video as
well when I get to a sort of like around

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.660
four or five products that are sort of
like a regret buying this I'll make one

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.640
of these videos for you guys so i've got
i think four or five to share with you

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.219
so if you're interested then please keep
watching ok so the first one is here I

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.519
have waited a while to let you guys know
about this because I just couldn't make

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.760
my mind up on it and i think i have now
and unfortunately i'm disappointed that

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.640
i got this it's the nas all day luminous
weightless foundation i have tried so

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.330
many different ways to use this and i
can't get it to work the only way that i

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.460
would use this now is if i'm mixing it
in with another foundation just for

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.570
color matching because alone it just
does not work for me I've tried using my

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.600
fingers using a damp Beauty Blender
using a brush stippling it all different

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.780
ways of trying to apply it and it just
does not provide the coverage it sticks

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.790
on areas it's just not flawless
whatsoever coverage wise it doesn't give

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.780
me much coverage at all than you guys
know I like sort of light to medium

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.299
coverage but this doesn't even give me
that I absolutely love the NARS sheer

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.460
glow that
one of my absolute favorite foundations

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.990
and I had such high hopes for this
thinking that oh my gosh you know you

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.400
guys know I love luminous foundations
and think it would be even better than

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.870
the sheer glow but no I would definitely
recommend if you're looking at either

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.420
one of those I would go the sheer glow
and I really really wanted to love this

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.380
I have to let you guys know about it I
was going to do a full review on it

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.180
because I was so excited when I got it
but yeah I just kept trying all

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.940
different ways to use it to recommend to
you guys but yeah I just couldn't get it

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.330
to work and you know how they say the
one pump definitely not one pump one

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.650
pump did sort of this area of my face
now this next one isn't a disappointing

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.820
product it's just that I regret
purchasing it because I prefer the Jew

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.770
to it better which is a fraction of the
price now this one is it here it's the

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.320
Stiller magnificent metal eyes in kitten
and the dupe for it which I prefer is

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.260
this one here and it's the Australis
metallics I shadow in gold gaga I've got

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.140
a review blog post of the collection of
these and actually a swatch comparison

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.380
of these two and actually prefer how
this one applies and how it wears so and

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.090
as I said fraction of the price I got
this around Christmas time and then this

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.260
one just came out recently but
definitely won't be repurchasing this

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.459
one I'll repurchase this one for sure
this metallics range is part of their

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.670
permanent range the Australia's
permanent range now which is really good

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.230
definitely prefer this one and the next
one unfortunately is the models prefer

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.560
soft touch mineral powder this one is in
luminous glow I've got all four of them

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.450
and I don't mind the other three they've
got a little bit more pigmentation but

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.300
this one I just can't get it to show up
on my skin I mean it gets compared to

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.470
the hourglass ambient lighting powders
and I've got luminous light in that and

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.510
that is so pigmented and I really
thought that these ones would be at

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.299
least a similar pigmentation
but they are as I said I try to get this

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.280
one to do have any payoff on my skin but
it just does not show up so this one is

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.199
in luminous glow I'll swatch it for you
guys that's it there and you can see

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.970
like I fully try to get as much as I
could off but yeah there's hardly

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.250
anything that shows up on my skin I
don't mind the radiant glow one because

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.350
it just gives a little bit of warmth to
the face without you know being too

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.930
bronzed I suppose but yeah if you want
just a subtle highlight the others check

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.720
out the others but this one here in
luminous glow I don't recommend

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.280
unfortunately now on to a bit of skin
care this guy here it's by philosophy

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.860
you guys know I love philosophy all
there you know renewed hope in a jar and

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.580
you know their body washes and
everything like that so I thought this

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.630
one would be fantastic as a serum
underneath my moisturizer because

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.720
everyone says vitamin C serums are
fantastic this one unfortunately I think

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.510
might be too active for my skin I really
have to be careful with serums I really

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:33.159
need very just light sensitive either
oils or serums work well for me but

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:39.430
anything too active I think just makes
my skin react and that's what this did I

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.710
used it a few times underneath my
moisturizer at night and I found that

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.020
after say about three or four days I was
just getting little bumps everywhere an

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.039
irritated skin and I can only put it
down to this because it's this is the

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:59.530
only thing that I changed so yeah this
may work perfectly for you let me know

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.240
if it does unfortunately i'll have to
give this away because it just doesn't

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.039
work for me and also this one here it's
a mineral lip liner by nude by Nature

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.300
it's in the color de mujer absolutely
love this color it's the color that I'm

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.490
going for in wit liners at the moment so
i thought i would love it but no it

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.860
drags on the skin and it's not very
comfortable to apply whatsoever i know a

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.110
lot of pencil
liners are like that traditionally but

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.030
the essence pencil lip liners are so
nice and creamy and easy to apply so I

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.930
thought this one would be like that but
no it just pulls on the skin

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.150
unfortunately they're all the current
disappointing products for me guys not

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.950
too many which is good I try and do as
much research as I can before I buy new

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.480
products and yeah there's just a few
that just don't live up to the

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.590
expectation let me know if they work for
you though if I should try them in a

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.480
different way and also let me know if
there's any disappointing products that

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.380
you've come across as well so we can
share them and yeah that is pretty much
