00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.700
 In any case, the draw has 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.660
 For boston also very worthwhile 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:30.029
 they played super first place 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.830
 for me, yes, with these words of rené 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.480
 May I welcome you warmly 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.199
 for the twelfth day of the regional league 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.250
 north our goslarer sc played against the 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.150
 top riders and table leaders 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.100
 Holstein keel 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.489
 The stadium was very well filled 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.350
 1169 spectators and especially students 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.839
 was that the same time with sometimes 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.000
 Provide people was the right thing 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.449
 city ​​and heavy tasks into the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.059
 game 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.430
 first action of kiel marcel schied in 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.739
 the middle heads the ball to the latte 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.210
 Laue is the second ball for that 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.280
 It was the kieler's first good chance 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.739
 so after eleven minutes after flattened 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.150
 the game a bit the most 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.670
 scenes took place in midfield 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.420
 Kiel had more ball possession and we 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.980
 stood behind very compact and ours 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.490
 augenmerk is our augenmerk on 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.200
 counter 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.540
 you can see another good option 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.480
 the kieler nice ball of tens 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.500
 johansson 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.610
 which understands pure again but warps 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.850
 their long throw from right-back 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.170
 a good shot of kacar, mine 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.460
 because of that they were the fake ones 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.580
 best action by kiel in the first 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.020
 halbzeit our best now followed the 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.540
 others just played long ball 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.920
 in the beginning marseille runs through 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.450
 defender and goalkeeper they are not 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.890
 agree and make him inimitable 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.750
 one on the 1 0 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.160
 who was cheering measles in large stadium 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.200
 is also happy after two games of red 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.190
 barrier he is back and he skin 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.920
 the thing immediately 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.740
 the kieler fans over we see it 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.040
 again a slow-motion ice-cold 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.600
 Außenrist no chance for the keeper yes 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.010
 so it was in the half time afterwards 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.680
 of course the kids can get mad out of the 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.930
 half-time again and in the 46 minute 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.660
 how should it be different mazan muslehe he 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.630
 foult haider just cheered mine 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.370
 I questionable but eleven meters marriage loud 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.720
 The Rhine pull us after the game 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.830
 it was scarce he was in the right place 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.210
 corner but there was just too good 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.850
 shot he unfortunately did not arrive 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.190
 Well then it went on a nice 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.200
 standard situation of us willi flankt 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.880
 in a hurry on the meantime 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.980
 Substitutes let the warp 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.810
 unfortunately scarcely yes and here comes now 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.160
 best scene of the game again marcel 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.410
 divorced by looks in the middle 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.800
 Johansson free from the gate direct purchase 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.209
 but for a long time it keeps him absolutely world class 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.680
 you have to say so, yes, a little bit of luck 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.940
 we had what you look like here 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.989
 then a latten action yes but that 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.030
 luck, the guys have rather work 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.020
 in the last weeks and 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.790
 make use of it that's it 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.940
 scene goes on but runs 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.440
 now by a foul 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.180
 yes and then we will make it clear 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.280
 can justin eilers as in the last one 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.959
 week in bremen fischi is in a hurry 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.720
 Alone from the gate takes the ball unfortunately 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.580
 something bad with and yes that would be the 2nd 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.489
 1 because the jubilarian also put 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.810
 has been huge but it has not 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.470
 should still be nice game 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.860
 make it good with us the trainer of ours 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.140
 guests from the table guide keel 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.769
 Good time first congratulations if you have to 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.290
 can say 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.459
 to the point, however, I see today 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.459
 probably expect more 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.180
 no easy task last play 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.469
 very much 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.469
 the strongest team 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.820
 seen from one must expect it 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.700
 that we draw again we 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:51.330
 also have a bit today 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:54.690
 Computing has this fight against 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.670
 the table guide against table leader 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.220
 expect new measured points 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.170
 but it is just great 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.750
 came on 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:13.709
 we work today and too 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:15.989
 Low ones have more than what you get in time 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.989
 after common to 1 converted allawi out 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.570
 wisdom screaming to go with the 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.870
 performance of slawo now even longer 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.870
 injured 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.520
 inserted is used the page has one 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.180
 some made with dense or I 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.180
 a little bit of problems 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.530
 harder to pack opponents so 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:44.110
 so far next friday in meppen 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.450
 I'm sure the meppener with me 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.010
 currently 27 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.010
 relatively weak what is going on 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.790
 usually enjoy it very clearly 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.850
 Eventually a point comes to get 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.630
 That's a sensation because it is 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:07.780
 Of course 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:09.340
 so far the point was pretty much today 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.710
 exhausting this beautiful october sun 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.030
 Olympics 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.660
 I think we are a bit one 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.400
 a bit broken 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.620
 one has also seen that the goal 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.830
 just above the home 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.360
 Quality of the Rhine to have come 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.480
 of course very, very good football 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.790
 was played for us in difficult 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.020
 to make europe's time but I think 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.670
 We still have your Austria 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.650
 Well done the guided tours 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.450
 tried a little bit over the 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.880
 to put complete few counterrevolutionary 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.350
 yes, not quite in the second half 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.940
 Of course, the lightning would have worked out 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.710
 he had to be honest 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.870
 but still we have it again and again 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.190
 He tries to set the fire 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.630
 We also have two good options 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.700
 but in the end we have, of course 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.380
 has also had luck with think I 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.090
 once latte once post 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.130
 I think there is a bit of points 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.200
 happy but a single week 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.540
 Maybe one speaks again of 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.380
 each of you again a few words 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.380
 about the game 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.569
 aware that the strong 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.710
 behind on fast players 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.840
 from there it is through just 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.240
 a draw is still a bit was 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.690
 in relation of oil to naturally with the 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.690
 31 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.800
 I can sign that, too 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:31.599
 we are really happy 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.680
 after the game against Holstein Kiel 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:36.039
 spend big big climb 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.620
 have to 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.780
 we must 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.310
 France plays I think it was too 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.080
 Nice many spectators because they had 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.210
 fun and we have as I said that one 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.190
 lady has a little luck with it 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.190
 the post shot a very good action 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.979
 that is a performance-oriented 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.760
 we draw a bit of luck 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.760
 had that the 3
