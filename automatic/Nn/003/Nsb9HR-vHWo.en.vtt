00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.730
 small 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.279
 I will briefly review the review with him 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.750
 was a man she saw the video 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.570
 told me what my transfer and 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.390
 realizing seemed appetizing attacked Fashion 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.550

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.990

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.180
 it just flashed through wi-fi but it's at 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.000
 she did not accept me 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.520
 memory card first story I thought and 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.649
 if a person convert later 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.360
 just try it or big through 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.649
 Wi-Fi 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.930
 start to convert goat memory she 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.899
 writes error the second time invective she 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.960
 already writes that the memory card does not exist 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.180
 but I then took a demigod to warm old 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.789
 4th memory card here on the 16th on you 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.190
 all the files there you copied to the computer 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.860
 then they took watched the video in 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.159
 internet 2 then video even firmware 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.920
 gave the link and I took and went 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.530
 I got it now works 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:22.770
 all I said now proceed to the game 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:25.950
 the game we will have mortal kombat new 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.990
 mortal kombat honestly i am more 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.930
 nicotine raglan corner model 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.700
 played on the console for a long time on 1 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.759
 bags start 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.549
 so but by the end of the nineties 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.860
 the beginning of the 2000s was mortal kombat 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.610
 there is a completely different mortal kombat 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.829
 Now let's see what so now we 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.429
 look at this wonderful gambling 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:54.579
 so you can take a closer look in general 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:59.619
 here I reached the boss well, as there 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:02.110
 you know few opponents but still 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.969
 reached boxing and I couldn't kill him 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.789
 the latter being somehow late 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:12.730
 it was even so well let's start with 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:16.030
 I am beginning to show you a few such 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.630

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:23.049

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:10.170

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:12.530

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.530

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:49.310
 I told myself now I will show you 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.569
 how does it go on like this 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.640

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:59.140

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.130
