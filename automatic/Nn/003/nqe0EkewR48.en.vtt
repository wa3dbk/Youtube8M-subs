00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
exhaust is dangerous but boss created

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.340 
exhaust is dangerous but boss created
the<00:03:41.580> system<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.120> stand<00:03:42.480> heat<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:42.989> is

the system to a stand heat and is

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.750 
the system to a stand heat and is
designed<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.799> be<00:03:43.860> placed<00:03:44.160> under<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.610> hood<00:03:44.730> of

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.530 

so<00:03:51.310> now<00:03:51.430> that<00:03:51.489> we've<00:03:51.730> made<00:03:51.760> all<00:03:52.030> of<00:03:52.060> our<00:03:52.209> final

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
so now that we've made all of our final

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.239 
so now that we've made all of our final
connections<00:03:53.019> all<00:03:53.409> that's<00:03:53.739> left<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:53.980> do<00:03:54.219> is

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:54.249 
connections all that's left to do is

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:56.369 
connections all that's left to do is
