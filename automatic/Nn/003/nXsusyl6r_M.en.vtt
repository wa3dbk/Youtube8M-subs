00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
little blocks now that didn't quite work

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.429 
little blocks now that didn't quite work

little pieces joined together so as you
can<00:01:12.390> see<00:01:12.630> I'm<00:01:12.900> taking<00:01:13.080> bit-by-bit

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
can see I'm taking bit-by-bit

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.530 
can see I'm taking bit-by-bit
and<00:01:14.729> laying<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:16.909> where<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.090> found<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and laying it up where so I found the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.440 
and laying it up where so I found the
best<00:01:18.570> way<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.900> do<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.350> let's<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.549> make<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.150> all

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
best way to do it let's just make it all

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.050 
best way to do it let's just make it all
into<00:01:21.750> one<00:01:21.780> big<00:01:22.229> ball<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.799> push<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.880> down<00:01:24.030> on

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
into one big ball and push it down on

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.609 
into one big ball and push it down on
the<00:01:24.390> floor<00:01:24.600> obviously<00:01:24.750> I'm<00:01:25.020> using<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.320> plastic

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the floor obviously I'm using a plastic

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.870 
the floor obviously I'm using a plastic
bag<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.130> don't<00:01:26.280> damage<00:01:26.460> any<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.790> your

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
bag so I don't damage any of your

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.350 
bag so I don't damage any of your
flooring<00:01:28.189> but<00:01:29.189> spread<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.820> all<00:01:29.939> down<00:01:30.119> it's

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
flooring but spread it all down it's

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.859 
flooring but spread it all down it's
basically<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.920> you're<00:01:31.920> making<00:01:32.909> pastry<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
basically like you're making pastry and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.249 
basically like you're making pastry and
just<00:01:34.200> spread<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.950> all<00:01:35.070> out<00:01:35.570> just<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.140> can

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
just spread it all out just like you can

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.010 
just spread it all out just like you can
see<00:01:37.290> here<00:01:37.680> now<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.850> did<00:01:39.090> leave<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.810> about

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
see here now I did leave this for about

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.230 
see here now I did leave this for about
an<00:01:40.380> hour<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> half<00:01:40.890> two<00:01:41.189> hours<00:01:41.549> or<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:41.970> I

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
an hour and a half two hours or so I

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.450 
an hour and a half two hours or so I
can't<00:01:42.689> remember<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.079> exact<00:01:43.350> timing<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
can't remember the exact timing but the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.210 
can't remember the exact timing but the
water-based<00:01:44.909> clay<00:01:45.060> was<00:01:45.390> very<00:01:46.020> very<00:01:46.320> watery<00:01:46.890> so

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
water-based clay was very very watery so

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.530 
water-based clay was very very watery so
when<00:01:47.369> it'll<00:01:47.549> put<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.939> my<00:01:48.030> chin<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.420> was

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
when it'll put it up to my chin it was

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.810 
when it'll put it up to my chin it was
just<00:01:48.689> hopping<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.470> staying<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.829> shape<00:01:50.040> so

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
just hopping and not staying in shape so

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.730 
just hopping and not staying in shape so
once<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.119> dried<00:01:51.360> out<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.540> little<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.259> stay<00:01:52.560> in

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
once it dried out a little it is stay in

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.850 
once it dried out a little it is stay in
shape<00:01:53.040> more<00:01:53.310> now<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.570> dried<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.259> did

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
shape more now that it's dried out I did

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.490 
shape more now that it's dried out I did
take<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.880> again<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.329> put<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.689> all<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.200> big

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
take it again and put it all as one big

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.560 
take it again and put it all as one big
piece<00:01:58.770> up<00:01:59.280> too<00:01:59.549> much<00:01:59.719> chin<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.930> push<00:02:01.740> it

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
piece up too much chin and push it

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.120 
piece up too much chin and push it
basically<00:02:03.570> as<00:02:03.780> hard<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.140> possible<00:02:04.320> into<00:02:04.860> all

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
basically as hard as possible into all

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.059 
basically as hard as possible into all
my<00:02:05.310> bone<00:02:05.670> structure<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.420> things<00:02:07.229> basically

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
my bone structure and things basically

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.750 
my bone structure and things basically
just<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.429> get<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> basic<00:02:09.149> shape<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.780> your<00:02:09.840> chin

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.130 

you<00:02:14.760> can<00:02:14.940> see<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.569> goes<00:02:15.780> all<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.050> way

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
you can see it goes all the way

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.589 
you can see it goes all the way
underneath<00:02:16.590> my<00:02:16.890> chin<00:02:17.250> as<00:02:17.519> well<00:02:17.730> down<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
start of the neck up off my mouth just

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.960 
start of the neck up off my mouth just
so<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.650> can<00:02:22.830> get<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.010> good<00:02:23.310> area<00:02:23.849> to<00:02:24.060> make

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
so that I can get a good area to make

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.650 
so that I can get a good area to make
the<00:02:26.970> cast's<00:02:27.480> sculpt<00:02:28.200> on<00:02:28.319> later<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.480> hear

the cast's sculpt on later on and I hear
I<00:02:30.690> am<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:31.230> speeding<00:02:31.440> up<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.769> drying<00:02:32.010> process

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
I am just speeding up the drying process

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.289 
I am just speeding up the drying process
using<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:32.970> hair<00:02:33.120> dryer<00:02:35.030> now<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.090> want<00:02:36.269> to

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
using the hair dryer now you want to

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.030 
using the hair dryer now you want to
keep<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.599> moving<00:02:36.750> just<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.500> make<00:02:37.650> sure<00:02:37.830> you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
keep it moving just to make sure you

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.979 
keep it moving just to make sure you
don't<00:02:38.220> crack<00:02:38.580> any<00:02:38.879> of<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> clay<00:02:39.360> by<00:02:39.599> drying<00:02:39.900> it

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
don't crack any of the clay by drying it

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.110 
don't crack any of the clay by drying it
out<00:02:40.049> too<00:02:40.440> fast<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:43.549> also<00:02:44.549> while<00:02:44.790> doing<00:02:45.090> that

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
out too fast and also while doing that

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.210 
out too fast and also while doing that
keep<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.750> make<00:02:46.019> sure<00:02:46.049> it's<00:02:46.319> on<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.470> low<00:02:46.769> heat<00:02:49.220> as

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
keep it make sure it's on a low heat as

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.880 
keep it make sure it's on a low heat as
you<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.459> see<00:02:50.780> just<00:02:51.780> take<00:02:52.049> any<00:02:52.230> time<00:02:52.440> moving

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
you can see just take any time moving

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.270 
you can see just take any time moving
the<00:02:53.069> hair<00:02:53.220> dryer<00:02:53.489> around<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:55.769> dry<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.040> clay

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
the hair dryer around to dry the clay

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.490 
the hair dryer around to dry the clay
out

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.560 

now<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.130> said<00:03:02.430> about<00:03:02.610> keeping<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.120> on<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.240> low

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
now I said about keeping it on a low

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.290 
now I said about keeping it on a low
heat<00:03:04.100> I've<00:03:05.100> shown<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.370> how<00:03:05.580> low<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.910> heat<00:03:06.060> is

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
heat I've shown you how low the heat is

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.590 
heat I've shown you how low the heat is
right<00:03:06.720> here<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:08.010> actually<00:03:08.220> hold<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.880> hair

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
right here I can actually hold a hair

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.990 
right here I can actually hold a hair
dryer<00:03:09.920> straight<00:03:10.920> up<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.130> my<00:03:11.250> arm<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.670> leave<00:03:11.850> it

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
dryer straight up to my arm and leave it

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.170 
dryer straight up to my arm and leave it
there<00:03:12.030> for<00:03:12.210> quite<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> while<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.880> it<00:03:14.880> doesn't

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
there for quite a while and it doesn't

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.660 
there for quite a while and it doesn't
hurt<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:15.600> that's<00:03:16.350> how<00:03:16.500> low<00:03:16.740> heat<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.250> want<00:03:17.430> it

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
hurt so that's how low heat you want it

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.860 
hurt so that's how low heat you want it
and<00:03:17.820> basically<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.180> little<00:03:18.360> lowest<00:03:18.600> setting

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
and basically a little lowest setting

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.460 
and basically a little lowest setting
you<00:03:18.900> can<00:03:19.140> get<00:03:20.630> now<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:21.840> dried<00:03:22.080> out<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.260> little

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
you can get now this dried out a little

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.030 
you can get now this dried out a little
bit<00:03:22.800> as<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.610> can<00:03:23.730> see<00:03:24.060> here<00:03:24.590> it's<00:03:25.590> not<00:03:25.800> dried

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
bit as you can see here it's not dried

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.830 
bit as you can see here it's not dried
fully<00:03:26.310> out<00:03:26.490> as<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.700> can<00:03:26.880> scrape<00:03:27.090> my<00:03:27.240> nail<00:03:27.480> into

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
doesn't have to be perfect because I

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.830 
doesn't have to be perfect because I

so they're looking sculpt on to it
doesn't<00:03:47.790> matter<00:03:48.030> if<00:03:48.180> it's<00:03:48.330> not<00:03:48.510> perfect<00:03:49.020> as

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
doesn't matter if it's not perfect as

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.440 
doesn't matter if it's not perfect as
long<00:03:49.560> as<00:03:49.920> it's<00:03:50.100> roughly<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.520> shape<00:03:50.610> of<00:03:50.970> the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
long as it's roughly the shape of the
