even if you're at seventy-five percent

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.270 
even if you're at seventy-five percent
you<00:02:20.269> put<00:02:20.450> into<00:02:20.629> deep<00:02:20.870> cycle<00:02:21.260> mode<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.980> it'll

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
you put into deep cycle mode and it'll

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.100 
you put into deep cycle mode and it'll
go<00:02:22.640> red<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.209> then<00:02:23.360> it'll<00:02:23.569> start<00:02:23.629> draining

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
go red and then it'll start draining

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.800 
before loading it back up to a hundred
percent<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.000> just<00:02:29.209> press<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:29.599> red

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.890 
back and it's been deep cycle charge DJ
I<00:02:37.040> recommend<00:02:37.550> doing<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.819> every<00:02:38.450> few<00:02:38.690> flights

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
I recommend doing that every few flights

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.040 
I recommend doing that every few flights
or<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.819> over<00:02:41.090> here<00:02:41.300> on<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.569> right<00:02:41.780> side

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
or so and over here on the right side

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.229 
or so and over here on the right side
we've<00:02:42.379> got<00:02:42.409> as<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.040> can<00:02:43.190> see<00:02:43.430> we've<00:02:44.060> got<00:02:44.209> a

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
we've got as you can see we've got a

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.199 
we've got as you can see we've got a
little<00:02:44.540> warning<00:02:44.930> label<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.470> off/on<00:02:45.890> switch

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
little warning label and off/on switch

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.880 
little warning label and off/on switch
the<00:02:47.209> power<00:02:47.450> control<00:02:48.050> or<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.769> power

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
the power control or the power

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.970 
the power control or the power
connection<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:50.120> is<00:02:50.150> included<00:02:51.140> with<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.560> kit

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
connection that is included with the kit

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.550 
connection that is included with the kit
and<00:02:52.280> then<00:02:52.730> you've<00:02:53.030> also<00:02:53.150> got<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.659> USB<00:02:54.049> spots

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
and then you've also got to USB spots

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.320 
and then you've also got to USB spots
that<00:02:54.920> are

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
that are

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.480 
that are
five<00:02:55.570> point<00:02:55.930> five<00:02:56.140> volts<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.310> normal

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
five point five volts so the normal

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.900 
five point five volts so the normal
voltage<00:02:57.790> on<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.270> on<00:02:58.630> USB<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.250> 2.1<00:03:00.250> if<00:03:00.550> you're

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
voltage on the on USB is 2.1 if you're

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.690 
voltage on the on USB is 2.1 if you're
lucky<00:03:01.270> but<00:03:01.420> these<00:03:01.570> are<00:03:01.690> 5.5<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:02.770> if<00:03:02.980> your<00:03:03.430> phone

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
lucky but these are 5.5 so if your phone

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.210 
lucky but these are 5.5 so if your phone

another cool feature is available for

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.480 
another cool feature is available for
thirty<00:03:31.210> dollars<00:03:31.570> is<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.830> USB<00:03:32.830> adapter<00:03:33.310> so<00:03:33.459> you

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
thirty dollars is a USB adapter so you

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.160 
thirty dollars is a USB adapter so you
can<00:03:33.700> just<00:03:33.730> plug<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.090> into<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.660> battery<00:03:34.990> slot

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
can just plug that into the battery slot

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.110 
can just plug that into the battery slot
and<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.680> actually<00:03:35.830> get<00:03:36.100> two<00:03:36.310> additional<00:03:36.820> USB

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
and you actually get two additional USB
