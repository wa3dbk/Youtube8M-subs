00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.250
 I struggled 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.700

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.610
 finish line as much will be off 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.470
 go one by one at a time if you 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.289
 do not agree says the giant of the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.660
 race that will serve the race so you 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.940

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.000
 so after there is the sorting of poles 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.220
 so it's not longer 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.020
