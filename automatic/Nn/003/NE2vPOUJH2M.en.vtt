Japanese farmhouse for you some of you

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.160 
Japanese farmhouse for you some of you
might<00:00:05.819> remember<00:00:05.970> around<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.569> back<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:06.930> the

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
might remember around the back of the

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.100 
might remember around the back of the
main<00:00:07.440> house<00:00:07.799> there<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.700> shed<00:00:09.480> that<00:00:09.900> was<00:00:10.080> a

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
main house there is a shed that was a

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.919 
main house there is a shed that was a
tractor<00:00:10.860> shed<00:00:11.070> half<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:12.179> was<00:00:12.300> tractor<00:00:12.780> and

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
tractor shed half it was tractor and

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.810 
tractor shed half it was tractor and
half<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.380> was<00:00:13.410> pickles

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
half of it was pickles

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.849 
half of it was pickles
so<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> tractor<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.230> pickles<00:00:16.560> are<00:00:16.650> gone

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
so the tractor and the pickles are gone

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.740 
so the tractor and the pickles are gone
we've<00:00:17.070> now<00:00:17.220> got<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.490> machinery<00:00:17.940> shed<00:00:18.420> and

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
we've now got a machinery shed and

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.340 
we've now got a machinery shed and
another<00:00:19.230> room<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.800> keep<00:00:20.090> materials<00:00:21.090> in

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
another room that we keep materials in

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.240 
another room that we keep materials in
but<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:22.500> pretty<00:00:22.680> rusty

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
but it's pretty rusty

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.660 
but it's pretty rusty
so<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.269> found<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.600> roller<00:00:25.430> specifically<00:00:26.430> for

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
so we found a roller specifically for

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.019 
so we found a roller specifically for
corrugated<00:00:27.210> iron<00:00:27.300> very<00:00:28.140> clever<00:00:28.439> isn't<00:00:28.560> that

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
corrugated iron very clever isn't that

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.530 
corrugated iron very clever isn't that
simple<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:30.150> brilliant<00:00:31.940> because<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.270> don't

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
simple but brilliant because we don't

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.560 
simple but brilliant because we don't
really<00:00:33.750> want<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.050> spend<00:00:34.230> big<00:00:34.530> money<00:00:35.570> replacing

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
really want to spend big money replacing

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.810 
really want to spend big money replacing
the<00:00:37.010> corrugated<00:00:38.010> iron<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.370> an<00:00:38.460> old<00:00:38.610> building

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the corrugated iron and an old building

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.690 
the corrugated iron and an old building
like<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:39.660> really<00:00:39.899> worth<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.579> so<00:00:41.579> if

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
like this it's not really worth it so if

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.690 
like this it's not really worth it so if
we<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.059> paint<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.570> up<00:00:42.690> with<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.700> rust

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
we can paint it up with this rust

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.720 
we can paint it up with this rust
inhibiting<00:00:45.210> paint<00:00:45.950> that<00:00:46.950> should<00:00:47.190> extend<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
inhibiting paint that should extend the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.540 
inhibiting paint that should extend the
life<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.329> for<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.660> few<00:00:48.870> more<00:00:49.050> years<00:00:49.550> without

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
life of it for a few more years without

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.510 
life of it for a few more years without
any<00:00:50.879> great<00:00:51.180> expense<00:00:51.949> just<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.100> little<00:00:53.309> bit<00:00:53.430> of

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
any great expense just a little bit of

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.979 
any great expense just a little bit of
time<00:00:53.789> from<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> unskilled<00:00:55.379> laborer<00:00:55.800> they're

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
time from the unskilled laborer they're

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.279 
time from the unskilled laborer they're
looking<00:00:57.989> very<00:00:58.020> fashionable<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.960> big<00:01:00.960> dagi

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
still pretty hot it was just before I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.420 
still pretty hot it was just before I
started<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.330> cold<00:01:09.570> here<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:11.220> was<00:01:11.340> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
started to get cold here so it was a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.010 
started to get cold here so it was a
pretty<00:01:11.610> horrible<00:01:11.909> day<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> roof<00:01:12.840> of

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
pretty horrible day to be on the roof of

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.649 
pretty horrible day to be on the roof of
that<00:01:13.049> place<00:01:13.380> actually<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.240> it<00:01:15.240> had<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.540> be

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
that place actually but it had to be

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.260 
that place actually but it had to be
done<00:01:16.310> there's<00:01:17.310> also<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.610> lot<00:01:17.790> more<00:01:17.939> slippery

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
done there's also a lot more slippery

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.870 
done there's also a lot more slippery
than<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.630> thought<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.930> was<00:01:19.049> because<00:01:19.880> we

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
than we thought it was because we

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.280 
than we thought it was because we
thought<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.210> movia<00:01:21.450> bit<00:01:21.600> slippery<00:01:21.930> bit<00:01:22.140> was

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
thought of movia bit slippery bit was

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.260 
thought of movia bit slippery bit was
really<00:01:22.830> slippery<00:01:23.220> which<00:01:23.520> didn't<00:01:23.850> make<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.119> any

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
really slippery which didn't make it any

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.050 
really slippery which didn't make it any
fun<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.659> all<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.130> had<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.280> be<00:01:26.310> done<00:01:28.759> this<00:01:29.759> place

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
fun at all but had to be done this place

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:41.450 
fun at all but had to be done this place
to<00:01:30.270> get<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> end<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.869> job

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.520 

and<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:42.180> onto<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.510> walls<00:01:42.810> with<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.260> spray

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and then onto the walls with the spray

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.950 
and then onto the walls with the spray
gun<00:01:44.270> what<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.300> brilliant<00:01:45.750> invention<00:01:46.050> that<00:01:46.350> is

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
gun what a brilliant invention that is

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.380 
gun what a brilliant invention that is
absolutely<00:01:48.960> brilliant<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:53.520> actually<00:01:53.850> gave<00:01:54.360> a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
absolutely brilliant and actually gave a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.150 
absolutely brilliant and actually gave a
better<00:01:54.720> finish<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:56.000> then<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.120> roller<00:01:57.330> did<00:01:58.160> so

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
better finish and then the roller did so

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.470 
better finish and then the roller did so
that<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.730> the<00:01:59.760> way<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.000> go

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
that really is the way to go

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
that really is the way to go
absolutely<00:02:00.900> brilliant<00:02:02.990> faster<00:02:03.990> cleaner

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
absolutely brilliant faster cleaner

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.910 
absolutely brilliant faster cleaner
easier<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:06.000> does<00:02:06.870> a<00:02:06.900> better<00:02:07.110> job<00:02:07.230> which<00:02:07.770> is

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
easier and does a better job which is

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:21.640 
easier and does a better job which is
good

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.300 

actually<00:02:22.540> cost-effective<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:24.220> amount<00:02:25.220> of

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
actually cost-effective to the amount of

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.210 
actually cost-effective to the amount of
paint<00:02:25.610> were<00:02:26.450> used<00:02:26.720> with<00:02:27.019> the<00:02:27.140> spray<00:02:27.409> gun<00:02:27.620> per

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
paint were used with the spray gun per

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.089 
paint were used with the spray gun per
meter<00:02:28.610> was<00:02:29.150> much<00:02:29.959> less<00:02:30.260> than<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.680> was<00:02:30.769> of<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
meter was much less than it was of the

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.300 
meter was much less than it was of the
roller<00:02:31.959> so<00:02:32.959> it's<00:02:33.110> obviously<00:02:33.439> more<00:02:33.709> economical

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
roller so it's obviously more economical

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.330

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
really common here that the building's

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.490 
really common here that the building's
are<00:03:17.579> just<00:03:18.349> the<00:03:19.349> maintenance<00:03:19.829> or<00:03:20.250> the

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
are just the maintenance or the

are just the maintenance or the
irregular<00:03:22.500> painting<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:23.069> old<00:03:23.220> buildings<00:03:23.459> just

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
irregular painting of old buildings just

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.619 
irregular painting of old buildings just
doesn't<00:03:24.150> seem<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.419> happen<00:03:25.069> so<00:03:26.069> this<00:03:26.639> building

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
doesn't seem to happen so this building

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.420 
doesn't seem to happen so this building
would<00:03:27.780> have<00:03:27.870> just<00:03:28.079> been<00:03:28.139> let<00:03:28.409> to<00:03:28.439> rust<00:03:28.889> until

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
would have just been let to rust until

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.830 
would have just been let to rust until
those<00:03:29.669> big<00:03:29.909> holes<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.329> walls<00:03:30.599> probably

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
those big holes in the walls probably

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.809 
those big holes in the walls probably
and<00:03:31.290> then<00:03:31.349> they<00:03:31.470> probably<00:03:31.889> just<00:03:32.129> replaced<00:03:32.639> the

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
and then they probably just replaced the

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.819 
and then they probably just replaced the
walls<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.510> guess<00:03:33.840> or<00:03:34.139> knocked<00:03:34.349> it<00:03:34.500> down<00:03:34.530> and

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
walls I guess or knocked it down and

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.409 
walls I guess or knocked it down and
built<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.040> new<00:03:35.220> one<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.989> that's<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.230> storm

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
built a new one that that's a storm

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.789 
built a new one that that's a storm
shutter<00:03:39.419> but<00:03:40.049> it's<00:03:40.169> actually<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.620> main

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
shutter but it's actually the main

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.720 
shutter but it's actually the main
window<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.639> room<00:03:41.969> so<00:03:42.919> it's<00:03:43.919> deteriorated

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
window of that room so it's deteriorated

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.390 
window of that room so it's deteriorated
in<00:03:44.819> the<00:03:44.909> weather<00:03:45.060> as<00:03:45.299> well<00:03:45.590> again<00:03:46.590> never<00:03:47.159> been

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
in the weather as well again never been

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.979 
in the weather as well again never been
painted<00:03:47.700> probably<00:03:48.329> since<00:03:48.569> it<00:03:48.719> was<00:03:48.840> installed

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
painted probably since it was installed

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.569 
painted probably since it was installed
it<00:03:49.500> might<00:03:49.650> have<00:03:49.739> been<00:03:49.799> painted<00:03:50.159> once<00:03:50.340> at<00:03:50.489> the

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
it might have been painted once at the

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.220 
it might have been painted once at the
beginning<00:03:51.030> but<00:03:51.209> hadn't<00:03:51.510> been<00:03:51.629> painted<00:03:52.019> since

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
beginning but hadn't been painted since

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.110 
beginning but hadn't been painted since
so<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.590> was<00:03:52.680> all<00:03:52.829> soft<00:03:53.159> and<00:03:53.370> those<00:03:53.549> holes<00:03:53.790> in<00:03:54.000> it

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
so it was all soft and those holes in it

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.979 
so it was all soft and those holes in it
so<00:03:54.530> just<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.680> little<00:03:55.859> piece<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.040> ply<00:03:56.879> to<00:03:57.720> go<00:03:57.840> over

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
so just a little piece of ply to go over

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.390 
so just a little piece of ply to go over
the<00:03:58.079> top<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.290> that

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.759 

this<00:04:02.849> is<00:04:03.000> actually<00:04:03.299> an<00:04:03.360> offcut<00:04:03.959> from<00:04:04.530> another

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
this is actually an offcut from another

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.839 
this is actually an offcut from another
job<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.220> we<00:04:05.310> did<00:04:05.459> before<00:04:07.489> just<00:04:08.489> happened<00:04:08.790> to

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
job that we did before just happened to

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.910 
job that we did before just happened to
be<00:04:08.939> big<00:04:09.120> enough<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.659> to<00:04:09.870> make<00:04:10.200> that<00:04:10.409> cover

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
be big enough to you to make that cover

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:23.460 
be big enough to you to make that cover
that<00:04:10.980> window

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.560 

stick<00:04:24.250> it<00:04:24.370> into<00:04:24.490> place<00:04:24.820> with<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.150> magic

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
stick it into place with the magic

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.760 
stick it into place with the magic
battery<00:04:26.350> drill<00:04:26.620> what<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.100> great<00:04:27.370> invention<00:04:28.770> the

battery drill what a great invention the

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.290 
battery drill what a great invention the
dude<00:04:29.980> that<00:04:30.130> invented<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.580> battery<00:04:30.910> drill<00:04:31.150> and

I<00:04:36.550> think

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.540 

fabulous

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
fabulous

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.700 
fabulous
so<00:05:00.150> wasn't<00:05:00.509> actually<00:05:00.750> possible<00:05:01.139> to<00:05:01.289> take<00:05:01.440> that

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
so wasn't actually possible to take that

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.790 
so wasn't actually possible to take that
window<00:05:02.310> out<00:05:02.340> to<00:05:02.699> work<00:05:02.849> on<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.210> it's<00:05:03.449> sort<00:05:03.690> of

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
window out to work on it it's sort of

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.379 
window out to work on it it's sort of
being<00:05:04.800> built<00:05:05.099> into<00:05:05.520> place<00:05:05.789> with<00:05:06.180> that

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
being built into place with that

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.330 
being built into place with that
corrugated<00:05:07.289> iron<00:05:07.379> that's<00:05:07.650> on<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.830> outside<00:05:07.889> of

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
corrugated iron that's on the outside of

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.850 
corrugated iron that's on the outside of
it<00:05:08.430> so<00:05:08.699> it<00:05:09.569> had<00:05:09.690> to<00:05:09.810> be<00:05:09.930> all<00:05:10.020> done<00:05:10.259> in<00:05:10.409> there<00:05:10.590> but

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
it so it had to be all done in there but

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.490 
it so it had to be all done in there but
end<00:05:11.639> result<00:05:12.000> was<00:05:12.120> okay<00:05:14.870> so<00:05:15.870> up<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.139> the<00:05:16.229> before

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
end result was okay so up to the before

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.260 
end result was okay so up to the before
and<00:05:16.620> after<00:05:16.949> already<00:05:19.699> this<00:05:20.699> is<00:05:20.849> what<00:05:21.000> it<00:05:21.120> looked

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
and after already this is what it looked

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.050 
and after already this is what it looked
like<00:05:21.360> before

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:38.339 

a<00:05:27.090> little<00:05:27.750> bit<00:05:27.900> tragic<00:05:28.169> wasn't

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.309 

looks<00:05:39.129> like<00:05:39.309> now<00:05:39.869> bit<00:05:40.869> of<00:05:40.960> an<00:05:41.020> improvement

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 
looks like now bit of an improvement

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:44.969 
looks like now bit of an improvement
isn't<00:05:41.589> that<00:05:42.960> so<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.110> old-style<00:05:44.409> buildings

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
isn't that so the old-style buildings

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.010 
isn't that so the old-style buildings
here<00:05:45.129> quite<00:05:45.369> often<00:05:45.550> actually<00:05:46.240> black<00:05:46.599> with

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
here quite often actually black with

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.109 
here quite often actually black with
white<00:05:47.229> trim<00:05:47.589> so<00:05:48.520> it's<00:05:48.669> sort<00:05:48.819> of<00:05:48.849> going<00:05:49.059> a

00:05:49.109 --> 00:05:49.119 
white trim so it's sort of going a

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:51.029 
white trim so it's sort of going a
little<00:05:49.240> bit<00:05:49.449> that<00:05:49.599> way<00:05:49.719> use<00:05:50.169> dark<00:05:50.439> brown<00:05:50.529> a

00:05:58.799 --> 00:05:58.809 
side wall with those beams sticking out

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:05.999 
side wall with those beams sticking out
untreated<00:06:03.509> so<00:06:04.509> it<00:06:04.599> looks<00:06:04.749> like<00:06:04.809> now<00:06:05.139> made<00:06:05.830> sure

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
untreated so it looks like now made sure

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.059 
untreated so it looks like now made sure
those<00:06:06.159> beams<00:06:06.460> got<00:06:06.699> a<00:06:06.729> good<00:06:06.909> coating<00:06:07.180> to<00:06:08.069> extend

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:09.069 
those beams got a good coating to extend

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:11.899 
those beams got a good coating to extend
their<00:06:09.249> life<00:06:09.279> by<00:06:09.759> another<00:06:09.999> 10<00:06:10.240> years<00:06:10.419> probably

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:11.909 
their life by another 10 years probably

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:23.930 
their life by another 10 years probably
shiny<00:06:12.909> isn't<00:06:13.180> it<00:06:15.809> there's<00:06:16.809> the<00:06:16.930> back

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.970 

a<00:06:24.000> bit<00:06:24.540> of<00:06:24.630> an<00:06:24.720> improvement<00:06:25.350> I<00:06:25.380> mean<00:06:25.590> Sonia

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 
a bit of an improvement I mean Sonia

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.640 
a bit of an improvement I mean Sonia
shed<00:06:26.370> you<00:06:26.700> know<00:06:26.820> keep<00:06:27.410> giving<00:06:28.410> him<00:06:28.470> I'd

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
shed you know keep giving him I'd

shed you know keep giving him I'd
eternia<00:06:29.100> shed<00:06:29.460> the<00:06:29.700> main<00:06:29.910> reason<00:06:30.480> we<00:06:30.690> did<00:06:30.870> this

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
eternia shed the main reason we did this

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.530 
eternia shed the main reason we did this
was<00:06:31.200> to<00:06:31.230> extend<00:06:31.650> its<00:06:31.860> life<00:06:32.240> so<00:06:33.240> we<00:06:33.330> didn't

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540 
was to extend its life so we didn't

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.790 
was to extend its life so we didn't
empty<00:06:33.750> end<00:06:33.960> up<00:06:34.050> have<00:06:34.170> to<00:06:34.200> replace<00:06:34.560> all<00:06:34.740> this

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
empty end up have to replace all this

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.210 
empty end up have to replace all this
corrugated<00:06:35.310> iron<00:06:35.400> is<00:06:35.820> that'll<00:06:36.030> be<00:06:36.090> a<00:06:36.120> huge<00:06:36.450> job

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
corrugated iron is that'll be a huge job

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.560 
corrugated iron is that'll be a huge job
so<00:06:38.220> that<00:06:38.460> was<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.700> main<00:06:38.880> reason<00:06:39.300> for<00:06:39.330> this

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
so that was the main reason for this

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.960 
so that was the main reason for this
project<00:06:40.110> but<00:06:40.350> also<00:06:40.770> makes<00:06:41.100> it<00:06:41.250> nicer<00:06:41.640> too<00:06:41.820> you

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
project but also makes it nicer too you

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.740 
project but also makes it nicer too you
know<00:06:42.500> it's<00:06:43.500> sort<00:06:43.680> of<00:06:43.830> in<00:06:43.890> a<00:06:43.950> fairly

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
know it's sort of in a fairly

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.030 
know it's sort of in a fairly
high-profile<00:06:45.750> spot<00:06:46.110> so<00:06:46.440> it's<00:06:46.680> sort<00:06:46.830> of<00:06:46.890> nice

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
high-profile spot so it's sort of nice

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.900 
high-profile spot so it's sort of nice
to<00:06:47.100> get<00:06:47.400> it<00:06:47.550> looking<00:06:48.000> a<00:06:48.090> bit<00:06:48.210> better

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.360 

so<00:06:53.480> preserve<00:06:53.960> it<00:06:54.170> extend<00:06:54.590> its<00:06:54.740> life<00:06:54.950> and<00:06:55.220> make

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
so preserve it extend its life and make

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.250 
so preserve it extend its life and make
it<00:06:55.520> look<00:06:55.640> a<00:06:55.700> little<00:06:55.820> bit<00:06:56.030> prettier<00:06:56.170> isn't<00:06:57.170> that

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260 
it look a little bit prettier isn't that

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.880 
it look a little bit prettier isn't that
