and<00:00:53.950> stone

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.510 

it's<00:01:01.600> only<00:01:01.930> a<00:01:02.080> little<00:01:02.230> hard<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:02.800> throw<00:01:03.040> it<00:01:03.160> in

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:22.380 

that's<00:01:06.520> why<00:01:06.790> I<00:01:06.850> use<00:01:07.270> this<00:01:07.510> block<00:01:07.870> right

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.240 

there<00:01:23.050> isn't<00:01:23.350> really<00:01:23.470> much<00:01:23.670> inside<00:01:24.670> here<00:01:26.250> only

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
there isn't really much inside here only

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.210 
there isn't really much inside here only
thing<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:28.090> you<00:01:28.870> can<00:01:29.800> place<00:01:30.010> a<00:01:30.040> sentry<00:01:30.520> gun<00:01:30.670> here

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
thing is you can place a sentry gun here

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.080 
thing is you can place a sentry gun here
so<00:01:33.220> if<00:01:33.430> it<00:01:33.550> sees<00:01:33.760> an<00:01:33.909> enemy<00:01:34.240> will<00:01:34.510> shoot<00:01:34.750> him<00:01:34.900> i

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
so if it sees an enemy will shoot him i

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:44.219 
so if it sees an enemy will shoot him i
hope<00:01:37.090> i<00:01:37.420> never<00:01:37.630> tried<00:01:38.080> actually<00:01:42.450> yeah<00:01:43.450> it

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
hope i never tried actually yeah it

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.090 
hope i never tried actually yeah it
