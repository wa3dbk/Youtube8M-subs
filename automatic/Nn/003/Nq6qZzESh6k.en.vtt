00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
offense to Lewis Hamilton fans but I

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.570 
offense to Lewis Hamilton fans but I
really<00:02:10.619> feel<00:02:10.860> they<00:02:10.979> should<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.310> stayed<00:02:11.489> at

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
really feel they should have stayed at

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.350 
really feel they should have stayed at
McLaren<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.120> mean<00:02:12.239> I'm<00:02:12.360> not<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.510> fan<00:02:12.780> of

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
McLaren I mean I'm not a fan of

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.990 
McLaren I mean I'm not a fan of
Lewis<00:02:13.780> Hamilton<00:02:14.260> but<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.280> still<00:02:15.610> think<00:02:15.910> that

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
Lewis Hamilton but I still think that

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.420 
Lewis Hamilton but I still think that
McLaren<00:02:16.870> is<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.170> best<00:02:17.410> option<00:02:17.650> for<00:02:17.860> him<00:02:18.070> and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
McLaren is the best option for him and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.310 
McLaren is the best option for him and
you<00:02:18.490> should<00:02:18.700> stay<00:02:18.940> there<00:02:19.180> until<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:19.960> team

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
you should stay there until that team

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.810 
you should stay there until that team
actually<00:02:20.560> flops<00:02:20.950> because<00:02:21.280> he's<00:02:21.400> not<00:02:21.550> doing

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820

that bad right now like if you really

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.830 
that bad right now like if you really
needs<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.640> money<00:02:24.790> why<00:02:25.150> doesn't<00:02:25.420> he<00:02:25.480> just<00:02:25.510> work

let's<00:02:36.580> face<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:37.060> some<00:02:37.570> people<00:02:37.690> say<00:02:38.050> that

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
let's face it some people say that

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.070 
let's face it some people say that
Mercedes<00:02:39.400> will<00:02:39.580> do<00:02:39.700> really<00:02:40.090> well<00:02:40.240> because<00:02:40.480> you

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
Mercedes will do really well because you

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.660 
Mercedes will do really well because you
know<00:02:41.110> if<00:02:41.500> they're<00:02:41.740> buying<00:02:41.950> Hamilton<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.610> they

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
know if they're buying Hamilton and they

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.490 
know if they're buying Hamilton and they
must<00:02:42.880> have<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.090> fast<00:02:43.390> car<00:02:43.630> but<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:43.959> don't<00:02:44.260> think

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
must have a fast car but I don't think

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.860 
must have a fast car but I don't think
that's<00:02:45.000> actually<00:02:46.000> true<00:02:46.180> i<00:02:46.240> just<00:02:46.570> think<00:02:46.810> that

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
that's actually true i just think that

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.020 
that's actually true i just think that
they<00:02:47.620> really<00:02:47.650> want<00:02:48.160> someone<00:02:48.430> that's<00:02:48.730> really

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
they really want someone that's really

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.660 
they really want someone that's really
going<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.300> perform<00:02:49.810> with<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.010> car<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.580> they

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
going to perform with the car that they

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.270 
going to perform with the car that they
have<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:52.150> mean<00:02:52.450> who<00:02:52.660> knows<00:02:52.840> in<00:02:53.050> 2014<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:53.980> mean

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
have I mean who knows in 2014 I mean

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.830 
have I mean who knows in 2014 I mean
with<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.520> new<00:02:54.640> engines<00:02:55.120> may<00:02:55.360> be<00:02:55.390> missing

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
with the new engines may be missing

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.610 
with the new engines may be missing
these<00:02:55.989> have<00:02:56.200> something<00:02:56.530> planned<00:02:56.800> for<00:02:57.570> 2014

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
these have something planned for 2014

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.710 
these have something planned for 2014
but<00:02:59.620> I<00:02:59.830> just<00:03:00.220> don't<00:03:00.430> think<00:03:00.580> Hamilton<00:03:01.239> is<00:03:01.540> going

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
but I just don't think Hamilton is going

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.680 
but I just don't think Hamilton is going
to<00:03:01.870> perform<00:03:02.170> for<00:03:02.530> an<00:03:03.130> XD<00:03:03.580> anyway<00:03:04.000> at<00:03:04.120> least<00:03:04.180> and

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
to perform for an XD anyway at least and

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.810 
to perform for an XD anyway at least and
I<00:03:05.440> actually<00:03:05.590> feel<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.310> this<00:03:06.400> could<00:03:06.640> be<00:03:06.730> the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
I actually feel that this could be the

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.370 
I actually feel that this could be the
downfall<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.300> Lewis<00:03:07.630> Hamilton's<00:03:08.080> Korea

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
downfall of Lewis Hamilton's Korea

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.120 
downfall of Lewis Hamilton's Korea
because<00:03:08.770> he<00:03:08.950> opted<00:03:09.250> for<00:03:09.430> money<00:03:09.630> instead<00:03:10.630> of

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
because he opted for money instead of

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.760 
because he opted for money instead of
trying<00:03:12.130> to<00:03:12.190> win<00:03:12.400> championships<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.650> for<00:03:14.650> sure

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
trying to win championships and for sure

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.350 
trying to win championships and for sure
you'll<00:03:14.950> definitely<00:03:15.340> regret<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.700> because<00:03:16.060> you

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
for him I disagree with that you know I

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.040 
for him I disagree with that you know I
think<00:04:55.910> Schumacher<00:04:56.419> would<00:04:56.630> be<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:56.870> perfect

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
think Schumacher would be the perfect

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.740 
think Schumacher would be the perfect
number<00:04:57.350> to<00:04:57.620> drive<00:04:57.830> a<00:04:57.860> Ferrari<00:04:58.479> he<00:04:59.479> would<00:04:59.630> be

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
number to drive a Ferrari he would be

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.780 
number to drive a Ferrari he would be
much<00:04:59.990> more<00:05:00.020> consistent<00:05:00.590> than<00:05:00.860> felipe<00:05:01.370> massa

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
much more consistent than felipe massa

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.879 
much more consistent than felipe massa
and<00:05:02.060> I<00:05:02.720> don't<00:05:02.780> think<00:05:03.050> Schumacher<00:05:03.500> would<00:05:03.740> want

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
and I don't think Schumacher would want

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.460 
and I don't think Schumacher would want
to<00:05:03.979> have<00:05:04.610> any<00:05:04.850> competition<00:05:05.150> with<00:05:05.660> Harlan

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
to have any competition with Harlan

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.290 
to have any competition with Harlan
torinu<00:05:06.770> I<00:05:06.800> don't<00:05:07.040> think<00:05:07.250> Schumacher<00:05:08.060> would

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
torinu I don't think Schumacher would

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.200 
torinu I don't think Schumacher would
have<00:05:08.479> it<00:05:08.630> in<00:05:08.780> him<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.280> be<00:05:10.280> Alonso<00:05:10.820> I<00:05:10.850> mean<00:05:11.090> it

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
have it in him to be Alonso I mean it

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.390 
have it in him to be Alonso I mean it
would<00:05:11.419> be<00:05:11.450> fast<00:05:11.810> but<00:05:12.530> I<00:05:12.620> don't<00:05:12.800> think<00:05:12.950> it<00:05:13.250> would

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
would be fast but I don't think it would

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.409 
would be fast but I don't think it would
be<00:05:13.520> Alonso<00:05:14.110> but<00:05:15.110> anyway<00:05:15.580> who<00:05:16.580> I<00:05:16.610> blamed<00:05:17.150> for

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
be Alonso but anyway who I blamed for

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.510 
be Alonso but anyway who I blamed for
all<00:05:17.450> this<00:05:17.780> is<00:05:18.050> Bernie<00:05:18.440> Bernie<00:05:18.919> Ecclestone
