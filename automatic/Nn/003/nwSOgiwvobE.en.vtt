00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
there's less chance of tangles forming

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.989 
there's less chance of tangles forming
and<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> roots<00:01:03.739> now<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:05.069> made<00:01:05.219> used<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:05.999 
and the roots now I just made used to

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:07.999 
and the roots now I just made used to
come<00:01:06.209> for<00:01:06.840> my<00:01:06.929> horizontal<00:01:07.200> horizontal

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
partings but for my vertical partings I

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.590 
partings but for my vertical partings I
just<00:01:10.859> use<00:01:11.009> my<00:01:11.039> fingers

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600

this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.260> because<00:01:13.590> I'm<00:01:13.740> really<00:01:13.770> planning<00:01:14.130> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
this is because I'm really planning to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.230 
this is because I'm really planning to
keep<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> style<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.330> two<00:01:15.990> weeks

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
keep the style in for two weeks

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.539 
keep the style in for two weeks
so<00:01:18.240> once<00:01:18.479> I've<00:01:18.630> parted<00:01:18.990> each<00:01:19.380> section<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.430> I

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
so once I've parted each section then I

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.810 
so once I've parted each section then I
moisturize<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.360> using<00:01:21.990> my<00:01:22.200> homemade<00:01:23.190> leave-in

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
moisturize it using my homemade leave-in

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.840 
moisturize it using my homemade leave-in
conditioner<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.350> add<00:01:25.560> my<00:01:25.850> homemade

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
conditioner and then I add my homemade

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.120 
conditioner and then I add my homemade
whipped<00:01:27.180> shea<00:01:27.540> butter<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:30.090> then<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.330> separate

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
whipped shea butter and then I separate

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.960 
whipped shea butter and then I separate
that<00:01:32.130> section<00:01:32.610> into<00:01:33.240> two<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:37.979> as<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.399> twist<00:01:38.460> I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that section into two so as I twist I

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.749 
that section into two so as I twist I
make<00:01:39.149> sure<00:01:39.330> that<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.920> twist<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.250> tied<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> at

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
make sure that the twist is tied to at

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.029 
make sure that the twist is tied to at
the<00:01:41.850> roots<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:42.630> looser<00:01:43.470> towards<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
the roots and then looser towards the

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.969 
the roots and then looser towards the
end<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:44.850> as<00:01:44.970> I'm<00:01:45.090> twisting<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.750> don't<00:01:46.530> put<00:01:46.800> I

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
end and as I'm twisting I don't put I

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.940 
end and as I'm twisting I don't put I
try<00:01:47.220> not<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.429> put<00:01:47.550> too<00:01:47.580> much<00:01:47.819> tension<00:01:48.179> on<00:01:48.950> my

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.399 
you move down at an even rate at the
same<00:02:36.200> pace<00:02:36.939> so<00:02:37.939> that's<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.109> a<00:02:40.060> great<00:02:41.060> easy

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
same pace so that's it a great easy

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.649 
same pace so that's it a great easy
protective<00:02:42.409> style<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:43.069> only<00:02:43.519> things<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:44.090> would

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
protective style and only things I would

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.649 
protective style and only things I would
say<00:02:44.810> about<00:02:44.989> two<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.260> three<00:02:45.530> hours<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:47.209> parting

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
say about two to three hours the parting

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.229 
say about two to three hours the parting
takes<00:02:48.109> the<00:02:48.919> most<00:02:49.069> time<00:02:49.220> really<00:02:49.909> put<00:02:50.030> apart

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
takes the most time really put apart

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.050 
takes the most time really put apart
from<00:02:50.389> that<00:02:50.569> it's<00:02:51.230> it's<00:02:51.769> a<00:02:51.829> really<00:02:51.980> quick<00:02:52.220> style

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
from that it's it's a really quick style

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.140 
from that it's it's a really quick style
protective<00:02:53.569> style<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:54.019> do<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.519> I<00:02:55.519> wore<00:02:56.000> mine

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
protective style to do and I wore mine

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.360 
protective style to do and I wore mine
for<00:02:56.180> two<00:02:56.780> weeks<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.349> they<00:02:57.620> did<00:02:57.769> one<00:02:57.950> wash<00:02:58.159> in

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
for two weeks and they did one wash in

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.059 
for two weeks and they did one wash in
the<00:02:58.430> middle<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:58.969> it<00:02:59.060> was<00:02:59.150> fine<00:02:59.419> re<00:02:59.810> twisted<00:03:00.319> my

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
the middle and it was fine re twisted my

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.190 
the middle and it was fine re twisted my
edges<00:03:01.669> because<00:03:02.299> they<00:03:02.419> look<00:03:02.840> out<00:03:03.019> really

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
edges because they look out really

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.100 
edges because they look out really
easily<00:03:03.439> and<00:03:04.040> they<00:03:04.159> get<00:03:04.310> tangled<00:03:04.519> it<00:03:04.819> easy

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
easily and they get tangled it easy

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.770 
easily and they get tangled it easy
