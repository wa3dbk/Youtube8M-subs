00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.880
 hello girls so today envy 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.040
 to share with you my care of 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.830
 moment so what am I using in the evening 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.199
 how do I get clean and so the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.699
 products that I use 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.890
 so for starters it's very simple 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.650
 I have two produce right now for 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.170
 cleanse so you go either a 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 tail from home shop so the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.080
 make-up remover you I like a lot 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.579
 left with chamomile and g i fell 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.130
 literally in love with makeup removal 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.730
 the oil that I discovered not via via 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.770
 other yuzu two compared me want 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.230
 you have makeup remover or bifa deposit 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.360
 cases the trends well deserved the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.610
 the eyes and I really had a lot of 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.620
 wrong and I wish you honest 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.000
 something fast enough and that does not 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.860
 do not take ten years to cleanse 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.730
 and so that's how it looks like 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.690
 so it's a day of butter 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.550
 turns into oil at heat to at 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.659
 contact with your hands I'm going to get there 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.190
 and no, so you take a little 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.049
 mix well of this novel it really or 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.240
 maquis all face in one fell swoop 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.630
 it's clear with nothing for five 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.490
 minutes 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.260
 for me it tends to work well 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.750
 so it's a very gentle make-up removal 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.369
 very nice really could do some 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.880
 eyes pushes to remove the waterproof 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.460
 it removes lipsticks from 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.619
 red and white have held so really 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.229
 for that it's really very good and 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.600
 also I made myself no I swapped 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.880
 so with that and also I made myself 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.710
 my own emma clean and makeup 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.369
 did you have coconut oil gerra 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.410
 but also and hazelnut oil 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.890
 what hazelnut oils said 'my 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.210
 virtues for the skin for glad to have 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.550
 small problems of pimples 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.929
 small of a small imperfections and 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.250
 so I mixed the two all 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.170
 simply is the same the same principle 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.060
 that I take a little bit I get 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.460
 mix in my hands and after I get 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.619
 removes all the face with and therefore 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.409
 to clean all that no I will use 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.300
 little face squares so do it to 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.780
 hot water and after I remove it all 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.610
 all the oil makeup so with that 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.209
 and sermons it's really great because 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.519
 it was really all the show side of 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.430
 hot water that allows for everything 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.019
 withdraw his mom his peers then the 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.430
 Once I did this part 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.950
 I use my class nyha ii with so 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.890
 the cashmere tip 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.700
 it's great we it's super nice and 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.730
 once in make-up remover soap I use 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.790
 the uncle sam ne of gutters dreamed the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.269
 laboratories would not go from there in 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.799
 line ac here so that is for skin to 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.520
 problem skin 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.020
 so it's a bit 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.580
 generalize that but for a problem 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.080
 it's more simply because I have a 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.730
 oily skin 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.590
 I have buttons that can happen and 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.710
 for that it makes it possible to miss what 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.780
 puts cleans so regulate the excess of 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.340
 sebum and soothes so that's so I 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.180
 just put on my right 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.090
 clear only hic 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.590
 and no I clean myself all face like 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.390
 that in addition so that can remove 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.270
 the excess oil you had 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.680
 with your first makeup and that 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.450
 led three really skin in 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.450
 depth and it's true that since 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.630
 I use the clear sonic my skin ago 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.550
 not a pretty much improved photo and 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.100
 in addition it allows to perfect the 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.190
 removing make-up that are no purine which 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.660
 then stay what I use once 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.850
 that's done so I continued to 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:42.310
 arras and he cleaned with my square the 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:45.040
 face use it in this case I 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.280
 uses them and flasks from clinic 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.980
 so I just finished it 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.830
 jmil mineral water with essences 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.830
 of lemon that precisely for 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.650
 particularity these two precisely 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.300
 to cleanse the skin to be able to clear 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.700
 precisely all the pigmentary tasks 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.740
 that you can have and it gives it 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.080
 very refreshing i like a lot 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.920
 doctors are learning that a world and 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.770
 makeup then what once 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.510
 all this is done for the underside of 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.910
 eyes to moisturize under the eyes 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.980
 I use lemon argan oil 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:30.220
 melvita so that looks like this 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:32.800
 but in relay so it's certain that 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.449
 me a role to the nabis and we I have it 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.759
 maybe just below them 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.129
 eyes and frankly surprised so 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.889
 after I have them I'm massing underneath 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:43.419
 duels these tiles and it's the same 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.900
 it's super nice I like it a lot 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:49.479
 I really like this product then this 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.120
 that I'm going to put it's considering it's going 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:57.029
 to be from sephora the super serum 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.379
 peeling renovators so door h ome to 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:02.650
 fumets work simpler to words 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:05.669
 I did not have it and you come so here is 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.999
 it's like that's the acid 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:12.069
 glycolic so we are not what this 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:13.589
 I do not know this said his aunt 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.729
 to precisely refine the skin texture 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:17.589
 Besides, I got myself by 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.050
 pay attention especially below 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:21.969
 the mouth is what at that level 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.979
 completely dried me down so 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:25.300
 that to tell you that this is my very 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.689
 powerful like take as serve 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.089
 so it looks like this with a 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:32.710
 pipette it's very liquid so 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:33.909
 to say almost water 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.710
 so I just put on my 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.389
 hands I rub and I have a little 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.270
 So everywhere we avoid contour 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:42.759
 eyes of his friend argan oil is so 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:48.279
 the outline of the mouth as I the 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:51.310
 said and so to finish I'm going 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:52.990
 use my clinic cream that 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.289
 jenny among my darlings of the month of 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.740
 March 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:59.069
 and so it's thirst-quenching gel cream 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.509
 intense dehydrated skin 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:03.939
 so you have to know that as I say 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:05.979
 often a skin with a greasy tendency 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:09.669
 not necessarily necessarily has 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:11.319
 dehydration I have a lot 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.319
 precisely because it is like they 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:16.629
 say of a gel unlike creams 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.569
 I tried several creams but I 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:23.020
 really not that very fat side on the 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:24.870
 skin has inevitably and so gel side it is 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.520
 really super globe what it's cool 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.249
 it's the pole it absorbs very quickly 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.520
 so after you really have the finish 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:34.160
 we on the face and 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:39.139
 ceron pure happiness I love this cream 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:43.550
 really this gel earlier and which of which 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:47.599
 present like this yes the texture and 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:50.169
 it's really great so that's it 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:53.030
 can for my care my evening care 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:54.650

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:01.220
 I really have the skin quench 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:03.949
 to plump up is really 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:07.849

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:09.229
