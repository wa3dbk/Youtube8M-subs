track so as you can see that outside of
the<00:01:02.520> track<00:01:02.760> actually<00:01:03.270> flexes<00:01:03.949> which<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.100> kind

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the track actually flexes which is kind

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.600 
the track actually flexes which is kind
of<00:01:05.400> crazy<00:01:06.920> never<00:01:07.920> seen<00:01:08.190> anything<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.460> that

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
of crazy never seen anything like that

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.970 
of crazy never seen anything like that
it<00:01:08.940> makes<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.210> big<00:01:09.750> difference<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.590> seems<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
it makes a big difference it seems the

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.310 
it makes a big difference it seems the
fine<00:01:11.160> interaction<00:01:11.760> what<00:01:12.750> also<00:01:12.900> helps<00:01:13.290> with

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
fine interaction what also helps with

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.280 
fine interaction what also helps with
maneuvering<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> track<00:01:14.540> is<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.720> two<00:01:15.900> inside

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
maneuvering the track is the two inside

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.500 
maneuvering the track is the two inside

mountain<00:01:18.750> guys<00:01:18.870> you've<00:01:19.050> been<00:01:19.140> doing<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.440> for

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
mountain guys you've been doing that for

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.570 
mountain guys you've been doing that for
years<00:01:20.870> so<00:01:21.870> as<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.409> already<00:01:22.680> know<00:01:22.800> if<00:01:23.370> you've

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
years so as you already know if you've

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.550 
years so as you already know if you've
done<00:01:23.730> that<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.330> makes<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.870> easier<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.260> fit

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
done that is it makes it easier to fit

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.440 
done that is it makes it easier to fit
the<00:01:26.010> suspension<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.700> see<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.120> is<00:01:27.150> what<00:01:27.330> they

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
the suspension you see here is what they

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.810 
the suspension you see here is what they
call<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.810> emotion<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:29.130> has<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> little<00:01:29.580> hinge

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
call the emotion it has a little hinge

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.030 
call the emotion it has a little hinge
here<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.840> moves<00:01:31.050> back<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.470> forth<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.890> few

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
here that moves back and forth a few

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.740 
here that moves back and forth a few
degrees<00:01:32.190> doesn't<00:01:32.850> sound<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.150> much<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:33.420> it

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
degrees doesn't sound like much but it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.570 
degrees doesn't sound like much but it
makes<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.050> huge<00:01:34.290> difference<00:01:34.680> they<00:01:35.100> flatten<00:01:35.490> out

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
makes a huge difference they flatten out

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.040 
makes a huge difference they flatten out
this<00:01:35.820> rail<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.510> split<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:36.990> middle

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
this rail and split it in the middle

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.740 
this rail and split it in the middle
allow<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.830> reflects<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:39.120> help<00:01:39.300> of<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.540> rear

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
allow it reflects the help of the rear

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.440 
allow it reflects the help of the rear
so<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.590> slide<00:01:40.860> when<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.190> lean<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:42.270> whole

they planted in fine traction but makes

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.100 
they planted in fine traction but makes
a<00:01:48.500> sled<00:01:48.740> feel<00:01:49.040> in<00:01:49.850> my<00:01:50.000> opinion<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:50.540> feels<00:01:50.720> 100

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
a sled feel in my opinion it feels 100

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.660 
a sled feel in my opinion it feels 100
pounds<00:01:51.380> lighter<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:51.800> was<00:01:51.979> like<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.310> lightest

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
pounds lighter it was like the lightest

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.820 
pounds lighter it was like the lightest
load<00:01:52.820> I've<00:01:52.880> ever<00:01:53.210> read<00:01:53.420> seat<00:01:54.140> they<00:01:54.350> chopped<00:01:54.650> it

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
load I've ever read seat they chopped it

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.469 
load I've ever read seat they chopped it
down<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.460> we're<00:01:55.610> stepping<00:01:55.910> over<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.300> back

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
down so we're stepping over the back

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.870 
down so we're stepping over the back
constantly<00:01:57.140> all<00:01:57.380> day<00:01:57.410> in<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.800> trees<00:01:58.070> this

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
constantly all day in the trees this

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.300 
constantly all day in the trees this
makes<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.570> way<00:02:00.170> easier<00:02:00.200> is<00:02:00.830> a<00:02:00.860> lot<00:02:01.100> less

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
makes it way easier is a lot less

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.310 
makes it way easier is a lot less
fatiguing<00:02:01.729> on<00:02:02.000> your<00:02:02.180> legs<00:02:02.780> and<00:02:02.869> hips<00:02:03.110> would

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
fatiguing on your legs and hips would

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.380 
fatiguing on your legs and hips would
get<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:03.560> back<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:03.979> forth<00:02:04.220> and<00:02:04.520> when<00:02:05.090> they<00:02:05.210> did

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
get it back and forth and when they did

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.420 
get it back and forth and when they did
that<00:02:05.420> they<00:02:05.600> had<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:06.009> strengthen<00:02:07.009> it<00:02:07.130> up<00:02:07.280> so

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
that they had to strengthen it up so

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.330 
that they had to strengthen it up so
they<00:02:07.580> they<00:02:08.030> made<00:02:08.209> a<00:02:08.240> lot<00:02:08.590> stiffer<00:02:09.590> taller<00:02:10.039> bar

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
they they made a lot stiffer taller bar

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.830 
they they made a lot stiffer taller bar
here<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.970> they<00:02:11.090> also<00:02:11.300> weighed<00:02:11.600> a

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
here and they also weighed a

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.470 
here and they also weighed a
reinforcement<00:02:12.500> inside<00:02:13.220> they<00:02:13.940> also<00:02:14.090> gave<00:02:14.450> it

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
reinforcement inside they also gave it

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.170 
reinforcement inside they also gave it
another<00:02:14.900> eight<00:02:15.110> inches<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.500> footprint<00:02:16.180> which

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
another eight inches of footprint which

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.840 
another eight inches of footprint which
makes<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.570> sled<00:02:17.980> easier<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.040> maneuver<00:02:19.280> just

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
makes the sled easier to maneuver just

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.280 
makes the sled easier to maneuver just
because<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.239> can<00:02:20.390> get<00:02:20.600> where<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:20.959> want<00:02:21.200> to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
because you can get where you want to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.170 
because you can get where you want to
get<00:02:21.470> on<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.680> sled<00:02:21.800> you<00:02:22.340> don't<00:02:22.520> always<00:02:22.700> use<00:02:22.850> it

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
get on the sled you don't always use it

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.120 
get on the sled you don't always use it
