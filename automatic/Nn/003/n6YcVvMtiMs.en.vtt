00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.470 
and to Joe and I think that we wanted
really<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.280> stress<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:36.000> idea<00:00:36.360> that's

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
really to stress this idea that's

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.420 
really to stress this idea that's
something<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.350> when<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:37.829> good<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.219> good

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
something that is when it's good is good

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.770 
something that is when it's good is good
forever<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:40.100> of<00:00:41.100> course<00:00:41.489> I've<00:00:41.910> been<00:00:41.940> using

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
forever and of course I've been using

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.209 
forever and of course I've been using
new<00:00:43.140> techniques<00:00:43.500> for<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:44.309> them<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.960> like<00:00:46.219> new

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
new techniques for for them and like new

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.119 
new techniques for for them and like new
materials<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> neoprene<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.129> lacquered

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
materials like a neoprene and lacquered

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.610 
materials like a neoprene and lacquered
studs<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.329> also<00:00:51.840> wanted<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.289> show<00:00:52.590> that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620

when<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> good<00:00:54.030> style<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.930> don't

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
when you have a good style you don't

there<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.700> also<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.270> new<00:01:06.950> technical<00:01:07.950> aspect<00:01:08.490> it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
there is also a new technical aspect it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.820

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
who's thought if I get maybe you know

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.580

like<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.340> 1997<00:01:39.329> they<00:01:39.450> say<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.780> because<00:01:40.140> it

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
like in 1997 they say it's because it

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.200 
like in 1997 they say it's because it
can<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.860> worn<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.310> different<00:01:41.670> ways<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.090> it's

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
can be worn in different ways so it's

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
can be worn in different ways so it's
like<00:01:42.360> even<00:01:42.390> stressing<00:01:43.110> out<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.439> concept

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
like even stressing out this concept

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.670 
like even stressing out this concept
that<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.670> made<00:01:44.970> if<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.240> get<00:01:45.390> famous<00:01:45.960> or<00:01:46.140> not<00:01:46.229> if

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that it's made if I get famous or not if

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.550 
that it's made if I get famous or not if
I<00:01:46.770> get<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.130> famous<00:01:47.579> because<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:48.380> always<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
I get is famous because it's always the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.710 
I get is famous because it's always the
same<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:49.950> always<00:01:50.340> different<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.360> says

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
same but always different and that says

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.569 
same but always different and that says
you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.409> really<00:01:52.740> choose<00:01:52.950> your<00:01:53.220> baguette

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
you can really choose your baguette

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.760 
you can really choose your baguette
according<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.270> your<00:01:54.420> personality<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.439> so

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
according to your personality and so

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.700 
according to your personality and so
this<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.100> an<00:01:56.310> one<00:01:56.640> more<00:01:56.850> tool<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:58.229> which

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
this is an one more tool for this which

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.160 
this is an one more tool for this which
is<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.369> think<00:01:59.670> very<00:01:59.939> important<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:01.049> not

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
is I think very important so it's not

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.010 
is I think very important so it's not
only<00:02:01.500> your<00:02:02.009> version<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.240> also<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.869> your

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
only your version but also that your
