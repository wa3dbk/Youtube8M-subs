you<00:00:59.090> want<00:00:59.300> to<00:00:59.359> use<00:00:59.660> the<00:01:00.559> villains<00:01:00.890> superpowers

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
or not if you're new to the game I

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.560 
or not if you're new to the game I
recommend<00:01:04.790> not<00:01:04.879> using<00:01:04.939> them<00:01:05.239> in<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.420> first

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
recommend not using them in the first

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.050 
recommend not using them in the first
game<00:01:05.780> but<00:01:06.110> after<00:01:06.439> that<00:01:06.560> they<00:01:06.860> provide<00:01:07.220> a<00:01:07.250> neat

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
game but after that they provide a neat

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.539 
game but after that they provide a neat
asymmetric<00:01:08.780> element<00:01:09.140> that<00:01:09.799> that<00:01:10.189> makes<00:01:10.340> games

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
asymmetric element that that makes games

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.520 
asymmetric element that that makes games
more<00:01:10.790> flavorful<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.299> interesting<00:01:11.530> each

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
more flavorful and interesting each

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.260
