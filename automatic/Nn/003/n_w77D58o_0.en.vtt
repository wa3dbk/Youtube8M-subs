00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
now don't have it very organized because

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.420 
now don't have it very organized because
I've<00:02:37.420> been<00:02:37.450> moving<00:02:37.810> things<00:02:38.140> around<00:02:38.260> but<00:02:39.190> I

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
I've been moving things around but I

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.680 
I've been moving things around but I
thought<00:02:39.640> well<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.239> would<00:02:40.390> be<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.480> great<00:02:40.599> place

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
thought well this would be a great place

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.360 
thought well this would be a great place
because<00:02:41.019> I<00:02:41.140> don't<00:02:41.349> store<00:02:41.560> one<00:02:41.799> down<00:02:42.040> here<00:02:42.220> it's

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
because I don't store one down here it's

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.140 
because I don't store one down here it's
not<00:02:42.549> realistic<00:02:42.849> but<00:02:44.220> these<00:02:45.220> photos<00:02:45.579> will<00:02:45.849> fit

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
not realistic but these photos will fit

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.470 
not realistic but these photos will fit
just<00:02:46.530> perfect<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.739> get<00:02:48.190> like<00:02:48.280> that<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.849> leave

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
just perfect I get like that and leave

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.650 
just perfect I get like that and leave
it<00:02:49.599> out<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.720> little<00:02:49.840> bit<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.140> see<00:02:50.319> what<00:02:50.349> I<00:02:50.890> have

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
it out a little bit and see what I have

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.100 
it out a little bit and see what I have
so<00:02:53.010> anyway<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.360> is<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.959> I<00:02:55.989> hope

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
so anyway that is it and I hope

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.220 
so anyway that is it and I hope
everybody<00:02:56.470> has<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.620> good<00:02:56.799> night<00:02:56.950> I
