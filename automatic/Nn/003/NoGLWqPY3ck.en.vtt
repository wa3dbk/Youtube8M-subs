a<00:00:38.940> skeleton<00:00:39.149> spawner<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.809> wouldn't<00:00:40.140> recommend

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
a skeleton spawner I wouldn't recommend

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.900 
a skeleton spawner I wouldn't recommend
doing<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:40.920> zombies<00:00:41.309> cuz<00:00:41.670> they're

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
doing this with zombies cuz they're

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.979 
doing this with zombies cuz they're
drops<00:00:42.180> aren't<00:00:42.329> really<00:00:42.570> worth<00:00:42.690> anything

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
drops aren't really worth anything

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.740 
drops aren't really worth anything
stable<00:00:43.739> exploiters<00:00:44.160> once<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.090> get<00:00:45.210> five<00:00:45.600> or

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
stable exploiters once you get five or

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.240 
stable exploiters once you get five or
so<00:00:45.840> string<00:00:46.230> there's<00:00:46.500> not<00:00:46.860> really<00:00:47.010> much<00:00:47.190> else

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
so string there's not really much else

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.690 
so string there's not really much else
you<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.730> with<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.410> so<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.160> method

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
you can do with it so in this method

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.310 
you can do with it so in this method
won't<00:00:50.969> even<00:00:51.180> work<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.510> spiders<00:00:51.930> because<00:00:52.170> they

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
won't even work on spiders because they

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.689 
won't even work on spiders because they
can<00:00:52.530> climb<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.430> they're<00:00:54.300> wide<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:56.460> what<00:00:56.579> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
can climb and they're wide so what you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.020 
can climb and they're wide so what you
have<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.300> put<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.230> these<00:00:58.320> down<00:00:58.620> um

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
have to do is put one of these down um

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.349 
have to do is put one of these down um
dig<00:01:00.030> out<00:01:00.469> one<00:01:01.469> layer<00:01:01.770> below<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.640> spawner<00:01:03.059> so

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
dig out one layer below the spawner so

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.710 
dig out one layer below the spawner so
it's<00:01:03.629> floating<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.170> one

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
it's floating on one

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.700 
it's floating on one
and<00:01:05.810> then<00:01:06.200> go<00:01:06.410> to<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.560> end<00:01:06.740> of<00:01:06.830> it<00:01:06.950> dig<00:01:07.400> a<00:01:08.710> 3d

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
and then go to the end of it dig a 3d

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.800 
and then go to the end of it dig a 3d
pull<00:01:10.040> all<00:01:10.910> the<00:01:11.000> way<00:01:11.030> across<00:01:12.340> for<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.810> mobster

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
pull all the way across for the mobster

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.190 
pull all the way across for the mobster
drone<00:01:15.080> in<00:01:15.230> and<00:01:15.440> then<00:01:15.950> go<00:01:16.400> out<00:01:16.430> one<00:01:16.790> or<00:01:16.910> two<00:01:17.200> dig

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
drone in and then go out one or two dig

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.740 
drone in and then go out one or two dig
a<00:01:18.380> trench<00:01:18.650> to<00:01:19.100> lower<00:01:19.370> and<00:01:19.760> we'll<00:01:19.970> go<00:01:20.120> on<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.330> how

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
a trench to lower and we'll go on to how

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.300 
a trench to lower and we'll go on to how
this<00:01:20.900> will<00:01:21.050> work<00:01:21.080> later<00:01:21.470> for<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:21.860> collection

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
this will work later for the collection

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.000 
this will work later for the collection
system<00:01:23.320> but<00:01:24.320> it's<00:01:24.530> pretty<00:01:24.650> straightforward

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
system but it's pretty straightforward

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.590 
system but it's pretty straightforward
pretty<00:01:25.520> simple<00:01:25.880> you<00:01:25.910> can<00:01:26.120> build<00:01:26.300> us<00:01:26.420> about

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
pretty simple you can build us about

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.160 
pretty simple you can build us about
five<00:01:26.930> minutes<00:01:27.170> um<00:01:28.570> all<00:01:29.570> you<00:01:29.690> need<00:01:29.870> is<00:01:29.900> the

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
five minutes um all you need is the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.380 
five minutes um all you need is the
spawner<00:01:30.620> which<00:01:31.070> is<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.490> only<00:01:31.640> hard<00:01:31.880> part<00:01:31.940> and

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
spawner which is the only hard part and

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.050 
spawner which is the only hard part and
then<00:01:32.630> what<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:32.960> do<00:01:33.140> I<00:01:33.470> look<00:01:33.830> pink<00:01:34.130> what<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:34.880> do

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
across anyway and you just put a source

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.859 
across anyway and you just put a source
block<00:01:47.119> of<00:01:47.660> water<00:01:48.290> on<00:01:49.119> every<00:01:50.119> single<00:01:50.479> block

which is down here and as you can see it
all<00:02:13.459> flows<00:02:13.730> down<00:02:13.969> into<00:02:14.000> here<00:02:14.420> um<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.560> isn't

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
all flows down into here um this isn't

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.039 
all flows down into here um this isn't
exactly<00:02:15.980> how<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.489> Finnish<00:02:17.299> system<00:02:17.689> will<00:02:17.840> look

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
exactly how the Finnish system will look

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.119 
exactly how the Finnish system will look
what<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.129> would<00:02:19.310> need<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:19.730> do<00:02:19.879> next<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.769> take<00:02:21.769> a

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
what you would need to do next is take a

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.000 
what you would need to do next is take a
handful<00:02:22.849> of<00:02:22.909> signs<00:02:23.390> like<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.620> have<00:02:24.799> my

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
handful of signs like I have my

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.090 
handful of signs like I have my
inventory<00:02:25.310> here

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.600 

and<00:02:28.220> slap<00:02:29.120> them<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.810> Don<00:02:30.140> ends<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:31.190> cut<00:02:31.460> the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
and slap them and Don ends to cut the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.850 
and slap them and Don ends to cut the
water<00:02:31.760> current<00:02:32.180> like<00:02:32.990> so<00:02:33.290> um<00:02:34.960> this<00:02:35.960> makes<00:02:36.710> it

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
water current like so um this makes it

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.310 
water current like so um this makes it
so<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.160> water<00:02:37.340> can't<00:02:37.670> get<00:02:37.760> through<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.810> you

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
so the water can't get through and you

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.200 
so the water can't get through and you
have<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:40.070> clean<00:02:40.910> area<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.540> work<00:02:41.720> with<00:02:41.930> um<00:02:43.210> like

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
have a clean area to work with um like

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.590 
have a clean area to work with um like
that<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.950> then<00:02:45.950> from<00:02:46.400> there<00:02:46.760> all<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.390> need<00:02:47.570> to

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
that and then from there all you need to

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.740 
that and then from there all you need to
do<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.260> take<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.280> water<00:02:49.670> bucket

ND half slab like that put the water at

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.420 
ND half slab like that put the water at
the<00:02:58.570> end<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:58.780> these<00:02:58.900> two<00:02:59.260> flew<00:02:59.830> it<00:02:59.980> over<00:03:00.190> to
