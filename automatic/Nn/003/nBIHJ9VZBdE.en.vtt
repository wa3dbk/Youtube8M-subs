was<00:04:31.880> pretty<00:04:32.210> cool<00:04:32.419> at<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.660> time<00:04:32.840> because<00:04:33.110> even

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
was pretty cool at the time because even

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.860 
was pretty cool at the time because even
phones<00:04:34.430> there<00:04:34.760> weren't<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.090> plication<00:04:35.480> 's<00:04:35.660> for

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
phones there weren't a plication 's for

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.360 
phones there weren't a plication 's for
them<00:04:35.960> that<00:04:36.139> would<00:04:36.260> do<00:04:36.410> this<00:04:36.590> I<00:04:36.650> think<00:04:37.100> the

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
them that would do this I think the

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.720 
them that would do this I think the
iPhone<00:04:37.550> 3G<00:04:38.240> was<00:04:38.389> out<00:04:38.570> by<00:04:38.720> them<00:04:38.960> still<00:04:39.950> there<00:04:40.490> so

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
iPhone 3G was out by them still there so

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.140 
iPhone 3G was out by them still there so
you<00:04:40.790> get<00:04:41.000> this<00:04:41.180> effect<00:04:42.430> you<00:04:43.430> get<00:04:43.580> this<00:04:43.820> effect

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
you get this effect you get this effect

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.830 
you get this effect you get this effect
which<00:04:44.389> is<00:04:44.540> my<00:04:44.690> favorite<00:04:45.350> at<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.770> time

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
which is my favorite at the time

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.390 
which is my favorite at the time
distortion<00:04:47.840> which<00:04:48.139> was<00:04:48.320> my<00:04:48.470> other<00:04:48.889> favorite

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
distortion which was my other favorite

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.390 
distortion which was my other favorite

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
so there you see me a bit messed up as

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.000

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
usual and then you have this one which

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.920 
usual and then you have this one which
just<00:04:58.280> turned<00:04:58.610> it<00:04:58.760> back<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.060> white<00:04:59.210> you<00:04:59.750> could

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
just turned it back and white you could

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.409 
just turned it back and white you could
