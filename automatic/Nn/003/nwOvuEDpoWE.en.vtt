gonna cover day number 90 of this 90
gallon<00:00:25.980> build<00:00:26.250> process<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.119> system<00:00:27.599> is

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
gallon build process so the system is

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.560 
gallon build process so the system is
three<00:00:28.380> months<00:00:28.740> old<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.400> I've<00:00:29.789> added<00:00:30.090> some<00:00:30.420> new

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
three months old and I've added some new

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
three months old and I've added some new
additions<00:00:31.140> now<00:00:31.260> I'm<00:00:31.380> very<00:00:31.730> very<00:00:32.730> excited

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
additions now I'm very very excited

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.840 
additions now I'm very very excited
overall<00:00:34.590> with<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> way<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.399> system<00:00:35.579> is

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
overall with the way the system is

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.280 
overall with the way the system is
really<00:00:36.149> looking<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.600> mean<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:36.899> really

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
really looking I mean it's really

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.340 
really looking I mean it's really
starting<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:38.129> resemble<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.690> reef<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.050> I

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
starting to resemble the reef that I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.979 
starting to resemble the reef that I
envisioned<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.550> however<00:00:41.879> there's<00:00:42.510> probably

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
envisioned but however there's probably

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.170 
envisioned but however there's probably
gonna<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.379> another<00:00:43.649> 10<00:00:44.100> or<00:00:44.129> 15<00:00:44.430> different

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
gonna be another 10 or 15 different

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.250 
gonna be another 10 or 15 different
species<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.719> corals<00:00:46.289> added<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.789> system

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
species of corals added to this system

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.100 
species of corals added to this system
it's<00:00:49.260> gonna<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.620> some<00:00:49.829> very<00:00:49.860> rare<00:00:50.789> species<00:00:51.300> and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
it's gonna be some very rare species and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.310 
it's gonna be some very rare species and
probably<00:00:52.649> might<00:00:52.890> even<00:00:53.160> remove<00:00:53.820> or<00:00:54.239> frag<00:00:54.899> some

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
probably might even remove or frag some

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.290 
probably might even remove or frag some
of<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.399> ones<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.239> are

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
of this the ones that I have that are

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.630 
of this the ones that I have that are
much<00:00:57.570> bigger<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.800> know<00:00:58.949> cut<00:00:59.219> them<00:00:59.399> down<00:00:59.579> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
much bigger you know cut them down and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.069 
much bigger you know cut them down and
position<00:01:00.000> them<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.600> different<00:01:00.930> position

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
position them in a different position

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.520 
position them in a different position
and<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:02.039> just<00:01:02.280> sort<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:03.019> get<00:01:04.019> my<00:01:04.170> hands

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
long as a branching montipora now this

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.370 
long as a branching montipora now this
one<00:03:25.530> here<00:03:25.920> it's<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.549> nice<00:03:26.730> Frank<00:03:27.150> however<00:03:27.660> you
