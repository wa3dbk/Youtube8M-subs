I want to show you how you can improve
the<00:00:05.339> quality<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:05.910> your<00:00:06.180> -<00:00:06.600> studio<00:00:06.990> renders<00:00:07.490> so

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
the quality of your - studio renders so

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.879 
the quality of your - studio renders so
maybe<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:10.139> make<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> render<00:00:10.830> sometimes<00:00:11.400> and

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
maybe you make a render sometimes and

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.519 
maybe you make a render sometimes and
you<00:00:13.889> can<00:00:14.099> see<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.750> skin<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:16.020> your<00:00:16.350> figure

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
you can see the skin of your figure

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.660 
you can see the skin of your figure
looks<00:00:16.920> really<00:00:17.520> smooth<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:19.189> yeah<00:00:20.189> looks<00:00:20.460> not

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
looks really smooth and yeah looks not

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.779 
looks really smooth and yeah looks not
like<00:00:21.029> real<00:00:21.210> skin<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:22.160> we<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.340> solve<00:00:23.580> this

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
like real skin and we can solve this

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.960 
like real skin and we can solve this
problem<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.840> Photoshop<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:26.189> an<00:00:26.400> uber

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
problem in Photoshop and with an uber

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.140 
problem in Photoshop and with an uber
environment<00:00:27.449> shader<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:28.039> the<00:00:29.039> ubermensch<00:00:29.640> ADA

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
environment shader so the ubermensch ADA

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.630 
environment shader so the ubermensch ADA
is<00:00:30.449> included<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.470> -<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.279> for<00:00:32.579> pro<00:00:33.410> I<00:00:34.640> think

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
is included in - to do for pro I think

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.970 
is included in - to do for pro I think
in<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.000> basic<00:00:36.480> version<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:37.350> need<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.770> buy<00:00:37.920> it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
in the basic version you need to buy it

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.130 
in the basic version you need to buy it
separately<00:00:38.399> from<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.239> -<00:00:39.480> -<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.840> your<00:00:39.930> home

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
separately from the - - to your home

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.200 
separately from the - - to your home
page<00:00:42.440> but<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.860> really<00:00:44.070> great<00:00:44.309> trader<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
page but it's a really great trader and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.619 
page but it's a really great trader and
you<00:00:45.270> can<00:00:45.840> make<00:00:46.140> really<00:00:46.440> really<00:00:46.829> realistic

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
you can make really really realistic

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.760 
you can make really really realistic
renders<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:51.030> make<00:00:51.239> our<00:00:51.770> render

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
renders with this so to make our render

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.200 
renders with this so to make our render
looks<00:00:52.980> really<00:00:53.399> good<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.730> need<00:00:53.910> two<00:00:54.120> things

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.880 

yeah<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.449> need<00:00:57.600> two<00:00:58.260> pictures<00:00:58.710> from<00:00:59.160> our<00:00:59.309> seen

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
yeah we need two pictures from our seen

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.240 
yeah we need two pictures from our seen
one<00:01:01.890> picture<00:01:02.329> rendered<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.539> normal<00:01:04.019> lights

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
one picture rendered with normal lights

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.179 
one picture rendered with normal lights
this<00:01:05.250> picture<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:05.880> was<00:01:06.270> rendered<00:01:06.630> with<00:01:07.189> I

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
this picture here was rendered with I

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.410 
this picture here was rendered with I
think<00:01:09.710> distant<00:01:10.710> light<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.280> some<00:01:12.119> spotlights

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
think distant light and some spotlights

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.450 
think distant light and some spotlights
and<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:14.430> render<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.560> was<00:01:16.560> rendered<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.189> an

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
and and render that was rendered with an

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.740 
and and render that was rendered with an
uber<00:01:17.909> environment<00:01:18.360> shader

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
uber environment shader

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.550 
uber environment shader
this<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.470> here<00:01:20.869> with<00:01:21.869> an<00:01:22.170> urban<00:01:22.439> environment

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
this one here with an urban environment

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.899 
this one here with an urban environment
China<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.130> got<00:01:23.310> one<00:01:23.490> problem<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.460> use

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
China you got one problem you can use

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.980 
China you got one problem you can use
other<00:01:27.270> lights<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.400> not<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
other lights so you have not the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.929 
other lights so you have not the
possibility<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.710> make<00:01:32.869> really<00:01:34.520> cool<00:01:35.520> shadows

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
possibility to make really cool shadows

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.340 
possibility to make really cool shadows
or<00:01:36.439> play<00:01:37.439> with<00:01:37.650> light<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:39.780> image<00:01:40.049> looks

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
or play with light and the image looks

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.450 
or play with light and the image looks
really<00:01:41.009> flat<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:42.799> we<00:01:43.799> can<00:01:44.009> solve<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.399> problem

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
really flat so we can solve this problem

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.600 
really flat so we can solve this problem
with<00:01:44.970> photoshop<00:01:45.470> we<00:01:46.470> only<00:01:46.649> need<00:01:46.950> our<00:01:47.189> urban

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
with photoshop we only need our urban

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.210 
with photoshop we only need our urban
environment<00:01:47.640> shader<00:01:48.360> render<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.829> second

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
environment shader render and a second

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.460 
environment shader render and a second
render<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:50.759> normal<00:01:51.600> lights<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.990> want<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.290> use

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
render with normal lights we want to use

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.660 
render with normal lights we want to use
and<00:01:53.299> how<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.570> make<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:55.500> combined<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.219> show

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
and how we can make this combined I show

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.010 
and how we can make this combined I show
you<00:01:56.729> know<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:58.700> open<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.090> two<00:02:00.600> pictures<00:02:00.990> in

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
you know so open you to two pictures in

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.740 
you know so open you to two pictures in
Photoshop<00:02:02.600> okay

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
Photoshop okay

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.639 
Photoshop okay
now<00:02:05.750> we<00:02:06.290> need<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:07.360> grab<00:02:08.360> our<00:02:08.600> normal<00:02:09.530> light

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
now we need to grab our normal light

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.420 
now we need to grab our normal light
image<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.630> move<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.840> over<00:02:11.960> our<00:02:12.950> web

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
image and move it over our web

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.920 
image and move it over our web
environment<00:02:13.670> share<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.300> image<00:02:15.280> okay<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.930> set

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
environment share the image okay and set

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.330 
environment share the image okay and set
the<00:02:18.080> layer<00:02:18.230> mode<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.560> multiply<00:02:21.040> as<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.190> can

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
the layer mode to multiply as you can

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.800 
the layer mode to multiply as you can
see<00:02:22.520> now<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.730> image<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:24.290> really<00:02:24.890> dark<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.630> we

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
see now the image is really dark so we

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.550 
see now the image is really dark so we
need<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.230> lighten<00:02:27.440> up<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:28.010> little<00:02:28.280> bit<00:02:28.400> I

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
need to lighten up it a little bit I

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:41.140 
need to lighten up it a little bit I
make<00:02:30.560> this<00:02:30.770> with<00:02:31.010> an<00:02:31.250> craft<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:34.430> light<00:02:35.440> okay

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.480 

yeah<00:02:42.080> still<00:02:42.500> very<00:02:42.770> dark<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.490> I<00:02:43.520> think<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:45.490> light

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
yeah still very dark so I think I light

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:55.630 
yeah still very dark so I think I light
bright<00:02:47.420> up<00:02:48.160> shadows<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.190> little<00:02:49.310> bit<00:02:54.370> yeah<00:02:55.370> that

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
bright up shadows a little bit yeah that

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.610 
bright up shadows a little bit yeah that
looks<00:02:55.880> fine<00:02:56.440> okay

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
looks fine okay

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.660 
looks fine okay
the<00:02:58.340> next<00:02:58.640> step<00:02:58.850> is<00:02:59.060> we<00:02:59.950> need<00:03:00.950> again<00:03:01.370> our

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
the next step is we need again our

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.500 
the next step is we need again our
normal<00:03:02.150> metal<00:03:02.360> I'd<00:03:03.550> make<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.760> same<00:03:04.790> thing

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
normal metal I'd make the same thing

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.060 
normal metal I'd make the same thing
like<00:03:05.900> before<00:03:07.030> but<00:03:08.030> now<00:03:08.300> we<00:03:08.990> turn<00:03:09.410> our<00:03:09.440> image

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
like before but now we turn our image

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.300 
like before but now we turn our image
into<00:03:10.280> an<00:03:10.460> black-and-white<00:03:10.730> image<00:03:13.930> okay<00:03:14.930> and

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
into an black-and-white image okay and

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.100 
into an black-and-white image okay and
set<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.460> layer<00:03:16.610> mode<00:03:16.700> this<00:03:17.060> time<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.660> hard

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
set the layer mode this time to hard

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.270 
set the layer mode this time to hard
light<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:20.170> yeah<00:03:21.170> you<00:03:21.410> can<00:03:21.590> see<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:21.920> result

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
light and yeah you can see the result

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.430 
light and yeah you can see the result
maybe<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.300> little<00:03:23.510> bit<00:03:23.720> too<00:03:23.870> strong

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
maybe a little bit too strong

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.310 
maybe a little bit too strong
I<00:03:25.000> set<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.150> opacity<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:27.850> err<00:03:29.080> 70%

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
I set the opacity to err 70%

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.680 
I set the opacity to err 70%
I<00:03:30.350> think<00:03:30.890> 70s<00:03:31.430> good<00:03:35.650> yeah<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.890> as<00:03:37.100> you<00:03:37.280> can<00:03:37.460> see

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
I think 70s good yeah and as you can see

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.200 
I think 70s good yeah and as you can see
it<00:03:38.690> looks<00:03:38.900> really<00:03:39.800> good<00:03:39.950> but<00:03:40.700> we<00:03:40.940> are<00:03:41.060> not

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
it looks really good but we are not

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.440 
it looks really good but we are not
ready<00:03:42.100> we<00:03:43.100> need<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.460> do<00:03:43.610> some<00:03:43.880> steps<00:03:45.040> first<00:03:46.450> we

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
ready we need to do some steps first we

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.020 
ready we need to do some steps first we
combined<00:03:47.930> all<00:03:48.200> our<00:03:48.800> layers<00:03:49.100> to<00:03:49.430> one<00:03:49.610> single

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
combined all our layers to one single

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.180 
combined all our layers to one single
layer<00:03:50.150> so<00:03:50.750> as<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:51.440> can<00:03:51.530> see<00:03:51.590> we<00:03:51.890> have<00:03:51.980> three

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
layer so as you can see we have three

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.960 
layer so as you can see we have three
layers<00:03:52.340> here<00:03:52.490> and<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:55.310> only<00:03:55.550> thing<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.850> need

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
layers here and the only thing you need

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:05.070 
layers here and the only thing you need
to<00:03:56.030> do<00:03:56.240> is<00:03:56.390> go<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:59.890> layer<00:04:00.890> that<00:04:01.190> is<00:04:02.170> above

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
to do is go to the layer that is above

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.120 
to do is go to the layer that is above
press<00:04:06.080> control<00:04:06.680> alt<00:04:06.980> on<00:04:07.250> your<00:04:07.310> keyboard<00:04:07.640> and

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
combine the layer to one so we have all

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.150 
combine the layer to one so we have all
this<00:04:13.160> layer<00:04:13.370> in<00:04:13.550> one<00:04:13.790> image<00:04:14.060> now<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:15.730> now<00:04:16.730> we

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
this layer in one image now and now we

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.190 
this layer in one image now and now we
can<00:04:19.160> make<00:04:19.370> some<00:04:19.730> color<00:04:20.150> correction<00:04:20.660> so<00:04:23.200> first

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
can make some color correction so first

can make some color correction so first
of<00:04:24.410> all<00:04:24.590> I<00:04:25.360> desaturate<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.390> image<00:04:28.510> okay

00:04:30.549 --> 00:04:30.559 
of all I desaturate the image okay

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:37.679 
of all I desaturate the image okay
after<00:04:31.399> that<00:04:31.639> I<00:04:33.939> make<00:04:34.939> a<00:04:34.969> color<00:04:35.359> balance<00:04:35.599> and

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:37.689 
after that I make a color balance and

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:45.509 
after that I make a color balance and
make<00:04:38.689> my<00:04:39.019> shadows<00:04:39.529> a<00:04:40.389> bit<00:04:41.389> more<00:04:41.629> blue<00:04:43.119> okay

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:45.519 
make my shadows a bit more blue okay

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:50.069 
make my shadows a bit more blue okay
the<00:04:46.519> middle<00:04:46.789> tone<00:04:46.999> su-yong<00:04:48.249> not<00:04:49.249> too<00:04:49.429> much<00:04:49.639> and

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:50.079 
the middle tone su-yong not too much and

00:04:50.079 --> 00:05:01.839 
the middle tone su-yong not too much and
the<00:04:51.079> lights<00:04:51.319> yellow<00:04:54.249> okay<00:04:55.249> and<00:05:00.519> as<00:05:01.519> you<00:05:01.699> can

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:14.079 
see we got a little bit more contrast in
the<00:05:07.909> image<00:05:07.939> and<00:05:11.529> what<00:05:12.529> we<00:05:12.739> see<00:05:12.949> here<00:05:12.979> is<00:05:13.369> our

the image and what we see here is our

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:17.469 
the image and what we see here is our
claws<00:05:14.569> are<00:05:15.139> very<00:05:15.559> very<00:05:16.279> dark<00:05:16.579> so<00:05:16.849> we<00:05:16.999> can<00:05:17.239> see

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
claws are very very dark so we can see

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.729 
claws are very very dark so we can see
all<00:05:18.079> the<00:05:18.469> details<00:05:18.859> like<00:05:19.659> the<00:05:20.659> sparkles<00:05:21.529> here

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:21.739 
all the details like the sparkles here

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:26.979 
all the details like the sparkles here
and<00:05:23.199> we<00:05:24.199> can<00:05:24.379> fix<00:05:24.589> this<00:05:24.739> with<00:05:24.799> a<00:05:25.279> layer<00:05:25.609> mask<00:05:25.989> so

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:26.989 
and we can fix this with a layer mask so

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:33.009 
and we can fix this with a layer mask so
set<00:05:27.259> a<00:05:27.289> layer<00:05:27.499> mask<00:05:29.079> take<00:05:30.079> a<00:05:31.209> black<00:05:32.209> brush<00:05:32.689> with

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:33.019 
set a layer mask take a black brush with

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:37.919 
set a layer mask take a black brush with
a<00:05:33.049> soft<00:05:33.469> edges<00:05:34.419> and<00:05:36.399> with<00:05:37.399> your<00:05:37.610> layer<00:05:37.789> mask

a soft edges and with your layer mask

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:44.319 
a soft edges and with your layer mask
activate<00:05:38.929> you<00:05:39.499> can<00:05:39.739> now<00:05:40.059> oops<00:05:42.189> not<00:05:43.189> lighten<00:05:44.179> up

okay now we can see all the details and

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.810 
okay now we can see all the details and
the<00:05:57.830> faults<00:05:58.900> it<00:05:59.900> was<00:06:00.230> before<00:06:00.530> much<00:06:01.340> too<00:06:01.550> dark

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
the faults it was before much too dark

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:09.360 
the faults it was before much too dark
so<00:06:02.120> we<00:06:02.690> can<00:06:02.900> see<00:06:03.169> anything<00:06:07.450> okay

it that's our final image and I can show

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.010 
it that's our final image and I can show
you<00:06:32.900> the<00:06:33.350> original<00:06:33.910> render<00:06:34.910> without<00:06:35.479> any<00:06:35.720> post

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
you the original render without any post

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.290 
you the original render without any post
work<00:06:36.880> and<00:06:38.770> I<00:06:39.770> think<00:06:40.280> you<00:06:40.610> can<00:06:40.820> see<00:06:41.090> the

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
work and I think you can see the

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.600 
work and I think you can see the
different<00:06:44.470> yeah<00:06:45.470> the<00:06:45.860> skin<00:06:46.070> looks<00:06:46.400> really
