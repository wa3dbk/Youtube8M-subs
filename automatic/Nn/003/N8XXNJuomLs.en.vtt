00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.779
 yes you could fear the most for it 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.199
 Enough people who can still drive on a provincial road 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:21.079
 only on the highway when reading and probably 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:23.989
 beerta is suffering from 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:29.210
 twente an honest way the sho may god be newborn that tomorrow 

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:33.030
 shining oncoming traffic with our eyes remains a full case was a justified one 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.200
 winner 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.330
 The result of this is 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.180
 to the old structure 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.340
 now it goes as it were in the premier league they are there too 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.990
 and a lot of chances that you are looking for concern or mir method 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.920
 but at the same time you may also know after your environment 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.860
 we clearly saw a bottle 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.300
 I see a high-voltage cable there 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.830
 containing the vegte 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.010
 that open for it 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.050
 hell yes 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.620
 that's my world 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.870
 and I'm glad I do that to the womb 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.200
 eindhoven strained 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
 whatever you want but gallery in the face 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.680
 gasquet 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.310
 without having a tech crunch 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.310
 look out a lot for me 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.920
 where it is also likely that it 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.970
 watching the car 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.970
 what exactly went wrong 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.870
 for his first and david o the tallest 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.220
 we are not on a fishing boat 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.990
 many people with driving anxiety 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 and there is none 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.450
 I now drive at 80 kilometers per hour 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.310
 I know the atmosphere 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.310
 good he gets 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.459
 I see it anyway 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.309
 suicide 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.309
 Annelies body is not it I only see the water 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:18.909
 phil vs 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:19.879
 I'm from 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.879
 many people watch the low point was striking 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.830
 from the need this is under investigation and that is the only thing that it rained this 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.600
 always turn to the tt of axes 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.909
 that's what it's about 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.409
 the second quarter 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.619
 and never again 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:39.219
 defeated re-election from the corner of my eye 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.219
 and northwest 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.569
 if you accept this percentage 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.969
 it all looks a lot easier 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.319
 see you too 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.829
 what come on the high side
