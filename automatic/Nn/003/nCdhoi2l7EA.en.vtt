00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 what will be hot fitness and 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.440
 Welcome to my bank 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.750
 through video and 100 kilo three 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.580
 repetitions six sentences and we 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.500
 I got speed date 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.379
 but maximum tries me 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.430
 shoulder could then on 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.600
 Thursdays not because of that 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.609
 that videos too after solo 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.189
 because I did saturday 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.710
 so saturday the training again 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.420
 bit of mobility made that is 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.119
 So far the days have been really extreme 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.080
 in between and pushed the vub ran it 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.829
 my pleasure again 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.180
 I was able to get back on the band 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.770
 I am satisfied with the technology that has to be 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.070
 I clearly say so was the technology 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.200
 often I had tried it again 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.300
 with that with the setup that is like me 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.570
 prepared me before I got the snake 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.610
 out stretch and then I am near the end 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.840
 I noticed 80 then 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.270
 I did that repetition 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.250
 was wrong to order really the Rhine 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.930
 take and so what in and of itself around 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.070
 an attempt to strengthen 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:09.200
 I'm hot with the lamp age is yes 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:11.490
 exaggerate without real 1 but yes 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.619
 and the elbows after a little nice 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.520
 inside that's all a bit shit 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.619
 So move soon 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.900
 that means running slow runs too 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.710
 good but i would like more 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.810
 to wish 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.380
 but you get that in front I give that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.140
 Whatever time and then it works too 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.350
 with the middle with with the bank press 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.579
 my friends 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.689
 but there we can break you technically 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.159
 Do something else and we can do that 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.159
 cutting technology in any case 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.310
 we have to do a lot there 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.310
 case 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.430
 is there something to say 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:57.590
 so well now the 106 sat and 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.539
 now after that a little bit with 80 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.090
 Of course, clown 80 is just me 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.820
 I made 25 repetitions and a 10 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.929
 repetitions and in the ten 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.679
 Repeat sentence is me 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.810
 noticed 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.160
 At the very end, I do that all the time 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.060
 somehow wrong but good 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.970
 you do not get stuck in there 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.170
 Technology is still a bit unfamiliar 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.750
 that's why there's a reason why you want to cross 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.549
 and squat with me at the moment so 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.580
 disengages because simply the technology 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.400
 every time is the right routine 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.420
 is the same I always do everything as 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.630
 the times before and the two things that 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.010
 Rest just like that, I'm from 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.340
 I have the feeling to strengthen the day 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.340
 stronger 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.190
 That's okay by me 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.549
 So if this continues then then 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.459
 We certainly squat this year 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.380
 to see another 200 on repeat 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.930
 I'm assuming so as trainings 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.070
 Do not straighten up now tongues 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.670
 but really in the repetitions 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.400
 training plan yet, and that's 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.500
 a hausnummer curious I am 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.209
 really curious what else is going on my 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.209
 friends video already something to end 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.420
 until the next video makes it good
