and that the monster is controlled by

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.539 
and that the monster is controlled by
somebody<00:01:39.950> else<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.429> you<00:01:40.520> can

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
somebody else and that you can

back in without just being annihilated

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.050 
back in without just being annihilated
at<00:02:44.840> everything<00:02:45.350> by<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.799> pros<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.940> know

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
at everything by the pros you know

at everything by the pros you know
there's<00:02:47.840> probably<00:02:48.410> tutorials<00:02:49.100> but<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.760> would

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
there's probably tutorials but you would

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.020 
there's probably tutorials but you would
start<00:02:50.150> on<00:02:50.389> an<00:02:50.560> easier<00:02:51.560> player<00:02:52.250> class<00:02:52.579> I<00:02:52.819> would

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
start on an easier player class I would

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.819 
start on an easier player class I would
say<00:02:53.239> trapper<00:02:53.600> is<00:02:53.840> probably<00:02:54.200> one<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.709> more

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
say trapper is probably one of the more

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.759 
say trapper is probably one of the more
difficult<00:02:54.980> ones<00:02:55.359> but<00:02:56.359> support<00:02:57.170> would<00:02:57.350> be<00:02:57.470> a

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
difficult ones but support would be a

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.500 
difficult ones but support would be a
good<00:02:58.010> choice<00:02:58.220> or<00:02:58.519> maybe<00:02:58.700> attacker<00:02:59.090> because

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
good choice or maybe attacker because

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.820 
good choice or maybe attacker because
it's<00:02:59.660> pretty<00:02:59.840> straightforward<00:03:00.110> what<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.680> do

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
the distance indicate where he might be

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.080 
the distance indicate where he might be
you<00:04:09.360> can<00:04:09.600> you<00:04:10.019> can<00:04:10.170> you<00:04:10.470> know<00:04:10.980> track<00:04:11.670> certain

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
you can you can you know track certain

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.400 
you can you can you know track certain
elements<00:04:12.510> of<00:04:12.660> that<00:04:12.780> which<00:04:13.049> i<00:04:13.140> think<00:04:13.200> is

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
elements of that which i think is

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.590 
elements of that which i think is
interesting<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:13.950> more<00:04:14.190> than<00:04:14.489> just<00:04:14.600> we're

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
interesting it's more than just we're

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.430 
interesting it's more than just we're
gonna<00:04:15.690> hate<00:04:15.840> we're<00:04:15.930> going<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.109> find<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.350> and

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
are other elements to the game it's more

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.650 
are other elements to the game it's more
intuitive<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:19.979> guess<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:20.609> maybe<00:04:20.820> Dave<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.450> would

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
intuitive I guess so maybe Dave it would

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.270 
intuitive I guess so maybe Dave it would
be<00:04:21.780> easier<00:04:22.109> for<00:04:22.169> you<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.410> jump<00:04:22.620> in<00:04:22.830> using<00:04:23.190> your

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
be easier for you to jump in using your

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.920 
be easier for you to jump in using your
real-world<00:04:23.550> experience<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.510> knowing<00:04:24.660> the

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
real-world experience of knowing the

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.900 
real-world experience of knowing the
birds<00:04:25.229> fly<00:04:25.860> from<00:04:26.100> trees<00:04:26.400> that<00:04:26.580> have<00:04:26.729> been

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
birds fly from trees that have been

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.360 
birds fly from trees that have been
disturbed<00:04:27.450> in<00:04:27.570> some<00:04:27.810> manners<00:04:28.290> often<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:29.040> see<00:04:29.340> a

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
disturbed in some manners often I see a

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.830 
disturbed in some manners often I see a
tree<00:04:29.700> in<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:29.910> distance<00:04:30.300> with<00:04:30.510> a<00:04:30.540> little

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
tree in the distance with a little

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.420 
tree in the distance with a little
rustling<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.530> I<00:04:31.590> think<00:04:31.770> that's<00:04:32.010> where<00:04:32.250> the

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
rustling and I think that's where the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.159 
rustling and I think that's where the
monster<00:04:32.820> is<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.210> I<00:04:33.479> usually<00:04:33.630> drive<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.080> other

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
monster is and I usually drive the other

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.200 
monster is and I usually drive the other
way<00:04:34.350> but<00:04:34.500> you're<00:04:34.620> saying<00:04:34.860> in<00:04:35.040> this<00:04:35.160> case<00:04:35.430> we

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
way but you're saying in this case we

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.750 
way but you're saying in this case we
run<00:04:36.390> towards<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.200> do<00:04:37.440> something<00:04:37.729> now<00:04:38.729> I

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
run towards it and do something now I

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.670 
run towards it and do something now I
assume<00:04:39.000> we<00:04:39.270> can<00:04:39.419> buy<00:04:39.540> this<00:04:39.600> game<00:04:39.870> for<00:04:40.110> 2i<00:04:40.350> t<00:04:40.500> and

on we're still trying to convince stay
with<00:04:44.490> that<00:04:44.520> is<00:04:44.790> a<00:04:44.820> effective<00:04:45.630> right<00:04:45.870> off<00:04:45.990> it's

doesn't<00:04:48.570> have<00:04:48.780> split<00:04:49.500> screen<00:04:49.860> so<00:04:50.700> it's<00:04:51.060> only

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
doesn't have split screen so it's only

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.390 
doesn't have split screen so it's only
one<00:04:51.540> person<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:51.990> play<00:04:52.140> per<00:04:52.380> copy<00:04:52.680> so<00:04:52.979> we'd<00:04:53.160> need

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
one person to play per copy so we'd need

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.360 
one person to play per copy so we'd need
five<00:04:53.790> Xbox<00:04:54.300> ones<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:55.140> five<00:04:55.620> copies<00:04:56.010> of<00:04:56.250> the

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
game which is the screen co-op like dead

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.440 
game which is the screen co-op like dead
now<00:04:59.250> because<00:04:59.760> it's<00:04:59.880> my<00:05:00.000> favorite<00:05:00.419> thing

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450

now because it's my favorite thing
pretty<00:05:01.080> much<00:05:01.169> I<00:05:01.620> thought<00:05:02.370> this<00:05:02.610> game<00:05:02.760> would

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
pretty much I thought this game would

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.240 
pretty much I thought this game would
