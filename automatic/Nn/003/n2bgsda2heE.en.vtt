00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.250
 and 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.040
 today we start engines with suitcase 64 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.780
 we have convinced that he teaches us 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.970
 get first to the goal using a 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.739
 of his most effective traps and that is wario 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.280
 this donations about looking for shortcuts in 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.280
 the circuits 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.190
 we meet at koopa beach 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.690
 troopa the third circuit of the cup 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.610
 mushroom and in this first round 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.750
 we will see a shortcut that will save us between 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.750
 15 and 20 seconds 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.290
 if we can take any object 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.390
 that guarantees us an acceleration will be 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.190
 we'll just have to locate 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.720
 a small cave on a mountain to the 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.700
 to climb using the turbo on a ramp and 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.700
 that leave our competitors behind 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.720
 if we do not have any object that accelerates 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.610
 our vehicle we will use the button on 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.970
 jump right before jumping the most 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.970
 edges 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.750
 well done user now we all know 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.750
 all these tricks 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.730
 but what would be wrong we are in the cup 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.500
 star in the barium circuit and it 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.830
 He knows all the basses like the palm of 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.830
 your glove 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.780
 the best way to take advantage of the turbos 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.220
 it's on the straights 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.220
 a good marine council 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.990
 we brush using the ground elevation 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.670
 to assault it by your side of the track and 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:44.720
 is that you save more than 30 seconds in 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.720
 the primary race why I'm alone 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.380
 what they get that par way the first 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.890
 circuit of the special cup and home of 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.600
 donkey kong 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.890
 me that you would not make that monkey angry 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.960
 me too 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.430
 the key is in the first big jump 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.200
 of the circuit where taking advantage of the 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.670
 impulse of curved objects wario 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.440
 tours or joystick lightly to the 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.440
 left to cut ground when falling 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.230
 jump with the wrong button so that 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.230
 we have more precision in the curves 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.700
 it's from me 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.830
 go out there there must be another fan of yours 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.550
 the next below is at the end 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.140
 of the wooden bridge panel where 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.280
 enter the cave we will take a small 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.200
 curve to the right and then to the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.030
 left to remember the elevation of the 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.459
 helping ground of small jumps 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.170
 put so as to lose for it though if 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.300
 it happens to you it's ready you could end up 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.410
 dump the guard vehicle is just 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.410
 save more than five seconds
