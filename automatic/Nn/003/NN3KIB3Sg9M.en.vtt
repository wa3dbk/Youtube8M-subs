from fat that pushes through the sides
of<00:00:48.180> cells<00:00:48.570> up<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> outer<00:00:49.860> layer<00:00:50.160> right<00:00:50.789> up

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
of cells up to the outer layer right up

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.779 
of cells up to the outer layer right up
underneath<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.350> skin<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.520> fat

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
underneath the skin and it's the fat

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.869 
underneath the skin and it's the fat
that's<00:00:54.059> pushing<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.899> against<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.890> skin<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
that's pushing up against the skin the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.240 
that's pushing up against the skin the
reason<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.329> able<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.780> get<00:00:57.989> there<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.500> because

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
reason it's able to get there is because

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.490 
reason it's able to get there is because
the<00:00:59.430> connective<00:00:59.940> tissues<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.809> cells<00:01:01.199> are

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
the connective tissues and the cells are

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.490 
the connective tissues and the cells are
weak<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.460> fats<00:01:03.090> able<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.780> squeeze

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
weak and the fats able to squeeze

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.920 
weak and the fats able to squeeze
through<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.580> there<00:01:05.729> are<00:01:05.760> certain<00:01:06.270> foods<00:01:06.630> that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
through so there are certain foods that

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.929 
through so there are certain foods that
you<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.290> use<00:01:07.530> both<00:01:07.860> by<00:01:08.070> eating<00:01:08.490> them<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
you can use both by eating them and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.810 
you can use both by eating them and
putting<00:01:09.750> them<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.320> skin<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:11.280> help<00:01:11.549> to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
strengthen the connective tissue and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.539 
strengthen the connective tissue and
repair<00:01:14.250> cells<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:16.229> might<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.830> be<00:01:17.100> able<00:01:17.220> to

that's<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.590> whole<00:02:01.920> different<00:02:02.280> thing<00:02:02.460> so

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
that's a whole different thing so

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.810 
that's a whole different thing so
laughing<00:02:03.909> helps<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.810> also<00:02:05.290> pull<00:02:06.190> excess

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
the same thing with milk milk has lactic

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.470 
the same thing with milk milk has lactic
