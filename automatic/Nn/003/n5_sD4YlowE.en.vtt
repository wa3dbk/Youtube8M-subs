really<00:00:57.390> go<00:00:57.629> along<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.170> what<00:00:58.320> they<00:00:58.440> were

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
really go along with what they were

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.330 
really go along with what they were
doing<00:00:58.770> was<00:00:59.550> the<00:01:00.180> Brock<00:01:01.140> lost<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.739> match<00:01:02.039> that
