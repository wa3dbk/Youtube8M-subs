00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.120 

which<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.540> why<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> matrix<00:01:52.440> was<00:01:53.100> redesigned

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
which is why the matrix was redesigned

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:40.270 
which is why the matrix was redesigned
to<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:55.280> peak<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.580> your<00:01:56.900> civilization<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:59.360> say<00:02:00.360> I
