I might be here sooner than we think

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.819 
I might be here sooner than we think
excellent<00:02:21.299> how<00:02:21.900> much<00:02:22.079> cost<00:02:22.319> is<00:02:22.440> gonna<00:02:22.590> add<00:02:22.799> to

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
excellent how much cost is gonna add to

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.979 
excellent how much cost is gonna add to
the<00:02:23.310> average<00:02:23.730> blu-ray<00:02:24.269> player<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.810> really

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
the average blu-ray player is it really

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.360 
the average blu-ray player is it really
that<00:02:25.019> much<00:02:25.139> more<00:02:25.350> expensive<00:02:25.530> oh<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.100> know<00:02:26.340> I

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
that much more expensive oh you know I

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.530 
that much more expensive oh you know I
actually<00:02:26.549> don't<00:02:26.850> think<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.359> for<00:02:27.510> example

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
actually don't think so that for example

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.190 
actually don't think so that for example
the<00:02:28.079> ps3<00:02:29.569> president<00:02:30.569> should<00:02:30.660> have<00:02:30.690> change<00:02:31.019> on

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
the ps3 president should have change on

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.410 
the ps3 president should have change on
that<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.889> ministry<00:02:32.340> should<00:02:32.819> be<00:02:32.910> able<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.150> do<00:02:33.389> a

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
that the ministry should be able to do a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.449 
that the ministry should be able to do a
video<00:02:34.230> live<00:02:34.470> later<00:02:34.709> on<00:02:34.829> this<00:02:34.950> year<00:02:35.010> as<00:02:35.280> well
