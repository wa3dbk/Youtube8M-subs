versions of the maps I was excited

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.340 
versions of the maps I was excited
because<00:00:14.849> who<00:00:15.269> doesn't<00:00:15.540> love<00:00:15.630> free<00:00:15.690> content

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350

because who doesn't love free content
but<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:16.980> didn't<00:00:17.550> think<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:18.000> was<00:00:18.090> going<00:00:18.180> to

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.570 
but I didn't think that it was going to
be<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.630> true<00:00:19.020> night<00:00:19.740> combat<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.430> I've

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580

be that true night combat that I've
always<00:00:20.939> wanted<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.390> battlefield<00:00:21.869> if<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.500> look

always wanted in battlefield if you look

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.650 
always wanted in battlefield if you look
back<00:00:22.949> at<00:00:23.160> basically<00:00:23.519> every<00:00:24.029> night<00:00:24.240> map<00:00:24.449> that

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
back at basically every night map that

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.390 
back at basically every night map that
dice<00:00:24.869> has<00:00:25.080> created<00:00:25.529> over<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.859> last<00:00:26.010> couple<00:00:26.220> of

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
dice has created over the last couple of

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.810 
dice has created over the last couple of
years<00:00:26.730> while<00:00:27.359> it's<00:00:27.779> darker<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.590> tone<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:29.519> does

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
years while it's darker in tone it does

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.510 
years while it's darker in tone it does
sort<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.599> feel<00:00:30.840> like<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.619> time<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.070> day<00:00:32.250> in

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
sort of feel like that time of day in

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.280 
sort of feel like that time of day in
reality<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.450> don't<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.840> play<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.079> any

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
reality you don't have to play it any

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.959 
reality you don't have to play it any
differently<00:00:34.710> everything<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.370> nice<00:00:35.610> bright

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
differently everything is nice bright

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.729 
differently everything is nice bright
and<00:00:36.149> illuminated<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:37.020> no<00:00:37.260> problem

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
and illuminated you have no problem

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.860 
and illuminated you have no problem
seeing<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.129> enemy<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.760> that's<00:00:39.360> exactly<00:00:39.570> what

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
seeing the enemy and that's exactly what

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.660 
seeing the enemy and that's exactly what
I<00:00:39.899> assumed<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.860> night<00:00:41.070> version<00:00:41.340> of

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
I assumed that the night version of

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.250 
I assumed that the night version of
siege<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.059> Shanghai<00:00:42.120> was<00:00:42.600> gonna<00:00:42.690> be<00:00:42.870> all<00:00:42.989> about

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and while there are certain sections of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.240 
and while there are certain sections of
the<00:00:45.539> map<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.379> fit<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:47.010> description

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
the map that do fit that description

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.440 
the map that do fit that description
perfectly

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
perfectly

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.060 
perfectly

walking<00:01:17.939> down<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.119> street<00:01:18.390> noticed<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.960> there

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
walking down a street noticed that there

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.109 
walking down a street noticed that there
were<00:01:19.350> some<00:01:19.619> streetlights<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.430> my<00:01:20.970> reaction

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
were some streetlights on my reaction

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.940 
were some streetlights on my reaction
was<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.570> well<00:01:21.840> let's<00:01:22.080> see<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.710> turn

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
was like well let's see if we can turn

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.830 
was like well let's see if we can turn
these<00:01:23.159> things<00:01:23.340> off<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.880> shot<00:01:24.299> at<00:01:24.479> him<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:24.659> they

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
these things off I shot at him but they

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.350 
these things off I shot at him but they
blew<00:01:25.049> out<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:26.100> my<00:01:26.340> surprise<00:01:26.850> they

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
blew out and to my surprise they

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.719 
blew out and to my surprise they
actually<00:01:28.020> made<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.619> street<00:01:28.979> significantly

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
actually made the street significantly

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.670 
actually made the street significantly
darker<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.229> want<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.530> have

darker and so if you do want to have
that<00:01:31.950> sucks<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.520> silent<00:01:33.000> assassin<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.689> want

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
loving about it is that the flares are

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.490 
loving about it is that the flares are
finally<00:01:47.610> seeing<00:01:48.149> some<00:01:48.750> tactical<00:01:49.290> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
finally seeing some tactical and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.280 
finally seeing some tactical and
practical<00:01:50.250> value<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:51.420> guys<00:01:51.630> know<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.869> this

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
practical value you guys know that this

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.310 
practical value you guys know that this
grenade<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:53.460> pretty<00:01:53.909> much<00:01:54.119> useless<00:01:54.540> some<00:01:55.140> may

a lot of smoke and they're using a the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
and get some free kills this can be one

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.240 
and get some free kills this can be one
way<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.930> counter<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.560> they'll<00:02:07.950> be<00:02:08.099> greeted

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
time at the aim-down-sight but let's be

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.500 
time at the aim-down-sight but let's be
honest<00:02:12.599> other<00:02:12.780> than<00:02:12.989> those<00:02:13.080> two

honest other than those two

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.270 
honest other than those two
it's<00:02:13.780> pretty<00:02:14.170> much<00:02:14.379> just<00:02:14.440> something<00:02:14.980> fun<00:02:15.159> to

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
little frustrating though and I know

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.150 
little frustrating though and I know
that<00:02:49.959> dice<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.200> aware<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.829> it<00:02:50.950> they're<00:02:51.099> gonna

that dice is aware of it they're gonna

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.349 
that dice is aware of it they're gonna
be<00:02:51.340> trying<00:02:51.579> to<00:02:51.700> address<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.150> in<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.329> future

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
be trying to address it in a future

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.319 
be trying to address it in a future
update<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.799> that<00:02:54.400> spotting<00:02:55.090> is<00:02:55.299> a

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
update and that is that spotting is a

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.630 
update and that is that spotting is a
little<00:02:55.780> bit<00:02:55.900> too<00:02:56.079> powerful<00:02:56.709> we<00:02:57.280> are<00:02:57.310> playing

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
little bit too powerful we are playing

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.160 
little bit too powerful we are playing
on<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.819> classic<00:02:58.299> rule<00:02:58.480> set<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.019> there

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
on the classic rule set and so there

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.869 
on the classic rule set and so there
isn't<00:02:59.290> any<00:02:59.440> 3d<00:02:59.890> spotting<00:03:00.069> which<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.489> good<00:03:00.700> if

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
isn't any 3d spotting which is good if

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.250 
isn't any 3d spotting which is good if
there<00:03:01.060> was<00:03:01.209> 3d<00:03:01.510> spotting<00:03:01.690> it<00:03:01.930> would<00:03:02.019> just<00:03:02.170> be

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
there was 3d spotting it would just be

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.830 
there was 3d spotting it would just be
flat-out<00:03:02.560> busted<00:03:03.160> but<00:03:03.790> because<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.510> enemy

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
flat-out busted but because the enemy

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.420 
flat-out busted but because the enemy
can<00:03:05.049> just<00:03:05.200> use<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.650> information<00:03:05.890> on<00:03:06.280> their

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
can just use the information on their

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.039 
can just use the information on their
mini-map<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:06.940> mean<00:03:07.090> your<00:03:07.329> icon<00:03:07.629> is<00:03:07.780> still<00:03:07.870> gonna

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
mini-map I mean your icon is still gonna

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.930 
mini-map I mean your icon is still gonna
show<00:03:08.260> up<00:03:08.379> there<00:03:08.620> there<00:03:09.310> are<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.430> lot<00:03:09.609> of<00:03:09.640> times

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
show up there there are a lot of times

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.819 
show up there there are a lot of times
where<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.269> was<00:03:10.450> trying<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.959> be<00:03:11.079> stealthy<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.560> was

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
where I was trying to be stealthy I was

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.380 
where I was trying to be stealthy I was
trying<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.400> use<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.760> shadows<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.150> my

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
trying to use the shadows to my

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.210 
trying to use the shadows to my
advantage<00:03:13.750> but<00:03:14.410> little<00:03:14.650> did<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:14.829> know<00:03:14.859> I<00:03:15.040> was

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
advantage but little did I know I was

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.069 
advantage but little did I know I was
spotted<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.790> entire<00:03:16.090> time<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:16.750> as<00:03:16.870> soon

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
spotted the entire time and so as soon

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.839 
spotted the entire time and so as soon
as<00:03:17.260> I<00:03:17.379> was<00:03:17.470> getting<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.859> awesome<00:03:18.280> flank<00:03:18.609> up

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
as I was getting that awesome flank up

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.270 
as I was getting that awesome flank up
the<00:03:19.239> enemy<00:03:19.540> knew<00:03:19.690> my<00:03:19.810> exact<00:03:20.169> location<00:03:20.829> and<00:03:21.040> was

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
the enemy knew my exact location and was

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.740 
the enemy knew my exact location and was
able<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.579> take<00:03:21.700> me<00:03:21.819> out<00:03:21.970> very<00:03:22.000> very<00:03:22.450> quickly

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
able to take me out very very quickly

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.770 
able to take me out very very quickly
I'm<00:03:23.380> not<00:03:23.709> exactly<00:03:23.980> sure<00:03:24.310> how<00:03:24.340> dice<00:03:25.209> is<00:03:25.510> gonna

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
I'm not exactly sure how dice is gonna

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.990 
I'm not exactly sure how dice is gonna
be<00:03:25.930> able<00:03:26.049> to<00:03:26.230> address<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:27.040> spotting<00:03:27.489> issue<00:03:27.639> I

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
be able to address the spotting issue I

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.069 
be able to address the spotting issue I
thought<00:03:28.389> that<00:03:28.510> maybe<00:03:28.690> they<00:03:28.900> could<00:03:29.049> just

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
thought that maybe they could just

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.319 
thought that maybe they could just
flat-out<00:03:29.470> remove<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.220> from<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.790> map<00:03:31.060> that

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
flat-out remove it from that map that

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.849 
flat-out remove it from that map that
could<00:03:31.450> be<00:03:31.540> one<00:03:31.780> way<00:03:31.959> of<00:03:32.109> going<00:03:32.260> about<00:03:32.470> it

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
could be one way of going about it

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.379 
could be one way of going about it
but<00:03:33.130> then<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:33.370> eliminate<00:03:33.639> the<00:03:34.000> teamwork

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
but then you eliminate the teamwork

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.780 
but then you eliminate the teamwork
aspect<00:03:34.840> there<00:03:35.470> if<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.709> see<00:03:35.950> an<00:03:36.069> enemy<00:03:36.190> off<00:03:36.549> in

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
aspect there if you see an enemy off in

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.879 
aspect there if you see an enemy off in
the<00:03:36.849> distance<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.239> spot<00:03:37.569> them<00:03:37.750> why<00:03:38.440> shouldn't

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
the distance you spot them why shouldn't

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.379 
the distance you spot them why shouldn't
your<00:03:39.010> team<00:03:39.280> have<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:39.669> that<00:03:39.880> slight<00:03:40.209> advantage

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
your team have it that slight advantage

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.390 
your team have it that slight advantage
on<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:41.049> enemy<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.769> other<00:03:41.919> thing<00:03:42.130> I<00:03:42.250> thought

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
on that enemy the other thing I thought

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.430 
on that enemy the other thing I thought
of<00:03:42.459> is<00:03:42.819> well<00:03:43.150> make<00:03:43.450> make<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:44.109> that<00:03:44.139> you<00:03:44.410> have

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
of is well make make it so that you have

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.530 
of is well make make it so that you have
to<00:03:44.769> spot<00:03:45.040> while<00:03:45.400> aiming<00:03:45.700> down<00:03:45.970> sight<00:03:46.329> if

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
to spot while aiming down sight if

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.360 
to spot while aiming down sight if
you're<00:03:46.840> just<00:03:46.959> running<00:03:47.139> forward<00:03:47.680> then<00:03:48.160> they

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
you're just running forward then they

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.440 
you're just running forward then they
won't<00:03:48.549> have<00:03:48.760> that<00:03:48.790> capability

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
won't have that capability

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.819 
won't have that capability
that<00:03:49.870> could<00:03:50.079> be<00:03:50.169> another<00:03:50.380> way<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.620> they

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
that could be another way that they

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.559 
that could be another way that they
could<00:03:50.980> tackle<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.430> but<00:03:51.760> whatever<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.150> case<00:03:52.359> if

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
could tackle it but whatever the case if

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:53.940 
could tackle it but whatever the case if
they're<00:03:52.750> able<00:03:53.049> just<00:03:53.169> to<00:03:53.349> make<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.650> so<00:03:53.799> that

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
they're able just to make it so that

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.949 
they're able just to make it so that
it's<00:03:54.069> not<00:03:54.250> as<00:03:54.519> powerful<00:03:54.880> as<00:03:55.239> it<00:03:55.269> is<00:03:55.480> right<00:03:55.750> now

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
it's not as powerful as it is right now

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.990 
it's not as powerful as it is right now
it<00:03:56.349> will<00:03:56.530> be<00:03:56.709> a<00:03:56.739> great<00:03:57.280> step<00:03:57.579> in<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:57.849> right

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
it will be a great step in the right

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.479 
it will be a great step in the right
direction<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:59.260> then<00:03:59.379> my<00:03:59.500> last<00:03:59.620> criticism<00:04:00.340> is

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
direction and then my last criticism is

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.940 
direction and then my last criticism is
that<00:04:00.669> I<00:04:00.700> still<00:04:01.060> feel<00:04:01.540> like<00:04:01.870> they<00:04:02.590> can<00:04:02.769> go

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
that I still feel like they can go

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.400 
that I still feel like they can go
darker<00:04:03.459> granted<00:04:04.299> this<00:04:04.389> is<00:04:04.569> much<00:04:05.019> better<00:04:05.230> than

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
darker granted this is much better than

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.839 
darker granted this is much better than
what<00:04:05.560> we've<00:04:05.680> gotten<00:04:05.889> in<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.040> past<00:04:06.069> this<00:04:06.579> is

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
what we've gotten in the past this is

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.879 
what we've gotten in the past this is
the<00:04:07.209> best<00:04:07.540> night<00:04:07.840> combat<00:04:08.410> map<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.799> we've

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
the best night combat map that we've

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.110 
the best night combat map that we've
ever<00:04:09.129> gotten<00:04:09.370> in<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.639> Battlefield<00:04:10.030> franchise

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
ever gotten in the Battlefield franchise

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.119 
ever gotten in the Battlefield franchise
but<00:04:11.079> there<00:04:11.230> are<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.319> lot<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:11.530> times<00:04:11.769> and<00:04:12.010> I<00:04:12.040> was

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
but there are a lot of times and I was

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:13.979 
but there are a lot of times and I was
noticing<00:04:12.519> that<00:04:12.609> in<00:04:12.790> chat<00:04:13.030> many<00:04:13.540> people<00:04:13.840> were

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
noticing that in chat many people were

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.020 
noticing that in chat many people were
agreeing<00:04:14.530> that<00:04:15.010> they<00:04:15.250> could<00:04:15.489> go<00:04:15.609> darker

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
agreeing that they could go darker

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.339 
agreeing that they could go darker
because<00:04:16.239> there<00:04:16.539> still<00:04:16.810> wasn't<00:04:17.109> enough

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
because there still wasn't enough

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.469 
because there still wasn't enough
incentive<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.549> use<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:19.060> infrared

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
incentive to use the infrared

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.240 
incentive to use the infrared
night-vision<00:04:19.690> scope<00:04:20.199> or<00:04:20.349> to<00:04:20.500> use<00:04:20.799> the

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
night-vision scope or to use the

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.279 
night-vision scope or to use the
flashlight<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.150> flares<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:22.810> while<00:04:23.169> they

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
flashlight and the flares and while they

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.720 
flashlight and the flares and while they
can<00:04:23.590> give<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:23.919> a<00:04:23.950> slight

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
can give you a slight

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.030 
can give you a slight
in<00:04:25.000> some<00:04:25.270> situations<00:04:25.450> most<00:04:26.440> people<00:04:26.740> were<00:04:26.830> just

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
in some situations most people were just

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.440 
in some situations most people were just
running<00:04:27.250> around<00:04:27.310> with<00:04:27.550> their<00:04:27.730> normal<00:04:28.210> load

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
running around with their normal load

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.150 
running around with their normal load
outs<00:04:28.660> because<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.140> was<00:04:29.260> just<00:04:29.470> performing<00:04:29.740> just

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
outs because it was just performing just

also going to have to use that in tandem
with<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:04.090> flashlight<00:05:04.780> to<00:05:04.960> be<00:05:05.080> able<00:05:05.350> to

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
with the flashlight to be able to

weaknesses into the equation and

depending on which loadout you decide on
you're<00:05:13.930> gonna<00:05:14.020> have<00:05:14.290> to<00:05:14.410> work<00:05:14.560> around<00:05:14.920> them

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
you're gonna have to work around them

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.670 
you're gonna have to work around them
for<00:05:15.610> example<00:05:16.030> if<00:05:16.180> you<00:05:16.270> decide<00:05:16.600> to<00:05:16.750> use<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.380> IR

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
for example if you decide to use the IR

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
sight you're gonna be able to have that

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.130 
sight you're gonna be able to have that
crystal-clear<00:05:21.850> view<00:05:22.210> of<00:05:22.450> all<00:05:22.630> of<00:05:22.660> the<00:05:22.930> action

but as soon as a light source comes into
play<00:05:25.750> things<00:05:26.500> become<00:05:27.070> a<00:05:27.100> little<00:05:27.370> bit<00:05:27.580> more

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
play things become a little bit more

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.730 
play things become a little bit more

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
then gonna have to work around is that

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.580 
then gonna have to work around is that
if<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.150> enemy<00:05:52.510> is<00:05:52.540> even<00:05:52.930> looking<00:05:53.350> in<00:05:53.470> your

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
general location they're gonna be able

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.020 
general location they're gonna be able
to<00:05:55.780> see<00:05:55.990> that<00:05:56.380> that<00:05:56.800> flashlight<00:05:57.160> bobbing<00:05:57.910> up

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
to see that that flashlight bobbing up

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.610 
to see that that flashlight bobbing up
and<00:05:58.180> down<00:05:58.420> you're<00:05:58.630> gonna<00:05:58.750> be<00:05:58.900> this<00:05:59.050> great

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
and down you're gonna be this great

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
white beacon out in the distance and

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.820 
white beacon out in the distance and
they're<00:06:01.630> gonna<00:06:01.720> be<00:06:01.870> able<00:06:01.960> to<00:06:02.110> take<00:06:02.260> you<00:06:02.380> out<00:06:02.530> no

problem<00:06:03.130> it's<00:06:04.030> that<00:06:04.330> dynamic<00:06:04.600> that<00:06:04.960> I<00:06:05.200> love

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
problem it's that dynamic that I love

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.470 
problem it's that dynamic that I love
because<00:06:05.740> it<00:06:06.010> really<00:06:06.310> forces<00:06:06.520> players<00:06:07.000> to

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
because it really forces players to

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.390 
because it really forces players to
think<00:06:07.750> about<00:06:07.960> combat<00:06:08.440> differently<00:06:08.950> and<00:06:09.160> adds

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
think about combat differently and adds

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.280 
think about combat differently and adds
in<00:06:09.850> a<00:06:09.970> different<00:06:10.300> layer<00:06:10.510> of<00:06:10.540> strengths<00:06:11.140> and

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
in a different layer of strengths and

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.750 
in a different layer of strengths and
weaknesses<00:06:11.770> that<00:06:12.130> we<00:06:12.250> really<00:06:12.550> never

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
weaknesses that we really never

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.090 
weaknesses that we really never
experienced<00:06:13.390> in<00:06:13.540> normal<00:06:13.870> battlefield<00:06:14.380> but

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
experienced in normal battlefield but

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.640 
experienced in normal battlefield but
overall<00:06:15.580> I<00:06:15.790> am<00:06:16.060> really<00:06:16.510> impressed<00:06:16.870> by<00:06:17.440> what
