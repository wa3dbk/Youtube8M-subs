00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 This is a great year for Golden Boy Promotions. Party after the event. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 It's true, we have our hands full. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 Danny Jacobs is the star of the evening at this gala. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 This is the beginning of our cooperation with FOX Sports 1. I am very happy that we are starting with a gala where a wonderful boy like Daniel Jacobs will perform. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 It's amazing, considering the fact that this boy passed in his life. Something beautiful. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 The fact that this boy can fight is really a bonus. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 It's only a bonus, because he has already won the most important fight. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 He is already a winner. Now he wants to be the world champion yet, and this is another step. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.500
 How often will such galas take place? Every Monday? 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Virtually every Monday. We'll make almost 30 such gal this year. We have a long-term contract. Golden Boy Live returns every Monday. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 The fight against Floyd Mayweather with Saul "Canelo" Alvarez is coming ... 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 In my opinion, it will be a very difficult fight for each of them. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 It will be interesting, because Floyd will face a young wolf, and such as "Canelo" has not yet fought. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 He does not know this style, this hunger, that anger. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Floyd is Floyd, he is invincible, but his rival has never lost and is strong mentally. One thing is certain - Floyd can never be crossed out 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 A young player with such a record makes an impression. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 The next fight at this gala is Danny Garcia vs Lucas Matthysse. The Golden Boy group tried it. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 In fact, such a fight should have its own gala. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Matthysse-Garcia, we had to give it to one Mayweather-Canelo gala. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 We want fans to pay for PPV broadcasts, so it is our duty to give them a product worth the money. And we did it. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 I use the Time Warner package, where Showtime has disappeared. I think I will have to look around for something else.
