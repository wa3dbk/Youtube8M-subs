s5 active so i previously spoke with

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.850 
s5 active so i previously spoke with
about<00:00:16.570> the<00:00:16.750> smartphone<00:00:17.200> here<00:00:17.439> as<00:00:17.529> a<00:00:17.619> channel

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
about the smartphone here as a channel

before<00:00:18.099> and<00:00:18.700> now<00:00:18.790> we're<00:00:18.910> actually<00:00:19.000> getting

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
before and now we're actually getting

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.050 
before and now we're actually getting
some<00:00:19.630> leaked<00:00:20.590> press<00:00:20.950> shots<00:00:21.160> of<00:00:21.430> the<00:00:21.550> device<00:00:21.820> so

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
some leaked press shots of the device so

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.269 
some leaked press shots of the device so
you're<00:00:22.899> getting<00:00:22.989> a<00:00:23.169> sense<00:00:23.500> of<00:00:23.619> how<00:00:23.800> the<00:00:23.860> front

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
you're getting a sense of how the front

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.880 
you're getting a sense of how the front
and<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:24.939> back<00:00:24.970> looks<00:00:25.840> just<00:00:26.410> a<00:00:26.500> couple<00:00:26.680> days

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
and the back looks just a couple days

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.510 
and the back looks just a couple days
ago<00:00:26.919> we<00:00:27.880> actually<00:00:28.419> the<00:00:28.989> galaxy<00:00:29.559> s5<00:00:29.800> active<00:00:30.279> was

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
ago we actually the galaxy s5 active was

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.609 
ago we actually the galaxy s5 active was
leaked<00:00:30.790> in<00:00:31.029> terms<00:00:31.480> of<00:00:31.630> more<00:00:31.840> press<00:00:32.110> shots<00:00:32.349> and

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
leaked in terms of more press shots and

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.560 
leaked in terms of more press shots and
this<00:00:33.010> time<00:00:33.190> it's<00:00:33.340> actually<00:00:33.610> evleaks<00:00:34.210> that<00:00:34.480> are

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
this time it's actually evleaks that are

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.600 
this time it's actually evleaks that are
publishing<00:00:35.230> these<00:00:35.559> this<00:00:36.100> new<00:00:36.340> batch<00:00:36.579> of

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
publishing these this new batch of

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.910 
publishing these this new batch of
images<00:00:37.210> so<00:00:37.840> what<00:00:38.200> you'll<00:00:38.320> notice<00:00:38.470> about<00:00:38.680> the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
images so what you'll notice about the

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.740 
images so what you'll notice about the
design<00:00:39.220> is<00:00:39.430> it<00:00:39.550> looks<00:00:39.730> very<00:00:39.820> similar<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.390> last

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
design is it looks very similar to last

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.410 
design is it looks very similar to last
year<00:00:41.110> is<00:00:41.260> a<00:00:41.290> active<00:00:42.280> model<00:00:42.520> so<00:00:42.820> i<00:00:42.880> believe<00:00:43.150> it

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
year is a active model so i believe it

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.350 
year is a active model so i believe it
was<00:00:43.570> called<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.840> galaxy<00:00:44.230> s4<00:00:44.620> active<00:00:45.360> but

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
was called the galaxy s4 active but

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.930 
was called the galaxy s4 active but
Samsung<00:00:46.780> you'll<00:00:47.170> notice<00:00:47.560> that<00:00:47.710> in<00:00:48.400> comparison

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
Samsung you'll notice that in comparison

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.700 
Samsung you'll notice that in comparison
to<00:00:49.060> the<00:00:49.150> galaxy<00:00:49.510> s5<00:00:49.780> which<00:00:50.050> the<00:00:50.290> smartphone

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
to the galaxy s5 which the smartphone

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.790 
to the galaxy s5 which the smartphone
supposed<00:00:51.190> to<00:00:51.310> be<00:00:51.430> like<00:00:51.730> in<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.270> lineup<00:00:53.079> of<00:00:53.290> it

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
supposed to be like in the lineup of it

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.310 
supposed to be like in the lineup of it
the<00:00:54.100> fingerprint<00:00:54.550> reader<00:00:54.730> is<00:00:55.060> no<00:00:55.720> longer<00:00:55.990> here

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
the fingerprint reader is no longer here

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.990 
the fingerprint reader is no longer here
so<00:00:56.500> they<00:00:56.650> remove<00:00:56.920> that<00:00:57.100> for<00:00:57.310> the<00:00:57.400> galaxy<00:00:57.760> s5

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
so they remove that for the galaxy s5

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.790 
so they remove that for the galaxy s5
active<00:00:58.450> but<00:00:58.900> you<00:00:58.989> can<00:00:59.140> still<00:00:59.320> see<00:00:59.530> that<00:00:59.710> the

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
active but you can still see that the

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.590 
active but you can still see that the
heart<00:01:00.040> rate<00:01:00.220> monitor<00:01:00.280> is<00:01:00.850> still<00:01:01.120> sitting<00:01:01.360> next

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
heart rate monitor is still sitting next

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.930 
heart rate monitor is still sitting next
to<00:01:01.900> the<00:01:02.079> LED<00:01:02.890> flash<00:01:03.190> on<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:03.460> back<00:01:03.700> of<00:01:03.730> the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
to the LED flash on the back of the

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.940 
to the LED flash on the back of the
smartphone<00:01:04.269> so<00:01:04.899> that's<00:01:05.079> nice<00:01:05.259> to<00:01:05.470> see<00:01:05.710> that

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
smartphone so that's nice to see that

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.340 
smartphone so that's nice to see that
they<00:01:06.159> have<00:01:06.369> that<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.600> key<00:01:07.750> selling<00:01:07.960> point<00:01:08.259> of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
they have that the key selling point of

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.320 
they have that the key selling point of
the<00:01:08.470> smartphone<00:01:08.799> of<00:01:09.159> course<00:01:09.370> is<00:01:09.610> it's<00:01:09.940> going

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
the smartphone of course is it's going

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.830 
the smartphone of course is it's going
into<00:01:10.750> ruggedness<00:01:11.740> or<00:01:12.250> ruggedness<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:13.000> its

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
into ruggedness or ruggedness and its

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.300 
into ruggedness or ruggedness and its
ability<00:01:14.050> to<00:01:14.320> withstand<00:01:15.510> obviously<00:01:16.510> water<00:01:16.840> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
ability to withstand obviously water and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.100 
ability to withstand obviously water and
dust<00:01:18.310> sand<00:01:18.670> whatever<00:01:19.540> you<00:01:19.720> throw<00:01:19.900> at<00:01:20.050> it

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
dust sand whatever you throw at it

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.990 
dust sand whatever you throw at it
mostly<00:01:20.320> so<00:01:20.860> it's<00:01:21.370> going<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.580> be<00:01:21.700> a<00:01:21.729> really

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
mostly so it's going to be a really

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.260 
mostly so it's going to be a really
bulky<00:01:23.310> durable<00:01:24.310> smartphone<00:01:24.790> i<00:01:24.820> guess<00:01:25.090> i

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
bulky durable smartphone i guess i

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.350 
bulky durable smartphone i guess i
should<00:01:25.750> say<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:27.130> galaxy<00:01:27.490> s5<00:01:27.729> is<00:01:27.760> actually

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
should say the galaxy s5 is actually

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.920 
should say the galaxy s5 is actually
already<00:01:28.890> ip67<00:01:30.210> certified<00:01:31.210> against<00:01:31.750> both

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
already ip67 certified against both

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.870 
already ip67 certified against both
water<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:32.500> dust<00:01:33.070> so<00:01:33.430> it's<00:01:33.580> going<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:33.790> be

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
water and dust so it's going to be

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.789 
water and dust so it's going to be
interesting<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.600> see<00:01:34.780> exactly<00:01:35.020> what<00:01:35.650> the

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
interesting to see exactly what the

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.550 
interesting to see exactly what the
galaxy<00:01:36.130> s5<00:01:36.659> active<00:01:37.659> will<00:01:37.900> bring<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.409> table

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
galaxy s5 active will bring to the table

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.300 
galaxy s5 active will bring to the table
in<00:01:38.799> terms<00:01:38.830> of<00:01:39.479> certification<00:01:40.479> but<00:01:41.310> i'm

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
in terms of certification but i'm

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.010 
in terms of certification but i'm
assuming<00:01:42.909> that<00:01:43.240> it's<00:01:43.360> going<00:01:43.479> to<00:01:43.540> be<00:01:43.659> able<00:01:43.780> to

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
assuming that it's going to be able to

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.190 
assuming that it's going to be able to
be<00:01:44.190> submerged<00:01:45.190> in<00:01:45.520> deeper<00:01:46.000> water<00:01:46.240> for<00:01:46.810> longer

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
be submerged in deeper water for longer

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.070 
be submerged in deeper water for longer
periods<00:01:47.619> of<00:01:47.830> time<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:48.820> hopefully<00:01:49.479> it'll<00:01:49.960> be

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
periods of time and hopefully it'll be

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.500 
periods of time and hopefully it'll be
able<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.350> survive<00:01:50.670> larger<00:01:51.670> drops<00:01:52.060> than<00:01:52.390> the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
able to survive larger drops than the

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.950 
able to survive larger drops than the
galaxy<00:01:52.900> s5<00:01:53.200> can<00:01:53.820> only<00:01:54.820> well<00:01:55.299> i'm<00:01:55.689> assuming

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
galaxy s5 can only well i'm assuming

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.750

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
Snapdragon 801 processor so it's not the
