off the end on both cartridges and then
a<00:01:54.950> good<00:01:55.950> habit<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:57.360> write<00:01:57.600> down<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.560> maybe

and then you'll see a material with a
small<00:02:21.660> little<00:02:21.930> tape<00:02:22.170> at<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.530> end<00:02:22.710> here<00:02:23.010> you

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
small little tape at the end here you

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.610 
small little tape at the end here you
want<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:25.850> roll<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:27.030> wheel<00:02:27.330> out<00:02:27.600> slightly<00:02:28.110> and

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
want to roll this wheel out slightly and

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.560 
want to roll this wheel out slightly and
that<00:02:29.430> will<00:02:30.200> pull<00:02:31.200> material<00:02:31.560> out<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.360> just<00:02:33.360> cut

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
that will pull material out and just cut

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.780 
that will pull material out and just cut
that<00:02:33.720> end<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.230> just<00:02:34.370> leave<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.520> little

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
that end and just leave that little

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.030 
that end and just leave that little
segment<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:37.320> you're<00:02:37.440> going<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.620> do<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.860> same

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
segment and you're going to do the same

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.420 
segment and you're going to do the same
thing<00:02:38.340> with<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:39.080> support<00:02:40.080> material<00:02:40.590> so

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
thing with the support material so

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.050 
thing with the support material so
you're<00:02:41.580> going<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.760> remove<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.270> red<00:02:42.930> stopper

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
you're going to remove this red stopper

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.540 
you're going to remove this red stopper
and<00:02:45.060> rotate<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.690> little<00:02:45.959> wheel<00:02:46.140> out<00:02:46.680> then

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
and rotate that little wheel out then

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.550 
and rotate that little wheel out then
you'll<00:02:47.730> cut<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:48.090> little<00:02:48.390> end<00:02:48.630> same<00:02:49.230> thing

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
you'll cut that little end same thing

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.060 
you'll cut that little end same thing
and<00:02:49.800> those<00:02:50.580> are<00:02:50.790> ready<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.060> load<00:02:51.330> in<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:52.080> and

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
and those are ready to load in the and

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.320 
and those are ready to load in the and
the<00:02:53.160> device<00:02:53.510> take<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.660> cartridges<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:56.330> first

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
have the support material on the label

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.270 
have the support material on the label
and<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:03.180> color<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.690> material<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.350> then

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
and the color of the material and then

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.940 
and the color of the material and then
here<00:03:05.520> on<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.910> on<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:07.050> device<00:03:07.320> you'll<00:03:07.650> see<00:03:07.830> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
here on the on the device you'll see the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.040 
here on the on the device you'll see the
ass<00:03:08.130> for<00:03:08.670> support<00:03:09.150> you're<00:03:09.720> going<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.900> lay<00:03:10.020> that

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
ass for support you're going to lay that

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.970 
ass for support you're going to lay that
in<00:03:10.770> there<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.959> then<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.230> model<00:03:13.530> material<00:03:13.920> of

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
in there and then the model material of

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.830 
in there and then the model material of
course<00:03:14.130> is<00:03:14.340> white<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.850> then<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.330> course<00:03:15.390> it'll

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
course is white and then of course it'll

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.310 
course is white and then of course it'll
say<00:03:16.049> model<00:03:16.410> on<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.730> label<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.870> you'll<00:03:19.110> put

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
say model on the label and you'll put

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.910 
say model on the label and you'll put
that<00:03:19.470> in<00:03:19.680> there<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:21.120> we<00:03:21.239> waited<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.989> little<00:03:22.769> bit

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
that in there so we waited a little bit

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.170 
that in there so we waited a little bit
you're<00:03:23.489> going<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.700> hit<00:03:23.880> retry<00:03:24.750> or<00:03:25.019> just<00:03:25.970> if<00:03:26.970> it

you're going to hit retry or just if it

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.789 
you're going to hit retry or just if it

hit load the printhead will move forward
and<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.260> can<00:03:43.739> hear<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.790> material<00:03:45.420> being

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
and you can hear the material being

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.310 
and you can hear the material being
pulled<00:03:46.440> into<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.950> into<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.970> head<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.390> then

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
pulled into this into the head and then

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.350 
pulled into this into the head and then
the<00:03:49.350> head<00:03:49.470> will<00:03:49.739> go<00:03:49.890> back<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:51.120> its<00:03:51.269> home

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
the head will go back to its home

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.910 
the head will go back to its home
position<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:53.880> very<00:03:54.510> important<00:03:54.989> step<00:03:55.620> is<00:03:55.890> to

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
position and a very important step is to

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.520 
position and a very important step is to
see<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.400> purge<00:03:56.670> you<00:03:56.910> actually<00:03:57.500> visually<00:03:58.500> see
