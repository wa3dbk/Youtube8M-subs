it right before I did this so this is

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.710 
it right before I did this so this is
how<00:02:07.780> much<00:02:07.960> we're<00:02:08.920> getting<00:02:09.010> for<00:02:09.640> smithing<00:02:10.030> you

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
how much we're getting for smithing you

take that the next one the stand
dismantle<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:15.310> get<00:02:15.430> these<00:02:15.550> broken<00:02:15.790> pipes

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
dismantle it you get these broken pipes

and<00:02:25.990> this<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.470> much<00:02:26.620> cheaper<00:02:26.860> than<00:02:27.010> ceremonial

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
and this is much cheaper than ceremonial

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
a hammer and I think it's pretty awesome

a hammer and I think it's pretty awesome
so<00:03:00.000> that's<00:03:00.810> done<00:03:01.079> attached<00:03:02.030> there<00:03:03.030> we<00:03:03.120> go<00:03:03.239> and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
so that's done attached there we go and

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.170 
so that's done attached there we go and
furnace<00:03:04.650> we're<00:03:04.769> almost<00:03:04.890> done<00:03:05.129> already<00:03:05.280> now<00:03:05.970> it

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
furnace we're almost done already now it

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.690 
furnace we're almost done already now it
takes<00:03:06.329> about<00:03:06.950> three<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:07.980> four<00:03:08.220> cannons

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
takes about three to four cannons

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.649 
takes about three to four cannons
roughly<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:10.470> get<00:03:10.730> 1%<00:03:11.730> respect<00:03:12.329> which<00:03:12.510> is

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
roughly to get 1% respect which is

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.569 
roughly to get 1% respect which is
actually<00:03:13.049> pretty<00:03:13.349> quick<00:03:13.650> considering<00:03:14.400> how

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
actually pretty quick considering how

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.460 
actually pretty quick considering how
fast<00:03:14.760> like<00:03:15.120> railroads<00:03:15.569> it'll<00:03:16.170> take<00:03:16.319> forever

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
fast like railroads it'll take forever

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.789 
fast like railroads it'll take forever
to<00:03:16.680> get<00:03:16.739> respect<00:03:17.069> so<00:03:17.700> remove<00:03:18.060> parts<00:03:18.530> use<00:03:19.530> this

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
to get respect so remove parts use this

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.910

there we go it's spinning its spinning
it<00:04:16.160> can<00:04:16.280> mess<00:04:16.430> up<00:04:16.459> a<00:04:16.730> few<00:04:16.910> times<00:04:17.030> too<00:04:17.330> so

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
it can mess up a few times too so

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.380 
it can mess up a few times too so
there's<00:04:17.989> our<00:04:18.110> extra<00:04:18.380> experience

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
there's our extra experience

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.630 
there's our extra experience
we<00:04:20.390> got<00:04:20.540> three<00:04:20.690> point<00:04:20.900> eight<00:04:21.049> for<00:04:21.980> that<00:04:22.130> so

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
we got three point eight for that so

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.220 
we got three point eight for that so
it's<00:04:23.180> pretty<00:04:23.390> good<00:04:23.890> so<00:04:24.890> that<00:04:25.280> took<00:04:25.430> roughly

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
it's pretty good so that took roughly

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.660 
it's pretty good so that took roughly
three<00:04:27.230> minutes<00:04:27.380> or<00:04:27.680> so<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:28.010> didn't<00:04:28.250> time<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.430> I

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
three minutes or so I didn't time it I

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.940 
three minutes or so I didn't time it I
meant<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:28.940> time<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:29.270> but<00:04:29.450> normally<00:04:30.320> my<00:04:30.650> average

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
meant to time it but normally my average

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.380 
meant to time it but normally my average
is<00:04:31.100> about<00:04:31.280> three<00:04:31.550> minute<00:04:31.790> per<00:04:31.910> cannon

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
is about three minute per cannon

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.770 
is about three minute per cannon
you'll<00:04:32.930> start<00:04:33.200> slow<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:33.470> you'll<00:04:33.680> get<00:04:33.800> better

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
you'll start slow and you'll get better

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.030 
you'll start slow and you'll get better

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
you get 3.8 K experience in about three

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.110 
you get 3.8 K experience in about three
minutes<00:06:19.830> pretty<00:06:20.220> good<00:06:20.430> experience<00:06:20.910> right<00:06:21.090> a

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
minutes pretty good experience right a

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.640 
minutes pretty good experience right a
little<00:06:21.479> bit<00:06:21.600> expensive<00:06:22.080> now<00:06:22.199> because<00:06:22.530> the

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
little bit expensive now because the

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.650 
little bit expensive now because the
ores<00:06:22.830> are<00:06:23.010> just<00:06:23.190> through<00:06:23.460> the<00:06:23.550> roof<00:06:23.729> but

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
ores are just through the roof but

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.360 
ores are just through the roof but
eventually<00:06:25.260> they're<00:06:25.680> not<00:06:25.830> going<00:06:25.979> to<00:06:26.070> be<00:06:26.160> so

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
eventually they're not going to be so

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.600 
eventually they're not going to be so
high<00:06:27.260> so<00:06:28.260> it<00:06:28.620> could<00:06:28.830> be<00:06:28.949> a<00:06:28.979> pretty<00:06:29.220> cheap<00:06:29.400> way

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
high so it could be a pretty cheap way

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.409 
high so it could be a pretty cheap way
to<00:06:29.639> get<00:06:29.940> about<00:06:30.180> 65<00:06:31.020> K<00:06:31.289> or<00:06:31.740> so<00:06:32.240> experience<00:06:33.240> per

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
to get about 65 K or so experience per

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:33.740 
to get about 65 K or so experience per
hour

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
hour

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.080 
hour
I'm<00:06:33.990> sure<00:06:34.139> faster<00:06:34.620> ways<00:06:34.770> will<00:06:35.250> be<00:06:35.610> found<00:06:35.880> but

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
I'm sure faster ways will be found but

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.089 
I'm sure faster ways will be found but
you<00:06:36.630> get<00:06:36.780> respect<00:06:36.930> for<00:06:37.500> a<00:06:37.530> pretty<00:06:37.710> quick<00:06:37.889> and

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099 
you get respect for a pretty quick and

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:42.439 
you get respect for a pretty quick and
pretty<00:06:38.400> cheap<00:06:38.669> so<00:06:40.669> that's<00:06:41.669> really<00:06:41.940> about<00:06:42.150> it

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:42.449 
pretty cheap so that's really about it

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.540 
pretty cheap so that's really about it
you<00:06:43.139> know<00:06:43.380> I<00:06:43.410> just<00:06:43.440> wanted<00:06:43.830> to<00:06:43.979> review<00:06:44.250> making

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
you know I just wanted to review making

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.270 
you know I just wanted to review making
the<00:06:44.610> cannons<00:06:45.680> railroads<00:06:46.680> are<00:06:46.979> pretty

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
the cannons railroads are pretty

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.400 
the cannons railroads are pretty
explanatory<00:06:47.669> I<00:06:48.240> might<00:06:48.660> make<00:06:48.840> a<00:06:48.870> guide<00:06:49.110> on<00:06:49.139> that

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.410 
explanatory I might make a guide on that

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.589 
explanatory I might make a guide on that
later<00:06:49.620> I'm<00:06:49.860> not<00:06:50.039> sure<00:06:50.310> and<00:06:50.639> same<00:06:51.389> thing<00:06:51.419> with

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 
later I'm not sure and same thing with

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.629 
later I'm not sure and same thing with
swords<00:06:51.990> and<00:06:52.229> burial<00:06:52.770> armor<00:06:53.070> but<00:06:53.370> for<00:06:53.580> right

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 
swords and burial armor but for right

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.250 
swords and burial armor but for right
now<00:06:53.699> this<00:06:54.030> is<00:06:54.210> the<00:06:54.360> fastest<00:06:54.810> way<00:06:54.930> that<00:06:55.110> I<00:06:55.139> know

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.260 
now this is the fastest way that I know

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.860 
now this is the fastest way that I know
that<00:06:55.380> doesn't<00:06:56.220> cost<00:06:56.430> a<00:06:56.669> lot<00:06:56.699> of<00:06:56.970> money<00:06:57.180> so

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
that doesn't cost a lot of money so

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.900 
that doesn't cost a lot of money so
thanks<00:06:58.289> for<00:06:58.380> watching<00:06:58.440> and<00:06:59.039> check<00:06:59.130> out<00:06:59.760> my
