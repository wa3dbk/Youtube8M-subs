tourniquet<00:00:56.899> can<00:00:57.020> I<00:00:57.649> think<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:58.250> know

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.390 

we're<00:01:03.140> not<00:01:03.380> afraid<00:01:03.650> to<00:01:03.860> like<00:01:04.010> for<00:01:04.190> an<00:01:04.280> athlete

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
we're not afraid to like for an athlete

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.899 
we're not afraid to like for an athlete
time

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
time

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.100 
time
it's<00:01:06.210> kyle

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
it's kyle

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.350 
it's kyle
so<00:01:08.700> retarded<00:01:09.700> come<00:01:10.180> to<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.420> seven

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:25.000 

so<00:01:14.690> obviously

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.780 

in<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.100> last<00:01:26.310> two<00:01:26.490> miles

half<00:03:29.000> its<00:03:29.900> kind<00:03:30.080> of<00:03:30.110> spring

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.210 

turn<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.900> block<00:03:34.110> with<00:03:34.319> that<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:35.220> see

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.750 

how<00:03:40.220> well<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.670> training<00:03:41.150> went<00:03:41.330> for<00:03:42.260> that<00:03:42.349> bill

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
how well the training went for that bill

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.340 
how well the training went for that bill
then<00:03:43.760> we<00:03:43.879> were<00:03:44.030> confident<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:44.569> if<00:03:44.750> you

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
then we were confident that if you

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.870 
then we were confident that if you
what<00:03:46.920> do<00:03:47.010> you<00:03:47.040> think<00:03:47.100> getting<00:03:47.310> into<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.700> race

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
what do you think getting into that race

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.150 
what do you think getting into that race
and<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.570> think<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.440> guys<00:03:49.560> kind<00:03:49.710> of<00:03:49.830> paddy<00:03:49.980> can

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
and I think you guys kind of paddy can

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.010 
and I think you guys kind of paddy can
maybe<00:03:50.340> get<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:50.640> American<00:03:50.940> record<00:03:51.060> good<00:03:51.360> yeah

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
maybe get the American record good yeah

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.550 
maybe get the American record good yeah
I<00:03:52.380> thought<00:03:53.840> obviously<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.110> best<00:03:55.350> case

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
I thought obviously the best case

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.820 
I thought obviously the best case

York<00:05:05.699> City<00:05:05.880> Marathon<00:05:06.150> all-time<00:05:06.720> records<00:05:07.080> 2<00:05:07.229> of

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:07.319 
York City Marathon all-time records 2 of

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:11.689 
York City Marathon all-time records 2 of
7<00:05:07.500> 45<00:05:08.090> you<00:05:09.090> gotta<00:05:09.270> figure<00:05:10.069> you<00:05:11.069> know<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.550> two

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
7 45 you gotta figure you know the two

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.210 
7 45 you gotta figure you know the two
events<00:05:11.970> did<00:05:12.240> worth<00:05:12.750> that<00:05:12.960> at<00:05:13.080> least<00:05:13.259> yeah<00:05:13.949> you

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
events did worth that at least yeah you

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.010 
events did worth that at least yeah you
know<00:05:14.340> it's<00:05:14.849> hard<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.030> compare<00:05:15.360> yeah<00:05:15.660> when<00:05:15.900> we

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
know it's hard to compare yeah when we

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.909 
know it's hard to compare yeah when we
saw<00:05:16.229> whales<00:05:16.560> time<00:05:17.240> no<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:19.110> race<00:05:19.380> the<00:05:19.530> next<00:05:19.800> day

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
saw whales time no the race the next day

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.559 
saw whales time no the race the next day
I<00:05:20.250> think<00:05:20.910> Ryan<00:05:21.599> would<00:05:21.720> have<00:05:21.870> dumped<00:05:22.050> it<00:05:22.169> along

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:23.569 
I think Ryan would have dumped it along

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:25.689 
I think Ryan would have dumped it along
I<00:05:23.629> think<00:05:24.259> the<00:05:24.349> difference<00:05:24.559> with<00:05:24.949> some<00:05:25.610> of

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 
I think the difference with some of

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:27.050 
I think the difference with some of
these<00:05:25.759> course<00:05:26.089> records

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
these course records

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.060 
these course records
it's<00:05:27.510> just<00:05:27.750> how<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:27.930> tactics<00:05:28.500> play<00:05:28.710> out<00:05:28.830> with

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
it's just how the tactics play out with

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.350 
it's just how the tactics play out with
we<00:05:29.400> have<00:05:29.610> them

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.830 

ruin<00:05:33.169> so<00:05:33.349> many<00:05:33.409> good<00:05:33.740> guys<00:05:34.419> patient<00:05:35.419> go<00:05:35.509> fast

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840

I<00:05:41.229> think<00:05:42.229> that<00:05:42.349> was<00:05:42.469> one<00:05:42.620> of<00:05:42.650> the<00:05:42.710> things<00:05:42.860> that

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
I think that was one of the things that

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.790 
I think that was one of the things that
allow<00:05:43.189> trying<00:05:43.520> back<00:05:44.060> injury<00:05:44.509> /<00:05:44.659> you<00:05:45.650> know

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
starting in the second bag so it should

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.420 
starting in the second bag so it should

smart analysis
we've<00:06:49.880> heard<00:06:50.060> a<00:06:50.900> long<00:06:51.410> time<00:06:53.260> so<00:06:54.340> it<00:06:55.340> was

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
we've heard a long time so it was

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.500 
we've heard a long time so it was
actually<00:06:55.730> probably<00:06:55.880> good<00:06:56.120> that<00:06:56.150> we<00:06:56.360> heard

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
actually probably good that we heard

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:02.740 
actually probably good that we heard
because<00:06:56.780> it's<00:06:56.960> been<00:06:57.140> simply<00:06:57.500> just<00:06:57.650> provide

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
just it front pack experience so we're

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.810 
just it front pack experience so we're
not<00:07:06.240> going<00:07:06.510> concern

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:08.820 
not going concern

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.400 
not going concern
because<00:07:08.940> you've<00:07:09.420> seen<00:07:09.630> enough<00:07:09.780> marathons

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 
this Wendy maybe it's hot so throw that

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:24.580 
this Wendy maybe it's hot so throw that
out<00:07:23.229> there<00:07:23.529> is

out there is

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.130 
out there is
if<00:07:25.190> you<00:07:25.400> look<00:07:25.520> at<00:07:25.670> it<00:07:25.730> from<00:07:25.820> a<00:07:26.390> physiological

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:27.140 
if you look at it from a physiological

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.620 
if you look at it from a physiological
standpoint

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630 
standpoint

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.330

so you should be pretty comfortable you

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:38.690 
so you should be pretty comfortable you
know<00:07:36.169> from<00:07:36.529> that<00:07:36.560> feels

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:38.700 
know from that feels

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.070 
know from that feels
it's<00:07:39.210> like<00:07:39.360> you<00:07:39.450> talk<00:07:39.630> to<00:07:41.510> teams<00:07:42.510> never<00:07:42.690> ride

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 
it's like you talk to teams never ride

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.430 
it's like you talk to teams never ride
out<00:07:43.230> someone<00:07:44.160> over<00:07:44.460> he<00:07:45.030> did<00:07:45.240> hear<00:07:45.480> you<00:07:46.140> got<00:07:46.290> the

out someone over he did hear you got the

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.530 
out someone over he did hear you got the

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:54.910 
for a half maybe a foot I think just

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:59.040 
for a half maybe a foot I think just
