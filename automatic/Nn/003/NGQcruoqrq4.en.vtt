00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.640
When we first came to Egypt, we had some money

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.700
Then we ran out of money ..

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.700
and we felt that the rent of the house is expensive

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.740
we faced problems

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.500
I am "Om Refaat"(mother of Refaat)

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.000
I have a boy and a girl

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.080
We are 3 families here in the house, 14 persons.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.800
My name is "Om Leen"(mother of Leen)

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.200
I have 5 daughters

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.040
we are all in Alexandria

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.200
my husband was killed in "Al-Sham"(Damascus) inside his store

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.200
when I came here, my husband was just died

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.900
and I had some money from the beginning

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.000
And I sold some jewelry I had

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.000
then we found our situation is getting worse, so we decided to establish this project

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.500
"Set Al-Sham" food

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.000
We came up with the project`s idea when the five of us were walking in the street ...

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.900
"Om Bishr", "Om Mohamed", "Om Emad", "Om Refaat", "Om Leen"....

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and we found some Syrians begging at the door of a mosque

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.000
And we said that day that they better do a project than sitting there begging

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.000
so one of us suggested that we launch a project

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.820
we agreed and said it`s better than asking help from anyone

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.300
and our husbands can`t find work

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.000
The husband of "Om Emad" is not with her in Egypt...

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
"Om Leen"`s husband is dead...

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
"Om Refaat"`s husband has cardiac disease ...etc.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:38.360
We cook at home Syrian food and we distribute to restaurants and houses..etc. Whoever requests.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.700
The most requests are for "Kibba", "Taboula", and chicken

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.640
Me, "Om Refaat" and "Om Mohamed" are sisters in law

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
we`ve  met with "Om Emad" and "Om Bishr" here by coincidence

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.400
you know Syrians are friendly, so we quickly became friends

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.000
Then we decided to do the project

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.000
we are intending to teach Egyptian girls Syrian cooking

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.000
Me and some friends came to learn cooking, especially that we love Syrian food

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
we enjoyed the classes and the ladies are professionals

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.000
The ladies are perfect...

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.000
and I liked the idea of cultures exchange

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
beside the course and its advantages...

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
the gathering was wonderful.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The revenue of the project will be for families that we have met in the street...

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.900
who were begging for a packet of sugar or butter at the mosque`s door

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.500
this is our first goal

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.800
and the second goal is that we improve our lives too
