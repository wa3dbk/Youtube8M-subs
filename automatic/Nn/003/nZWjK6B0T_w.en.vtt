00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.960
 in the shoe story lost a number of 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.490
 ages the point of attention because of their 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.530
 three medium presumption and the shoe 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.790
 teacher retired on his part such 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.410
 numerous warnings from the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.120
 disappearance of the shoe he reaches the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.950
 conclusion that the city ​​will arrive 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.140
 where they live is like any city 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.849
 with great social contrasts 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.860
 economic, religious, political and other 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.810
 where people take these 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.270
 differences as normal and therefore 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.220
 they become indifferent and insensitive 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.770
 in situations like watching a child 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.870
 low stratum barefoot and begging 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.090
 or the inhabitants of the street as something 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.940
 normal in social reality however 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.550
 what happens when in a small city 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.260
 as an Armenian an 18-year-old girl walks 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.980
 without a shoe because it has not been passed 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.980
 continually 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.259
 in difference it feels greater some 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.210
 curious people are interested in the 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.770
 case and throwing a look seemingly 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.840
 indirect from top to bottom by the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.850
 what announcements but normal is that a 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.890
 girl with decent clothes or at least clean 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.319
 before a shoe dirty asphalt 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.580
 the excited cities feature 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.069
 that draws the attention of some 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.750
 people but one everyone's maybe with 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.519
 the age factor that makes 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.140
 people take a certain distance from what 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.970
 what is happening and prefer to look 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.769
 from the comfortable point of understanding 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.300
 responsibilities or consequences that the 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.630
 first with a certain level of 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.799
 rationale prejudices and other elements 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.730
 internalized by the passage of time 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.730
 Can cause 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.930
 social exclusion is not only a fact 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.330
 of indifference and insensibility or of 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.470
 a simplification in the problems 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.300
 It also involves an individual issue of 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.950
 góriz risks blind sick that leads to 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.599
 people to marginalize or discriminate 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.520
 so as not to disturb the comfort zone in 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.980
 which fortunately have the pleasure of 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.269
 money currently people do not 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.430
 want to be part of the solution of 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.349
 that is, they want to contribute for 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.420
 solve it because it would clearly be 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.489
 risk your communities for another the 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.950
 story people warn the father 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.799
 the lack of the shoe his son finish the 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.690
 relationship that there is in such a warning 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.310
 time because the next action if the the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.130
 the most important must take 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.020
 responsible had to get the shoe 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.670
 whereas if someone warns about 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.560
 the absence of millions of shoes 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.180
 poor children on the planet who will take 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.010
 the next action 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.570
 one of the real problems since 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.460
 few are willing to get the 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.380
 shoe in the moment or stability 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.910
 what others need 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.740
 would imply an extra cost in terms of 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.200
 more time or effort color 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.990
 then we prefer more to go noticing 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.150
 the shortcomings of others but filling the 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.460
 excess of ours taking the 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.500
 problematic as something normal and leaving 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.410
 everything as a matter of government state 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.630
 while something less the truth 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.770
 well attracting attention and impact us 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.770
 the in thoughts
