 make cd and dvd burning 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.370
 when one is in a point if it sells applications or I do not know I received two was 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.169
 different because accessory assets 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:15.809

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.490
 this is simpler here you go the missionary was here you are 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.409
 burned cd and dvd 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.939
 were much smaller than that which interfered with shekels event in that 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:27.650
 active 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.949
 multimedia 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.699
 disc recorded 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.580
 brasília 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.680
 if you click on it 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.530
 it will have that several options 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.170
 I think I have is what I 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.170
 aldo project 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.110
 they wanted to know something common 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.110
 we wanted to be sold from cd and dvd 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.100
 devine copy parades imagine who records images that cd 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.780
 see here and there gifts 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.280
 the show comparing the middle of the area to his appearance with my name 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.940
 Windows 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.870
 many the tumor feather but not proven that it is to record mubarak thing 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.440
 You do not have to cite it with appearance 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.440
 What matters is functionality is not that you do almost everything 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.980
 what do you do 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.370
 you need it bleeding are that most users like you need 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.370
 be here 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.370
 if you still think there are things you can not do 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.310
 in functions that can not do you come here central programs in a 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.980
 pocket 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.980
 and you can jam one too which is standard 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.480
 his name is 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.330
 it's sad to see 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.670
 tequila 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.970
 it is also a lawn as it is installed 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.720
 You're going to stay here. Ivan was normal. 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.210
 installed motta 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.730
 the people were naked 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.240
 3d cad 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.950
 after you're there he would have been here 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.570
 panting multimedia 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.030
 here three times 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.850
 it is a much better lawn 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.410
 advanced 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.940
 however for most of the functions you with Brazil or if we go 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.089
 quietly 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.089
 hence the first 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.779
 here are some tips to get you started 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:23.049
 so I do not choose first if the design is even 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.409
 siqueira 1 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.719
 the project 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.949
 the tonality design 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.759
 the flavour 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:34.759
 with Alzheimer's the coupé bug 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:38.399
 - if you want if the crime is a cd and a dvd recorded 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:41.759
 I'll stay here the first 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:43.709
 newark required 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.980
 and then I'm going to trigger my project down here 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.819
 I choose for example 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.819
 I'll put it here 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.949
 of living against what to do on the 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:59.789
 It's not that I'm ineligible to score 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:03.839
 everything is in another he comes to this one that will grant a side 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:06.909
 proposal that raises the question 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.489
 or decrease 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.979
 if I stay here in another 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:11.879
 he comes here 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.789
 Why are you here? 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.149
 click English mana 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.589
 it will start recording the voice stayed so dvd rosemeyer 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:21.839
 on the lawn 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.839
 he will automatically stay here. 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:28.819
 so many options 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.099
 it is not configured that other professions do nothing 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.449
 sing in the parliament here you ass my mine will not record sang without any cd 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:37.090
 audio 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.909
 followed by leader 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.909
 and that the sescoop the life of any practice 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.819
 secret disagree 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.819
 is that the voice of the recording also that he appeared daughter 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.989
 what would never be speed 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.989
 the grave that the voice of the recording 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:03.499
 and aggravate 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:06.069
 lucas salatta i will not take anything 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.069
 You have several alternatives too. 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.769
 what you want I assumed you dared to try right you can copy 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.989
 pass-through and parents and son 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.989
 and for you it extracts an extra ewaldo shine of the strange flavor 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:24.550
 the fan heard 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.809
 one of them 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:28.340
 who else do you think 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.340
 is dry simão imagem that lock the service 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.589
 if the decision was made when you download on the French internet and operational 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.430
 You come here for example. 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.080
 I opened it 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.080
 browser 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.849
 here at bajaki 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:51.860
 only that this passion is seen this in general operating systems even 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.659
 He does not tell me he's a fucking kid. 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.659
 aquino bagé you can download it from program the impasse 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.460
 if you will choose ab furthermore here olympic 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:07.370
 the best attack - 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.370
 it will have several programs and you can 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.309
 choose who 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:16.900
 great surprise but 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.729
 programs and the data here 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.939
 I said that you 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.189
 push over to record the image 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.770
 more than knowing 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.319
 You can see more of this then when it comes to fuel in brazil it is so much 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:29.710
 that he until the butô 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.770
 maputo 10 that this action counted 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.379
 using 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:37.910
 as it will freeze and like this with an iso image there you will record it has 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.379
 what to give a collection that are here 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:44.379
 who works maximum in May 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.029
 I'm going back here. 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:52.159
 You can use this too. 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.159
 it's the go-cart 

00:05:57.619 --> 00:06:01.519
 avoiding your case the project does not want to save the lookout does not want rain
