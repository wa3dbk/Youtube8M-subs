reason<00:00:26.279> we're<00:00:26.400> using<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.849> surface<00:00:27.390> mounted<00:00:27.720> to

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
reason we're using a surface mounted to

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.839 
reason we're using a surface mounted to
latch<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.380> place<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.920> an<00:00:29.010> internal<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.640> latch

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
latch in place of an internal to latch

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.910 
latch in place of an internal to latch
is<00:00:30.090> because<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.570> old<00:00:30.720> latches<00:00:31.260> are<00:00:31.470> damaged

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
is because the old latches are damaged

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.120 
is because the old latches are damaged
and<00:00:32.160> replacements<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:32.940> no<00:00:33.149> longer<00:00:33.390> available

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
and replacements are no longer available

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.780 
and replacements are no longer available
instead<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.219> searching<00:00:35.399> around<00:00:35.640> for

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
instead of searching around for

instead of searching around for
replacements<00:00:36.450> which<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.260> difficult<00:00:37.739> it's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
replacements which can be difficult it's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.950 
replacements which can be difficult it's
much<00:00:38.460> easier<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> find<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.149> pair<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.420> surface

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
much easier to find a pair of surface

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.069 
much easier to find a pair of surface
mounted<00:00:40.320> tilt<00:00:40.590> latches<00:00:41.480> so<00:00:42.480> what<00:00:42.989> we

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
mounted tilt latches so what we

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.690 
mounted tilt latches so what we
recommend<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.710> case<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.399> leave<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
recommend in this case is to leave the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.229 
recommend in this case is to leave the
broken<00:00:45.059> latch<00:00:45.239> or<00:00:45.750> latches<00:00:46.320> as<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.550> done<00:00:48.120> use

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
broken latch or latches as is a done use

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.590 
broken latch or latches as is a done use
a<00:00:48.270> hacksaw<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.840> remove<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.530> latches<00:00:49.920> teeth

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
a hacksaw to remove the latches teeth

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.850 
a hacksaw to remove the latches teeth
leaving<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> internal<00:00:52.079> latches<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.649> sash

leaving the internal latches in the sash

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.560 
leaving the internal latches in the sash
will<00:00:53.100> not<00:00:53.250> affect<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.820> operation<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.449> the
