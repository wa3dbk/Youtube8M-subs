00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
photo pulls in a lot of information and

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.949 
photo pulls in a lot of information and
you<00:02:03.459> can<00:02:03.489> really<00:02:03.759> kind<00:02:03.879> of<00:02:04.119> adjust<00:02:04.509> the<00:02:04.750> other

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
you can really kind of adjust the other

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.490 
you can really kind of adjust the other
faders<00:02:05.500> around<00:02:05.950> this<00:02:06.429> ain't<00:02:07.060> so<00:02:07.599> I<00:02:07.929> want<00:02:08.410> you

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
faders around this ain't so I want you

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.190 
faders around this ain't so I want you
to<00:02:08.590> keep<00:02:08.709> in<00:02:08.860> mind<00:02:09.069> if<00:02:09.250> you're<00:02:09.369> coming<00:02:09.700> to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
to keep in mind if you're coming to

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.110 
to keep in mind if you're coming to
Photoshop<00:02:11.200> cs5<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:12.489> you're<00:02:12.910> using

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
Photoshop cs5 and you're using

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.350 
Photoshop cs5 and you're using
photomatix<00:02:13.959> there's<00:02:14.410> not<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.620> one-to-one<00:02:15.360> with

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
photomatix there's not a one-to-one with

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.330 
photomatix there's not a one-to-one with
the<00:02:16.720> faders<00:02:17.110> hey<00:02:17.410> there<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.770> going<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.160> be<00:02:18.310> a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
the faders hey there is going to be a

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.150 
the faders hey there is going to be a
little<00:02:18.580> bit<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:18.880> learner

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
little bit of a learner

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.610 
little bit of a learner
curve<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:20.270> get<00:02:20.780> up<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.990> speed<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.440> how<00:02:21.560> the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
curve to get up to speed and how the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.800 
curve to get up to speed and how the
faders<00:02:22.010> work<00:02:22.190> in<00:02:22.370> merge<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.730> HDR<00:02:22.760> pro<00:02:23.360> right

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
faders work in merge to HDR pro right

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.290 
faders work in merge to HDR pro right
right<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:24.890> start<00:02:25.280> again<00:02:25.610> with<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.910> detail

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
right so I start again with the detail

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.090 
right so I start again with the detail
slider<00:02:26.660> this<00:02:26.960> really<00:02:27.290> kind<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.560> just<00:02:27.770> grabs

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
slider this really kind of just grabs

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.610 
slider this really kind of just grabs
all<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.940> sharpness<00:02:29.270> pulls<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.020> up<00:02:30.110> pulls<00:02:30.470> up

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
all the sharpness pulls it up pulls up

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.200 
all the sharpness pulls it up pulls up
the<00:02:30.710> contrast<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.460> then<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:31.850> can<00:02:32.000> start

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
the contrast and then I can start

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.550 
the contrast and then I can start
playing<00:02:32.420> wrong<00:02:32.630> with<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.780> other<00:02:32.870> faders<00:02:33.290> so

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
playing wrong with the other faders so

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.650 
playing wrong with the other faders so
you'll<00:02:33.710> notice<00:02:34.130> now<00:02:34.310> if<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.700> drag<00:02:35.330> up<00:02:35.360> the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
you'll notice now if I drag up the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.820 
you'll notice now if I drag up the
strength<00:02:36.080> in<00:02:36.380> my<00:02:36.440> edge<00:02:37.100> glow<00:02:37.550> and<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:39.530> drag<00:02:39.800> up

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
strength in my edge glow and I drag up

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.630 
strength in my edge glow and I drag up
the<00:02:40.040> radius<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:40.700> my<00:02:40.850> edge<00:02:41.030> glow<00:02:42.070> hey<00:02:43.070> this<00:02:43.460> is

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
the radius in my edge glow hey this is

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.550 
the radius in my edge glow hey this is
where<00:02:43.820> you're<00:02:43.940> really<00:02:44.420> getting<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.900> haloing

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
where you're really getting the haloing

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.940 
where you're really getting the haloing
that<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.040> lot<00:02:46.460> of<00:02:46.580> people<00:02:46.850> see<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.440> HDR<00:02:48.440> photos

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
that a lot of people see in HDR photos

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.310 
that a lot of people see in HDR photos
so<00:02:49.310> if<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:49.790> back<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.330> radius<00:02:50.660> off

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
so if I back the radius off

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.910 
so if I back the radius off
notice<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.340> haloing<00:02:52.790> starts<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.210> die<00:02:53.390> down

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
notice the haloing starts to die down

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.840 
notice the haloing starts to die down
certainly<00:02:54.920> if<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.130> start<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.490> pull<00:02:55.700> the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
certainly if I start to pull the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.630 
certainly if I start to pull the
strength<00:02:56.240> down<00:02:56.510> look<00:02:56.810> at<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.110> trees<00:02:57.520> pull<00:02:58.520> the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
strength down look at the trees pull the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.240 
strength down look at the trees pull the
strength<00:02:58.970> down<00:02:59.240> I<00:02:59.540> can<00:03:00.350> start<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.680> pull<00:03:00.950> back

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
strength down I can start to pull back

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.450 
strength down I can start to pull back
hey<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.360> haloing<00:03:02.900> I'm<00:03:03.890> gonna<00:03:04.190> drop<00:03:04.340> the

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
hey that haloing I'm gonna drop the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.270 
hey that haloing I'm gonna drop the
radius<00:03:04.760> some<00:03:04.910> more<00:03:05.500> hey<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.770> that<00:03:06.920> works<00:03:07.130> out

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
radius some more hey and that works out

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.470 
radius some more hey and that works out
a<00:03:07.340> little<00:03:07.430> bit<00:03:07.610> better

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
a little bit better

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.570 
a little bit better
if<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:09.230> start<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.680> move<00:03:09.830> into<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.220> tone<00:03:10.430> and

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
if I start to move into the tone and

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.570 
if I start to move into the tone and
detail<00:03:10.880> section<00:03:11.270> again<00:03:11.560> sliding<00:03:12.560> gamma<00:03:13.040> to

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
detail section again sliding gamma to

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.340 
detail section again sliding gamma to
the<00:03:13.700> left<00:03:14.000> is<00:03:14.360> going<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.840> affect<00:03:15.110> more<00:03:15.290> than

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
the left is going to affect more than

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.250 
the left is going to affect more than
mid-tone<00:03:15.830> range<00:03:16.330> sliding<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:17.480> gamma<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:18.110> the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
mid-tone range sliding and gamma to the

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.890 
mid-tone range sliding and gamma to the
right<00:03:18.640> gives<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:19.790> again<00:03:20.090> kind<00:03:20.330> of<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.540> drawn

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
right gives it again kind of a drawn

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.450 
right gives it again kind of a drawn
look<00:03:21.530> because<00:03:21.920> we're<00:03:22.130> hitting<00:03:22.370> the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
look because we're hitting the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.670 
look because we're hitting the
highlights<00:03:22.880> in<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.060> shadow<00:03:23.330> areas<00:03:23.750> right<00:03:24.110> so

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
highlights in the shadow areas right so

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.870 
highlights in the shadow areas right so
I'm<00:03:24.800> actually<00:03:24.890> gonna<00:03:25.160> move<00:03:25.370> mine<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.730> little

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
I'm actually gonna move mine a little

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.090 
I'm actually gonna move mine a little
bit<00:03:26.000> more<00:03:26.240> to<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.390> left<00:03:26.770> playing<00:03:27.770> around<00:03:27.980> with

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
bit more to the left playing around with

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.590 
bit more to the left playing around with
the<00:03:28.190> exposure<00:03:28.550> is<00:03:28.820> just<00:03:28.970> gonna<00:03:29.060> adjust<00:03:29.420> the

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
the exposure is just gonna adjust the

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.210 
the exposure is just gonna adjust the
overall<00:03:29.870> brightness<00:03:30.140> in<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.500> scene<00:03:30.800> so

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
overall brightness in the scene so

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.590 
overall brightness in the scene so
really<00:03:31.520> really<00:03:31.760> bright<00:03:32.080> really<00:03:33.080> really<00:03:33.290> dark

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
really really bright really really dark

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.790 
really really bright really really dark
playing<00:03:35.600> with<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.870> shadow<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.380> highlight

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
playing with the shadow and highlight

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.650 
playing with the shadow and highlight
faders<00:03:37.220> will<00:03:37.790> make<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.150> shadow<00:03:38.420> and

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
faders will make the shadow and

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.860 
faders will make the shadow and
highlights<00:03:39.050> either<00:03:39.350> brighter<00:03:39.830> or<00:03:40.760> darker<00:03:41.180> so

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
highlights either brighter or darker so

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.090 
highlights either brighter or darker so
I'm<00:03:41.900> just<00:03:42.110> gonna<00:03:42.260> darken<00:03:42.560> up<00:03:42.740> the<00:03:42.800> shadow

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
I'm just gonna darken up the shadow

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.190 
I'm just gonna darken up the shadow
areas<00:03:43.520> I<00:03:43.790> play<00:03:44.450> around<00:03:44.540> with<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.780> highlights

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
areas I play around with the highlights

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.780 
areas I play around with the highlights
here<00:03:45.440> they<00:03:45.560> are<00:03:45.709> brighter<00:03:45.980> I'm<00:03:46.310> gonna<00:03:46.490> pull

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
here they are brighter I'm gonna pull

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.270 
here they are brighter I'm gonna pull
that<00:03:46.820> back<00:03:47.150> down<00:03:47.330> a<00:03:47.390> little<00:03:47.600> bit<00:03:47.780> if<00:03:48.260> we<00:03:48.770> jump

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
that back down a little bit if we jump

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.760 
that back down a little bit if we jump
into<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.640> color<00:03:49.880> section<00:03:50.450> it's<00:03:50.870> worth<00:03:51.170> noting

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
into the color section it's worth noting

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.820 
into the color section it's worth noting
that<00:03:51.800> vibrance<00:03:52.760> is<00:03:52.970> gonna<00:03:53.540> target<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.410> muted

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
that vibrance is gonna target the muted

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.150 
that vibrance is gonna target the muted
colors<00:03:55.250> first<00:03:55.700> right<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:56.870> then<00:03:57.160> saturation

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
colors first right and then saturation

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.550 
colors first right and then saturation
is<00:03:58.340> going<00:03:58.550> to<00:03:58.760> boost<00:03:59.540> up<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.930> overall<00:04:00.290> scene

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
is going to boost up the overall scene

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.530 
is going to boost up the overall scene
so<00:04:01.370> I'm<00:04:01.489> going<00:04:01.610> to<00:04:01.640> take<00:04:01.790> vibrance<00:04:02.330> all<00:04:02.450> the

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
so I'm going to take vibrance all the

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.180 
so I'm going to take vibrance all the
way<00:04:02.630> to<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.780> top<00:04:03.050> look<00:04:03.410> at<00:04:03.500> how<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:03.650> grabs

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
way to the top look at how that grabs

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.670 
way to the top look at how that grabs
the<00:04:04.550> sky<00:04:05.209> it<00:04:05.270> kind<00:04:05.660> of<00:04:05.750> grabs<00:04:05.989> part<00:04:06.350> of<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.500> RUS

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
the sky it kind of grabs part of the RUS

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.460 
the sky it kind of grabs part of the RUS
color<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.250> then<00:04:07.880> if<00:04:08.000> I<00:04:08.150> boost<00:04:08.390> up<00:04:08.690> saturation

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
color and then if I boost up saturation

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.340 
color and then if I boost up saturation
that's<00:04:10.370> just<00:04:10.850> a<00:04:11.000> little<00:04:11.450> bit<00:04:11.720> too<00:04:12.080> much<00:04:12.320> a

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
that's just a little bit too much a

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.540 
that's just a little bit too much a
little<00:04:12.560> bit<00:04:12.680> over-the-top<00:04:12.920> so<00:04:13.400> I'm<00:04:13.459> gonna

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
little bit over-the-top so I'm gonna

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.349 
little bit over-the-top so I'm gonna
pull<00:04:13.820> saturation<00:04:14.480> back<00:04:14.660> right<00:04:15.970> so<00:04:16.970> those<00:04:17.180> are

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
pull saturation back right so those are

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.420 
pull saturation back right so those are
some<00:04:17.450> of<00:04:17.510> the<00:04:17.660> faders<00:04:18.020> inside<00:04:18.919> those<00:04:19.160> are<00:04:19.280> some

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
some of the faders inside those are some

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.670 
some of the faders inside those are some
of<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.549> adjustments<00:04:19.850> for<00:04:20.840> HDR<00:04:21.169> certainly

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
of the adjustments for HDR certainly

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.810 
of the adjustments for HDR certainly
it's<00:04:21.799> subjective<00:04:22.250> you're<00:04:22.340> gonna<00:04:22.430> play<00:04:22.700> around

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
it's subjective you're gonna play around

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.210 
it's subjective you're gonna play around
and<00:04:23.180> decide<00:04:23.480> what<00:04:23.630> you<00:04:23.750> like<00:04:23.930> I<00:04:24.169> do<00:04:24.800> recommend

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
and decide what you like I do recommend

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.540 
and decide what you like I do recommend
going<00:04:25.790> to<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.660> presets<00:04:27.140> and<00:04:27.410> I'll<00:04:28.220> just<00:04:28.340> run

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
going to the presets and I'll just run

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.159 
going to the presets and I'll just run
through<00:04:28.610> them<00:04:28.850> real<00:04:29.030> quick<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:29.479> can<00:04:29.630> see<00:04:29.870> that

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
through them real quick you can see that

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.190 
through them real quick you can see that
this<00:04:30.320> is<00:04:30.530> kind<00:04:30.770> of<00:04:30.890> a<00:04:31.150> surreal<00:04:32.150> holistic<00:04:32.900> high

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
this is kind of a surreal holistic high

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.650 
this is kind of a surreal holistic high
contrast<00:04:33.770> preset<00:04:34.220> hey<00:04:34.789> that's<00:04:35.060> really<00:04:35.479> kind

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
contrast preset hey that's really kind

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.510 
contrast preset hey that's really kind
of<00:04:35.720> over<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.050> top<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:37.070> don't<00:04:37.250> know<00:04:37.430> it

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
of over the top and I don't know it

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.830 
of over the top and I don't know it
gives<00:04:37.669> it<00:04:37.760> kind<00:04:37.850> of<00:04:37.940> a<00:04:38.030> mood<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:38.360> think<00:04:38.600> you<00:04:38.720> know

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
gives it kind of a mood I think you know

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.529 
gives it kind of a mood I think you know
it's<00:04:38.990> not<00:04:39.140> too<00:04:39.320> bad<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:40.340> have<00:04:40.520> a<00:04:40.729> more<00:04:41.240> saturated

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
it's not too bad I have a more saturated

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.650 
it's not too bad I have a more saturated
preset<00:04:42.320> here<00:04:42.440> we<00:04:42.620> can<00:04:42.740> pull<00:04:42.919> up<00:04:43.270> this<00:04:44.270> one<00:04:44.630> a

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
preset here we can pull up this one a

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.600 
preset here we can pull up this one a
little<00:04:45.140> bit<00:04:45.229> too<00:04:45.410> cartoony<00:04:46.039> for<00:04:46.220> me<00:04:46.310> I'm<00:04:46.460> not<00:04:46.490> a

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
little bit too cartoony for me I'm not a

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.510 
little bit too cartoony for me I'm not a
big<00:04:46.820> fan<00:04:47.030> of<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.229> but<00:04:48.229> we<00:04:48.320> also<00:04:48.500> have<00:04:48.860> black

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
big fan of that but we also have black

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.210 
big fan of that but we also have black
and<00:04:49.700> white<00:04:50.440> so<00:04:51.440> here's<00:04:51.710> a<00:04:51.770> monochromatic

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
and white so here's a monochromatic

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.400 
and white so here's a monochromatic
conversion<00:04:53.060> I<00:04:53.150> actually<00:04:53.330> you<00:04:54.050> know<00:04:54.080> kind<00:04:54.380> of

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
conversion I actually you know kind of

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.230 
conversion I actually you know kind of
like<00:04:54.590> this<00:04:54.770> one<00:04:54.979> right<00:04:55.310> but<00:04:55.700> what<00:04:55.820> I<00:04:55.850> might<00:04:56.060> do

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
like this one right but what I might do

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.880 
like this one right but what I might do
is<00:04:56.390> maybe<00:04:56.539> punch<00:04:57.110> in<00:04:57.350> back<00:04:57.530> some<00:04:57.740> of<00:04:57.770> the

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
is maybe punch in back some of the

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.100 
is maybe punch in back some of the
vibrance<00:04:58.360> punch<00:04:59.360> back<00:04:59.570> in<00:04:59.780> some<00:04:59.960> of<00:05:00.050> the

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
vibrance punch back in some of the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.719 
vibrance punch back in some of the
saturation<00:05:00.590> and<00:05:00.860> bring<00:05:01.039> back<00:05:01.250> some<00:05:01.580> of<00:05:01.669> the

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
saturation and bring back some of the

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.760 
saturation and bring back some of the
color<00:05:01.940> to<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.690> scene<00:05:02.930> right<00:05:03.350> just<00:05:03.590> kind<00:05:03.680> of

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
color to the scene right just kind of

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.000 
color to the scene right just kind of
give<00:05:04.100> it<00:05:04.190> a<00:05:04.250> desaturated<00:05:04.760> look<00:05:05.380> once<00:05:06.380> you<00:05:06.500> have

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
give it a desaturated look once you have

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.770 
give it a desaturated look once you have
played<00:05:07.370> around<00:05:07.490> with<00:05:07.669> the<00:05:07.850> faders<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.600> thing

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
played around with the faders the thing

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.659 
played around with the faders the thing
that<00:05:08.930> really<00:05:09.050> stands<00:05:09.560> out<00:05:09.860> and<00:05:10.190> merge<00:05:10.400> to<00:05:10.640> HDR

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
that really stands out and merge to HDR

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.050 
that really stands out and merge to HDR
pro<00:05:11.390> is<00:05:11.660> its<00:05:12.590> ability<00:05:13.070> to<00:05:13.100> remove<00:05:13.490> artifacts

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
pro is its ability to remove artifacts

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.850 
pro is its ability to remove artifacts
right<00:05:14.539> so<00:05:15.140> I'm<00:05:15.350> gonna<00:05:15.470> make<00:05:15.620> a<00:05:15.680> couple

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
right so I'm gonna make a couple

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.469 
right so I'm gonna make a couple
adjustments<00:05:16.070> here<00:05:16.610> let<00:05:16.760> me<00:05:16.850> go<00:05:16.940> back<00:05:17.180> to<00:05:17.390> the

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
adjustments here let me go back to the

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.010 
adjustments here let me go back to the
photorealistic<00:05:17.870> preset<00:05:19.120> hey<00:05:20.120> and<00:05:20.419> I'm<00:05:20.900> gonna

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
photorealistic preset hey and I'm gonna

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.630 
photorealistic preset hey and I'm gonna
just<00:05:21.169> pull<00:05:21.380> up<00:05:21.530> some<00:05:21.710> of<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:21.830> detail<00:05:22.220> here<00:05:22.520> I

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
just pull up some of the detail here I

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.170 
just pull up some of the detail here I
want<00:05:22.789> to<00:05:22.880> do<00:05:22.970> that<00:05:24.100> hey<00:05:25.100> that's<00:05:25.520> good<00:05:25.789> drop

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
want to do that hey that's good drop

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.810 
want to do that hey that's good drop
down<00:05:26.330> my<00:05:26.450> gamma<00:05:26.750> and<00:05:27.110> I'm<00:05:27.919> gonna<00:05:28.039> zoom<00:05:28.310> in<00:05:28.580> on

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
down my gamma and I'm gonna zoom in on

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.990 
down my gamma and I'm gonna zoom in on
the<00:05:28.970> bottom<00:05:29.330> portion<00:05:29.690> of<00:05:29.780> the<00:05:29.840> photo<00:05:31.000> because

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
the bottom portion of the photo because

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.130 
the bottom portion of the photo because
you<00:05:32.180> can<00:05:32.360> notice<00:05:32.600> down<00:05:32.720> in<00:05:32.840> the<00:05:32.900> bottom

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
you can notice down in the bottom

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.810 
you can notice down in the bottom
portion<00:05:33.289> of<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.530> photo<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:34.160> weeds<00:05:34.370> were<00:05:34.580> kind

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
portion of the photo the weeds were kind

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.790 
portion of the photo the weeds were kind
of<00:05:34.970> blowing<00:05:35.210> in<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.510> wind<00:05:35.539> when<00:05:36.110> I<00:05:36.140> took<00:05:36.650> this

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
of blowing in the wind when I took this

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.279 
of blowing in the wind when I took this
photograph<00:05:37.070> so<00:05:37.490> I<00:05:37.550> had<00:05:37.729> it<00:05:37.820> on<00:05:37.910> a<00:05:37.970> tripod<00:05:38.510> but

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
photograph so I had it on a tripod but

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.230 
photograph so I had it on a tripod but
you<00:05:40.190> know<00:05:40.280> I<00:05:40.310> couldn't<00:05:40.669> do<00:05:40.850> anything<00:05:41.060> to

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
you know I couldn't do anything to

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.300 
you know I couldn't do anything to
account<00:05:41.690> for<00:05:41.780> the<00:05:41.990> wind<00:05:42.169> so<00:05:42.830> I'm<00:05:43.039> gonna<00:05:43.160> go

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
account for the wind so I'm gonna go

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.950 
account for the wind so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:05:43.490> and<00:05:43.610> check<00:05:43.850> the<00:05:44.090> box<00:05:44.120> it<00:05:44.510> says<00:05:44.539> remove

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
ahead and check the box it says remove

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.930 
ahead and check the box it says remove
ghosts<00:05:45.500> and<00:05:46.360> what<00:05:47.360> this<00:05:47.510> will<00:05:47.690> do<00:05:47.960> is<00:05:48.169> pick<00:05:49.100> one

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
ghosts and what this will do is pick one

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.850 
ghosts and what this will do is pick one
of<00:05:50.240> your<00:05:50.479> images<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:51.320> one<00:05:51.470> that's<00:05:51.680> the<00:05:51.830> most

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
of your images the one that's the most

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.430 
of your images the one that's the most
balanced<00:05:52.700> and<00:05:52.940> it<00:05:53.390> will<00:05:53.539> make<00:05:53.810> it<00:05:54.020> the<00:05:54.169> base

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
balanced and it will make it the base

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.140 
balanced and it will make it the base
image<00:05:54.770> and<00:05:55.160> you<00:05:55.400> can<00:05:55.580> see<00:05:55.850> that<00:05:56.030> it

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
image and you can see that it

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.510 
image and you can see that it
essentially<00:05:56.600> removed<00:05:57.110> the<00:05:57.950> artifacts

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
essentially removed the artifacts

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.550 
essentially removed the artifacts
removed<00:05:58.910> the<00:05:59.060> weeds<00:05:59.270> from<00:06:00.050> the<00:06:00.229> other<00:06:00.350> two

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
removed the weeds from the other two

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.810 
removed the weeds from the other two
images<00:06:00.919> and<00:06:01.070> took<00:06:01.190> them<00:06:01.310> out<00:06:01.400> of<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.580> scene

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
images and took them out of the scene

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.450 
images and took them out of the scene
all<00:06:02.360> right<00:06:02.390> so<00:06:02.810> that<00:06:03.050> the<00:06:03.680> ghost<00:06:04.010> feature<00:06:04.370> of

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
all right so that the ghost feature of

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.520 
all right so that the ghost feature of
the<00:06:04.550> removed<00:06:04.789> ghost<00:06:05.000> feature<00:06:05.270> I<00:06:05.390> really<00:06:05.840> like

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
the removed ghost feature I really like

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.090

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
it a whole lot in photomatix I think it

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.070 
it a whole lot in photomatix I think it
works<00:06:12.320> really<00:06:12.440> really<00:06:12.830> well<00:06:13.340> here<00:06:13.370> hey<00:06:14.240> so<00:06:14.900> I'm

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.700 
hey the mini bridge there and then this
is<00:06:50.340> the<00:06:50.550> final<00:06:50.699> exposure<00:06:51.210> right<00:06:51.660> so<00:06:52.289> you<00:06:52.350> can

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
is the final exposure right so you can

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.180 
is the final exposure right so you can
see<00:06:52.919> that's<00:06:53.280> how<00:06:53.520> you<00:06:53.580> use<00:06:54.199> mini<00:06:55.199> bridge<00:06:55.500> mini

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.190

00:06:58.339 --> 00:06:58.349 
bridge that's how you do HDR with merge

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:04.820 
bridge that's how you do HDR with merge
to<00:06:58.590> HDR<00:06:58.620> and<00:06:59.389> Photoshop<00:07:00.389> I<00:07:00.630> hope<00:07:03.349> well<00:07:04.349> it<00:07:04.620> was
