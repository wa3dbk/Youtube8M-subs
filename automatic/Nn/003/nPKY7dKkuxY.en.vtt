00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:09.369
 good friends welcome to what would be 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:12.390
 the presentation of the kits 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:14.050
 vehicle survival part two 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.900
 good 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.960
 As I do not know if you remember, I made a 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.570
 post in your guide precisely because of the 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.810
 of the survival kits that 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.509
 We had at least the one I was wearing 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.119
 in my private vehicle today I love you 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.720
 show the survival kits that 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.239
 they go in my wife's car according 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.030
 you will see that they are a bit different so much 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.559
 of size above all in size because one 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.350
 which is the material because more or less is 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.620
 the same 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:53.640
 but more than anything they are different because 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.420
 because the size because my car is 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.870
 much greater than yours then then the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.500
 space available as it is what we 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.340
 therefore limits to carry 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.550
 in less quantity of materials 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.530
 in spite of that well then 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.049
 if I keep carrying two clips 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.800
 in this case is that here is a clip 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.430
 of the house bcb 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.280
 improved by me or maybe not improved 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.740
 but modified by me according to my 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.820
 needs and this other one because already what 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.550
 you know is the survival kit 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.100
 advanced of the colleague's gerber house 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.470
 bear grylls 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.250
 and well these are elements for 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.619
 reinforce both kits because then the other 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.360
 day I review it because in this case there is 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.230
 some things that are missing or that I think 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.760
 can be expanded 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.550
 so then well let's see 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.290
 what the clips are made of, I'm not going 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.960
 to go too much into matter because there 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.400
 a post ex process done for that of 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.620
 weather 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.360
 instead in this yes because I do not 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.090
 I have presented never taught him never 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.730
 and I think it's worth it as I say 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.369
 it's a clip from cb's house I do not think anymore 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.060
 that they do not market these before 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.160
 came with a 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.410
 with a kind of 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.470
 of yellow label but I removed it 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.110
 because he was quite guaribe already and he 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.950
 they end up waiting for you and winding you up 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.950
 American tape 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.790
 so let's go straight to the subject in 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.920
 this next video that we are going to do 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.960
 where will we see this bcb team that is what 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.130
 what it contains and what it can be 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.530
 improve and what can not be 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.100
 improve if you are interested in the topic that I think 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.410
 yes, why 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.760
 the post of the survival kits of 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.150
 vehicles the truth is that people what 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.220
 he welcomed quite well then well 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.950
 accompany me I think it's interesting and 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.270
 so we are moving forward among all 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.870
 knowing the materials that we carry and 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:00.470
 others are worth 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.470
 so far do not go greetings
