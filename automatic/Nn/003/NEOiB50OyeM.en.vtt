begins at first through an order is

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.030 
begins at first through an order is
basically<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.270> determined<00:01:03.750> randomly<00:01:04.040> but

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
basically just determined randomly but

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.859 
basically just determined randomly but
after<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.430> whoever<00:01:06.000> as<00:01:06.150> farthest<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.840> the

after that whoever as farthest in the
front<00:01:07.260> gets<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.650> go<00:01:07.799> first<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:08.490> there's<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.119> tie

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
front gets to go first if there's a tie

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.830 
front gets to go first if there's a tie
whoever's<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> front<00:01:11.180> for<00:01:12.180> example<00:01:12.570> here

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
whoever's in the front for example here

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.140 
whoever's in the front for example here
purple<00:01:13.320> gets<00:01:13.470> ago<00:01:13.680> then<00:01:13.920> yellow<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:14.909> they

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
purple gets ago then yellow but if they

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.910 
purple gets ago then yellow but if they
are<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> same<00:01:15.689> row<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.500> whoever<00:01:16.799> is

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
are in the same row then whoever is

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.850 
are in the same row then whoever is
closer<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> baobab<00:01:17.790> tree<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:19.110> for<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.650> in

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
closer to the baobab tree is for is in

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.730 
closer to the baobab tree is for is in
first<00:01:20.040> place<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.549> here<00:01:20.759> yellow<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:22.320> gets<00:01:22.619> to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
first place so here yellow is it gets to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.920 
first place so here yellow is it gets to
go<00:01:22.860> before<00:01:23.040> purple<00:01:23.610> when<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.479> your<00:01:24.600> turn<00:01:24.869> you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.030 
on the board the black yellow blue or
red<00:01:38.820> your<00:01:39.600> ostrich<00:01:40.020> will<00:01:40.200> move<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> number<00:01:40.890> on

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
red your ostrich will move the number on

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.550 
red your ostrich will move the number on
this<00:01:41.159> space<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.729> must<00:01:42.030> move<00:01:42.350> towards<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
this space but you must move towards the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.410

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
land up on the color so for example if

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.700 
land up on the color so for example if
the<00:01:47.700> purple<00:01:48.090> here<00:01:48.270> played<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> three<00:01:48.899> yellow<00:01:49.110> he

how<00:05:06.700> you<00:05:06.760> move<00:05:07.120> on<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.420> board<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:07.840> card

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
how you move on the board and card

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.440 
how you move on the board and card
management<00:05:08.680> there's<00:05:08.860> muck<00:05:09.130> but<00:05:09.850> every<00:05:10.240> player

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
management there's muck but every player

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.240 
management there's muck but every player
has<00:05:10.480> the<00:05:10.840> same<00:05:11.080> deck<00:05:11.380> of<00:05:11.530> cards<00:05:11.830> with<00:05:11.980> the<00:05:12.070> same

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
has the same deck of cards with the same

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.610 
has the same deck of cards with the same
numbers<00:05:12.670> in<00:05:12.850> them<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:13.180> yeah<00:05:14.140> that's<00:05:14.290> like<00:05:14.470> I'm

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
numbers in them and yeah that's like I'm

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.900 
numbers in them and yeah that's like I'm
going<00:05:14.740> to<00:05:14.800> get<00:05:14.950> the<00:05:15.040> cards<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.490> right<00:05:15.640> time

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
going to get the cards the right time

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.180 
going to get the cards the right time
but<00:05:16.150> it<00:05:16.420> doesn't<00:05:16.960> feel<00:05:17.230> so<00:05:17.530> lucky<00:05:17.800> and<00:05:17.980> you

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
but it doesn't feel so lucky and you

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.830 
but it doesn't feel so lucky and you
have<00:05:18.370> strategy<00:05:18.820> and<00:05:18.940> how<00:05:19.060> you<00:05:19.120> move<00:05:19.510> and

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
have strategy and how you move and

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.380 
have strategy and how you move and
maneuver<00:05:20.650> around<00:05:20.770> but<00:05:21.700> even<00:05:21.850> more<00:05:22.120> than<00:05:22.180> that

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
maneuver around but even more than that

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.180 
maneuver around but even more than that
I<00:05:22.570> think<00:05:22.750> I<00:05:23.080> like<00:05:23.230> the<00:05:23.380> fact<00:05:23.560> that<00:05:23.740> it's<00:05:23.830> so

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
I think I like the fact that it's so

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.910 
I think I like the fact that it's so
quick<00:05:24.880> and<00:05:25.210> if<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.420> game<00:05:25.600> ends<00:05:25.870> very<00:05:26.500> quickly

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
quick and if the game ends very quickly

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.450 
quick and if the game ends very quickly
a<00:05:27.250> short<00:05:28.060> racing<00:05:28.780> game<00:05:28.990> with<00:05:29.800> this<00:05:30.130> kind<00:05:30.370> of

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
a short racing game with this kind of

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.700 
a short racing game with this kind of
variety<00:05:30.700> is<00:05:31.030> one<00:05:31.270> I<00:05:31.300> think<00:05:31.480> has<00:05:31.960> really<00:05:32.260> been

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
variety is one I think has really been

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.280 
variety is one I think has really been
needed<00:05:33.040> game's<00:05:33.820> sake<00:05:34.030> maybe<00:05:34.270> 15<00:05:34.810> to<00:05:34.960> 20

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
needed game's sake maybe 15 to 20

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.750 
needed game's sake maybe 15 to 20
minutes<00:05:35.470> they<00:05:36.010> can<00:05:36.160> hand<00:05:36.340> up<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.550> five

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
minutes they can hand up the five

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.850 
minutes they can hand up the five
players<00:05:37.060> and<00:05:37.360> while<00:05:37.750> some<00:05:38.020> people<00:05:38.170> I<00:05:38.410> pointed

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
players and while some people I pointed

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.830 
players and while some people I pointed
with<00:05:39.010> have<00:05:39.430> found<00:05:39.670> the<00:05:39.820> game<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:40.150> be<00:05:40.180> too<00:05:40.540> light

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
with have found the game to be too light

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.940 
with have found the game to be too light
for<00:05:41.440> their<00:05:42.010> taste<00:05:42.250> for<00:05:42.550> me<00:05:42.970> I<00:05:43.410> really<00:05:44.410> have<00:05:44.920> a

at<00:05:47.230> the<00:05:47.350> family<00:05:47.680> game<00:05:47.860> my<00:05:48.340> daughter<00:05:48.640> poison<00:05:49.120> my

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
at the family game my daughter poison my

at the family game my daughter poison my

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
wife and I and we're all very even as we

go<00:05:51.760> down<00:05:51.970> the<00:05:52.180> course<00:05:52.420> I<00:05:52.600> think<00:05:53.320> this<00:05:53.470> may<00:05:53.740> be

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
go down the course I think this may be

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.000 
go down the course I think this may be
the<00:05:54.520> best<00:05:54.910> family<00:05:55.420> game<00:05:55.570> of<00:05:55.690> 2009<00:05:56.440> or<00:05:56.740> if<00:05:56.830> it's

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
the best family game of 2009 or if it's

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.680 
the best family game of 2009 or if it's
not<00:05:57.190> it's<00:05:57.460> certainly<00:05:57.790> one<00:05:58.120> of<00:05:58.150> the<00:05:58.300> best<00:05:58.510> and

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
not it's certainly one of the best and

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.510 
not it's certainly one of the best and
if<00:05:59.140> you<00:05:59.320> can<00:05:59.530> get<00:05:59.650> a<00:05:59.680> hold<00:05:59.980> of<00:06:00.040> a<00:06:00.130> copy<00:06:00.310> i

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
if you can get a hold of a copy i

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.430 
if you can get a hold of a copy i
recommend<00:06:01.060> it<00:06:01.180> the<00:06:01.540> idea<00:06:01.870> of<00:06:02.050> racing
