analyzer to wait 10 second but if you

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.119 
analyzer to wait 10 second but if you
assume<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.289> as<00:00:49.530> long<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:49.770> you're<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.010> the

just<00:01:16.259> thought<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.500> doing<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.860> um<00:01:17.840> it's

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
just thought of doing this um it's

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.260 
just thought of doing this um it's
probably<00:01:19.080> some<00:01:19.320> people<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.830> would<00:01:20.700> be<00:01:21.060> come

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
probably some people that would be come

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.390 
probably some people that would be come
in<00:01:21.390> handy<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.720> them<00:01:22.049> or<00:01:22.320> anything<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.220> that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
in handy for them or anything like that

friend is gonna walk around this is not
such<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> big<00:01:46.799> map<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.250> i<00:01:47.310> think<00:01:47.850> i<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.180> show

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
such a big map so i think i can show

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.780 
such a big map so i think i can show
almost<00:01:49.049> everything<00:01:49.439> within<00:01:50.280> like<00:01:50.549> four

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
almost everything within like four

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.639 
almost everything within like four
minutes<00:01:51.030> hopefully<00:01:52.670> mana<00:01:53.670> cans<00:01:54.649> biatches<00:01:57.649> you

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
minutes hopefully mana cans biatches you

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.200 
minutes hopefully mana cans biatches you
can't<00:01:58.920> go<00:01:59.130> out<00:01:59.250> there<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.790> building<00:02:00.090> if

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
can't go out there and that building if

loosen gets there something best oil and
probably<00:02:59.430> West<00:02:59.910> Germany<00:03:03.950> probably<00:03:04.950> can<00:03:05.069> use

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
probably West Germany probably can use

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.009

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
that's pretty cool no idea why this is

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.500 
that's pretty cool no idea why this is
here<00:03:10.470> anyway<00:03:10.800> but<00:03:11.540> it's<00:03:12.540> really<00:03:12.780> useful<00:03:13.019> to
