00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:12.770
 for the heart and well simply 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.390
 I was doing my job 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.430
 then from the beginning since before 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.269
 the fight I told them I could fight 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.260
 with him the short has already been announced and it was 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:26.950
 what I did because I had seen many 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.950
 for these days 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.950
 d 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.150
 we work for him 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.350
 we work to connect the blows that 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:42.020
 we connect you and if we actually saw 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.329
 that came in right a lot and the 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.999
 we work for 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:51.140
 but it is totally different from the 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:54.769
 fighter alfredo styles a fighter 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.420
 intelligent that moves that if you win the 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.359
 fights with three punches and leave him 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.030
 moving to the only import him 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.580
 matter win are very different 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.000
 styles I wanted to do many things I could not 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.000
 maybe 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.570
 so much pressure that I had anything not the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.020
 can do and that is already in the past 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.649
 this is the time is this 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.210
 well we have always have a plan 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.600
 all the fighters we are going to make a 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.520
 preparation a plan is always made but 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.520
 when you get in the ring 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.470
 I only did what suited me in the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.200
 fight and from the first round 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:43.049
 can 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:48.140
 I could connect different well I did my 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.140
 work the work was there he no longer 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.689
 but I sincerely feel that 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.090
 of the 12 rounds maybe all in one 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.540
 fight everything can change from a moment to 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.580
 another but I did my job and the referee 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.050
 without work and can not be done 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.020
 I stayed there because 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.120
 I knew that unemployment fear that 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.849
 Enduring have 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.849
 so it looked in what was said 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.190
 I had a heavy hand and several 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.470
 fighters say that the one who was bringing 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.390
 stones in my hands and honestly I 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.140
 he knew how to assimilate his blows and 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.060
 I assimilated and I felt it and I did not feel that much 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.510
 his beating and that's why I stayed there 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.230
 was there to be now as well as the 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.790
 billboard is called brother marc no no no 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.670
 I do not wait for anyone 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.070
 'ours for nobody I'm doing my 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.630
 and my fights and no more waiting for anyone 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.450
 if we have to fight and July we will see and 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.440
 see what is best for people like 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.650
 offer them the best fight like this 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.650
 when there is no 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.830
 supplicatory fight 154 you will not lose 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.660
 the place 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.660
 you can play that quartz pound 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.540
 do not 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:20.230
 and that 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.230
 with the title 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.300
 how good 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.090
 they did not survive 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.090
 yes 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:10.260
 then in the fights 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.260
 if it's not in the sword fights 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.460
 and obviously 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.580
 I do not know maybe they saw to prepare the 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.500
 Fight before the bad time and respect each other 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.280
 and always the both hands have the 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.560
 reason and it is respected but only 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.889
 tell them and reiterate that I was there 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.800
 to fight I am not the law above the 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.200
 quadrilateral I simply work but 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.770
 maybe they are right that they stopped her 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.480
 sooner but maybe the referee for 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.510
 what has gone through so many deaths that 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.970
 There have been ads in these times 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.180
 that's why the coach did too 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:09.410
 I had told him 34 blows that 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.570
 will connect more than one burst because there goes 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.610
 stop then I think everyone 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.730
 does his work and respects the 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.730
 people 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.230
 I'm not happy with the work that 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.030
 we did 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:26.610
 look I did my job stop me because 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.169
 it would suit me to stop in the north will be more 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.080
 powerful 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.479
 Y 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.310
 I think I do not owe anything to people I 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.509
 I always go out to do my job always 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.169
 I go out to give everything above 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.289
 quadrilateral 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.990
 that night simply the style the 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.270
 that did not let me do my job 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.270
 I tried many things I tried to do 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.310
 many things I could not 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.950
 and it's already happened it's a great experience for 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.950
 they tell me when when 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:01.539
 when you learn 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:03.909
 you have not lost then I think it's a 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:06.759
 great experience for me I'm 23 years old 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:10.739
 much future ahead and that is going to 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:10.739
 Serve will serve a lot like tonight
