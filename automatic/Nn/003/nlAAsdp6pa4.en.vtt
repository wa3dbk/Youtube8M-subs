 Face 100 or something 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.409
 It does not seem to neutralize the hardness well 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:14.529
 The harmonious 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:17.150

 There was a little goal so was really not too soft also some of elasticity 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:51.550
 I don't feel like I'm going to burn too much at 1 School will stop on a similar path 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.330
