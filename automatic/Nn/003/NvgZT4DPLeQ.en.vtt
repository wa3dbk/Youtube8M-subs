00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
some authority I can go back to my

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.299 
some authority I can go back to my
regular<00:00:51.300> pot<00:00:51.839> which<00:00:52.319> I<00:00:52.499> can<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> little

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
regular pot which I can get a little

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.750 
regular pot which I can get a little
tentative<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:54.350> right<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.069> can<00:00:56.249> step<00:00:56.519> in

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
tentative with right and I can step in

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.700 
tentative with right and I can step in
there<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:56.999> it<00:00:57.390> automatically<00:00:58.050> comes<00:00:58.409> off<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
there and it automatically comes off the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.250 
there and it automatically comes off the
face<00:00:59.149> with<00:01:00.149> some<00:01:00.390> authority<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.019> not<00:01:04.200> a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
face with some authority so it's not a

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.110 
face with some authority so it's not a
d-cell<00:01:04.920> I'm<00:01:05.070> trying<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.400> protect<00:01:05.700> against

shaft gets a little back I mean it won't

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.200 
shaft gets a little back I mean it won't
go<00:01:42.000> anywhere<00:01:43.010> so<00:01:44.010> if<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.370> learn<00:01:44.580> to<00:01:44.790> take<00:01:45.000> this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
go anywhere so if I learn to take this

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.070 
go anywhere so if I learn to take this
putter<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.870> make<00:01:46.650> a<00:01:46.680> solid<00:01:47.190> stroke<00:01:48.050> with<00:01:49.050> the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
putter and make a solid stroke with the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.850 
putter and make a solid stroke with the
ball<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.500> steel<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:51.630> will<00:01:51.690> automatically<00:01:52.560> set

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
ball of steel it will automatically set

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.860 
ball of steel it will automatically set
up<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.190> eliminate<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:54.300> chicken<00:01:54.780> wing

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
up and eliminate that chicken wing

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.060 
up and eliminate that chicken wing
appropriately<00:01:57.870> and<00:01:58.110> that's<00:01:58.710> one<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
appropriately and that's one of the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.430 
appropriately and that's one of the
things<00:01:59.280> we're<00:01:59.430> looking<00:01:59.460> for<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.270> that

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
things we're looking for is that

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.789 
things we're looking for is that
it<00:02:02.440> automatically<00:02:03.070> makes<00:02:03.580> that<00:02:03.909> ball<00:02:04.150> go<00:02:04.960> just

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
it automatically makes that ball go just

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.830 
it automatically makes that ball go just
my<00:02:06.010> shaft<00:02:06.340> angle<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:07.060> eliminates<00:02:07.750> that

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
my shaft angle it eliminates that

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.330 
my shaft angle it eliminates that
chicken<00:02:08.289> wing<00:02:08.440> because<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.770> just<00:02:08.860> won't<00:02:09.039> roll

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
chicken wing because it just won't roll

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.010 
chicken wing because it just won't roll
I<00:02:09.520> haven't<00:02:09.910> transferred<00:02:10.330> any<00:02:10.600> energy<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:10.990> just

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
I haven't transferred any energy it just

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.370 
I haven't transferred any energy it just
lays<00:02:11.380> there<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:13.510> one<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.900> new<00:02:14.050> things<00:02:14.290> that

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
lays there so one of the new things that

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.960 
lays there so one of the new things that
I've<00:02:14.530> learned<00:02:14.740> about<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.100> ball<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.430> steel<00:02:15.670> is

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
I've learned about the ball of steel is

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.870 
I've learned about the ball of steel is
that<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:17.050> really<00:02:17.260> helps<00:02:17.590> me<00:02:17.860> prevent<00:02:18.340> probably

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
that it really helps me prevent probably

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.120 
that it really helps me prevent probably
the<00:02:19.150> most<00:02:19.390> common<00:02:19.900> error<00:02:20.080> in<00:02:20.260> cutting<00:02:20.620> which

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
the most common error in cutting which

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.760 
the most common error in cutting which
is<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.520> left<00:02:21.940> wrist<00:02:22.360> sort<00:02:23.020> of<00:02:23.110> change<00:02:23.440> in<00:02:23.620> its

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
is that left wrist sort of change in its

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.520 
is that left wrist sort of change in its
angle<00:02:24.310> either<00:02:24.550> way<00:02:24.940> or<00:02:25.239> breaking<00:02:26.020> down<00:02:26.230> and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
angle either way or breaking down and

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.320 
angle either way or breaking down and
what<00:02:27.069> happens<00:02:27.430> when<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.610> do<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.180> don't

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
what happens when I do that is I don't

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.470 
what happens when I do that is I don't
give<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.930> ball<00:02:29.140> any<00:02:29.790> energy<00:02:30.790> from<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.209> putter

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
give the ball any energy from the putter

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.660 
give the ball any energy from the putter
it<00:02:31.810> kind<00:02:32.050> of<00:02:32.080> comes<00:02:32.350> up<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.770> it<00:02:33.130> just<00:02:33.340> kind<00:02:33.580> of

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
it kind of comes up and it just kind of

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.900 
it kind of comes up and it just kind of
gives<00:02:34.150> me<00:02:34.239> that<00:02:34.330> or<00:02:34.810> something<00:02:35.620> like<00:02:35.739> that<00:02:35.950> the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
gives me that or something like that the

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.540 
gives me that or something like that the
ball<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.209> steel<00:02:37.570> will<00:02:37.989> not<00:02:38.019> let<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.860> make<00:02:39.340> that

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
ball of steel will not let you make that

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.580 
ball of steel will not let you make that
stroke<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.300> just<00:02:40.570> won't<00:02:40.750> go<00:02:40.989> anywhere<00:02:41.440> if<00:02:41.530> you

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
stroke it just won't go anywhere if you

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.340 
stroke it just won't go anywhere if you
try<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.190> in<00:02:42.760> fact<00:02:43.090> if<00:02:43.570> you<00:02:43.780> get<00:02:43.989> your<00:02:44.080> hands

try it and in fact if you get your hands

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.320 
try it and in fact if you get your hands
too<00:02:44.590> far<00:02:44.830> forward<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:46.030> won't<00:02:46.209> go<00:02:46.300> anywhere

too far forward you won't go anywhere

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.770 
too far forward you won't go anywhere
either<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:48.220> if<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.489> if<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:49.000> learn<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.239> make<00:02:49.540> that

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
either but if I if I learn to make that

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.110 
either but if I if I learn to make that
stroke<00:02:50.140> appropriately<00:02:51.040> again<00:02:51.730> almost

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
stroke appropriately again almost

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.890 
stroke appropriately again almost
without<00:02:52.390> instruction<00:02:54.300> with<00:02:55.300> some<00:02:55.510> authority

without instruction with some authority

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.449 
without instruction with some authority
that<00:02:58.900> I've<00:02:59.110> made<00:02:59.319> an<00:02:59.500> adjustment<00:02:59.620> with<00:03:00.160> my

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
that I've made an adjustment with my

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.910 
that I've made an adjustment with my
stroke<00:03:00.940> where<00:03:01.690> this<00:03:02.019> left<00:03:02.319> wrist<00:03:02.560> is<00:03:02.739> gonna

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
stroke where this left wrist is gonna

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.670 
stroke where this left wrist is gonna
stay<00:03:03.190> connected<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:05.110> ball<00:03:05.320> will<00:03:05.500> come

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
stay connected and that ball will come

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.580 
stay connected and that ball will come
off<00:03:05.890> with<00:03:05.920> a<00:03:06.489> lot<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.209> momentum<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:08.170> that's

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
off with a lot of momentum so that's

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.170 
off with a lot of momentum so that's
another<00:03:08.920> great<00:03:09.250> drill<00:03:09.579> we've<00:03:09.700> learned<00:03:09.910> out<00:03:10.060> on

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
another great drill we've learned out on

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.200 
another great drill we've learned out on
the<00:03:10.269> tour<00:03:10.450> at<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.630> ball<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:10.900> steel
