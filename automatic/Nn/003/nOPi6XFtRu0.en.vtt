00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.140
 So when piloted driving we test 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.730
 and we develop in germany 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.250
 We also drive with our vehicles 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.260
 here in ingolstadt on the freeway a9 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.210
 For example, we also use the infrastructure 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.500
 have and develop the function 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:41.250
 We also have here in this environment 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:43.710
 in germany as well as in ingolstadt in 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.950
 germany music for development 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:49.140
 functionality on German motorways 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.430
 if we have new tasks to solve 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.870
 we are driving on the 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.520
 to develop the motorway 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.990
 Comparison for example to traffic jam pilots 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.460
 always have shown in small 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.140
 speed range one is the one 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.880
 speed if you drive faster 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.770
 you have to drive ahead you have to 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.600
 recognize situations in a forward-looking manner 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.200
 such as cars, the one fast 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.440
 overtake 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.970
 and you have to be up much earlier 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.530
 Obstacles, for example, are the ones that react 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:55.170
 in front of you stand a construction site 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:57.720
 or an accident, for example, 37 of the builds 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.850
 on a series a 7 on how to get the 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.410
 normal at the dealer can buy what we 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.700
 additionally implemented in this vehicle 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.560
 have are 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.660
 innovative sensor technologies are becoming 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.480
 For example, a high-performance 3D camera 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.250
 we use and a whole new sensor 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.750
 a whole new sensor technology 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.190
 laser scanner we once forward 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.780
 need the front area off to 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.430
 scan and take it back 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.570
 for example, we need a change of lane 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.700
 safe to implement 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.650
 beyond that you need of course 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.870
 incredibly high computing power around 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.400
 to drive this vehicle piloted and 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.650
 there is in the trunk of this 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.450
 author the woman development platform with 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.990
 The computers use this simply 

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.990
 implement
