00:00:01.259 --> 00:00:04.330
 Welcome to the miscellanies 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.430
 first spanish 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.290
 all right 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.289
 outside the second part 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:12.069
 the instruction series 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:14.600
 to inter 2 together then 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.909
 without further delay 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.050
 we are not owen champions 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.059
 and now the camps is working is in the east part of the program phase 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.300
 this explains then work 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.249
 the 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.249
 concepts like what are ideas and metaphors 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.480
 what is good for us to keep in mind so as not to get entangled 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.480
 then to handle the interface 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.080
 So then directly and very fast today 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.580
 and because we do not have until the witness the presence screen of 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.990
 welcome in the documentation links and in the margins 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.290
 interested 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.420
 and we can just give the date escape to 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.640
 hide 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.500
 that welcome screen 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.880
 then it was that he is showing us glasses like 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.080
 first as a min what is this what is what we are seeing 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.650
 what we are seeing is a provision 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.970
 of windows 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.390
 certain of items that are selling is showing the purpose of making 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.259
 chores 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.060
 prince 13 crimes 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.210
 behind what is 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.180
 as acting 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.509
 It is important that 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:21.600
 let's know 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.450
 good reports different we wanted 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.920
 what 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.320
 what has particular with those specific things that he suffered does 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.450
 different 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.450
 perfect to start then 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.670
 a subject that that topic what are called regions 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.640
 if you notice 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.340
 in these common incidents 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.690
 a ten as defined is true 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.050
 renfe like this 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.050
 he is also here certain in common days 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.689
 is 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.029
 here is a stake, it is not a bird - lines that have been of most interest 

00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:01.320
 under yes I entered as darker 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 and also caesar carrion 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.889
 those lines what they do is separate 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.260
 costly in the boundary between what are called regions in the window l 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:17.529
 within each region what can be is common avoided I will give them a 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:17.979
 example 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:19.699
 to be here is a region 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:23.069
 this text is presenting 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.519
 ready that is a region of the program 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.909
 i within that region 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.230
 well this configuration that not by default bring a meditated a kind of bull 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.230
 but one can be with different facts you need 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.770
 in the lower corner normally used is a button 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.849
 from which one can access 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.430
 to the five publisher sites that Mendez has 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.969
 this time the country 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.099
 and there are different types of interest 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.599
 then in principle what many that the fact that was configured is the view 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.049
 3d primitive 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.689
 but we can change others we have for example and the text editor asiem 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.119
 we would understand click here 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:01.999
 and we realize dekker this review becomes a text editor but 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:05.629
 does not have tecsup that does not prevent infotec but it is the text editor 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.849
 we grow to the sct 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.849
 in the same way that it ends in another region 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.329
 it's lower 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.349
 this one from here region 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.349
 gossip in their own gral many later 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.949
 highlights region espot 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:25.719
 it goes otb years 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:26.599
 and is such 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.919
 larrea of ​​here 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.649
 it does not leave us side by side 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:32.649
 it's another region too 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:36.069
 in that case that swat's defenses 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.299
 very well 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.129
 those expressions each one has a sectors editor or just like 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.230
 official access specified for example in the isapres editor of what 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.809
 that we have a visual representation of the scene 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:50.129
 that machine protects circuit 6 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.569
 do not worry about how you select the objects we'll see later 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:58.989
 we keep a few minutes advisor certain functions the sector of acas a 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:03:59.569
 editor 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.059
 for animation in the one you can change from forem many are taking while 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:07.339
 is watching how they get out of animation 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:08.299
 in better 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:09.499
 the initial emf of the 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.359
 of the train of renfe the end 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.359
 with this format to the post and has invested 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:15.989
 regenerate 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.840
 percent is taxing the landas poses of the animations for example those 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.509
 characters 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.509
 he also has his minor related to this project 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.940
 this special medical campground that's why with a circuit just 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.240
 Your property rights of your child can not change the properties of the 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.259
 objects their own from the serene one's own materials and objects 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:36.180
 of the textures 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.180
 despite a special casement in which one simply 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.080
 navigate 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.450
 the structure but it is a person reputation of the scenes too 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.000
 but of hierarchical nature ready then protest the scene the scene 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 contains objects in the dark camera lahm 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:54.119
 those are some of the sectors that they have depends on the pro keeps more 

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:56.319
 jokes examine this menu of the cam 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.919
 sanaa says that there are enough editors 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.339
 my respects and condolences to the wife hour 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:04.319
 now it turns out that 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:08.379
 not only is the issue not sector, it is the issue of how the body expresses 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.930
 interest in doing specific activities first with I'm encouraging 

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:15.009
 with jostles from Swiss sinopec when it's still 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:17.360
 percent and he did it for games 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.120
 the internally displaced mind 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.319
 these configurations can also be saved 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.520
 ready and that by default come some packham 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.460
 in this menu 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.659
 it's called fox 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:31.659
 ain various acts we go for example the telmex 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.020
 the admission and we have a different disposition we observe that it changed 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:37.760
 so, we have 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.660
 here we have a dent a property editor 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.370
 three of the new values ​​is a track 13 seen from the cameras 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.930
 the xeneize 3d in a major these moments is this one editor for blind world xix 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.960
 for me nation 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.520
 and it is that they happen hector of curves the progenitor this minister nor nation 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.159
 these two sectors this one finished 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:58.159
 and this one finished 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:01.009
 his goal is to complement olot well bread 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:03.809
 story night the spokesperson in the selector 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:07.169
 where we have access to rolling mills and how to crash more 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.629
 civil constructor those things 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:12.869
 then this was stored common that is 

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:16.749
 that's the idea like - the averages we grow together roux peris that when 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:20.009
 one notes in that is to say that there is a certain set of tools 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:21.630
 at the hand very fast 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.020
 can be organized in selling can also be done 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.499
 i in principle ensenyament schools highlight are careless 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:34.539
 Although we already presented the first idea, we already know what London is 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:37.189
 window because it is cut 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:38.270
 rectangles 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.080
 pique in letter you can not enable a physical editor and proposals a way to 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.090
 access certain profra functionalities 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.389
 before making certain 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:47.460
 specific perez 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.229
 and that if we can finally generate as sets of organized editors is not 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:53.300
 special position in reality 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.399
 full window 

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:56.240
 in order to do homework 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.520
 This space 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.620
 perfect is the initial conceptual part with sources is quite 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.610
 then the concepts 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.589
 in the letter 

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:08.180
 and we go to the next among the members we go 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.260
 to be talking likewise a configuration exam progressing to play a 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:14.600
 little bit more with the theme of regions and more
