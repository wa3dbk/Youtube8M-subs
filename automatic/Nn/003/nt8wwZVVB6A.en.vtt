really straight and you'll find that
that's<00:01:48.020> an<00:01:48.229> easier<00:01:48.560> way<00:01:48.740> to<00:01:48.770> get<00:01:49.639> to<00:01:49.789> speed

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
that's an easier way to get to speed

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.480 
that's an easier way to get to speed
back<00:01:50.209> also<00:01:51.049> too<00:01:51.139> I<00:01:51.499> hit<00:01:51.889> with<00:01:52.039> my<00:01:52.189> knuckles

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
back also too I hit with my knuckles

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.429 
back also too I hit with my knuckles
because<00:01:52.759> when<00:01:52.909> I'm<00:01:53.060> throwing<00:01:53.569> a<00:01:53.780> punch<00:01:53.959> you

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
because when I'm throwing a punch you

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.349 
because when I'm throwing a punch you
know<00:01:54.590> I'm<00:01:54.649> fighting<00:01:55.189> someone<00:01:55.639> or<00:01:55.880> protect

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
know I'm fighting someone or protect

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.359 
know I'm fighting someone or protect
myself<00:01:56.569> that's<00:01:57.139> how<00:01:57.350> I'm<00:01:57.530> punching<00:01:57.979> I'm<00:01:58.130> not

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
myself that's how I'm punching I'm not

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.539 
myself that's how I'm punching I'm not
punching<00:01:58.670> with<00:01:58.969> the<00:01:59.090> side<00:01:59.329> of<00:01:59.359> my<00:01:59.539> hand<00:02:00.279> and<00:02:01.279> in

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
punching with the side of my hand and in

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.379 
punching with the side of my hand and in
boxing<00:02:02.090> it's<00:02:02.240> not<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.479> legal<00:02:02.749> punch<00:02:03.639> now<00:02:04.639> the

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:05.389 
boxing it's not a legal punch now the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:07.269 
boxing it's not a legal punch now the
Hema<00:02:05.630> fit<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:06.049> side<00:02:06.259> hammer<00:02:06.529> fist<00:02:06.829> that<00:02:07.069> will

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:07.279 
Hema fit the side hammer fist that will

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:09.010 
Hema fit the side hammer fist that will
work<00:02:07.459> when<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:07.969> want<00:02:07.999> to<00:02:08.270> be<00:02:08.390> directed<00:02:08.899> back

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
work when you want to be directed back

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.719 
work when you want to be directed back
so<00:02:09.259> a<00:02:09.289> lot<00:02:09.530> of<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.740> times<00:02:09.950> I'll<00:02:10.160> throw<00:02:10.429> that

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
so a lot of the times I'll throw that

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.240 
so a lot of the times I'll throw that
right<00:02:10.880> hand<00:02:11.180> I'll<00:02:12.170> actually<00:02:12.770> hit<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.129> with<00:02:13.220> a

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
right hand I'll actually hit it with a

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.820 
right hand I'll actually hit it with a
side<00:02:13.519> of<00:02:13.549> my<00:02:13.760> hand<00:02:14.000> nll<00:02:14.450> through<00:02:15.049> a<00:02:15.080> hook

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
side of my hand nll through a hook

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.530 
side of my hand nll through a hook
so<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.220> redirects<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.850> speed<00:02:17.150> bag<00:02:17.300> that

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
so that redirects the speed bag that

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.980 
so that redirects the speed bag that
makes<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.810> easier<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.410> hit<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:19.460> way<00:02:19.990> in

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
makes it easier to hit it that way in

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.170 
makes it easier to hit it that way in
boxing<00:02:21.830> what<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.130> used<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.580> do<00:02:22.730> when<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:22.970> was

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
boxing what I used to do when I was

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.840 
boxing what I used to do when I was
fighting<00:02:24.080> is<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.950> would<00:02:25.100> throw<00:02:25.220> my<00:02:25.400> right<00:02:25.580> hand

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
fighting is I would throw my right hand

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.010 
fighting is I would throw my right hand
out<00:02:26.030> there<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.390> wouldn't<00:02:26.660> bring<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.840> back

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
out there and I wouldn't bring it back

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.800 
out there and I wouldn't bring it back

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
punches it's working on your mechanics

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.830 
punches it's working on your mechanics
you<00:04:38.930> know<00:04:39.140> it's<00:04:40.030> moving<00:04:41.030> from<00:04:41.240> side<00:04:41.510> to<00:04:41.810> side

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
you know it's moving from side to side

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.020 
you know it's moving from side to side
and<00:04:42.440> when<00:04:42.650> you<00:04:42.740> move<00:04:42.950> from<00:04:43.100> side<00:04:43.400> to<00:04:43.640> side<00:04:43.669> and

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
and when you move from side to side and

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.930 
and when you move from side to side and
you<00:04:44.120> transfer<00:04:44.630> your<00:04:44.660> weight<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:46.460> are<00:04:46.640> moving

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
you transfer your weight you are moving

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.850 
you transfer your weight you are moving
your<00:04:47.240> head<00:04:47.390> and<00:04:47.570> that's<00:04:47.780> very<00:04:47.990> important<00:04:48.710> when

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
your head and that's very important when

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.250 
your head and that's very important when
you're<00:04:49.070> your<00:04:49.700> husband<00:04:50.360> you<00:04:50.510> just<00:04:50.720> want<00:04:50.930> to<00:04:51.169> be

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
you're your husband you just want to be

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.010 
you're your husband you just want to be
able<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.890> come<00:04:52.760> from<00:04:53.030> different<00:04:53.300> angles<00:04:53.900> and

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
able to come from different angles and

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.390 
able to come from different angles and
that's<00:04:57.020> what's<00:04:57.229> great<00:04:57.440> about<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.919> speed<00:04:58.190> bag

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
that's what's great about the speed bag

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.659 
that's what's great about the speed bag
is<00:04:58.610> because<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:59.870> speed<00:05:00.229> bag<00:05:00.410> is<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:01.039> size<00:05:01.460> of

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
is because the speed bag is the size of

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.600 
is because the speed bag is the size of
someone's<00:05:02.180> head<00:05:02.440> so<00:05:03.440> it's<00:05:03.770> a<00:05:03.890> great<00:05:04.070> tool<00:05:04.550> to

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
someone's head so it's a great tool to

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.670 
someone's head so it's a great tool to
practicing<00:05:05.360> but<00:05:05.960> when<00:05:06.110> you<00:05:06.200> hit<00:05:06.380> me<00:05:06.470> let<00:05:06.590> me

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
practicing but when you hit me let me

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.170 
practicing but when you hit me let me
decide<00:05:07.010> you<00:05:07.220> here<00:05:07.370> you<00:05:07.550> see<00:05:07.729> if<00:05:07.849> I'm<00:05:08.000> hitting

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
decide you here you see if I'm hitting

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.670 
decide you here you see if I'm hitting
look<00:05:08.419> aside<00:05:08.660> my<00:05:08.840> hand<00:05:09.080> like<00:05:09.169> that<00:05:09.229> like<00:05:09.590> a

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
look aside my hand like that like a

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.490 
look aside my hand like that like a
logical<00:05:09.860> I'm<00:05:10.700> really<00:05:11.479> close<00:05:11.690> i<00:05:11.990> don't<00:05:12.020> want<00:05:12.260> to

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
logical I'm really close i don't want to

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.980 
logical I'm really close i don't want to
be<00:05:12.530> 12<00:05:12.919> like<00:05:13.160> that<00:05:13.370> I'm<00:05:13.760> vulnerable<00:05:14.210> when<00:05:14.870> I'm

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
be 12 like that I'm vulnerable when I'm

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.010 
be 12 like that I'm vulnerable when I'm
hitter<00:05:15.229> like<00:05:15.500> with<00:05:16.039> my<00:05:16.220> knuckle<00:05:16.729> you<00:05:17.630> can<00:05:17.840> see

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
hitter like with my knuckle you can see

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.369 
hitter like with my knuckle you can see
how<00:05:18.200> far<00:05:18.590> further<00:05:19.070> away

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:24.379 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:29.659 

wake<00:05:25.379> up<00:05:25.619> a<00:05:26.629> lot<00:05:27.629> easier<00:05:28.129> when<00:05:29.129> you<00:05:29.219> can<00:05:29.279> still

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
wake up a lot easier when you can still

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.959 
wake up a lot easier when you can still
throw<00:05:29.879> your<00:05:30.209> hooks<00:05:30.449> without<00:05:30.809> warning<00:05:31.319> and

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:34.969 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.129 

then<00:05:35.969> you<00:05:36.119> could<00:05:36.299> stop<00:05:36.569> it<00:05:36.749> like<00:05:36.899> that<00:05:37.079> and

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
then you could stop it like that and

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.639 
then you could stop it like that and
that's<00:05:37.529> a<00:05:38.360> thing<00:05:39.360> that<00:05:39.419> takes<00:05:39.989> a<00:05:40.110> long<00:05:40.289> time<00:05:40.349> to

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:40.649 
that's a thing that takes a long time to

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:42.559 
that's a thing that takes a long time to
learn<00:05:40.919> how<00:05:40.979> to<00:05:41.249> do<00:05:41.399> and<00:05:41.849> I'll<00:05:42.029> do<00:05:42.299> it<00:05:42.329> on<00:05:42.509> one

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569 
learn how to do and I'll do it on one
