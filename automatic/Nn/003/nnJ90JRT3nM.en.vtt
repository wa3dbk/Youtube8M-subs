00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
style like this one one that's more

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.620 
style like this one one that's more
intricate<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.320> can<00:00:34.739> wear<00:00:35.550> multiple<00:00:36.059> days

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.240 
without having to redo it that's even
better<00:00:39.270> because<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:40.320> means<00:00:40.469> not<00:00:40.739> only<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.040> my

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
better because that means not only is my

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.459 
better because that means not only is my
hair<00:00:41.430> protected<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.540> then<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:43.020> less

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
hair protected but then it's less
