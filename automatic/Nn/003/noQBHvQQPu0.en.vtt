 good happy to be here in the return to

 colombia and well we hope to catch a little 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.910
 more level because after the return 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.370
 we stopped some time and well we hope 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.490
 take a little bit of level and try to 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.280
 look for a stage not this year as has 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.389
 been the balance of the team nor in Europe 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.919
 well I think it's good with what 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.220
 we did in the giro d'italia and with what 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.260
 we have done I think it has been quite 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.630
 positive and we hope to finish the 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.160
 season in italy very well where all 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.910
 let's be satisfied with the turn of 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.130
 Italy 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.990
 I did expect to win but good was 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.800
 difficult but I was always among the 10 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.330
 disputing time with these expectations 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.550
 of the return colombia 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.530
 take level to finish the season 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.210
 Oscar Sevilla the current champion of 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.580
 back to colombia the team depends on 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.289
 the metropolitan area to defend that 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.360
 last year's title man 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.190
 let's try to defend it obviously 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.630
 as I say with great respect towards the 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.480
 rivals there are no great teams 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.310
 conformed many very strong rivals 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.100
 for very well I have a great team like 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.780
 that pm a metropolitan area and the habit 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.330
 of cycling not the show the 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.400
 emotion on my part I feel good as 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.920
 I say I have prepared the return the 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.560
 health awareness has accompanied me 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.470
 and I feel physically and mentally 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.600
 prepared to face this new challenge 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.460
 hopefully we can get to Medellin 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.840
 winners if it's not like that 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.970
 calm and satisfied with my result 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.000
 and make it stronger I do not think that the 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.890
 cycling is a very beautiful sport that 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.200
 exciting and that until the last day there 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.300
 is going to know that more elements for 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.830
 analyze very strong rivals not every 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.170
 once the rivals are more professional 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.390
 there are more and more quality equipment 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.630
 are conformed but that is going to be a 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.210
 return 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.090
 very disputed with many rivals I do not think 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.560
 that there is a minimum deck of 15 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.350
 runners who can wait for the title 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.500
 and it's going to be a very open race where 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.910
 it's going to run very fast an article in 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.490
 cycling world precisely where 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.820
 I said all against Sevilla with this yes 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.050
 I think it has a reference, obviously not 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.000
 take a run against the last champion 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.770
 also the season this year been very 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.170
 good for me we have achieved many 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.520
 triumphs and I think it's going to be like that but 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.680
 well I think there will be many 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.690
 teams that want to play their race 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.860
 do your career tactic and now that 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.140
 it has been a very open race very 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.640
 disputed there are very strong runners and 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.400
 very aggressive as it is Felix Cardenas 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.900
 eat rujano and I think they are not going to 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.180
 be still to my wheel I do not think they're going 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.890
 to be the ones that are going to hurt and I think 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.540
 it's going to be a race from the morning 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.540
 very moved and very fast
