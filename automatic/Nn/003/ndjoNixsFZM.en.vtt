00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
want I need three different boards but

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.760 
want I need three different boards but
it<00:00:57.270> they<00:00:57.510> should<00:00:57.719> all<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> Dan<00:00:58.379> Brizzy

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
it they should all be the Dan Brizzy

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.920 
it they should all be the Dan Brizzy
experience<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.149> what<00:01:00.359> they<00:01:00.449> did<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.629> they<00:01:00.780> gave

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
experience so what they did is they gave

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.930 
experience so what they did is they gave
him<00:01:01.140> all<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.469> horsepower<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.670> he<00:01:02.760> needs

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
him all that horsepower that he needs

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.820 
him all that horsepower that he needs
inside<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:03.989> they<00:01:04.110> come<00:01:04.320> with<00:01:04.470> three

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
inside and then they come with three

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.320 
inside and then they come with three
separate<00:01:05.489> profiles<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.640> comes<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.060> three

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
separate profiles so it comes in three

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.030 
separate profiles so it comes in three
sizes<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:10.020> 151<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:11.130> 154<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.510> 157<00:01:13.369> so<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.659> 151

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
sizes a 151 a 154 and a 157 so your 151

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.520 
sizes a 151 a 154 and a 157 so your 151
that<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.930> your<00:01:18.930> zero<00:01:19.259> camber

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
that is going to have your zero camber

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.740 
that is going to have your zero camber
in<00:01:20.070> between<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> feet<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.330> gonna<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
in between the feet this is gonna be the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.960 
in between the feet this is gonna be the
jib<00:01:21.900> deck<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> 151<00:01:23.070> check<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.880> my

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
jib deck on the 151 check out in my

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.429 
jib deck on the 151 check out in my
hands<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:24.390> now<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:25.080> gonna<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
hands right now it's gonna have the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.480 
hands right now it's gonna have the
rocker<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.270> got<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.509> your<00:01:27.570> FK

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
rocker here and then you got to your FK

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.490 
rocker here and then you got to your FK
so<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.909> gonna<00:01:30.090> be<00:01:30.329> super<00:01:30.810> easy<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.200> maneuver

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
so it's gonna be super easy to maneuver

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.800 
so it's gonna be super easy to maneuver
at<00:01:31.590> low<00:01:31.740> speeds<00:01:32.070> high<00:01:32.369> speeds<00:01:32.729> jibin<00:01:33.240> lock

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
at low speeds high speeds jibin lock

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.920 
at low speeds high speeds jibin lock

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and then it's not going to have that FK

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.000 
and then it's not going to have that FK
it's<00:02:10.679> just<00:02:10.800> gonna<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.099> nice

for<00:02:29.560> going<00:02:29.650> huge<00:02:30.129> in<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.489> steeps<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.060> deeps

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
for going huge in the steeps and deeps

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.429 
for going huge in the steeps and deeps
and<00:02:32.290> then<00:02:32.500> this<00:02:32.709> one<00:02:32.950> actually<00:02:33.219> goes<00:02:33.579> back<00:02:34.439> to

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
and then this one actually goes back to

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.089 
and then this one actually goes back to
that<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:37.629> Freestyle<00:02:38.170> but<00:02:38.409> it's<00:02:38.530> got<00:02:38.739> the

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
that the Freestyle but it's got the

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.920 
so it keeps you super floating really
floats<00:02:47.530> super<00:02:48.459> well<00:02:48.639> but<00:02:49.209> it<00:02:49.299> also<00:02:49.329> worked

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
floats super well but it also worked

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.409 
floats super well but it also worked
really<00:02:50.530> really<00:02:50.889> well

that it's going to come to the nitty

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.039 
that it's going to come to the nitty
gritty<00:03:20.379> in<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:21.069> base<00:03:22.000> of<00:03:22.209> this<00:03:22.329> guy<00:03:22.659> you're

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
gritty in the base of this guy you're

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.449 
gritty in the base of this guy you're
gonna<00:03:23.169> have<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:25.260> let's<00:03:26.260> see<00:03:26.440> wax<00:03:26.859> infused

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.099 
gonna have the let's see wax infused
rotation<00:03:28.000> centered<00:03:28.359> base<00:03:28.540> so<00:03:28.840> it's<00:03:28.959> going<00:03:29.049> to

bamboo<00:03:59.290> is<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.590> super<00:04:00.280> sustainable<00:04:02.159> it<00:04:03.159> just

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
bamboo is a super sustainable it just

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.719 
bamboo is a super sustainable it just
it's<00:04:03.729> grows<00:04:04.720> insanely<00:04:05.530> fast<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:06.370> the

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
it's grows insanely fast and the

it's<00:04:08.949> also<00:04:09.159> very<00:04:09.609> fluid<00:04:10.359> and<00:04:10.449> snappy<00:04:11.019> so

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
it's also very fluid and snappy so

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.409 
it's also very fluid and snappy so
you're<00:04:11.620> gonna<00:04:11.709> get<00:04:11.919> tons<00:04:12.489> of<00:04:12.849> snap<00:04:13.180> out<00:04:13.389> of

you're gonna get tons of snap out of

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.929 
you're gonna get tons of snap out of
this<00:04:13.569> board<00:04:13.959> they<00:04:14.889> went<00:04:15.069> instead<00:04:15.370> of<00:04:15.519> the
