00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.670 
I will do a review of my Optimus Prime
which<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.399> standing<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.750> left<00:00:46.050> corner

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
which is standing in the left corner

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.290 
which is standing in the left corner
so<00:00:47.250> I'll<00:00:47.550> drone<00:00:47.940> him<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.750> also<00:00:49.200> my<00:00:49.680> custom

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
so I'll drone him and also my custom

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.380 
so I'll drone him and also my custom
Thundercracker<00:00:51.300> he's<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> Decepticon<00:00:52.320> too<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
Thundercracker he's a Decepticon too and

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.760 
Thundercracker he's a Decepticon too and
so<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:54.840> not<00:00:55.110> about<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.649> we<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:57.770> reviewing

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
so but not about it we just reviewing

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.490 
so but not about it we just reviewing
today<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.340> Megatron<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.690> there's<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.260> front

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
today the Megatron so there's the front

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.119 
today the Megatron so there's the front
look<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:01.949> him<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.789> side<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.989> back<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
look at him the side the back and the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.080 
look at him the side the back and the
other<00:01:05.250> side<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.939> think<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:07.640> done<00:01:08.640> him<00:01:08.880> well

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
other side so I think I done him well

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.350 
other side so I think I done him well
well<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.750> got<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.010> exhaust<00:01:11.670> pipe<00:01:12.030> short

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
well and got this exhaust pipe short

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.609 
well and got this exhaust pipe short
here<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.130> although<00:01:14.659> actually<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.900> design<00:01:16.290> is

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
here and although actually the design is

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.210 
here and although actually the design is
quite<00:01:16.920> nice<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.729> really<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.600> him<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.220> let's

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
quite nice I really like him and let's

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.480 
quite nice I really like him and let's
get<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.390> transformation<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.590> what

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
get on to the transformation and what

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.580 
get on to the transformation and what
you're<00:01:23.700> gonna<00:01:23.850> do<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.299> just<00:01:24.330> simply<00:01:24.930> push

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
you're gonna do you just simply push

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.660 
you're gonna do you just simply push
this<00:01:25.830> pieces<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:26.840> into<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.350> sides<00:01:28.680> into<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
this pieces like into the sides into the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.819 
this pieces like into the sides into the
left<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.119> into<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.840> right<00:01:31.020> or<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.560> just

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
left and into the right or you can just

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.600 
left and into the right or you can just
push<00:01:32.549> them<00:01:32.670> off<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.090> put<00:01:33.960> again<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.610> this

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
push them off and put again and this

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.179 
push them off and put again and this
will<00:01:35.909> actually<00:01:36.509> form<00:01:36.810> your<00:01:37.020> legs<00:01:37.320> what<00:01:38.070> you're

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
will actually form your legs what you're

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.800 
will actually form your legs what you're
gonna<00:01:38.310> do<00:01:38.579> next<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.450> put<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> arms<00:01:41.810> to

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
gonna do next is just put the arms to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.469 
gonna do next is just put the arms to
the<00:01:42.960> sides<00:01:43.290> then<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.549> see<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.909> joints

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
the sides then you can see this joints

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.560 
the sides then you can see this joints
you<00:01:45.750> rotate<00:01:46.350> them<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:46.920> rotate<00:01:47.369> actually<00:01:47.939> just

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you rotate them not rotate actually just

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
you rotate them not rotate actually just
put<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.439> position<00:01:49.850> then<00:01:50.850> you're<00:01:51.470> put<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
put in this position then you're put the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.660 
put in this position then you're put the
head<00:01:53.180> around<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.320> your<00:01:55.710> Megatron

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
head around and you have your Megatron

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.209 
head around and you have your Megatron
in<00:01:56.939> your<00:01:57.710> robot<00:01:58.710> mode

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
in your robot mode

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.050 
in your robot mode
so<00:01:59.640> actually<00:02:00.299> wear<00:02:00.689> nice<00:02:01.340> robot<00:02:02.340> mode<00:02:02.579> for<00:02:02.909> me

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
so actually wear nice robot mode for me

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.530 
so actually wear nice robot mode for me
I<00:02:03.090> think<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:04.740> face<00:02:04.979> looks<00:02:05.310> like<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.000> g1

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
I think the face looks like it's a g1

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.300 
I think the face looks like it's a g1
toy<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.560> try<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:07.979> make<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.580> as<00:02:10.039> Dark<00:02:11.039> Side<00:02:11.250> of

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
toy but I try to make it as Dark Side of

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.230 
toy but I try to make it as Dark Side of
the<00:02:11.489> Moon<00:02:11.610> possible<00:02:12.450> as<00:02:12.629> I

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
the Moon possible as I

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.660 
the Moon possible as I
could<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:15.090> yeah<00:02:16.090> but<00:02:16.630> I<00:02:16.930> had<00:02:17.350> no<00:02:17.590> faces<00:02:18.220> for<00:02:18.520> the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
could so yeah but I had no faces for the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.150 
could so yeah but I had no faces for the
make<00:02:18.820> more<00:02:19.690> accurate<00:02:19.900> faces<00:02:20.770> for<00:02:20.980> the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
make more accurate faces for the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.800 
make more accurate faces for the
Megatron<00:02:21.730> neither<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:22.750> so<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:24.300> was<00:02:25.300> this<00:02:25.510> and

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
Megatron neither this so I was this and

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.580 
Megatron neither this so I was this and
yeah<00:02:26.770> so<00:02:27.490> he<00:02:27.730> got<00:02:27.910> his<00:02:28.180> possible<00:02:28.780> arms<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.380> can

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
yeah so he got his possible arms you can

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.990 
yeah so he got his possible arms you can
move<00:02:29.890> them<00:02:30.160> forward<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.390> backward<00:02:33.000> actually

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
move them forward and backward actually

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.740 
move them forward and backward actually
to<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.330> sides<00:02:34.600> too<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:35.730> get<00:02:36.730> his<00:02:37.000> little

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
to the sides too and get his little

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.270 
to the sides too and get his little
fingers<00:02:38.580> just<00:02:39.580> actually<00:02:40.120> too<00:02:40.450> but<00:02:41.010> not<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.040> big

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
fingers just actually too but not a big

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.600 
fingers just actually too but not a big
deal<00:02:42.490> actually<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.330> think<00:02:43.560> there<00:02:44.560> if<00:02:44.800> his<00:02:45.010> mad

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
deal actually I think there if his mad

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.560 
deal actually I think there if his mad
tires<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:47.340> his<00:02:48.340> legs<00:02:48.670> are<00:02:48.850> designed<00:02:49.330> they<00:02:49.540> are

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
tires and his legs are designed they are

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.730 
tires and his legs are designed they are
movable<00:02:50.110> too<00:02:50.410> which<00:02:51.130> is<00:02:51.280> very<00:02:51.310> very<00:02:51.730> nice<00:02:52.740> his

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
movable too which is very very nice his

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.460 
movable too which is very very nice his
face<00:02:53.950> is<00:02:54.160> from<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.760> kre-o<00:02:55.090> transformers<00:02:55.630> and

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
face is from the kre-o transformers and

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.330 
face is from the kre-o transformers and
it<00:02:57.190> looks<00:02:57.490> like<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.850> g1<00:02:58.480> but<00:02:58.870> still<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.650> like<00:03:00.010> the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
it looks like a g1 but still I like the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.420 
it looks like a g1 but still I like the
g1<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.720> movie<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.740> toys<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.010> have

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
g1 the movie and the toys that have

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.880 
g1 the movie and the toys that have
released<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.950> 80s<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.170> think<00:03:08.230> that's<00:03:08.680> it

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
released in the 80s so I think that's it

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.630 
released in the 80s so I think that's it
of<00:03:09.040> my<00:03:09.340> Megatron<00:03:10.050> figure<00:03:11.050> actually<00:03:11.500> I've<00:03:12.190> made

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
of my Megatron figure actually I've made

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.890 
of my Megatron figure actually I've made
for<00:03:13.000> him<00:03:13.210> his<00:03:13.510> dark<00:03:14.290> Energon<00:03:15.040> sort<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:16.600> blood

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
for him his dark Energon sort the blood

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.120 
for him his dark Energon sort the blood
of<00:03:17.340> Unicron<00:03:18.340> sort<00:03:19.210> but<00:03:19.870> actually<00:03:20.710> this<00:03:20.950> is

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
of Unicron sort but actually this is

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.280 
of Unicron sort but actually this is
from<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:22.350> new<00:03:23.880> cartoon<00:03:24.960> Transformers<00:03:25.960> Prime

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
from the new cartoon Transformers Prime

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.160 
from the new cartoon Transformers Prime
beast<00:03:26.400> hunters<00:03:27.400> or<00:03:27.820> not<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.420> beast<00:03:28.660> hunters

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
beast hunters or not a beast hunters

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.520 
beast hunters or not a beast hunters
maybe<00:03:29.530> from<00:03:29.860> season<00:03:30.250> 2<00:03:30.460> actually<00:03:31.120> too<00:03:31.330> but<00:03:32.050> I

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
maybe from season 2 actually too but I

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.040 
maybe from season 2 actually too but I
think<00:03:32.890> it's<00:03:33.280> not<00:03:33.490> very<00:03:34.120> accurate<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.900> the

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
think it's not very accurate to the

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.190 
think it's not very accurate to the
movie<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:36.070> sword<00:03:36.430> cause<00:03:36.760> but<00:03:37.270> you<00:03:37.480> can<00:03:37.870> hold

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
movie the sword cause but you can hold

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.420 
movie the sword cause but you can hold
it<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.550> his<00:03:39.820> arms<00:03:40.300> actually<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.220> she<00:03:42.220> looks

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
it to his arms actually and she looks

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.960 
it to his arms actually and she looks
like<00:03:42.520> this<00:03:42.850> where<00:03:43.300> giant<00:03:43.810> sword<00:03:44.080> it's<00:03:44.380> like<00:03:44.680> a

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
like this where giant sword it's like a

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.750 
like this where giant sword it's like a
mess<00:03:45.970> on<00:03:46.330> in<00:03:46.870> his<00:03:47.200> arm<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.950> don't<00:03:48.010> feel<00:03:48.460> like

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
mess on in his arm and I don't feel like

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.210 
mess on in his arm and I don't feel like
it<00:03:48.970> I<00:03:49.120> will<00:03:49.270> be<00:03:49.980> making<00:03:50.980> more<00:03:51.550> of<00:03:51.700> those<00:03:51.910> but<00:03:52.240> in

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
it I will be making more of those but in

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.640 
it I will be making more of those but in
better<00:03:54.220> condition<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.240> think<00:03:55.270> and<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.230> will<00:03:56.470> not

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
better condition I think and it will not

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.120 
better condition I think and it will not
be<00:03:56.710> so<00:03:57.160> bulky<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:58.510> will<00:03:58.720> be<00:03:58.870> like<00:03:59.110> in<00:03:59.380> Optimus

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
be so bulky it will be like in Optimus

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.870 
be so bulky it will be like in Optimus
Prime's<00:04:00.630> Sentinel<00:04:01.630> sword<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:02.640> actually<00:04:03.640> I'll
