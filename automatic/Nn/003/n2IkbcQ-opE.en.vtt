2008 like I said 5.3 liter and I'll just
show<00:00:37.840> you<00:00:37.870> that<00:00:39.000> cylinder<00:00:40.000> that<00:00:40.120> was

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
show you that cylinder that was

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.500 
show you that cylinder that was
misfiring<00:00:40.780> was<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:41.469> number<00:00:41.739> seven<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.510> if

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
misfiring was the number seven and if

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.490 
misfiring was the number seven and if
you're<00:00:43.690> looking<00:00:44.019> at<00:00:44.140> the<00:00:44.230> front<00:00:44.379> of<00:00:44.440> your

one<00:01:22.299> of<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.479> things<00:01:22.689> I<00:01:22.869> invested<00:01:23.290> in<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.439> little

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
one of the things I invested in a little

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.770 
one of the things I invested in a little
while<00:01:23.829> back<00:01:24.040> it's<00:01:24.490> been<00:01:24.640> pretty<00:01:24.850> handy<00:01:25.240> as<00:01:25.360> one

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
while back it's been pretty handy as one

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.960 
while back it's been pretty handy as one
of<00:01:25.840> these<00:01:25.930> sparkplug<00:01:26.530> pullers<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.130> I

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
of these sparkplug pullers and I

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.420 
of these sparkplug pullers and I
probably<00:01:28.840> got<00:01:29.020> swindled<00:01:29.320> on<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.740> price<00:01:30.009> just

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
probably got swindled on the price just

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.270 
probably got swindled on the price just
for<00:01:30.869> what<00:01:31.869> they<00:01:32.020> were<00:01:32.079> or<00:01:32.770> where<00:01:32.950> I<00:01:32.979> bought

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.810 

yeah<00:01:46.940> it's<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:47.659> knuckle<00:01:48.050> Buster<00:01:48.550> all<00:01:49.550> right

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
yeah it's a knuckle Buster all right

yeah it's a knuckle Buster all right
there<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:50.479> go<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.930> spring<00:01:51.200> should<00:01:51.440> be<00:01:51.590> still

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
there you go the spring should be still

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.249 
there you go the spring should be still
in<00:01:52.040> that

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.390 

and<00:01:59.259> just<00:01:59.500> let<00:01:59.680> that<00:01:59.860> hang<00:02:02.130> see<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:03.189> just

and just let that hang see you just

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.790 
and just let that hang see you just
remember<00:02:05.729> use<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.759> sparkplug<00:02:07.450> cooler<00:02:07.800> it's

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
remember use the sparkplug cooler it's

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.529 
remember use the sparkplug cooler it's
uh<00:02:09.130> usually<00:02:09.700> comes<00:02:09.940> with<00:02:10.090> most<00:02:10.330> your

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
and number 8 cylinders they're by far

00:02:50.659 --> 00:03:02.860 
and number 8 cylinders they're by far
the<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.859> hardest<00:02:52.220> ones<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:53.439> to<00:02:54.439> change<00:03:01.870> he's

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
the the hardest ones to to change he's

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.850 
the the hardest ones to to change he's
in<00:03:03.019> there<00:03:03.170> pretty<00:03:03.200> good

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
once you get it loose maybe able to

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.750 
once you get it loose maybe able to
reach<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:15.500> like<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.650> said<00:03:16.920> number<00:03:17.159> seven<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:17.730> the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
reach in like I said number seven is the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.390 
reach in like I said number seven is the
hardest<00:03:18.260> well<00:03:19.260> number<00:03:19.530> seven<00:03:19.890> number<00:03:20.220> eight

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
hardest well number seven number eight

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.220 
hardest well number seven number eight
number<00:03:20.849> eight<00:03:21.030> probably<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.049> hardest<00:03:22.519> but

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
number eight probably the hardest but

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.300 
number eight probably the hardest but
because<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.530> don't<00:03:25.620> have<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:25.890> whole<00:03:26.129> lot<00:03:26.280> of

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
because you don't have a whole lot of

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.690 
because you don't have a whole lot of
room<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.989> twist<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:31.190> once<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.310> get<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.580> started

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
room to twist it once you get it started

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.339 
room to twist it once you get it started
you<00:03:33.510> should<00:03:33.540> be<00:03:33.810> able<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.220> reach<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:36.349> use

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
you should be able to reach in and use

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:47.080 
you should be able to reach in and use
your<00:03:37.530> fingers<00:03:42.379> okay

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.150 

all<00:03:47.690> right<00:03:47.840> guys<00:03:47.989> now<00:03:48.020> if<00:03:48.349> you<00:03:48.560> get<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.860> spark

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
all right guys now if you get the spark

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.699 
all right guys now if you get the spark
plug<00:03:49.400> out<00:03:50.410> obviously<00:03:53.050> let's<00:03:54.050> put<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.560> new

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
plug out obviously let's put the new

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.650 
plug out obviously let's put the new
spark<00:03:55.069> plug<00:03:55.280> in<00:03:55.550> like<00:03:55.970> I<00:03:56.090> said<00:03:56.330> this<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.630> the

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
spark plug in like I said this is the

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.479 
spark plug in like I said this is the
number<00:03:57.020> seven<00:03:57.410> doesn't<00:03:58.160> matter<00:03:59.230> on<00:04:00.230> GM<00:04:00.739> you

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
number seven doesn't matter on GM you

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.080 
number seven doesn't matter on GM you
want<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.790> gap<00:04:01.959> 3.40

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
want the gap 3.40

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.490 
want the gap 3.40
so<00:04:05.560> after<00:04:06.560> you<00:04:06.650> get<00:04:06.739> that<00:04:06.920> down<00:04:08.050> and<00:04:09.050> you

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
so after you get that down and you

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.589 
so after you get that down and you
adjust<00:04:09.800> the<00:04:09.950> gap<00:04:10.160> just<00:04:11.030> going<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.239> put<00:04:11.390> it<00:04:11.480> back

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
adjust the gap just going to put it back

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.850 
adjust the gap just going to put it back
in<00:04:12.190> and<00:04:13.190> I'll<00:04:13.630> try<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:14.690> show<00:04:14.900> you<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:15.080> lease

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
in and I'll try to show you the lease

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.759 
in and I'll try to show you the lease
how<00:04:16.040> I<00:04:16.070> do<00:04:16.250> it<00:04:17.440> it's<00:04:18.440> going<00:04:18.530> to<00:04:18.590> be<00:04:18.680> the

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
how I do it it's going to be the

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.990 
how I do it it's going to be the
opposite<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.310> took<00:04:19.579> it<00:04:19.700> out<00:04:21.040> but<00:04:22.040> you<00:04:22.639> have<00:04:22.820> to

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
opposite I took it out but you have to

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.719 
opposite I took it out but you have to
make<00:04:23.180> sure<00:04:23.650> that<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.889> threads<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:27.729> get

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
make sure that the threads and get

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.210 
make sure that the threads and get
started<00:04:29.270> you<00:04:30.169> know<00:04:30.290> so<00:04:30.530> that<00:04:30.560> it<00:04:30.860> goes<00:04:31.010> in

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
started you know so that it goes in

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.940 
started you know so that it goes in
straight<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:31.850> it's<00:04:32.000> hard<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.270> use<00:04:32.450> a<00:04:32.950> ratchet

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
straight so it's hard to use a ratchet

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.870 
straight so it's hard to use a ratchet
at<00:04:34.310> first<00:04:34.930> kind<00:04:35.930> of<00:04:36.080> have<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.470> reach<00:04:36.979> in<00:04:37.250> and<00:04:37.370> do

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
at first kind of have to reach in and do

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.300 
at first kind of have to reach in and do
it<00:04:38.000> with<00:04:38.120> your<00:04:38.240> hand<00:04:38.919> finding<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:40.010> hole<00:04:40.160> of

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
it with your hand finding the hole of

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.969 
it with your hand finding the hole of
course<00:04:40.520> on<00:04:40.729> number<00:04:40.940> seven<00:04:41.500> also<00:04:42.500> very<00:04:42.740> hard

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
course on number seven also very hard

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.460 
course on number seven also very hard
but<00:04:43.660> once<00:04:44.660> you<00:04:44.780> kind<00:04:45.020> of<00:04:45.050> fill<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:46.190> hole<00:04:47.470> get

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
but once you kind of fill the hole get

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.719 
but once you kind of fill the hole get
it<00:04:48.590> started<00:04:48.919> with<00:04:49.010> your<00:04:49.100> fingers

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
it started with your fingers

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.980 
it started with your fingers
stop<00:04:50.690> trying<00:04:50.960> to<00:04:51.020> drop<00:04:51.260> it<00:04:52.600> once<00:04:53.600> you<00:04:53.750> get<00:04:53.900> it

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
stop trying to drop it once you get it

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.450 
stop trying to drop it once you get it
started<00:04:54.350> you<00:04:54.850> can<00:04:55.850> fill<00:04:56.060> it<00:04:56.210> going<00:04:57.020> in<00:04:57.140> smooth

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
started you can fill it going in smooth

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.730 
started you can fill it going in smooth
you<00:04:58.460> can<00:04:58.640> put<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:58.940> ratchet<00:04:59.240> on<00:04:59.360> it<00:04:59.740> one

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
you can put the ratchet on it one

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.440 
you can put the ratchet on it one
suggest<00:05:01.160> just<00:05:01.370> try<00:05:01.520> to<00:05:01.580> go<00:05:01.729> as<00:05:01.850> far<00:05:02.000> as<00:05:02.150> you<00:05:02.240> can

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:44.790 

see<00:05:28.250> what<00:05:28.340> I'm<00:05:28.430> talking<00:05:28.760> about

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
thing left is to put the loop back on

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.629
