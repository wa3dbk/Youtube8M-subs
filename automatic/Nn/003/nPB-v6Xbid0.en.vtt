00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.950 
straight onto the video and as you saw
data<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> location<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.539> where<00:00:30.750> we<00:00:30.929> are

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
data is the location of where we are

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.870 
data is the location of where we are
based<00:00:31.289> now<00:00:31.890> we're<00:00:32.070> going<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.279> be<00:00:32.460> based<00:00:32.730> here

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
based now we're going to be based here

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.170
