00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
decided to name her Claire summer and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.389 
decided to name her Claire summer and
Claire<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.210> after<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> very<00:00:46.260> special<00:00:46.890> friend

and daughter of a very special friend of

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.100 
and daughter of a very special friend of
mine<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.300> thought<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.690> was<00:00:51.989> an

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
mine so I thought that was an

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.950 
mine so I thought that was an
appropriate<00:00:52.370> first<00:00:53.370> name<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.940> she<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.899> don't

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
appropriate first name and she I don't

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.319 
appropriate first name and she I don't
know<00:00:55.199> why<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.379> she<00:00:55.680> does<00:00:56.010> remind<00:00:56.309> me<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.550> clear

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
know why but she does remind me of clear

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.990 
know why but she does remind me of clear
and<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.620> guess<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> long<00:00:59.039> hair<00:00:59.989> also<00:01:00.989> I

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
and then I guess the long hair also I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.520 
and then I guess the long hair also I
picked<00:01:03.000> summer<00:01:03.329> as<00:01:03.539> her<00:01:03.690> middle<00:01:03.989> name<00:01:04.170> because

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
probably be the easiest this is just the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.830 
probably be the easiest this is just the
dream<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.140> daybed<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:33.150> three<00:01:33.360> girls<00:01:33.509> that
