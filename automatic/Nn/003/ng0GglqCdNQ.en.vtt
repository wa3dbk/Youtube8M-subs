I<00:00:54.050> thought<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.290> had<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.649> one<00:00:55.680> reference

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
I thought we had to have one reference

it<00:00:56.730> would<00:00:57.000> be<00:00:57.120> perverse<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.410> knew<00:00:59.130> it

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
would be the Cheshire Cat because I

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.729 
would be the Cheshire Cat because I
think<00:01:02.000> you'd<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.120> cheating<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.930> audience<00:01:04.530> of

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
think you'd be cheating the audience of

think you'd be cheating the audience of
that<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.280> pleasure<00:01:05.550> of<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.030> think<00:01:06.270> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that the pleasure of that I think and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.960 
that the pleasure of that I think and
the<00:01:07.380> way<00:01:07.500> around<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.920> was<00:01:08.130> not<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.820> as
