 well, in some 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.980
 however period is possible us 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.530
 progressed over four years 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.020
 some kind of model we have a number of models 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.410
 target 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.450
 stamp 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.460
 use such extreme speed and 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.829
 probably 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.230

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.020
 Odessa Look 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.390
 enough that is the size of the engine one 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.860
 I view such 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.090
 accounts more powerful for that girl i 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.090
 I remember how proud you were and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.750
 especially not overclocked and 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.650
 stand by the road for a good get and not 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.270
 very useful pipe 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.430
 our fans call the editorial office 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.500
 ask in a very banal question but 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.660
 all the rivers I scared to fly on such 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.900
 tag art 30 km an hour and not scary 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.880
 we train more 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.380
 Well, how to get used to this speed and number 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.380
 choose gradually to 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.540
 six months hard in 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.850
 for easier to understand 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.220
 that's what you think about just go to 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.970
 start and when already in the acorns fly 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.799
 to this historical if you are almost not 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.799
 this look at the nectarine send 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.280
 roads the same situation is read 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.050
 about the power of sentence and 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.050
 not only have to 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.820
 This is already people read here 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.049
 figure driving sewed operation 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.049
 some neighbor 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.979
 such experienced riders broke 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.030
 swim better so she goes to study in 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.369
