00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
clamps all right so with one in I'm

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.890 
clamps all right so with one in I'm
going<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.010> hold<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.280> forward<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.720> make<00:02:33.870> sure

going to hold this forward and make sure

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.600 
going to hold this forward and make sure
it<00:02:34.110> doesn't<00:02:34.290> pull<00:02:34.560> back<00:02:34.770> because<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.130> wants<00:02:35.460> to

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
it doesn't pull back because it wants to

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.670 
it doesn't pull back because it wants to
and<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.820> need<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.060> hold<00:02:36.210> it<00:02:36.330> flat<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.870> forward

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
and then I'm going to tighten this bolt

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.010 
and then I'm going to tighten this bolt
until<00:02:42.320> I<00:02:43.320> get<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.710> little<00:02:44.010> bit<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.400> clamp<00:02:44.700> on

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
until I get a little bit of a clamp on

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.470 
until I get a little bit of a clamp on
this<00:02:46.520> now<00:02:47.520> I've<00:02:47.610> used<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.910> wrench<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.240> I<00:02:48.300> still

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
this now I've used a wrench but I still

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.420 
this now I've used a wrench but I still
don't<00:02:48.600> really<00:02:48.810> have<00:02:49.080> this<00:02:49.260> tight<00:02:49.530> yet<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:50.040> just

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
don't really have this tight yet I just

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.680 
don't really have this tight yet I just
have<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.670> tight<00:02:50.820> enough<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.090> stay<00:02:51.270> on<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.600> now

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
have it tight enough to stay on and now

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.000 
have it tight enough to stay on and now
i'm<00:02:51.810> going<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:51.990> double<00:02:52.410> check<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.830> make<00:02:52.860> sure

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
i'm going to double check to make sure

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.550 
i'm going to double check to make sure
that<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.340> really<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.970> forward<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.750> yes<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.410> is

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
that it really is forward and yes it is

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.710 
that it really is forward and yes it is
and<00:02:55.770> if<00:02:55.830> you<00:02:55.950> look<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.340> can<00:02:56.490> see<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:57.540> is

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
and if you look you can see that this is

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.510 
and if you look you can see that this is
way<00:02:58.050> down<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.530> top<00:02:58.740> of<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.950> weatherstrip

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
way down the top of the weatherstrip

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.270 
way down the top of the weatherstrip
nice<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.540> tight<00:03:00.720> along<00:03:00.990> here<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.470> this<00:03:02.010> rubber

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
nice and tight along here on this rubber

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.760 
nice and tight along here on this rubber
bulb<00:03:02.580> seal<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.080> gives<00:03:04.230> me<00:03:04.320> a<00:03:04.440> great

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
bulb seal and so that gives me a great

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.340 
bulb seal and so that gives me a great
place<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.250> really<00:03:05.400> connect<00:03:05.790> my<00:03:05.910> soft<00:03:06.180> top<00:03:06.420> very

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
place to really connect my soft top very

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.870 
place to really connect my soft top very
obvious<00:03:07.709> where<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:07.920> connects<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.700> should

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
obvious where it connects that should

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.699 
obvious where it connects that should
work<00:03:08.970> great<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.750> I'm<00:03:09.959> going<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.230> now<00:03:10.350> finish

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
work great so I'm going to now finish

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.560 
work great so I'm going to now finish
tightening<00:03:10.950> these<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.580> want<00:03:12.030> these<00:03:12.120> bolts<00:03:12.480> to

this<00:04:54.100> so<00:04:54.370> this<00:04:54.520> is<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.760> left<00:04:54.970> side<00:04:55.210> drivers

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
this so this is the left side drivers

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.110 
this so this is the left side drivers
this<00:04:56.320> is<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.560> right<00:04:56.710> side<00:04:57.010> so<00:04:57.760> I'm<00:04:57.910> going<00:04:58.060> to

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
this is the right side so I'm going to

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.430 
this is the right side so I'm going to
turn<00:04:58.240> it<00:04:58.390> over<00:04:58.510> because<00:04:58.960> that's<00:04:59.290> how<00:04:59.410> I

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
turn it over because that's how I

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.340 
turn it over because that's how I
install<00:05:00.040> it<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:00.490> my<00:05:01.450> two<00:05:01.510> little<00:05:01.810> brackets

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
install it and my two little brackets

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.490 
install it and my two little brackets
are<00:05:02.530> conveniently<00:05:03.010> marked<00:05:03.370> with<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:04.500> lr4

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
are conveniently marked with the lr4

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.500 
are conveniently marked with the lr4
left<00:05:05.710> and<00:05:05.860> right<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:06.340> here's<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.210> tricky

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
left and right and here's the tricky

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.560 
left and right and here's the tricky
part<00:05:07.750> on<00:05:08.020> how<00:05:08.230> these<00:05:08.410> go<00:05:08.590> on<00:05:09.060> they're<00:05:10.060> angled

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
part on how these go on they're angled

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.710 
part on how these go on they're angled
like<00:05:10.780> this<00:05:13.380> they<00:05:14.380> go<00:05:14.590> on<00:05:14.820> with<00:05:15.820> the<00:05:15.970> angle

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
like this they go on with the angle

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.740 
like this they go on with the angle
facing<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.890> front<00:05:18.430> or<00:05:18.760> this<00:05:19.000> little<00:05:19.150> lip<00:05:19.479> on

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
facing the front or this little lip on

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.260 
facing the front or this little lip on
this<00:05:20.080> header<00:05:23.460> once<00:05:24.460> you've<00:05:24.610> got<00:05:24.790> the<00:05:24.940> left<00:05:25.120> and

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
this header once you've got the left and

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.570 
this header once you've got the left and
the<00:05:25.300> right<00:05:25.360> set<00:05:25.750> up<00:05:25.900> the<00:05:26.770> rest<00:05:27.070> of<00:05:27.220> its<00:05:27.370> really

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
the right set up the rest of its really

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.040 
the right set up the rest of its really
simple<00:05:27.760> these<00:05:28.090> little<00:05:28.330> bolts<00:05:28.570> just<00:05:28.720> go<00:05:28.900> in

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
simple these little bolts just go in

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.490 
simple these little bolts just go in
here<00:05:29.350> and<00:05:30.690> it<00:05:31.690> just<00:05:31.720> takes<00:05:32.110> a<00:05:32.200> couple<00:05:32.229> minutes

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
here and it just takes a couple minutes

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.090 
here and it just takes a couple minutes
to<00:05:32.830> get<00:05:32.919> those<00:05:33.100> all<00:05:33.280> attached<00:05:34.650> okay<00:05:35.650> so<00:05:35.710> we're

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
to get those all attached okay so we're

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.440 
to get those all attached okay so we're
back<00:05:36.220> outside<00:05:36.460> now<00:05:36.760> that<00:05:37.090> we've<00:05:37.180> got<00:05:37.330> these

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
back outside now that we've got these

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.730 
back outside now that we've got these
brackets<00:05:37.660> installed<00:05:38.080> we<00:05:38.350> can<00:05:38.410> put<00:05:38.620> this

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
brackets installed we can put this

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.740 
brackets installed we can put this
header<00:05:38.950> on<00:05:39.130> normally<00:05:40.030> at<00:05:40.120> this<00:05:40.150> stage<00:05:40.510> you'd

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
header on normally at this stage you'd

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.780 
header on normally at this stage you'd
have<00:05:40.930> your<00:05:41.080> bikini<00:05:41.470> top<00:05:41.740> snapped<00:05:42.130> on<00:05:42.370> to<00:05:42.550> here

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
have your bikini top snapped on to here

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.430 
have your bikini top snapped on to here
we<00:05:43.270> haven't<00:05:43.510> done<00:05:43.720> that<00:05:43.780> just<00:05:44.169> because<00:05:44.350> it

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
we haven't done that just because it

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.719 
we haven't done that just because it
makes<00:05:44.470> it<00:05:44.680> a<00:05:44.740> little<00:05:44.950> easier<00:05:45.190> to<00:05:45.430> show<00:05:45.700> you

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
makes it a little easier to show you

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.120 
makes it a little easier to show you
exactly<00:05:45.910> how<00:05:46.330> this<00:05:46.419> header<00:05:46.750> connects<00:05:47.260> so<00:05:47.890> just

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
exactly how this header connects so just

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.130 
exactly how this header connects so just
imagine<00:05:48.220> that<00:05:48.820> there's<00:05:48.970> fabric<00:05:49.360> on<00:05:49.479> this<00:05:49.720> and

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
imagine that there's fabric on this and

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
imagine that there's fabric on this and
we're<00:05:50.260> going<00:05:50.350> to<00:05:50.440> put<00:05:50.560> this<00:05:50.680> on<00:05:50.800> our<00:05:50.979> Jeep

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
we're going to put this on our Jeep

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.620 
we're going to put this on our Jeep
we're<00:05:51.940> going<00:05:52.090> to<00:05:52.240> install<00:05:52.870> this<00:05:53.370> using<00:05:54.370> the

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
we're going to install this using the

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.300 
we're going to install this using the
footman<00:05:55.630> blue<00:05:55.810> or<00:05:56.229> the<00:05:56.260> footman<00:05:56.680> bracket<00:05:57.070> on

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
footman blue or the footman bracket on

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.810 
footman blue or the footman bracket on
your<00:05:57.490> Jeep

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
your Jeep

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.800 
your Jeep
and<00:05:59.270> you're<00:05:59.900> going<00:05:59.990> to<00:06:00.050> see<00:06:00.230> how<00:06:00.320> this<00:06:00.470> works

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
and you're going to see how this works

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.150 
and you're going to see how this works
once<00:06:02.810> that's<00:06:02.960> as<00:06:03.140> far<00:06:03.290> forward<00:06:03.530> as<00:06:03.770> it's<00:06:03.950> close

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
once that's as far forward as it's close

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.310 
once that's as far forward as it's close
to<00:06:04.190> be<00:06:04.520> you<00:06:04.760> can<00:06:04.910> see<00:06:05.270> it<00:06:05.420> it<00:06:05.690> fits<00:06:06.080> right<00:06:06.260> over

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
to be you can see it it fits right over

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.260 
to be you can see it it fits right over
that<00:06:06.590> rubber<00:06:06.830> very<00:06:07.160> nicely<00:06:10.060> this<00:06:11.060> little

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
that rubber very nicely this little

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.610 
that rubber very nicely this little
bracket<00:06:13.450> which<00:06:14.450> is<00:06:14.570> designed<00:06:14.900> to<00:06:15.020> spread<00:06:15.440> out

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
bracket which is designed to spread out

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.290 
bracket which is designed to spread out
the<00:06:16.130> pressure<00:06:16.370> around<00:06:16.640> this<00:06:16.790> foot<00:06:17.000> one<00:06:17.030> clue

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
the pressure around this foot one clue

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.600 
the pressure around this foot one clue
goes<00:06:17.840> with<00:06:17.990> this<00:06:18.080> little<00:06:18.290> V<00:06:18.470> facing<00:06:19.130> up<00:06:19.280> like

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
goes with this little V facing up like

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.110 
goes with this little V facing up like
that<00:06:21.130> so<00:06:22.130> normally<00:06:22.370> this<00:06:22.700> would<00:06:22.880> have<00:06:23.000> the

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
that so normally this would have the

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.300 
that so normally this would have the
fabric<00:06:23.510> already<00:06:23.930> attached<00:06:24.260> to<00:06:24.530> it<00:06:24.650> but<00:06:25.160> it's

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
fabric already attached to it but it's

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.800 
fabric already attached to it but it's
you<00:06:25.670> can<00:06:25.820> see<00:06:25.970> how<00:06:26.060> that<00:06:26.270> was<00:06:26.480> already

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
you can see how that was already

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.230 
you can see how that was already
designed<00:06:27.260> to<00:06:27.350> work<00:06:27.530> and<00:06:27.770> it<00:06:28.310> fits<00:06:28.610> up<00:06:28.790> very

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
designed to work and it fits up very

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.090 
designed to work and it fits up very
neatly<00:06:29.540> along<00:06:29.900> the<00:06:30.020> rubber<00:06:30.230> bulb<00:06:30.560> seal<00:06:30.800> along
