00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:16.119 

so<00:05:07.570> this<00:05:07.750> match<00:05:08.050> out<00:05:08.650> of<00:05:08.830> 5<00:05:09.190> stars<00:05:09.520> I<00:05:09.729> give

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:16.129 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:18.909 

I<00:05:16.189> think<00:05:16.939> at<00:05:17.300> the<00:05:17.659> least<00:05:17.689> I'll<00:05:18.229> get<00:05:18.379> if<00:05:18.559> foreign

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
I think at the least I'll get if foreign

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.129 
I think at the least I'll get if foreign
three-quarter<00:05:19.550> stars<00:05:19.939> I<00:05:22.360> mean<00:05:23.360> if<00:05:23.509> Booker<00:05:23.929> T

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
three-quarter stars I mean if Booker T

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.199 
three-quarter stars I mean if Booker T
and<00:05:24.169> Chris<00:05:24.589> Jericho<00:05:25.069> weren't<00:05:25.339> linen<00:05:25.879> ated<00:05:26.089> so

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:26.209 
and Chris Jericho weren't linen ated so

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:28.929 
and Chris Jericho weren't linen ated so
easily<00:05:26.360> with<00:05:26.689> roll-ups<00:05:27.519> then<00:05:28.519> I<00:05:28.550> think<00:05:28.849> it

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:28.939 
easily with roll-ups then I think it

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:29.939 
easily with roll-ups then I think it
would<00:05:29.059> have<00:05:29.149> been<00:05:29.209> a<00:05:29.269> little<00:05:29.419> better<00:05:29.539> because

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
would have been a little better because

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.139 
would have been a little better because
especially<00:05:30.949> with<00:05:31.219> the<00:05:31.309> way<00:05:31.429> Booker<00:05:31.789> T<00:05:31.969> got

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:32.149 
especially with the way Booker T got

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:34.089 
especially with the way Booker T got
eliminated<00:05:32.330> just<00:05:32.749> by<00:05:32.869> a<00:05:32.899> simple<00:05:32.989> roll<00:05:33.589> up<00:05:33.800> kind

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
eliminated just by a simple roll up kind

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.129 
eliminated just by a simple roll up kind
of<00:05:34.129> Meghan<00:05:34.489> didn't<00:05:35.179> look<00:05:35.269> make<00:05:35.629> him<00:05:35.749> look<00:05:35.929> that

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
of Meghan didn't look make him look that

good being bean by that eats some easy

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:41.049 
good being bean by that eats some easy
of<00:05:38.389> a<00:05:38.479> move<00:05:38.919> then<00:05:39.919> Chris<00:05:40.159> Jericho<00:05:40.550> get<00:05:40.699> taken
