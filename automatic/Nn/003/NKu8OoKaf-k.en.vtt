but<00:04:27.460> you<00:04:27.640> can<00:04:27.910> easily<00:04:28.180> factor<00:04:28.750> it<00:04:28.810> into<00:04:28.930> a

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
but you can easily factor it into a

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.580 
but you can easily factor it into a
daily<00:04:29.350> number<00:04:29.800> so<00:04:30.340> uh<00:04:30.370> what<00:04:31.030> I<00:04:31.060> do<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:32.410> make

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
my our cycling these characters i would

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.430 
my our cycling these characters i would
probably<00:05:54.280> make<00:05:54.430> about<00:05:54.730> four<00:05:55.450> to<00:05:55.870> five<00:05:55.900> gold

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
probably make about four to five gold

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.800 
probably make about four to five gold
which<00:05:57.100> is<00:05:57.130> really<00:05:57.550> good<00:05:57.760> money<00:05:58.000> and<00:05:58.240> it<00:05:58.540> can't

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
which is really good money and it can't

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.200 
which is really good money and it can't
be<00:05:58.960> Murph<00:05:59.200> really<00:05:59.680> uh<00:05:59.970> because<00:06:00.970> you're<00:06:01.090> just

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
be Murph really uh because you're just

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.520 
be Murph really uh because you're just
switching<00:06:01.570> characters<00:06:01.990> and<00:06:02.170> gathering

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
you don't want to do that you can also

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.500 
you don't want to do that you can also
you<00:06:05.950> know<00:06:06.190> log<00:06:06.580> on<00:06:06.790> a<00:06:06.820> character<00:06:07.270> and<00:06:07.420> do
