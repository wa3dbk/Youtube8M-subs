so<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:28.620> color<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:29.810> more<00:02:30.810> dense<00:02:31.850> whereas

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
so this color is more dense whereas

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.270 
so this color is more dense whereas
these<00:02:33.270> first<00:02:33.690> two<00:02:33.900> colors<00:02:34.260> are<00:02:34.530> basically

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
these first two colors are basically

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.210 
these first two colors are basically
well<00:02:36.060> they<00:02:36.540> they<00:02:36.810> have<00:02:37.020> translucence<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
well they they have translucence in the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.460 
well they they have translucence in the
color<00:02:38.460> there<00:02:39.240> still<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.840> obvious

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
color there still is that obvious

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.850 
color there still is that obvious
pigmentation<00:02:41.190> there<00:02:41.370> but<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.870> sort<00:02:43.770> of

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
pigmentation there but it is sort of

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.320 
pigmentation there but it is sort of
see-through<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.640> can<00:02:44.790> see<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.060> skin

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
see-through so that you can see the skin

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.050 
see-through so that you can see the skin
underneath<00:02:45.620> this<00:02:46.620> color<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.220> much<00:02:47.520> more<00:02:47.760> dense

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
underneath this color is much more dense

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.640 
underneath this color is much more dense
so<00:02:48.510> it's<00:02:48.840> almost<00:02:49.230> opaque<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:51.090> finish<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.810> this

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
so it's almost opaque in finish and this

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.030 
so it's almost opaque in finish and this
color<00:02:53.160> does<00:02:53.400> not<00:02:53.430> have<00:02:53.820> any<00:02:54.030> shimmers<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.480> it

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
color does not have any shimmers in it

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.090 
color does not have any shimmers in it
so<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.130> just<00:02:56.160> get<00:02:56.490> this<00:02:56.750> dusty<00:02:57.750> rose<00:02:58.070> with<00:02:59.070> a

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
have any shimmer in it it's kind of hard

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.880 
have any shimmer in it it's kind of hard
to<00:03:39.000> get<00:03:39.180> these<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:40.020> look<00:03:40.230> even<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.800> the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
to get these to look even in the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.730 
to get these to look even in the
swatches<00:03:41.520> but<00:03:41.910> on<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.810> lips<00:03:43.080> that<00:03:43.290> will<00:03:43.560> be

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
swatches but on the lips that will be

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:51.590 
swatches but on the lips that will be
easier<00:03:44.520> to<00:03:44.580> do<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:46.200> sixth<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.890> hoola<00:03:50.360> this<00:03:51.360> is

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
easier to do and sixth is hoola this is

00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:03.590 
easier to do and sixth is hoola this is
a<00:03:51.750> shimmering<00:03:52.640> gold<00:03:53.640> nude<00:03:54.360> color

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.400 

here<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.380> go<00:04:04.560> up<00:04:04.740> close<00:04:05.330> get<00:04:06.330> those<00:04:06.570> golden

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
here you go up close get those golden

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.270 
here you go up close get those golden
micro<00:04:08.400> shimmers<00:04:09.320> so<00:04:10.320> here<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.650> have<00:04:10.770> all<00:04:10.980> the

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
micro shimmers so here you have all the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.400 
micro shimmers so here you have all the
colors<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.970> swatches<00:04:12.510> up<00:04:12.660> close<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:13.050> is<00:04:13.140> hard

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
colors and swatches up close it is hard

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.620 
colors and swatches up close it is hard
to<00:04:13.440> get<00:04:13.620> them<00:04:13.800> even<00:04:14.400> in<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.030> swatches<00:04:15.540> I

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
to get them even in the swatches I

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.760 
to get them even in the swatches I
noticed<00:04:15.960> this<00:04:16.020> also<00:04:16.230> when<00:04:16.440> doing<00:04:16.680> the

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
noticed this also when doing the

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.400 
noticed this also when doing the
pictures<00:04:17.270> but<00:04:18.270> when<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:18.810> apply<00:04:19.020> them<00:04:19.140> to<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
pictures but when you apply them to the

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.750 
pictures but when you apply them to the
lips<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:19.860> should<00:04:20.070> be<00:04:20.190> okay

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
lips it should be okay

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.030 
lips it should be okay
that's<00:04:21.239> just<00:04:21.480> the<00:04:21.690> nature<00:04:21.870> of<00:04:22.020> that<00:04:22.230> stiff

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
that's just the nature of that stiff

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.980 
that's just the nature of that stiff
slanted<00:04:23.550> applicator<00:04:23.670> that<00:04:24.270> kind<00:04:24.510> of<00:04:24.570> makes<00:04:24.840> it

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
slanted applicator that kind of makes it

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.720 
slanted applicator that kind of makes it
hard<00:04:25.170> to<00:04:25.410> make<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.800> swatches<00:04:26.220> look<00:04:26.400> really

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
hard to make the swatches look really

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:35.900 
hard to make the swatches look really
really<00:04:26.940> smooth

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:57.959 

you

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:57.969 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:59.939 

all<00:04:58.479> right<00:04:58.659> so<00:04:58.869> there<00:04:59.049> is<00:04:59.199> the<00:04:59.379> first<00:04:59.709> look

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
all right so there is the first look

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.609 
all right so there is the first look
into<00:05:00.189> these<00:05:00.639> six<00:05:01.119> new<00:05:01.389> benefit<00:05:02.049> lip<00:05:02.349> glosses

00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:02.619 
into these six new benefit lip glosses

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:06.179 
into these six new benefit lip glosses
my<00:05:03.189> first<00:05:03.699> impression<00:05:04.360> is<00:05:04.539> that<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:05.860> colors

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:06.189 
my first impression is that the colors

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.479 
my first impression is that the colors
are<00:05:06.339> all<00:05:06.610> pretty<00:05:07.179> sheer<00:05:07.799> except<00:05:08.799> for<00:05:09.039> Dallas

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:09.489 
are all pretty sheer except for Dallas

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:13.049 
are all pretty sheer except for Dallas
which<00:05:09.819> is<00:05:10.439> noticeably<00:05:11.439> more<00:05:11.739> opaque<00:05:12.129> it<00:05:12.610> isn't

00:05:13.049 --> 00:05:13.059 
which is noticeably more opaque it isn't

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:15.209 
which is noticeably more opaque it isn't
itself<00:05:13.509> completely<00:05:14.139> opaque<00:05:14.499> in<00:05:14.679> color<00:05:14.919> so

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219 
itself completely opaque in color so

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:17.339 
itself completely opaque in color so
it's<00:05:15.489> not<00:05:15.610> going<00:05:15.849> to<00:05:16.149> completely<00:05:16.899> cover<00:05:17.019> your

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
it's not going to completely cover your

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.199 
it's not going to completely cover your
lips<00:05:17.649> in<00:05:17.919> color<00:05:18.099> but<00:05:18.610> compared<00:05:18.969> to<00:05:18.999> the<00:05:19.179> other

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:19.209 
lips in color but compared to the other

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:21.409 
lips in color but compared to the other
five<00:05:19.689> shades<00:05:19.989> it's<00:05:20.169> definitely<00:05:20.559> more<00:05:20.739> opaque

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
five shades it's definitely more opaque

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.259 
five shades it's definitely more opaque
I<00:05:22.419> do<00:05:22.719> wish<00:05:23.289> that<00:05:23.319> some<00:05:23.769> of<00:05:23.889> the<00:05:24.009> colors<00:05:24.429> had

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:25.269 
I do wish that some of the colors had

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:27.719 
I do wish that some of the colors had
shimmer<00:05:25.899> in<00:05:26.139> them<00:05:26.379> the<00:05:26.889> way<00:05:27.039> that<00:05:27.219> the<00:05:27.309> blushes

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
shimmer in them the way that the blushes

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.059 
shimmer in them the way that the blushes
do<00:05:27.939> so<00:05:28.239> I<00:05:28.449> guess<00:05:28.629> my<00:05:28.809> point<00:05:29.019> is<00:05:29.169> that<00:05:29.199> the

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
do so I guess my point is that the

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.789 
do so I guess my point is that the
colors<00:05:30.519> don't<00:05:31.029> exactly<00:05:31.569> correspond<00:05:32.289> to<00:05:32.379> their

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:32.799 
colors don't exactly correspond to their

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:36.479 
colors don't exactly correspond to their
blush<00:05:33.339> counterparts<00:05:34.499> for<00:05:35.499> example<00:05:35.919> coralista

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:36.489 
blush counterparts for example coralista
