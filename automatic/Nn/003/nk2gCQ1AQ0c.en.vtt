I<00:01:26.790> absolutely<00:01:27.180> loved<00:01:27.930> when<00:01:28.230> I<00:01:28.320> was<00:01:28.440> a<00:01:28.500> kid<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
I absolutely loved when I was a kid and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.370 
I absolutely loved when I was a kid and
that<00:01:28.920> didn't<00:01:29.250> sit<00:01:29.430> me<00:01:29.610> anymore<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.870> cut<00:01:31.200> it

the<00:01:34.050> way<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.380> did<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.830> was<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.220> use

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the way that I did that was to use

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.270 
the way that I did that was to use
fabric<00:01:35.790> glue<00:01:35.900> to<00:01:36.900> attach<00:01:37.050> the<00:01:37.590> fabric<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:38.190> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
fabric glue to attach the fabric to the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.760 
fabric glue to attach the fabric to the
book<00:01:38.400> itself<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.150> then<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.660> sewed<00:01:40.260> along<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
book itself and then I sewed along the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.560 
book itself and then I sewed along the
edges<00:01:41.100> here<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.610> burgundy<00:01:42.060> kind<00:01:42.450> of

of<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.940> reckless<00:01:48.240> journal<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.990> was<00:01:49.260> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
of the reckless journal and that was the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.590 
of the reckless journal and that was the
title<00:01:50.130> page<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.910> don't<00:01:51.180> want<00:01:51.300> to<00:01:51.360> leave<00:01:51.479> this

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
title page I don't want to leave this

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.390 
title page I don't want to leave this
place<00:01:51.810> blank<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.620> thought<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.010> cut<00:01:53.370> out

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
place blank so I thought I just cut out

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.130 
place blank so I thought I just cut out
all<00:01:53.640> these<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:54.030> pretty<00:01:54.150> flowers<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.020> make

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
all these really pretty flowers and make

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:05.870 
all these really pretty flowers and make
a<00:01:55.170> collage<00:01:55.890> out<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.400> them

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.430 

now<00:02:06.880> if<00:02:06.940> we<00:02:07.060> put<00:02:07.180> over<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.510> few<00:02:07.660> pages<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.290> we

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
now if we put over a few pages and we

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.410 
now if we put over a few pages and we
have<00:02:08.710> the<00:02:08.920> instructions<00:02:09.610> patient<00:02:10.060> this<00:02:10.180> page

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
have the instructions patient this page

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.330 
have the instructions patient this page
isn't<00:02:10.660> quite<00:02:11.080> finished<00:02:11.290> yet<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.890> wanted<00:02:12.250> to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
isn't quite finished yet I wanted to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.950 
isn't quite finished yet I wanted to
create<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.730> bit<00:02:12.850> for<00:02:13.030> rainbow<00:02:13.360> effects<00:02:13.690> but

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
create a bit for rainbow effects but

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.300 
create a bit for rainbow effects but
make<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.290> little<00:02:14.440> bit<00:02:14.560> more<00:02:14.740> interesting<00:02:15.220> or

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
make it a little bit more interesting or

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.700 
make it a little bit more interesting or
not<00:02:15.400> have<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.700> very<00:02:15.850> smooth<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:17.200> I've<00:02:17.290> just<00:02:17.380> got

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
not have it very smooth so I've just got

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.370 
not have it very smooth so I've just got
all<00:02:17.830> these<00:02:18.010> little<00:02:18.220> bit<00:02:18.460> jagged<00:02:18.880> kind<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.600> this

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
all these little bit jagged kind of this

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.970 
all these little bit jagged kind of this
here

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
here

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.370 
here
the<00:02:23.790> next<00:02:24.060> page<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.480> want<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.870> show<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.140> is

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
the next page that I want to show you is

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.280 
the next page that I want to show you is
the<00:02:25.680> crack<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.520> time<00:02:26.970> paint<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.810> have<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.050> bit

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
the crack this time paint I have a bit

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.290 
the crack this time paint I have a bit
the<00:02:28.470> thing<00:02:28.680> about<00:02:28.860> triangles<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.910> wanted

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
the thing about triangles and I wanted

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.780 
the thing about triangles and I wanted
to<00:02:30.450> just<00:02:30.739> doodle<00:02:31.739> over<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.160> page<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.670> end

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
to just doodle over this page in the end

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.850 
to just doodle over this page in the end
I<00:02:32.880> did<00:02:33.090> eventually<00:02:33.239> look<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.959> bit<00:02:34.140> like<00:02:34.349> cracks

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
I did eventually look a bit like cracks

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.120 
I did eventually look a bit like cracks
so<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.400> think<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.880> works<00:02:36.150> out<00:02:36.420> rather<00:02:36.720> well

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
so I think that works out rather well

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.620 
so I think that works out rather well
we're<00:02:38.130> gonna<00:02:38.250> flip<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.640> again<00:02:38.790> another<00:02:39.390> few

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
we're gonna flip it again another few

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.140 
we're gonna flip it again another few
pages<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.440> draw<00:02:40.770> back<00:02:41.220> lines<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.819> thin

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
pages to the draw back lines and thin

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.420 
pages to the draw back lines and thin
this<00:02:42.690> took<00:02:42.930> me<00:02:43.020> actually<00:02:43.170> ages<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.040> do<00:02:44.190> and

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
this took me actually ages to do and

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.640 
this took me actually ages to do and
when<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:45.000> finish<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.540> decided<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.110> take<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.350> blue

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
when I finish I decided to take a blue

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.740 
when I finish I decided to take a blue
crayon<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.400> just<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.940> color<00:02:48.150> in<00:02:48.330> some<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.660> the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
crayon and just to color in some of the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.780 
crayon and just to color in some of the
lines<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.040> looks<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.340> little<00:02:50.459> bit<00:02:50.670> more

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
lines so that it looks a little bit more

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.640 
lines so that it looks a little bit more
interesting<00:02:51.330> or<00:02:51.540> than<00:02:51.690> just<00:02:51.870> one<00:02:52.019> color<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.560> I

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
interesting or than just one color and I

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.940 
interesting or than just one color and I
really<00:02:52.680> like<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.400> kind<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.670> baby<00:02:53.910> blue

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
really like this kind of baby blue

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.380 
really like this kind of baby blue
strands<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.250> just<00:02:56.459> flow<00:02:56.790> throughout<00:02:57.239> I

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
strands that just flow throughout I

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.210 
strands that just flow throughout I
guess<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:57.959> think<00:02:58.230> it's<00:02:58.440> really<00:02:58.830> really

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
guess and I think it's really really

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.380 
guess and I think it's really really
cute<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.090> love<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:00.780> page

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.850

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
fill this page with circles and I took

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.699 
fill this page with circles and I took
some<00:03:10.910> rewards<00:03:11.360> colors<00:03:11.720> with<00:03:11.959> for<00:03:12.230> this<00:03:12.379> page

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
and I just made these weird looking I

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.280 
and I just made these weird looking I
guess<00:03:15.680> like<00:03:16.190> planets<00:03:16.849> I<00:03:17.030> try<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.780> make<00:03:18.140> them

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
guess like planets I try to make them

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.770 
guess like planets I try to make them
look<00:03:18.440> like<00:03:18.500> planets<00:03:19.010> anyway<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.730> then<00:03:20.390> on<00:03:20.599> the

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
look like planets anyway and then on the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.170 
look like planets anyway and then on the
opposite<00:03:21.319> page<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:22.099> just<00:03:22.640> covered<00:03:22.849> the<00:03:22.910> page<00:03:23.060> of

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
opposite page I just covered the page of

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.670 
opposite page I just covered the page of
bubble<00:03:23.450> wrap<00:03:23.480> because<00:03:23.959> you<00:03:24.140> know<00:03:24.230> who<00:03:24.379> doesn't

one<00:05:16.729> to<00:05:16.880> do<00:05:17.060> it

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
one to do it

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.270 
one to do it
quite<00:05:17.960> that<00:05:18.140> I<00:05:18.170> decided<00:05:18.560> to<00:05:18.710> use<00:05:18.800> for<00:05:19.190> this
