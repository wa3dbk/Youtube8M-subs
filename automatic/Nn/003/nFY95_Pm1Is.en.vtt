00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
about 10 years ago i guess they didn't

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.960 
about 10 years ago i guess they didn't
have<00:01:54.420> any<00:01:54.600> um<00:01:54.750> rules<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.610> meetings<00:01:56.610> anything

more<00:02:35.610> important<00:02:36.030> that

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
more important that

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.020
