00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.380
 for george 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.760
 copper 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.799
 you propose me the strong hand in paris 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.799
 a multidisciplinary training of the same day 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.189
 for those who bring a translation quantum physics eyi to these 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.349
 applications in medicine and biology 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.849
 so it's about better understanding how the training that is capable of 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.849
 to cure the physical disorders excess chic 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.210
 so 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.550
 a track 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.530
 to skip click here 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.160
 i think m size 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
 in May all these people 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.840
 with here 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.120
 already working abdou kader practice 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.190
 info how to say who was inspired likely 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.930
 of quantic thought that is to say with all that is in very slow formation 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.310
 celebrating 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.170
 homeopathy 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.600
 acupuncture and it was rare so that his performance to the interested for them 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.770
 all kinds of therapists 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.390
 during the counting 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.070
 besides I have little father of peoples to start 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.680
 a few years ago 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.440
 it was in 2001 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.440
 I was contacted by cocktails 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.190
 president of the Belgian school had not everything so and the ropes 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.490
 impossible forbes a little 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.870
 asked me to give you a fall 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.070
 one-second theater 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.400
 tower but 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.990
 it's the first 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.590
 the places but why these bowlers 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.150
 despite that costs because 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.720
 I know you are a great connoisseur of the main the track is ready 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.460
 technically 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.970
 I'm not at war 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.920
 j the passersby 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.640
 there are dogmatic principles 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.570
 he tells me I have intuition 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.480
 quantum physics leave it one of the largest slices 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.000
 modern physics 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.020
 in any case public the franc in that I got the best 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.000
 what to do with its costs 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.509
 I have the feeling that 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.720
 quantum physics 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.790
 Explain 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.380
 always is it that it is scientifically legitimate 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.019
 the pena 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.709
 this stage more meaning 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.430
 m and throw the most loved ones I never thought it would happen to me 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.939
 never thought to tell me 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.159
 between the visit 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.159
 a small pocket is very good 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:20.949
 of information 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.589
 quantum physicist it was my specialty typically his 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:26.589
 counterparts to tell you that I'm going to think 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:28.869
 and I gave 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:31.669
 a training a turbine that creates links 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:34.669
 between the main screen 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.909
 some big passionate 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.769
 example 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.059
 the bankers 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:44.239
 then I plated gold 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.859
 and for good reason 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:46.720
 a pc 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.939
 he's like that 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.559
 the -avi idea 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:52.159
 his stomach 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.549
 the change of look 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.339
 he carton on the nature of the loan 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:58.590
 harmattan 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.709
 practically doubled 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.119
 and this subject 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:04.899
 philosophy tile we do not believe that his little game of all people 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:06.639
 present and future 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.559
 they stumble at all of sex are asked 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.169
 the approach of a certain number of 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.299
 we must quote 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.859
 in this note m 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.329
 he is now going to decorate a bag 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.120
 any physical person or chemistry 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.559
 10 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:22.929
 in the city 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:24.929
 and how will the day unfold 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:27.929
 m 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.439
 the first it's going to be complicated 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.099
 I will help him 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.099
 for these deputies 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:40.939
 plant 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.849
 that more weight no 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.469
 6 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.730
 it's just I'll explain to you screen as well 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.929
 the 37 stagnant pantelic 

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:53.879
 between 1900 and 1920 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.329
 explained clearly 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.669
 we'll go back to the evolution of the 90's sovec designs the physicist 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:01.889
 for the suspense 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.749
 for santoro 

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:07.570
 no debt 7 that's for sure 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.129
 they 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:10.559
 aubeterre 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.369
 physically but most do not know 

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:16.079
 elite 2 so the password 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.269
 bluffing this show 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.650
 listening 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.949
 for all 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.870
 diarra 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.080
 in the second part 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.080
 maybe I'm even worse 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.040
 all the applications of the gate 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.620
 2 d 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.560
 donate the relationship the patient the consequences firefighters have been 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.560
 you can but how beautiful I am 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.800
 the post-it 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.800
 data and then the planet 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.699
 Why 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.389
 exciting 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.860
 so that's 7 passes of 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.710
 the patient both his beta 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.720
 in a peace process they took everything he is close 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.290
 our countries this person 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.159
 two perspectives process 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:05.909
 what was destroyed 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.080
 gold 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.689
 three years 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:11.879
 Nope 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.879
 why as such 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.139
 team 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.229
 expected arrival 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:23.629
 both 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:26.919
 a room in the broad sense but it's a census 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.689
 but it is addressed but also 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.249
 to anyone 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:32.210
 jérémy 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.120
 the evening way 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.860
 in situation the country 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.509
 to not recognize 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:43.439
 Sunday, May 8 the new fact is false for little pep to its members 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.389
 little by little 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.400
 it is a little point in all tumult 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.400
 everywhere we get a compact 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.760
 quebec 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.420
 it's not over for the French tata steel open to the public and more but 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.840
 for the creators is to hear all these things but it's called 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.560
 worry 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.839
 the people 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:05.930
 he wants to used as a solvent 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.080
 but who is the main asset of the portico eat more than his own party 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.199
 m 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.889
 he is his prophet the land 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.940
 and to somehow talk about alternative medicines are more or 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:18.680
 less 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.229
 badly perceived and this common 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.990
 double the setting the legitimate and somehow and legitimized to put with 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.599
 His students 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:27.990
 his explanations 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.230
 we live like any other country in the EU is pretty 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.729
 this year the most important film ppp is beautiful a little bit 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:35.630
 after 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.430
 that's why its mtb 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.750
 it's a list yet menopause 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.469
 the complex 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:46.309
 we thought that it was not surprising that the paris floor was not in 

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:47.650
 taxes of agreement 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.650
 and now we understand that we are 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:54.430
 the most popular 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.949
 scientific design in which 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:59.270
 churkin what final for medicine 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.460
 percent this year the world group this decor 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.879
 the latter was in progress 

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:05.210
 but on the designs 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.210
 of physics from 10 to 12 September 

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:09.749
 the ttp of which 

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:11.369
 it is there too 

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:13.419
 some 25 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:15.279
 to a training because 

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:16.619
 I would say yes 

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:18.349
 thank you for everything dell 

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:21.349
 the mans with the reconciliation between aesthetics 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.560
 so it's not at all 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.749
 an approach 

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:28.699
 we want to break south in June if the classic 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:31.779
 but m but much sooner 

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:33.469
 of the head 

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:35.699
 but these sites 

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:38.699
 mother 

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:42.979
 safest 

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:44.870
 for fixed 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:45.990
 in cooperation 

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.089
 with our taxes 

00:07:47.089 --> 00:07:50.460
 by the patient's advice because ultimately 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.199
 % 

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:53.009
