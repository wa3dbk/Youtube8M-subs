00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.400
 9 and leisure activities 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.329
 why for ambiance 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.420
 therapy 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.039
 weekend care 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:29.999
 home care 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.999
 what followed were 6 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.360
 see yourself at work 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.740
 professional support 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.410
 in north Brabant and the Bommelerwaard 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.410
 with the support of his fans gelderland 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.780
 at the ladies and gentlemen of Ferrari the manager that drivers of 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.270
 if I am an employee 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.020
 Then comes harvesting frustration before one 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.110
 found that clients moved too little 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.410
 especially the employees who work with people with a severe multiple 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.800
 constraint 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.350
 where the father was received 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.290
 the campaign is correct 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.539
 further as chairman of the board 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.100
 of course 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.100
 get there 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.630
 partly due to a wrong track the Netherlands 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.360
 makes the collaboration 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.830
 but by people with a serious multiple coverage 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.100
 but according to us 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.100
 the French police 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.610
 every person needs something good to do 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.550
 they can 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.480
 concert at sea 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.230
 spotted for the first time just in time 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.040
 it is an enrichment 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.040
 the human and system error limitation 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.670
 luckily we came in contact with your kids tour dutch and through it 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.420
 program 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.959
 like all 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.959
 an own strength in the ad 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:19.619
 developing this opportunity 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:21.220
 8 that is 6 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.529
 but people fall and rise has come about 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:26.579
 it was every 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.960
 adjusted travel times and that comes to a halt 8 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.149
 also be different 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:36.909
 think differently than not to offer the first activities, but rather 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.909
 deployed 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.869
 due to the bankruptcy of your own body parts 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:46.869
 he is sitting 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:51.649
 responses 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.929
 give extra attention to getting started 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:59.029
 the movement he ends 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:00.939
 he spoke to him 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.990
 the bags keeps getting bigger 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.939
 the company has made 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.939
 are legal and we think of parties that participate 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:11.899
 action reaction 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:14.199
 even that influence 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.589
 and above all 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:18.389
 essien 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:19.629
 the evening 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.629
 the mother is from Jolanda 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.319
 she actually experiences many activities very passively 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.319
 and also done a day stay for a lot of fun activities 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:34.689
 the perpetrator 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:37.749
 he often only came to listen and watch 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:38.549
 or he will be 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.559
 we flew roof tiles 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:44.540
 in this method he gets the chance to come up with a reaction 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:49.299
 and this reaction is not only provoked to be repeated a few times 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:50.209
 encourage 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.509
 The response is placed from her career that he felt something 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:55.729
 he becomes 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:57.469
 involved 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.339
 daily management 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.559
 the interest was aroused there are so many questions 

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:05.739
 the German reported that 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.659
 and I'm going to hit the car all over the Netherlands and we even from it 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:10.519
 abroad 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:11.739
 if you have 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.109
 overall 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.109
 need my own situation 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:20.629
 just like his first 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.270
 the cpb 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.879
 by our editors 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:30.219
 however, it is not clear 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.219
 hospitality 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.800
 there are so many negativity 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.800
 we have been through 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:45.559
 the ethias arena in hasselt 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:47.830
 that's what it says 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.779
 when the first race is 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:52.779
 the occupants drive 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:02.110
 brought about a change 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.179
 is about the people who dare to go beyond limitations 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.330
 who dare to see things differently 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.580
 who no longer want to lay eyes on the established order 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.429
 with a pawl on a break they are the ones that get things moving 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.529
 they cannot be restrained by the limitations of others 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.909
 because they want to help people move forward 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.529
 often with the simple means 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:33.529
 ma always with strength 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:35.809
 these people 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:37.089
 have hope 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:39.719
 that they can make a difference 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:40.669
 and they 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.869
 are finally out the genes that actually do fall
