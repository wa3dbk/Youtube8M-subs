00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
here he is outlined this as a as a

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.069 
here he is outlined this as a as a
threat<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:47.210> it's<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.420> amazing<00:01:48.720> how<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
threat and it's just amazing how the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.690 
threat and it's just amazing how the
none<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.590> models<00:01:49.950> had<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.520> all<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.670> a

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
none of the models had this and all of a

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.149 
none of the models had this and all of a
sudden<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.689> European<00:01:52.259> model<00:01:52.560> picks<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.979> on

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
sudden the European model picks up on

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.800 
sudden the European model picks up on
this<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:53.880> wow<00:01:54.090> or<00:01:54.360> where'd<00:01:54.659> this

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
this and it's like wow or where'd this

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.010 
this and it's like wow or where'd this
come<00:01:54.869> from<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.979> here<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.479> what<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.630> evening

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
come from so here is what is the evening

come from so here is what is the evening
I<00:01:58.140> basically<00:01:58.590> what<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.520> can<00:01:59.640> see<00:01:59.820> here<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.619> call

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
I basically what you can see here a call

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.800 
I basically what you can see here a call
from<00:02:01.740> Gulf<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.399> Mexico<00:02:02.909> moisture<00:02:03.090> down<00:02:03.450> here

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
from Gulf of Mexico moisture down here

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.260 
from Gulf of Mexico moisture down here
okay<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.130> cold<00:02:05.369> front<00:02:05.610> moving

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
okay you have a cold front moving

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.389 
okay you have a cold front moving
through<00:02:06.600> here<00:02:06.810> now<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.020> GFS<00:02:07.649> what<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.250> does

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
through here now the GFS what it does

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.609 
through here now the GFS what it does
with<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.670> cold<00:02:08.879> front<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.989> pushes<00:02:10.349> this

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
with this cold front it just pushes this

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.930 
with this cold front it just pushes this
straight<00:02:10.920> through<00:02:11.250> actually<00:02:11.610> pretty<00:02:11.760> much

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
straight through actually pretty much

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.850 
straight through actually pretty much
everything<00:02:12.360> does<00:02:12.540> gfs

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
everything does gfs

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.310 
everything does gfs
Canadian<00:02:14.730> pushes<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.630> cold<00:02:15.900> front<00:02:16.140> through

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
Canadian pushes the cold front through

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.950 
Canadian pushes the cold front through
okay<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.910> do<00:02:18.060> get<00:02:18.210> some<00:02:18.360> light<00:02:18.510> snow<00:02:18.720> shower

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
okay you do get some light snow shower

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.660 
okay you do get some light snow shower
activity<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.680> would<00:02:19.860> be<00:02:19.950> wednesday<00:02:20.220> night

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
activity this would be wednesday night

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.380 
activity this would be wednesday night
late<00:02:21.390> Wednesday<00:02:21.750> night<00:02:21.890> early<00:02:22.890> Thursday<00:02:23.390> okay

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
late Wednesday night early Thursday okay

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.210 
late Wednesday night early Thursday okay
now<00:02:24.660> on<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.870> GFS<00:02:25.320> at<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.620> time<00:02:25.800> me<00:02:25.950> on<00:02:26.040> that

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
now on the GFS at the time me on that

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.460 
now on the GFS at the time me on that
and<00:02:26.460> then<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.510> system<00:02:28.080> here<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.440> never

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
and then this system here it never

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.670 
and then this system here it never
really<00:02:28.740> gets<00:02:28.920> going<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.520> just<00:02:29.580> aimlessly

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
really gets going and just aimlessly

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.170 
really gets going and just aimlessly
heads<00:02:31.680> out<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.890> seat<00:02:32.220> kind<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.670> like<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.060> was

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
heads out the seat kind of like that was

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.270 
heads out the seat kind of like that was
very<00:02:33.270> strung<00:02:33.660> out<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:33.870> fact<00:02:34.260> all<00:02:34.890> right<00:02:35.070> and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
very strung out in fact all right and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.310 
very strung out in fact all right and
that's<00:02:35.370> what<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.670> GFS<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.240> showing<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:37.110> go<00:02:37.260> to

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
that's what the GFS is showing you go to

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.450 
that's what the GFS is showing you go to
the<00:02:37.440> European<00:02:37.800> model<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.160> little<00:02:38.340> bit

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
the European model a little bit

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.750 
the European model a little bit
different<00:02:38.730> story<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:40.260> shows<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:41.190> cold<00:02:41.670> front

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
different story it shows the cold front

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.340 
different story it shows the cold front
a<00:02:41.910> lot<00:02:42.090> slower<00:02:42.360> this<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.840> actually<00:02:43.080> looking<00:02:43.230> at

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
a lot slower this is actually looking at

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.780 
a lot slower this is actually looking at
thursday<00:02:43.560> morning<00:02:44.070> out<00:02:44.190> but<00:02:44.370> at<00:02:44.520> this<00:02:44.580> point

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
thursday morning out but at this point

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.330 
thursday morning out but at this point
on<00:02:45.000> thursday<00:02:45.360> morning<00:02:45.720> gfs<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.650> sack<00:02:46.800> over<00:02:46.920> way

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
on thursday morning gfs a sack over way

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.030 
on thursday morning gfs a sack over way
over<00:02:47.370> here<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.120> pass<00:02:48.390> through<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.750> area<00:02:49.040> your

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
over here and pass through the area your

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.770 
over here and pass through the area your
p<00:02:50.160> model<00:02:50.430> has<00:02:50.520> is<00:02:50.640> up<00:02:50.790> here<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.450> it's<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.660> big

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
p model has is up here so it's a big

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.050 
p model has is up here so it's a big
difference<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.980> need<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.280> have<00:02:53.400> this<00:02:53.580> cold

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
difference you need to have this cold

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.490 
difference you need to have this cold
front<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.300> little<00:02:54.330> bit<00:02:54.540> slower<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:55.110> order<00:02:55.350> for

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
front a little bit slower in order for

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.090 
front a little bit slower in order for
this<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:56.120> develop<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.270> come<00:02:57.390> northward<00:02:58.100> if

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
this to develop and come northward if

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.160 
this to develop and come northward if
it's<00:02:59.310> any<00:02:59.459> faster<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.000> progressively<00:03:00.630> gfs

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
it's any faster and progressively gfs

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.130 
it's any faster and progressively gfs
has<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.820> then<00:03:02.820> this<00:03:03.239> will<00:03:03.390> just<00:03:03.600> be<00:03:03.690> kicked<00:03:03.989> out

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
has it then this will just be kicked out

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.470 
has it then this will just be kicked out
now<00:03:05.070> normally<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.670> european<00:03:06.090> model<00:03:06.360> will

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
now normally the european model will

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.990 
now normally the european model will
handle<00:03:06.810> southern<00:03:07.170> streams<00:03:07.380> better<00:03:07.850> but<00:03:08.850> this

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
handle southern streams better but this

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.820 
handle southern streams better but this
has<00:03:09.180> been<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.450> progressive<00:03:10.170> pattern<00:03:10.650> all

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
has been a progressive pattern all

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.630 
has been a progressive pattern all
winter<00:03:11.640> long<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.989> why<00:03:13.590> argue<00:03:14.010> against<00:03:14.489> the

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
winter long so why argue against the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.680 
winter long so why argue against the
fact<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.760> cold<00:03:18.299> fronts<00:03:18.510> going<00:03:18.630> to

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
fact that the the cold fronts going to

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.590 
fact that the the cold fronts going to
be<00:03:18.750> progressive<00:03:19.640> so<00:03:20.640> we're<00:03:20.760> siding<00:03:21.150> against

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
be progressive so we're siding against

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.470 
be progressive so we're siding against
this<00:03:21.720> right<00:03:21.989> now<00:03:22.170> just<00:03:22.769> snow<00:03:23.040> showers<00:03:23.549> not<00:03:24.450> a

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
this right now just snow showers not a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.600 
this right now just snow showers not a
big<00:03:24.720> deal<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.320> this<00:03:25.860> thing<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.100> not<00:03:26.370> going<00:03:26.519> to

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
big deal and this thing is not going to

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.979 
big deal and this thing is not going to
call<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.850> Coast<00:03:27.060> we're<00:03:27.239> thinking<00:03:27.630> right<00:03:27.959> now

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
call the Coast we're thinking right now

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.460 
call the Coast we're thinking right now
doesn't<00:03:28.980> mean<00:03:29.480> that<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.690> European<00:03:31.140> model

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
doesn't mean that the European model

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.910 
doesn't mean that the European model
can't<00:03:31.709> find<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.400> nut<00:03:32.670> in<00:03:32.700> this<00:03:32.910> situation<00:03:33.269> here

can't find a nut in this situation here
the<00:03:34.920> blind<00:03:35.160> squirrel<00:03:35.489> here<00:03:35.760> finding<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.120> nut

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
the blind squirrel here finding the nut

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.509 
the blind squirrel here finding the nut
and<00:03:36.350> finding<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.470> clutching<00:03:37.920> onto<00:03:38.070> something

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
and finding it clutching onto something

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:39.830 
and finding it clutching onto something
we're<00:03:39.000> going<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.180> keep<00:03:39.299> an<00:03:39.450> eye<00:03:39.570> on<00:03:39.600> earth

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
we're going to keep an eye on earth

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.509 
we're going to keep an eye on earth
against<00:03:40.200> olmos<00:03:40.590> over<00:03:40.830> kind<00:03:41.010> of<00:03:41.100> impressed

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
against olmos over kind of impressed

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.460 
against olmos over kind of impressed
some<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.910> those<00:03:42.060> some<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.510> our<00:03:42.780> doing<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.320> same

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
some of those some of our doing the same

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.810 
some of those some of our doing the same
thing<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:43.920> operational<00:03:44.519> are<00:03:44.580> doing

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
thing that the operational are doing

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.420 
thing that the operational are doing
here<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:45.299> it's<00:03:46.019> not<00:03:46.110> something<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.739> we<00:03:47.220> want

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
here so it's not something that we want

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.520 
here so it's not something that we want
to<00:03:47.459> dismiss<00:03:47.940> we<00:03:48.720> certainly<00:03:48.930> are<00:03:49.140> not<00:03:49.200> doing

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
to dismiss we certainly are not doing

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.710 
to dismiss we certainly are not doing
that<00:03:49.560> but<00:03:50.340> I'm<00:03:50.459> just<00:03:50.670> just<00:03:51.299> saying<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.630> the

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
that but I'm just just saying that the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.330 
that but I'm just just saying that the
progressive<00:03:52.230> pattern<00:03:52.560> has<00:03:52.709> one<00:03:52.980> up<00:03:53.130> all

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
progressive pattern has one up all

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.420 
progressive pattern has one up all
winter<00:03:53.580> long<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:54.900> why<00:03:55.290> are<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:55.950> against<00:03:56.340> it

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
winter long so why are you against it

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.370 
winter long so why are you against it
now<00:03:56.640> progressive<00:03:57.600> meeting<00:03:57.750> that's<00:03:58.049> with<00:03:58.230> this

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
now progressive meeting that's with this

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.280 
now progressive meeting that's with this
front<00:03:58.709> here<00:03:58.890> okay<00:03:59.790> at<00:04:00.000> this<00:04:00.600> front<00:04:00.900> is<00:04:01.019> is

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
front here okay at this front is is

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.310 
front here okay at this front is is
faster<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.390> progressive<00:04:03.390> like<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.870> GFS

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
faster and progressive like the GFS

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.160 
faster and progressive like the GFS
shows<00:04:04.560> this<00:04:04.860> doesn't<00:04:05.400> happen<00:04:05.549> and<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:07.049> have<00:04:07.140> a

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
shows this doesn't happen and you have a

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.720 
shows this doesn't happen and you have a
coastal<00:04:07.560> storm<00:04:07.650> here<00:04:07.950> throwing<00:04:08.220> snow<00:04:08.489> back

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
coastal storm here throwing snow back

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.880 
coastal storm here throwing snow back
here<00:04:08.940> in<00:04:09.060> eastern<00:04:09.299> PA<00:04:09.480> in<00:04:09.630> New<00:04:09.750> Jersey<00:04:10.140> so<00:04:10.739> we

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
here in eastern PA in New Jersey so we

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.550 
here in eastern PA in New Jersey so we
will<00:04:11.010> keep<00:04:11.160> an<00:04:11.280> eye<00:04:11.400> on<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.640> just<00:04:11.910> in<00:04:12.000> case

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
will keep an eye on it just in case

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.930 
will keep an eye on it just in case
obviously<00:04:13.560> this<00:04:14.160> is<00:04:14.340> done<00:04:14.459> before<00:04:14.820> the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
obviously this is done before the

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.729 
obviously this is done before the
overnight<00:04:15.299> run<00:04:15.480> of<00:04:15.720> some<00:04:16.109> of<00:04:16.260> these<00:04:16.350> models

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
overnight run of some of these models

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.370 
overnight run of some of these models
here<00:04:17.060> but<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:18.209> is<00:04:18.390> a<00:04:18.419> pretty<00:04:18.690> big<00:04:18.870> storm<00:04:19.320> here

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
here but this is a pretty big storm here

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.920 
here but this is a pretty big storm here
showing<00:04:19.769> here<00:04:20.100> on<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.120> European<00:04:21.510> model<00:04:21.780> then

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
showing here on the European model then

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.200 
showing here on the European model then
we<00:04:21.989> go<00:04:22.109> over<00:04:22.140> to<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.400> name<00:04:23.640> as<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:23.970> latest

Craig moving eastward just with a few
snow<00:04:37.470> showers<00:04:37.500> and<00:04:38.220> then<00:04:38.789> our<00:04:38.879> system<00:04:38.909> is

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
snow showers and then our system is

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.899 
snow showers and then our system is
right<00:04:39.449> off<00:04:39.599> Cape<00:04:39.810> Hatteras<00:04:39.840> here<00:04:40.729> see<00:04:41.729> right

here<00:04:42.180> just<00:04:42.750> a<00:04:42.840> few<00:04:42.870> snow<00:04:43.199> showers<00:04:43.229> coming

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
here just a few snow showers coming

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.469 
here just a few snow showers coming
through<00:04:44.009> with<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.250> cold<00:04:44.460> front<00:04:44.699> and<00:04:44.819> this

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
through with a cold front and this

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.059 
through with a cold front and this
system<00:04:45.659> is<00:04:45.840> picked<00:04:46.110> up<00:04:46.259> then<00:04:46.530> by<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.770> cold

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
system is picked up then by the cold

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.580 
system is picked up then by the cold
front<00:04:47.250> which<00:04:47.940> is<00:04:48.090> now<00:04:48.210> over<00:04:48.599> here<00:04:49.020> Thursday

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
front which is now over here Thursday

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.740 
front which is now over here Thursday
morning<00:04:50.069> instead<00:04:50.819> of<00:04:50.970> way<00:04:51.060> back<00:04:51.270> here<00:04:51.599> like

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
morning instead of way back here like

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.839 
morning instead of way back here like
the<00:04:51.870> European<00:04:52.229> model<00:04:52.470> has<00:04:52.620> it<00:04:52.830> so<00:04:53.340> this<00:04:53.520> has<00:04:53.669> no

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
the European model has it so this has no

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.369 
the European model has it so this has no
room<00:04:54.090> to<00:04:54.120> go<00:04:54.330> northward<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:54.960> that's<00:04:55.110> because

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:55.379 
room to go northward and that's because

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.619 
room to go northward and that's because
here's<00:04:55.979> area<00:04:56.280> low<00:04:56.370> pressure<00:04:56.639> is<00:04:56.909> going<00:04:57.449> to<00:04:57.569> be

00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:57.629 
here's area low pressure is going to be

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:59.210 
here's area low pressure is going to be
picked<00:04:57.870> up<00:04:57.990> by<00:04:58.050> those<00:04:58.259> cold<00:04:58.500> front<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:58.860> center

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
picked up by those cold front and center

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.189 
picked up by those cold front and center
apid<00:04:59.819> lee<00:04:59.940> northeast<00:05:00.330> it<00:05:00.569> says<00:05:00.750> cold<00:05:00.960> front<00:05:01.139> is

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
apid lee northeast it says cold front is

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.339 
apid lee northeast it says cold front is
pushing<00:05:01.229> it<00:05:01.800> for<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.490> Red<00:05:02.639> Sea<00:05:03.050> so<00:05:04.050> that's<00:05:04.229> the

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
pushing it for the Red Sea so that's the

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:05.420 
pushing it for the Red Sea so that's the
idea<00:05:04.650> that's<00:05:04.830> what<00:05:05.009> i<00:05:05.039> want<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.250> show<00:05:05.340> you

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
idea that's what i want to show you

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.189 
idea that's what i want to show you
there<00:05:05.759> those<00:05:06.360> are<00:05:06.479> the<00:05:06.539> names<00:05:06.690> don't<00:05:06.960> you<00:05:07.050> see

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
there those are the names don't you see

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.450 
there those are the names don't you see
what<00:05:07.319> it<00:05:07.379> does<00:05:07.500> it<00:05:07.680> just<00:05:07.710> picks<00:05:08.009> it<00:05:08.159> up<00:05:08.280> and

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
what it does it just picks it up and

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.420 
what it does it just picks it up and
takes<00:05:08.550> f<00:05:09.539> to<00:05:09.659> the<00:05:09.750> out<00:05:09.900> to<00:05:10.080> see<00:05:10.289> here<00:05:10.560> and<00:05:10.740> then

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
takes f to the out to see here and then

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.010 
takes f to the out to see here and then
it's<00:05:11.550> out<00:05:11.729> of<00:05:11.759> here<00:05:11.969> so<00:05:12.180> this<00:05:12.360> thing<00:05:12.569> is<00:05:12.599> picked

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
it's out of here so this thing is picked

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.180 
it's out of here so this thing is picked
up<00:05:13.080> by<00:05:13.139> the<00:05:13.289> front<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:13.620> absorbed<00:05:14.069> by<00:05:14.159> the

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
up by the front and absorbed by the

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.730 
up by the front and absorbed by the
front<00:05:14.430> taking<00:05:14.729> northeast<00:05:15.319> that's<00:05:16.319> still<00:05:16.650> the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
front taking northeast that's still the

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.770 
front taking northeast that's still the
most<00:05:16.860> likely<00:05:17.129> scenario<00:05:17.479> so<00:05:18.479> I<00:05:18.509> don't<00:05:18.719> think

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
most likely scenario so I don't think

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.119
