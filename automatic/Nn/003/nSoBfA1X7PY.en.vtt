university<00:03:37.459> that<00:03:37.670> has<00:03:37.819> a<00:03:37.849> combination<00:03:38.150> of

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
professors as does Baylor I really think

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.000 
professors as does Baylor I really think
that<00:03:46.099> the<00:03:47.060> small<00:03:47.720> classes<00:03:48.049> allows<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.769> to

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
that the small classes allows you to

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.490 
that the small classes allows you to
learn<00:03:49.189> material<00:03:49.730> really<00:03:49.849> well<00:03:50.139> but<00:03:51.139> also<00:03:51.290> the

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
learn material really well but also the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.440 
learn material really well but also the
large<00:03:51.680> pre-med<00:03:52.099> population<00:03:52.639> gives<00:03:52.849> you<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.120> lot

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
large pre-med population gives you a lot

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.000 
large pre-med population gives you a lot
of<00:03:53.480> really<00:03:53.689> great<00:03:53.900> resources<00:03:54.109> that<00:03:54.739> you<00:03:54.859> can

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
of really great resources that you can

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.580
