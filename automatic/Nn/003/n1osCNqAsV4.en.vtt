00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
we're gonna fix that we're gonna use the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.260 
we're gonna fix that we're gonna use the
last<00:00:43.320> time<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.860> first<00:00:44.520> off<00:00:44.789> all<00:00:45.090> my

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
last time you do it first off all my

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.209 
last time you do it first off all my
tracks<00:00:45.510> are<00:00:45.660> grouped<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.950> make<00:00:47.129> an

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
tracks are grouped so if I make an

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.010 
tracks are grouped so if I make an
adjustment<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.700> one<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.629> if<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.840> raise<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
adjustment to one like if I raise the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.510 
adjustment to one like if I raise the
fader<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.500> one<00:00:49.680> they<00:00:50.190> already<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.600> see

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
fader on one they already as you can see

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.720 
fader on one they already as you can see
put<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.640> back<00:00:54.949> which<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.129> important

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
put this back which is really important

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.889 
put this back which is really important
because<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.239> edit<00:00:57.420> these<00:00:57.690> things

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
because we have to edit these things

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.889 
because we have to edit these things
together<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.559> if<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.800> move<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.699> kick<00:00:59.910> drum<00:01:00.210> all

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
together so if we move the kick drum all

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.740 
together so if we move the kick drum all
the<00:01:01.140> audio<00:01:01.469> on<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.059> drum<00:01:03.059> set<00:01:03.270> has<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.600> move

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the audio on that drum set has to move

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.429 
the audio on that drum set has to move
with<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:03.960> right<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.250> over<00:01:06.150> here<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.930> your<00:01:06.990> track
