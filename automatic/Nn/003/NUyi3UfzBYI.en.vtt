00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 "Intestinal Wars: Sulfan vs. Butyric Acid" 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.049
 There is a parody of the producers' slogan: "Beef: We'll have dinner." 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.230
 "Beef: It rots us in the gut." 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.430
 I saw it once on a T-shirt with some friends 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.539
 and I allowed myself some verbal diarrhea - this is no allusion - 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.550
 and I began to explain to everyone how meat is 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.230
 completely digested in the small intestine 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.109
 and he can't get into the colon at all. 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.419
 It's not much fun to have fun with biological sprats - but I was wrong! 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.480
 It is estimated that in a typical Western diet 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.500
 can digest up to 12 grams of protein a day 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 and once they reach the colon, 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.940
 they can be converted into toxic substances such as ammonia. 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.920
 This decomposition of undigested proteins in the colon is called rotting, 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.789
 so a bit of meat can actually end up rotting in your colon. 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.969
 The problem is that some byproducts of this rot may be toxic. 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.430
 It is generally concluded that the fermentation of carbohydrates 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.059
 - fiber and resistant starches that enter our colon - 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.420
 result in positive effects for the host, 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.200
 due to the formation of short chain fatty acids such as butyrate, 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.310
 while protein fermentation is considered harmful to us. 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.799
 Protein fermentation occurs primarily at the lower end of the colon, 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.640
 where carbohydrates are already depleted 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.420
 thus producing potentially toxic metabolites. 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.770
 Maybe that's why we see more colorectal cancer 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.180
 and ulcerative colitis lower in the gut 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.799
 because this is where these proteins rot. 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.790
 The simplest strategy to reduce 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.680
 potentially harmful compounds produced by protein fermentation, 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.110
 is likely to reduce dietary intake of protein. 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.640
 But the accumulation of these harmful by-products of protein processing 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.640
 it can be weakened by fermentation of undigested plant matter. 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.649
 This study has shown that if you give people food containing resistant starch 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.869
 - it means starch resistant to small intestine digestion, 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.930
 to feed the good bacteria below in our colon, 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.140
 thus food such as cooked beans, peas, lentils, raw oatmeal, cold pasta, 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.549
 you can potentially suppress these accumulation 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.090
 harmful by-products of protein metabolism. 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.510
 The more starch ends in the stool, the less ammonia, for example. 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.170
 But there are also proteins in plants. 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.030
 The difference is that animal proteins usually contain 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.510
 more sulfur-containing amino acids 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.510
 such as methionine, which can be converted to sulfane in the colon, 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.030
 gas "rotten eggs" that can play a role in development 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.760
 inflammatory bowel diseases 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.950
 such as ulcerative colitis, as I have previously discussed. 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.260
 The toxic effects of sulfane appear to be caused 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.819
 its ability to prevent our colon cells from utilizing butyrate 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.010
 that our good bacteria make from the fiber we eat. 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.379
 So it's like a constant fight in our colon, 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.050
 between poor protein metabolites, sulfates, 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.680
 and good carbohydrate metabolites, butyrates. 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.890
 With human colon samples, 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.629
 that the adverse effects of sulfane can be reversed by butyrate. 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.870
 So either we can cut meat, or eat more plant foods, or both. 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.430
 However, there are two ways to form sulfane. 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.090
 Although it is predominantly present in our colon, 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.519
 as a result of the breakdown of these sulfur-containing proteins, 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.500
 rotten egg gas can also occur 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.060
 from inorganic sulfur preservatives such as sulfites and sulfur dioxide. 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.690
 Sulfur dioxide is used as a preservative in dried fruit, 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.480
 and sulphites are added to the wine. 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.159
 Added sulfur can be avoided by reading labels or simply choosing organic foods 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.930
 because in organic fruits and beverages, sulphites are banned by law. 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.569
 Well, vegetables from the genus crucifers contain some sulfur naturally, 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.970
 but fortunately, tracking more than 100,000 women for more than 25 years shows 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.739
 that broom vegetables are not associated with an increased risk of colitis. 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.860
 But because of the animal proteins present in canned foods 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.379
 a standard American diet can contain five to six times more sulfur 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.590
 than diet centered around unprocessed plant foods 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.480
 which can help explain the rarity of inflammatory bowel diseases 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.309
 among those who consume traditional wholesome plant foods.
