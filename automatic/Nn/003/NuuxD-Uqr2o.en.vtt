anywhere posted but what I have is a

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.330 
anywhere posted but what I have is a
verizon<00:00:25.640> galaxy<00:00:26.640> nexus<00:00:27.289> now<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.560> only<00:00:28.650> has<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
verizon galaxy nexus now it only has the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.700 
verizon galaxy nexus now it only has the
stock<00:00:29.880> battery<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.720> do<00:00:31.230> have<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
stock battery in it I do have the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.350 
stock battery in it I do have the
extended<00:00:32.099> battery<00:00:32.160> too<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.149> really

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
extended battery too but it really

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.100 
extended battery too but it really
doesn't<00:00:33.570> work<00:00:33.780> well<00:00:34.489> so<00:00:35.489> what<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
doesn't work well so what it is is the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.840 
doesn't work well so what it is is the
reason<00:00:37.380> they<00:00:37.469> say<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.829> not<00:00:37.980> really

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
reason they say it's not really

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.229 
reason they say it's not really
compatible<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.660> there's<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.770> little<00:00:41.640> lip<00:00:42.000> in

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
compatible is there's a little lip in

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.270 
compatible is there's a little lip in
the<00:00:42.780> edge<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.410> once<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> phone<00:00:43.980> sits

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the edge here that once the phone sits

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.360 
the edge here that once the phone sits
in<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.579> little<00:00:44.820> lip<00:00:44.969> kind<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.239> comes<00:00:45.390> over<00:00:45.690> it

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
in this little lip kind of comes over it

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.040 
in this little lip kind of comes over it
but<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:47.520> kind<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.850> just<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.180> soft<00:00:48.480> plastic

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
but it's kind of a just a soft plastic

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.979

the volume buttons and the power button
they<00:01:02.280> don't<00:01:02.430> really<00:01:02.579> work<00:01:02.820> too<00:01:03.059> well<00:01:03.530> but<00:01:04.549> i'll

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
they don't really work too well but i'll

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.450 
they don't really work too well but i'll
show<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> second<00:01:06.799> so<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.040> see<00:01:08.250> i<00:01:08.280> got

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
show you in a second so as you see i got

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.160 
show you in a second so as you see i got
it<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.119> immediately<00:01:09.390> like<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.750> volume

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
it in and it immediately like the volume

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.140 
it in and it immediately like the volume
went<00:01:10.380> down<00:01:10.530> all<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> way<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> kind<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
went down all the way but it kind of

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.600 
went down all the way but it kind of
just<00:01:12.299> settles<00:01:12.600> itself<00:01:12.720> out<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.350> then<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.740> can

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
just settles itself out and then I can

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.910 
just settles itself out and then I can
control<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> little<00:01:15.450> bit<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.320> only<00:01:16.470> goes<00:01:16.650> one

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
control it a little bit it only goes one

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.800 
control it a little bit it only goes one
way<00:01:17.070> or<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.430> other<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.390> doesn't<00:01:18.659> stay

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
way or the other but it doesn't stay

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.359 
way or the other but it doesn't stay
consistently<00:01:19.500> pressed<00:01:19.830> which<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> good

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
consistently pressed which is a good

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.039 
consistently pressed which is a good
thing<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.420> set<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.780> ever<00:01:21.930> I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
thing so I can just set it to ever I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.399

the phone sync up via bluetooth which

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.330 
the phone sync up via bluetooth which
then<00:01:51.030> goes<00:01:51.210> out<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.439> auxiliary<00:01:52.950> output

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
then goes out to the auxiliary output

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.760 
then goes out to the auxiliary output
that's<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:54.270> true<00:01:54.570> whatsoever<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.350> actually

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
that's not true whatsoever it actually

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.830 
that's not true whatsoever it actually
goes<00:01:56.009> straight<00:01:56.369> through<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.700> pogo<00:01:57.000> pins<00:01:57.240> so

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
goes straight through the pogo pins so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.600 
goes straight through the pogo pins so
