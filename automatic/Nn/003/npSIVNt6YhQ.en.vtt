00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.470 
lineup strategy this week we're offering
you<00:00:20.070> two<00:00:20.340> different<00:00:20.490> choices<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:21.150> mid<00:00:21.300> lane

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
you two different choices in mid lane

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.840 
you two different choices in mid lane
the<00:00:22.080> first<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> little<00:00:22.769> bit<00:00:22.890> safer<00:00:23.070> as<00:00:23.430> he

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the first is a little bit safer as he

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.550 
the first is a little bit safer as he
plays<00:00:24.060> against<00:00:24.420> two<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.840> our<00:00:24.960> other<00:00:25.140> players

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
so regardless of the outcome of that

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.179 
so regardless of the outcome of that
match<00:00:27.779> your<00:00:28.199> score<00:00:28.470> will<00:00:28.590> balance<00:00:29.010> out<00:00:29.130> a

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
match your score will balance out a

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.830 
match your score will balance out a
little<00:00:29.429> bit<00:00:29.640> because<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.179> will<00:00:30.330> do<00:00:30.449> well<00:00:30.599> and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
little bit because one will do well and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.810 
little bit because one will do well and
the<00:00:30.960> other<00:00:31.080> not<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.529> well<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.579> other<00:00:32.669> option

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
the other not so well the other option

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.880 
the other not so well the other option
is<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.360> bit<00:00:33.570> riskier<00:00:33.960> as<00:00:34.079> he<00:00:34.200> has<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> teammate<00:00:34.739> on
