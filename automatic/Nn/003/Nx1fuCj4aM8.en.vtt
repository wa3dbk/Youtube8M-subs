00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
oh man oh hey man I got it I got it I

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.530 
oh man oh hey man I got it I got it I
guess<00:00:09.960> oh<00:00:10.230> hi<00:00:11.010> today<00:00:11.969> we're<00:00:12.269> going<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.450> show

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
guess oh hi today we're going to show

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.250 
guess oh hi today we're going to show
you<00:00:12.750> how<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> computer<00:00:13.620> memory<00:00:14.190> card<00:00:14.400> works<00:00:14.670> uh

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
you how a computer memory card works uh

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.840 
you how a computer memory card works uh
I<00:00:17.750> don't<00:00:18.750> remember<00:00:19.279> how<00:00:20.279> does<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.550> computer

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
I don't remember how does the computer

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.800 
I don't remember how does the computer
memory<00:00:21.270> card<00:00:21.510> work<00:00:21.720> it's<00:00:22.560> quite<00:00:22.800> complicated

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
memory card work it's quite complicated

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.599 
memory card work it's quite complicated
memory<00:00:24.810> cards<00:00:25.080> work<00:00:25.289> by<00:00:25.500> allowing<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.039> CPU<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
memory cards work by allowing the CPU to

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.810 
memory cards work by allowing the CPU to
access<00:00:26.970> ram<00:00:27.240> through<00:00:27.689> distinct<00:00:28.080> hierarchy

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
access ram through distinct hierarchy

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.810 
access ram through distinct hierarchy
now<00:00:29.820> look<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:30.960> quite<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.260> easy<00:00:31.820> but

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
now look it's not quite that easy but

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.340 
now look it's not quite that easy but
it's<00:00:32.969> not<00:00:33.120> quite<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.329> complicated<00:00:33.690> either

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.110 

before<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.829> talk<00:00:38.040> about<00:00:38.309> what<00:00:38.700> makes<00:00:38.940> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
before we can talk about what makes a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.850 
before we can talk about what makes a
computer<00:00:39.540> memory<00:00:39.899> card<00:00:40.110> work<00:00:40.320> let's<00:00:40.649> take<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
computer memory card work let's take a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.170 
computer memory card work let's take a
look<00:00:41.129> at<00:00:41.280> one<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:42.649> there<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> small<00:00:44.070> board<00:00:44.489> with

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
look at one we there a small board with

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.290 
look at one we there a small board with
little<00:00:45.539> chips<00:00:45.870> honest<00:00:46.559> information<00:00:46.770> or<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
little chips honest information or a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.299 
little chips honest information or a
software<00:00:49.020> program<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:50.010> brought

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
software program is going to be brought

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.750 
software program is going to be brought
out<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.940> hard<00:00:51.510> drive<00:00:52.309> across<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
out of the hard drive across the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.479 
out of the hard drive across the
motherboard<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.570> right<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.530> into<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.219> memory

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
motherboard and right on into the memory

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.819 
motherboard and right on into the memory
chip<00:00:56.640> right<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.960> its<00:00:58.140> memory<00:00:58.410> slots

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
chip right here in its memory slots

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.000 
chip right here in its memory slots
these<00:00:59.340> memory<00:00:59.850> chips<00:01:00.180> actually<00:01:01.050> hold<00:01:01.289> all<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
these memory chips actually hold all the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.579 
these memory chips actually hold all the
software<00:01:02.609> while<00:01:03.180> you're<00:01:03.480> working<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
software while you're working on it the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.190 
software while you're working on it the
programs<00:01:05.250> or<00:01:05.610> any<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> things<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.110> you

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
programs or any of the things that you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.039 
programs or any of the things that you
actually<00:01:07.470> are<00:01:07.950> working<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.549> at<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.390> moment<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
actually are working on at the moment a

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.859 
actually are working on at the moment a
memory<00:01:10.619> chip<00:01:10.670> kind<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.939> works<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.689> our

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
memory chip kind of works like our

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.170 
memory chip kind of works like our
conscious<00:01:13.380> memory<00:01:13.830> whatever<00:01:14.460> we're<00:01:14.729> thinking

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
conscious memory whatever we're thinking

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.149 
conscious memory whatever we're thinking
about<00:01:15.450> what<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.659> need<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:15.990> do<00:01:16.409> where<00:01:16.920> I'm<00:01:17.130> going

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
about what I need to do where I'm going

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.660 
about what I need to do where I'm going
that's<00:01:18.119> how<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.420> memory<00:01:18.930> card<00:01:19.200> works

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
that's how the memory card works

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.149 
that's how the memory card works
information<00:01:20.670> goes<00:01:21.330> from<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.439> memory<00:01:22.770> card

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
information goes from the memory card

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.880 
information goes from the memory card
right<00:01:23.820> into<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> CPU<00:01:25.049> where<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
right into the CPU where all the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.460 
right into the CPU where all the
decisions<00:01:26.490> are<00:01:26.729> actually<00:01:27.210> made<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.689> memory

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
decisions are actually made a memory

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.520 
decisions are actually made a memory
card<00:01:28.500> works<00:01:29.100> by<00:01:29.729> thinking<00:01:30.329> about<00:01:30.479> whatever<00:01:31.110> is

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
card works by thinking about whatever is

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.090 
card works by thinking about whatever is
going<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:32.100> right<00:01:32.369> now<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.960> you're<00:01:34.380> working<00:01:34.650> on

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
going on right now if you're working on

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.149 
going on right now if you're working on
a<00:01:35.369> word<00:01:35.970> processing<00:01:36.750> document<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.650> you're

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
a word processing document if you're

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.670 
a word processing document if you're
making<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.729> movie<00:01:39.000> whatever<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.079> happen<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.560> be

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
making a movie whatever you happen to be

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.760 
making a movie whatever you happen to be
doing<00:01:40.979> at<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.490> moment<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:42.390> coming<00:01:43.020> from<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
doing at the moment it's coming from the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.130 
doing at the moment it's coming from the
memory<00:01:43.979> card<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.820> more<00:01:45.210> memory<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.930> you

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
memory card the more memory that you

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.910 
memory card the more memory that you
have<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.369> more<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.750> think<00:01:48.990> about<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
have the more you can think about the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.950 
have the more you can think about the
more<00:01:50.189> memory<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.000> put<00:01:51.270> onto<00:01:51.540> your

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
more memory that you put onto your

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.319 
more memory that you put onto your
computer<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.979> more<00:01:53.220> things<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.909> do<00:01:54.119> at

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
computer the more things that can do at

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.319 
computer the more things that can do at
the<00:01:55.079> same<00:01:55.409> time<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.549> how<00:01:56.700> does<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.909> memory<00:01:57.299> card

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the same time so how does a memory card

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.990 
the same time so how does a memory card
work<00:01:57.750> very<00:01:58.350> much<00:01:58.439> like<00:01:58.890> our<00:01:59.070> own<00:01:59.280> memory<00:01:59.790> works

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
work very much like our own memory works

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.149 
work very much like our own memory works
whatever<00:02:00.780> we're<00:02:01.140> thinking<00:02:01.500> about<00:02:01.590> right<00:02:02.130> now

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
whatever we're thinking about right now

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.910 
whatever we're thinking about right now
that's<00:02:03.119> exactly<00:02:03.750> how<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.079> memory<00:02:04.469> card<00:02:04.680> works

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
that's exactly how the memory card works

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.380 
that's exactly how the memory card works
now<00:02:05.189> if<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.399> want<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> know<00:02:05.700> more<00:02:06.060> than<00:02:06.210> what

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
now if you want to know more than what

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.109 
now if you want to know more than what
we<00:02:06.509> told<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.840> here<00:02:07.200> hey<00:02:07.680> read<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.670> footman

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
we told you here hey read the footman

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.810 
we told you here hey read the footman
