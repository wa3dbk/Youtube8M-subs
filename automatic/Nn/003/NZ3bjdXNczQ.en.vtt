00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
 We take a doctor 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:13.199
 moving to the chicken have found a 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.199
 planet very similar to ours 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.740
 at the non-polluted milestone three more times 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.740
 big that our planet 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.140
 and in what is possibly said there is 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.660
 a nitrogen sign if the second 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.380
 element is in greater quantity than the 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.300
 it could first be inhabited by us 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.239
 humans and would be the alternative 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.890
 degree submission when the comet the 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.960
 impacts destroying the mind alone 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.449
 page 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.300
 but when life is done here 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:47.360
 completely is unbearable and 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.739
 sustainable here is one of the many 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.739
 alternatives as we arrived 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:01:00.729
 at three years 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.540
 per second 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.770
 and the truth is the calculation but I think 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.810
 that with the technological and now the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.640
 speed is constant do not be cruising 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:27.729
 like 100 years does not delay a thing 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:31.369
 but you have to wait for it to come out or 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.439
 no but it is possible at some time that 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.390
 technology allows us to leave large 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.770
 distances in a short time or 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.080
 just how do you remember how 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.780
 appeared in the movie dune 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.320
 moving without having to move 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.940
 and then make alejandro hard and this 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.780
 extinction be 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.780
 that he had to kill Paul good cause 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.290
 you had to take it and with the spice milan 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.960
 the serious thing does not fail hey now you have to 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.500
 understand something if this planet is similar 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.869
 to ours and it's probably very much the same 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.360
 it may already be because there is 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.520
 creatures similar to us that is yes 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.530
 that there is oxygen nitrogen we feel that 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.670
 there is water in liquid state 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.310
 most likely they have 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.810
 possibly pollinated but yes but for 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.550
 the comets and that has developed 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.030
 they are a long time depend on the age that 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.470
 has some kind of unicellular life that 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.410
 over time evolved fact turned 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.810
 in something similar to the other 70 there 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.880
 now the evolutionary process prior to 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.170
 what are we seeing now or later or 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.730
 they may be exact they have developed 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.890
 along with maybe more than a meteorite and 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.590
 there are batam dinosaurs l 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.080
 well one thing we can not look for another 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.510
 thing else had time something else but 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.069
 now every and demand then there is 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.640
 complicated not everything can not survive 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:59.880
 oxygen the mother nitrogen of disks 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.070
 and with that all well the issue is that there 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.390
 water no no I'm not sure if by the 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.670
 fact of having oxygen nitrogen can 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.840
 good liquid condition but if you leave 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.580
 stress for a design I think we 're 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.060
 on the other side and there should be something 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.060
 similar 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.720
 the new planet then it would be similar 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.280
 to the earth could have some form of 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.940
 life is salt also today in the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.940
 press 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.810
 a finding is not minor is this 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.640
 discovery 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.550
 apart from bringing us that news that 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.290
 belongs to the present that what are you going 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.510
 to speak today of the last 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.300
 sightings chiles has only been 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.220
 transformed into a privileged place 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.030
 to see ufological phenomena in the 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.000
 heavens now this fact that happens 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.260
 more and more often is happening 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.840
 throughout the world the last 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.810
 sightings 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.569
 in all five continents 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.349
 all this in a bit more like 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.349
 example s 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:07.629
 mama mom tell me to be part of the school 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:12.069
 and with the feet that all that product the 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:16.109
 conspiracy site collaborating friend 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:19.289
 friends this gas ball and incandescent 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.060
 good if not no I have not gone to the side 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:25.139
 I had light in the reference 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:28.979
 and I'm granting santiago yes 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:31.370
 already they are and they are come chickens no 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.919
 we are going to lose before any phenomenon 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.750
 that will happen before the landing 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.970
 massive and that a little bit 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.650
 it's a habit to arrive and I saw it in the background 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.270
 of the reference that said try 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.270
 nitrogen to hydrogen and oxygen
