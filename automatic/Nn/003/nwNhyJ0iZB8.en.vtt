00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
lava feel to it the case itself is

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.330 
lava feel to it the case itself is
plastic<00:02:21.370> but<00:02:21.780> there's<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.900> coating<00:02:23.410> on<00:02:24.190> the

the<00:02:30.330> pattern<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.450> think<00:02:31.630> it's<00:02:31.750> really<00:02:31.900> cool<00:02:32.290> and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
the pattern I think it's really cool and

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.650 
the pattern I think it's really cool and
I<00:02:32.680> had<00:02:33.069> this<00:02:33.220> on<00:02:33.370> my<00:02:33.400> phone<00:02:33.700> for<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.000> long<00:02:34.330> time

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
I had this on my phone for a long time

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.130 
I had this on my phone for a long time
so<00:02:35.530> yes<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.519> cannot<00:02:36.730> publish<00:02:37.239> this<00:02:37.420> Poulos<00:02:37.870> but

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
so yes I cannot publish this Poulos but

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.890 
so yes I cannot publish this Poulos but
it<00:02:38.230> was<00:02:38.319> probably<00:02:38.709> like<00:02:39.360> 20<00:02:40.360> cents<00:02:40.600> is<00:02:40.720> ever

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
it was probably like 20 cents is ever

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.360 
it was probably like 20 cents is ever
enough<00:02:41.080> for<00:02:41.290> this<00:02:41.380> I'm<00:02:41.650> not<00:02:41.769> sure<00:02:41.920> I'll<00:02:42.040> put<00:02:42.280> it

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.240 
lot but I'm gonna say it the orange
because<00:04:25.450> not<00:04:26.080> a<00:04:26.110> lot<00:04:26.170> of<00:04:26.350> people<00:04:26.650> have<00:04:27.010> it<00:04:27.160> I've
