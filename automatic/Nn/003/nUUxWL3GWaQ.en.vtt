00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.060
 I come with a tutorial on how to do 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.639
 these three cute monkeys something easy and 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.429
 small that I love for my princess 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.490
 that as he still has a month yet 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.960
 they make me very pretty for her in the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.910
 little box down here I will leave you 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.680
 all the information of what they need 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.570
 to make these three pretty little bunches 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.120
 from the material to where they can 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.770
 get if you like you can do the 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.590
 slightly larger bows a little more 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.970
 small to your liking and also the smart 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.650
 you do not have to make the same measurements 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.480
 that I'm using but like in the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.040
 video I show you what are the measures 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.470
 that I use for you to like 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.360
 make them equal and let's start with 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.360
 this rosita that is one of my favorites 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.880
 I leave here the materials that you are going to 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.880
 need 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.489
 Do not forget to always seal the ribbon 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.489
 easiest way is with a lighter 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.270
 I'm going to start by aligning or erasing the 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.270
 three clips 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.740
 they can form them completely or nothing 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.299
 more the above as you like me 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.460
 in this case I'm covering them 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.200
 completely but they also change it 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.009
 times that nothing else because of the above is 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.009
 how do you like 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.950
 that's how I stay this to me 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.430
 I'm not ready to use it to make 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.430
 a bow tie 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.540
 let's do a fold this way 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.780
 yes 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.340
 we will cross the works with threads by the 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.739
 medium 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.760
 After giving it back we will return to 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.760
 cross in the middle 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.989
 and we will do the same for the other side 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.130
 let's tighten the thread while 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.530
 squeeze we will go accommodating the bun 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.870
 to our liking once we have it 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.190
 we assure it by giving it a few more laps 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.470
 with the thread and a knot 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.960
 for the center of the bow you can use 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.750
 whatever you want to me these issues very 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.550
 easy nothing but a ribbon in a knot and 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.180
 we stick it back with the stone 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.180
 hot 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.010
 pretty 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.879
 paquito you can wait as you like 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.390
 in his clip and we finished with the first 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.390
 bow tie 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.460
 this next one is the one I like the most 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.160
 and these are the two types of slats 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.160
 that I used to do it 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.730
 you can do it in the size I had 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.360
 you I mine I chose to do it the 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.360
 size of the brooch 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.450
 simply take the historical and 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.720
 use it from one side to another to make 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:08.460
 these segments will make a total of 8 not 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.460
 there will be 4 on each side 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.889
 since we have our 8 loops we're going 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:39.750
 to tie it with the thin wire or 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.569
 You can also use thread , I was made 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.789
 a little easier with the wire and you 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:47.819
 we cut the edges again the 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.610
 we sealed and I wanted to cut the edges of 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:53.180
 this in this piquito to be more 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.180
 pretty 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.740
 from here we are going to separate our ribbon 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.970
 to make it more beautiful and more like you 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.970
 whistle our hair 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.590
 again with a ribbon and a knot we are going to 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.590
 cover it in the middle of our hand 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.110
 in this case I chose to put the bow in 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.110
 middle of the arm 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.840
 and that's how I got this brooch now 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.220
 let's go with the last one who is also very 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.220
 cute and is this purple 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.650
 I used two 4-inch slats each 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.650
 a 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.820
 we put the edges together with our glue 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.820
 hard hot 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.210
 inside our ribbon in the middle we're going 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.400
 to put another droplet of hard paste and what 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.110
 let's put it together like this and we're going to 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.250
 Repeat the same steps with our 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.250
 next in stands 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:30.649
 once ready we go to our 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:33.709
 glue to stick them one on the 

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:36.639
 another one in a form of x but one x a 

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:36.639
 little more closed 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.630
 and again I'm decorating it with a 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.630
 knot in the middle 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.530
 and this I also wanted to stick on one side 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.530
 of the brooch 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.949
 that's it for this video I know that if I 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.260
 they try their bows they will also stay 

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:30.210
 very nice and do not forget to give in like 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.070
 this video if you liked it and share them 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.800
 have a friend with a baby that 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.840
 I can make this video, I invite you to 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.360
 go to see this next video how 

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:43.130
 make this cute bun and that's all 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.130
 I really like them in the next video
