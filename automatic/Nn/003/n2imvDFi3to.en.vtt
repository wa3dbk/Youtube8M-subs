00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750

come<00:01:21.960> with<00:01:22.229> black<00:01:22.770> laces<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.280> then<00:01:23.880> again

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000

people<00:01:24.330> last<00:01:24.659> year<00:01:24.840> were<00:01:25.020> bitching<00:01:25.320> about<00:01:25.409> how

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
people last year were bitching about how

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.490 
people last year were bitching about how
that<00:01:25.710> income<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.310> green<00:01:26.520> laces<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.500> really

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
that income of green laces so really

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.050 
that income of green laces so really
seems<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.770> Nike<00:01:29.130> can't<00:01:29.369> win<00:01:29.579> when<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.880> comes

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
seems like Nike can't win when it comes

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.359 
seems like Nike can't win when it comes
to<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.360> kind<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.720> stuff<00:01:30.990> um<00:01:31.619> but<00:01:32.070> i<00:01:32.159> will<00:01:32.340> be

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369

these<00:01:40.890> off<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.880> red<00:01:42.090> might<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.450> nice<00:01:42.600> too<00:01:42.899> but
