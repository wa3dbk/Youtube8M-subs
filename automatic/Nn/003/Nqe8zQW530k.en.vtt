00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.539
 to achieve this first clash 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.689
 for the time being 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:27.029
 Yes 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.720
 today 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.720
 but I imagine that this new series 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.680
 22 hours Saint-BeauzÃ©ly I was happy to live just price b 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.210
 runners like me 11 hours 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.360
 but in reality it's a new transport service on demand 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.120
 on avignon and more generally all powerful 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.130
 % to the peculiarity of this new service is that this is how it is 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.240
 available 24 of 24 7 days out of 7 years 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.040
 and for that and that prices are drawn 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.950
 very interesting rates for the pair arnaud costes jean-marie tulle 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.590
 call 0 892 42 00 42 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.840
 such an operation will take the position at the controls in progress 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.010
 m it's worth being in africa an rmp tells you directly how much in 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.300
 how many kilometers will you do otherwise you will pay 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.050
 there is no surprise no meter of a vehicle you pay 2 km departure 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.450
 the time spent in vehicles 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.450
 the municipality has already announced his doctor 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.100
 Yes 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.280
 in his report 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.280
 so percent of Americans was not easy 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.950
 so to get to the tgv station 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.420
 I see the heating after right now 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.540
 thanks the society the land of the season then reminds you to say in 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.470
 How long 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.130
 the driver arrives 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.610
 and you can choose to pay either by phone by giving your number of 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.050
 credit card either alone in the vehicle by tb system 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.390
 so that's a distance of 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.060
 the atmosphere km for the amount of 7 euros 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.350
 so the person 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.350
 so the person loses 1% and by credit card 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:11.969
 first reserved by the systems allow operators access 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.750
 just remind you before our race for them to confirm their for 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:17.319
 confirm the reservation 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.769
 so it appears there singer Dad arrives 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.370
 about 2 to 3 minutes in front of him under 18 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:27.979
 you are people 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:29.439
 it's missed 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:35.459
 but if the wicket today formulates enough available to 424 7 days a week dr 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.509
 been the operator who are there 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:39.089
 who are there to answer you 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:40.109
 I recognize 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.839
 always at the same point 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:42.899
 today 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:44.509
 as in its content 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.259
 while there was 5% 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:49.629
 thanks to advertising 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.120
 so advertising that is present outside two vehicles intersect 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.669
 total covering 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:58.489
 and like vehicles we have an embedded video system and 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.289
 inspired a little 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:04.679
 denis system new york is actually behind the headrests videos 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:08.029
 who plays video clips in a loop 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:09.190
 but what touches me 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.610
 on these regattas it's done we take German finances with a letter of 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.349
 transport in the vehicle so the places the customers in this sense 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.099
 in any case of arrival in advance it is also in person 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.789
 who did not book 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:26.599
 for a safety issue all of our vehicles are geolocated so 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.429
 that which makes that they were the operator calls in the vehicle 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:33.769
 the closest to the starting place men for in order to optimize all 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.519
 transport and to be more responsive 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.499
 and it's also for a security issue so at any time 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:44.349
 a driver who killed els segadors any problem whatsoever 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.869
 Cannabis started on the 15th of January 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:48.179
 2010en 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:50.969
 and we are currently 60 employees 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:55.139
 saturday and over 60 month cars to spend the time building we have ten 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.099
 cars currently 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.539
 outstanding especially says preparation 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:02.679
 yet consumers live available day and night 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:05.389
 this implies 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.139
 a fairly consistent name of people 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.789
 bischoffsheim 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.579
 the call center of people who ate a few people 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.699
 of setting up a supposed 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:15.590
 and then 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.039
 how does this distinction 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.349
 after matches 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.349
 that's why we are our own team of six people 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.620
 and the commercial part that sells the spaces as you explain total 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.849
 cover avoid embedded 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.750
 eric woerth we had the player everything internally that is to say after 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:34.809
 we have a graphic poet 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:37.870
 who makes models of the total covering that makes videos 

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:38.939
 embedded 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:42.139
 and then all this settled equal 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.169
 forgive not hesitated the idea came from 2 4% entrepreneur who we want for 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.229
 some worked in the event industry for a very long time 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.059
 long time 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:54.779
 we were confronted 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:56.779
 in euros for the lack of 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:01.509
 transport including yes the customer type difficulty what exists 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.520
 our customers I visited that it does not exist one is already addressing 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.680
 general nothing to people having 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.589
 a transport budget 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:12.509
 I had all the time 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.300
 control its transport budget cf vaduz finally the young people would have 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.349
 actually the weekend for his taste his tunnel 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.240
 are habitual clients and so many prescribing parents and 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.409
 especially in power their children who have not yet licensed the clients 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.419
 also said seniors 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.580
 I live a few times in very poorly served areas 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.159
 and not necessarily a big budget you appreciate what does not sound like a 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.999
 service to the person followed for his reach 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:46.459
 the driver is he made his hole and legally help him bring and 

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:48.439
 another race 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:52.210
 we also have sports associations on Sundays that do not have 

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:53.360
 their own 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.360
 minibus another 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.449
 also the cultural associations we worked well with the 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:00.589
 passengers then isolated 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:03.620
 for example for transfers the artist and evolution perspectives 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:07.269
 ten countries because we want to develop at the national level as 

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:08.909
 through deductibles 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:12.659
 so we already have some contacts at the national level who wants who 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:16.499
 wants to open their own fragility so it's a good 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:19.349
 it's on the right track for the moment 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:23.930
 and in the end there will also be a barbarian next center the recovery in order to 

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:25.669
 cover 20% of its value 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:26.889
 the Department 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.740
 all our vehicles euro the euro 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.740
 but the echo of them so for now waiting for lpg vehicles 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.270
 for a question of ecology and respect for the environment 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:36.219
