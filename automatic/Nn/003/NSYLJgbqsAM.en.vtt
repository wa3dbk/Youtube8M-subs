some people curb their hand around and
try<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> accommodate<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:56.820> depends<00:00:57.270> you

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
try to accommodate it just depends you

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.819 
try to accommodate it just depends you
know<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.260> your<00:00:58.859> own<00:00:58.920> technique<00:00:59.489> but<00:01:00.059> really

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
know on your own technique but really

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.549 
know on your own technique but really
figure<00:01:01.829> out<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.789> I've<00:01:03.449> spent<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:04.350> know<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
figure out what I've spent you know a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.590 
figure out what I've spent you know a
lot<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.159> don't<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> long<00:01:06.299> time

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
lot I don't know like a long time

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.719 
lot I don't know like a long time
working<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.110> project<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:07.770> realizing

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
working on a project and then realizing

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.460 
working on a project and then realizing
that<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.939> was<00:01:09.090> kind<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> holding<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.049> wrong<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
that I was kind of holding it wrong and

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.260 
that I was kind of holding it wrong and
I<00:01:10.530> was<00:01:10.650> beating<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.189> wrong<00:01:11.430> direction

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
I was beating in the wrong direction

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.820 
I was beating in the wrong direction
that's<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.990> something<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.320> comes<00:01:13.590> with

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
that's just something that comes with

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.880 
that's just something that comes with
practice<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:15.799> improving<00:01:16.799> your

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
practice and with improving your

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.030 
practice and with improving your
technique<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.640> by<00:01:17.820> by<00:01:18.299> doing<00:01:18.659> something<00:01:19.110> but

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
technique just by by doing something but

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.980 
technique just by by doing something but
it's<00:01:20.580> really<00:01:20.939> important<00:01:21.509> because<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.869> just

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
it's really important because it just

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.740 
it's really important because it just
makes<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.380> easy

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
makes it easy

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.120 
makes it easy
instead<00:01:23.140> of<00:01:23.230> a<00:01:23.290> chore<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.930> here's<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.800> little

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
instead of a chore so here's a little

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:39.630 
instead of a chore so here's a little
scrap<00:01:27.790> of<00:01:27.820> brain<00:01:28.240> tan<00:01:28.570> leather<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.890> I'm<00:01:39.250> going

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
scrap of brain tan leather and I'm going

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.180 
scrap of brain tan leather and I'm going
to<00:01:39.970> show<00:01:40.300> you<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:43.630> if<00:01:44.470> your<00:01:44.650> beads<00:01:44.860> are<00:01:45.010> loose

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
to show you I if your beads are loose

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
just put it in a bowl and then just

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.810 
just put it in a bowl and then just
scoop<00:01:47.920> them<00:01:48.130> up<00:01:48.250> like<00:01:48.550> this<00:01:49.290> okay<00:01:50.520> that's<00:01:51.520> the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
scoop them up like this okay that's the

way to do it if your beads are loose
just<00:01:53.920> scoop<00:01:54.310> them<00:01:54.550> and<00:01:54.850> if<00:01:55.300> you<00:01:55.420> have<00:01:55.509> more

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
just scoop them and if you have more

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.480 
just scoop them and if you have more
than<00:01:55.810> one<00:01:55.990> color<00:01:56.259> have<00:01:56.560> more<00:01:56.830> than<00:01:56.979> one<00:01:57.220> bowl

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
than one color have more than one bowl

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.130 
than one color have more than one bowl
and<00:01:57.880> scoop

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
and scoop

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.499 
and scoop
I've<00:02:00.040> seen<00:02:00.369> people<00:02:00.550> mix<00:02:00.970> all<00:02:01.149> their<00:02:01.330> beads

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509

I've seen people mix all their beads
together<00:02:01.750> for<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.140> project<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:02.770> then<00:02:02.860> they

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
together for a project and then they

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.840 
together for a project and then they
have<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.190> pick<00:02:03.520> out<00:02:03.729> each<00:02:04.060> bead<00:02:04.800> mm-hmm<00:02:05.860> really

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
have to pick out each bead mm-hmm really

your beads off of a hank just unloosen
one<00:02:13.590> strand<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.860> take<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.340> beads<00:02:18.580> off

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
one strand and just take the beads off

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.510 
one strand and just take the beads off
of<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.150> like<00:02:19.180> that

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
of it like that
