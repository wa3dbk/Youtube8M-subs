00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.379

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:32.629
 A little less 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:33.880
 Something teeth attend such a thing Well one over there Tteyuu Toka painful hit in the other run its 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.390
 Oh that 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.900
 Yes yes story well well quite the disabled NYA 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:46.750

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:49.720
 Also longer form check Toka the first time Do not in such a specific location in Maybe the same care 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.870
 Toka balance of the body of Tteyuu pain is coming is 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:58.399
 The balance is also more even fix and people Well it is in my 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:04.570
 Since there is often a place no longer out pain if we were from and the home long after this 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:06.570
 Thank you Yes My best in the You have to tell around the firm 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.570
 Hmm 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.770
 Let's check the form of Mr. Hashimoto from the side. 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.310
 Hashimoto who has a very good style 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.480
 Because I can not be aware of the bucky 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:27.850
 The whole view of the body is now one 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:31.240
 Energy upper body landed for the upright feeling has upward rather than before 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.040
 As a result, the top and bottom of the skin are intense 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.040
 I am pushing a driving force 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.080
 Then check from the front and the back 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.330
 Because I am not aware of the body axis 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:54.220
 You can see some flutter in your upper body 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:57.750
 Is there any difference in the flexibility of the pelvis? 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:02.810
 Looks like it's leaning a little to the left 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.810
 Let's fix these points in the workout 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.569
 Bach 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:14.060
 It's not such a strange girl 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:17.540
 Cormorant that I wish I was but you doing running cool because good style 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.170
 Because the pelvis moves differently between right and left 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.500
 In the fact that the left is a little hard and I do not feel 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.569
 Some people first 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.319
 It is important but 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:33.360
 It's fine, the whole view is not falling . 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.140
 Before the body feet If you're using completely 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.970
 To that issue 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:43.340
 Do you have lying before me the human body where the tilts before it are you and tried to run 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.850
 You run that utilized it 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:51.050
 It is selling to which side is the strength of the stomach at that time 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.580

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.950

 Do not put the power Come standing in the stomach 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:05.349
 I 'll hold my shoulders , so I won't let him down I'll leave my weight on my head or straighten my head 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.030
 I think so 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:11.860

 Yu' took 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.830
 new I knew that way of entering power 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.980
 If it falls down 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.370
 Hmm 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.370
 If you maintain it the angle at which the fallen Iiii 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.290

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.740

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.770
 I can not be had by all means water tank, two-one kicking 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.700
 Hmm 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.800
 There was a surprising weakness 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.980
 Twist is 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.459
 Do not move this head behind 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.580
 Please open all cars like 1st one 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.390

 Has been towards please gone to more smoothly root Festival please water was this is possible 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.480
 Switzerland points 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.020
 But arms behind 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.350
 Toward the back of the cow 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.580
 Say the axis is such axis there is no 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:23.830
 To create a shaft to the body because something has got moving doing this cat 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:25.290
 Tattattattattattattattatta The rhythm of the song was 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.360
 Niigata type 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.540
 Let's go in 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.639
 With arms, say so last spring 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.639
 My job is only where it turns after the rain 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:40.280
 Pizza and so on 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:47.630
 Yes I just say that Hashimoto does not rotate 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:51.150
 Nde like you Yes early so another version is people who chat stretch 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.310
 I'm extending the breakthrough in 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.020
 Body straight 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:01.310
 Kadomatsu supports with the left hand fist 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.120
 His here north ridge fist-positions that had kept the book value of the star 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.930
 And eyebrows Art 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.370
 Lower body 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.370
 That's right 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.380
 Is this display? 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.380
 Please be this 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:25.590
 Or Come feet's form would have been improved 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:29.289
 You can run in an ideal forward-looking posture with your abdominal muscles in mind 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:36.979
 Even if also the weight shift smoother now 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:41.000
 Just be aware of the forward- looking posture and you can see that it has turned into a beautiful running form 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:48.550
 So what if you look from the front and the back? 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.550
 Shake of the upper half of the body by the body of the axis could be firm consciousness is no longer the most 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:06:00.069
 Also, the flexibility of the pelvis has been improved, so the left and right are even and stable footing is possible. 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.069
 I will 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:14.230
 Let's compare the post-modification changes from the side 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:18.870
 The body turned forward and the point where the head came out a little was also improved 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:22.970
 In addition, there was a swing in the vertical direction before the correction 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.970
 I became a company with a whole body smoothly 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:35.860
 So how do you compare it from the front and the back? 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:42.510
 We wander the upper half of the body was quite healed by now be aware of the axis of the body 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:47.110
 Also you can see that the flexibility of the pelvis there is no difference between the left and right were up footfall 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:50.710
 I upper body and one half of the body is also linked is working properly 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:56.900
 Mr. Hashimoto who wants to try half marathon 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:59.740
 If you continue training with this form in mind, you can also challenge the full marathon. 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.740
 Please do your best
