00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.530
 or the people who give the one I met 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.870
 commenting and good that is what you 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.730
 I bring and today I bring you a glitch boom in 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.590
 transit as you want to call voucher in the 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.330
 that already known zombies are left 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.610
 blocked in one part do not go towards 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.710
 you but you get stuck in 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.840
 a part of the map and so you can kill them 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.369
 freely and fuck the games to 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.980
 your companions who have entered 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.010
 play smartly good the question is 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.660
 what's always this video is so that 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.180
 you comment what do you think for 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.399
 that you see it if you do not know it so that 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.470
 what you do in private games is worth nothing 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.140
 from that of getting into a public game 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.610
 online and fuck the other two people 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.210
 who are playing happily is worth and 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.500
 competitively like what to be and what 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.079
 is what they did to me is it worth to me 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.040
 they had there are two whores hours almost to 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.680
 get to 15 fuck fucking rounds worth 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.369
 but if I'm really pissed off what happens to me 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.380
 this to 15 rounds two hours my son not 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.790
 I know where they killed these zombies but 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.619
 I think they had them all the time 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.149
 circling or there waiting while 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.799
 the gods drank coffee or tea 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.080
 clean in the ass because it is not what 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.300
 I get it 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.490
 and nothing and you see that the shields are put 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.160
 worth the side and expect 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.320
 zombies come build up they kill them and 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.230
 over with bad weapons that is that if 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.700
 I say if you do this please 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.340
 do it in round 10 when you already have 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.620
 something good since they caught and killed 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.180
 from the wall and started killing zombies 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.620
 there in the corner I love doing 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.320
 this but in a private game and 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.900
 laugh and it will hit the 40th wave like this 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.640
 and it even seems fun because of course 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.080
 when I start it is draining the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.250
 delivery if they are going to kill you and good 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.080
 you return to the same position and 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.110
 tools to all you want is 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.700
 something that seems quite pleasant is worth it but 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.820
 to make a private game I have 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.710
 done in a private game with doubles 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.050
 controls is worth as you are seeing what I put 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.660
 in double commands because he was playing 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.090
 with my girlfriend as I always zombies 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.040
 I 'm bored playing alone and that's why 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.570
 wheat well like the previous 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.310
 I guess I'll put the description in the 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.130
 previous park for you to see it lidge 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.530
 book as you want to call it and nothing 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.180
 I hope you like the video is worth what 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.090
 I'm sorry for the swear words I'm gone 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.040
 a little bit the pot in this recording 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.040
 It pisses me off that they do this to me 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.930
 radio was a little bit very little 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.170
 for a while I start playing a 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.620
 bisbal option and I like zombies the 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.079
 I find this then it would be 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.680
 in the balls as two balls of 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:41.319
 basketball and I do not expect you to be able 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.359
 comments what do you think is worth I'm not 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.250
 criticizing what's worth I'm criticizing that 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.230
 they do it in public games badly in the 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.139
 Private games and I tell you until I 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.879
 that can be fun, you can 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.290
 have a good time because having it will be 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.010
 accumulating the killed to see here until 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.170
 what round 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.750
 you arrive without that without you staying without 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.609
 ammunition et cetera etcetera so no 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.500
 I hope you comment on the video you see 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.180
 that you will tell me what is your opinion and 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.099
 about it and nothing we see the next 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.749
 video I hope you liked a 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.749
 greeting and see you later 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.749
 action 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.689
 m
