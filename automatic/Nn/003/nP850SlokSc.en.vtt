00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.260
 but more than good I am very thank you for 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.110
 watch this video good more today 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.460
 I'm going to present this makeup that 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.820
 I think it's perfect for this 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.829
 Spring is super simple and is cover 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.199
 the makeup of the eyes on Instagram 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.640
 and many of you liked it and good 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.800
 because it made me perfect for this 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.780
 spring that is something that I repeat very 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.910
 simple very natural and I think that is 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.250
 perfect you can change in the 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.290
 life to the color that you want because 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.269
 that's going to give you more life a little bit 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.410
 more natural a little stronger 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.629
 you can play with the lipsticks 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.730
 but I think everything together as well as 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.710
 it stayed super well as it was 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.000
 I also stayed and I hope that 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.270
 like you, let's see the 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.270
 video 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.330
 using the easy or basic color of 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.670
 citi color number 4 and I'm going to apply the 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.880
 color like vanilla all over the eyelid 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.880
 mobile 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.840
 from the same quartet I will use the 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.510
 coffee color more clarito than for me 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.090
 it's like a brick color in everything in 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.550
 the whole eye socket with a brush of 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.880
 illuminator as you are seeing and as 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.880
 the color halo it like out 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.110
 to delineate the eyes I'm using 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.820
 the eyeliner in color coffee and 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.800
 well many of you ask me 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.020
 how is it that I kid and talk more 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.030
 detailed montse so everything would be 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.290
 very fast very good as they see it 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.810
 first thing I do is a line from the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.790
 half of my eye and I do it like a 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.900
 little bit outside and up and then 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.620
 like I make another line along with the 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.760
 end of my eye and fill the parts that 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.760
 they are without delineators 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.209
 if I do not explain myself very well please 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.459
 follow the video if it is helpful and 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.500
 then I make another line of lacrimal 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.650
 eye and not along with the first line that 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.650
 He says 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.680
 filling where there is no color and 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.989
 perfected to make it look really cool 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.700
 always super easy and more with this 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.700
 eyeliner that is almost like a club 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.159
 Now I'm going to apply some mascara on 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.230
 the tabs above and also on the 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.970
 lashes below is terrible I love 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.790
 because it is against water and leaves 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.140
 pretty separatist eyelashes so 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.500
 the word is super father you what 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.500
 I recommend 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.340
 to give a look like juice cited 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.540
 cool I do not know how he looks at the face of 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.540
 apply a little blush 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.819
 and to give more quality to the matter 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.609
 has made a little illuminator in 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.680
 the cheekbones also in the mosquito of the 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.680
 nose and nose 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.880
 arribita of the mouth locates in you 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.070
 in the bathrooms I will occupy this lip 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.660
 which is like a coral color , but as 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.030
 I said at the beginning you can play 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.710
 with the color of lips they want I think 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.690
 that this color is perfect for 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.690
 season I really like how it looks 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.020
 and so the makeup remains the next 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.449
 step is optional there is something that they want me 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.220
 for are the nuggets the nuggets and 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.949
 Do you really have freckles please do not you 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.870
 those charged do not get the ones that look super 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.849
 cute children with freckles look super 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.360
 nice and good because I do not have 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:42.740
 freckles I'm going to make up with a pencil 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.330
 eyeliner in coffee color very clear 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.330
 and I only do what they are like 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.330
 publicized jose the pencil I take it and I do 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.370
 as a circular movement has to 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.259
 be very small so they do not look 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.270
 false because obviously I do not want 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.650
 look like chilindrina 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.849
 just here as this touch of 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.469
 I really like stamped papers 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.779
 and obviously then you have to dry the 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:07.520
 symmetry and that they looked pretty and everything 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:09.459
 since you have them as well as where you 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.419
 you want to have it look pretty cool 

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:13.279
 only what we are going to do to 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.830
 give them a little more natural effect is 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.279
 blur them with the yolk of our 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.159
 fingers 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:21.589
 obviously you are not going to erase them 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:23.179
 we blend very well and in truth the 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:26.389
 effect I like very much but 

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:28.249
 I repeat this is optional and if you have freckles 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.669
 please do not cover them are super 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:30.669
 pretty 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.699
 and so it is like super nice extra is 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:39.199
 super easy to do i hope i have you 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.199
 liked and you encourage yourself to do it 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.310
