00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.610
 the brown gear is one of the most flies 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.760
 representative of tradition 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.920
 British and is still very much appreciated 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.810
 it is built by those fishermen who 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.060
 undermine the trout committed to 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.610
 to feed on various ephemeral species 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.760

 get us some of these rothery flies 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.329
 perform intense hatching in the month of 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.249
 March and are therefore commonly 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.679
 called brown marches 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:58.960
 hence the name of the homonymous fly

 artificial that limits besides to reveal itself 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.460

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.010
 march brown shows great effectiveness 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.440
 also in fishing in hunting especially 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.570
 if built on generous hooks 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.850
 dimensions that allow you to get 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.900
 burly flies is capable of 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.900
 entice trout 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.950
 let's start assembling the brown gear 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.190
 choosing one but a straight stem from 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.110
 measure between 16 and 12 e 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.620
 we crush his barb with one 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.560
 small pliers we insert the hook into the 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.540
 clamp jaw we impose ilbo 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.760
 miner loaded with a spool of 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.310
 mounting silk of brown or color 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.970
 black and we stop the yarn at the stem 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.890
 of the hook then winding it towards the curve 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.400
 with the scissors we decide the head 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.900
 excess of building silk from 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.340
 a rooster neck of brown color 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.560
 natural 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.890
 we select one of the long ones and with which 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.510
 found along the side margins 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.120
 we grab a bunch of fibers with the 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.370
 fingers of the left hand and tear the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.120
 from the calamus while we hold the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.160
 feather with the fingers of the other hand 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.350
 place the bunch of fibers on the hook e 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.380
 let's stop it with a few turns of the wire of 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.390
 fitting the length of these tails 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.050
 it must be similar to that of the axis 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.030
 of the hook from a spool of end 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.970
 oval golden tinsel 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.970
 we cut a string about 10 cm long 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.150
 we approach one of the ends of the 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.280
 cut the tinsel into the hook and let's stop it 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.070
 with the mounting silk on the point of 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.500
 fixing the tail to compose one 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.989
 in the aesthetically correct manner the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.140
 Selva team tied on the side of the hook 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.150
 opposite to ours with the specification was there 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.570
 we fatten a stretch of silk from 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.850
 construction we take a mask 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.390
 hare facial and tear off some 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.120
 hairs we distribute hairs 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.980
 on the greased silk and we rotate there among 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.790
 the fingers of one hand to form a 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.800
 compact cord we wrap in 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.810
 narrow passages from well to fur 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.420
 letters around the back two thirds 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.060
 of the stem of the hook trying to confer 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.000
 a slightly conical profile to the body 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.400
 that we are building we impose the 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.799
 clip for the acli and we hook her 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.799
 spout at the end of the evening team 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.260
 we turn the tinsel in large coils 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:49.590
 around the body and we form the rings 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:52.880
 these abdominal rings should 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.880
 all have the same breadth 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.530
 with the construction yarn we tie the 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:08.959
 tinsel in front of the body and eliminate the 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:10.640
 its excess we choose from 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.799
 same neck of rooster that has us 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.629
 provided the material for the queues one 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.930
 call that has long fibers around 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.359
 how much the stem of the hook we decide the 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.019
 basal portion of the feather 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.810
 characterized by a profile 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.060
 markedly triangular and we tear the 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.910
 fibers that cover a short section of the 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.160
 stump we approach the end 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.530
 bottom of the feather to the hook e 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.110
 let's stop it with the silk immediately in front of the 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:40.130
 body placing it with its inner side 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.080
 more opaque facing outwards 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.210
 we take the clip for a cole 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.050
 announce the at the tip of the feather of 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.940
 rooster we wrap the cola back good 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.430
 part of the front third of the axis 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.400
 I love trying to make good turns 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.289
 tight and without overlapping so as to 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.210
 make a collar with one 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.210
 Uneven uniform silhouette 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.600
 we block the feather just behind 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.560
 the eyelet and we eliminate his 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.180
 excess with the scissors we perform the 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.790
 cut so as to also remove 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.840
 those fibers that accidentally are 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.850
 been caught by the coils of the call 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.040
 from the neck or breast of the partridge 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.020
 we choose a feather that has fibers 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.560
 slightly longer than those of the call of 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.750
 rooster we remove the soft beards that 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.420
 they cover the lower portion of his 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:46.440
 calamus and we push back all the 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:48.960
 fibers of the central tract we approach the 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.930
 feather to the hook and tie it for his 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.330
 apex behind the eyelet placing it with 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.480
 its inner side more opaque facing 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.640
 towards the collar we decide the section 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.070
 apical in excess of the feather of 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.440
 partridge and hook to the lower part 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.130
 of its quill the spout of 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.560
 clothespin for the acores we wrap the 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:14.210
 feather behind the buttonhole and compose the 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.210
 front portion of the collar 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.640
 we block the calamus of the most but with 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.410
 a few turns of the assembly line e 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.410
 we cut his surplus 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.190
 let's pass silk by repeatedly 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:41.340
 construction behind the eyelet up to 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.800
 form a small head we impose 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.169
 the employer year and hooks the pier to the yarn 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:52.050
 to make some knots on the head 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:59.070
 serious demarcation molin and we cut the 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:07:01.110
 mounting silk in dye at the tip 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.509
 of the mounting lake in the paint for 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:11.820
 fly and distribute a drop of 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:14.160
 glue on the head the construction 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.229
 of the brown marches is finished e 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.220
 the trap is ready for the next one 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:19.220
 fishing trip
