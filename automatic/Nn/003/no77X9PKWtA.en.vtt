00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.690
 so today the investigators or courgettes count that in concluding 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.069
 we will need three putts 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:15.699
 200 grams of fresh cream 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:17.800
 50 grams of nov kango 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.720
 200 grams of shredded county a ball 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.029
 olive oil 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.029
 everything starts to prepare zucchini 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.210
 afro side flops 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.720
 to remove that part 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.850
 and preserve the particle that will serve us to hold the zucchini as a reminder 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.520
 conrad black zucchini finely 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.520
 with a re-entry other pretty coarse a big hole 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.890
 to find anyway some pieces of zucchini in the cac 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.270
 indeed heat a nonstick skillet in which 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.320
 novel to pour 2 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.530
 when one has it lightly that said guillaume incorporates the 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.930
 grated zucchini 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.410
 therefore the zucchini without coloration after about five minutes of cooking 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.880
 canteleu the zucchini 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.090
 will be almost all the role that the lot since its support and their 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.960
 mail 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.290
 stop it cooking 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.950
 a competition and one or two places is the pepper depending on the levels of 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.410
 each 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.820
 last step in the preparation of the designers 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.920
 at the end of cooking 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.220
 - and 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.700
 pouring a colander to listen to them 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.700
 in order to remove the maximum back this content 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.150
 we continue the recipe by breaking the four in a cul-de-poule with the 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.150
 crazy and we will beat them in the breach 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.290
 I understand their bloody revolt creamy thick 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.130
 the rooster between our 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.480
 fresh cream and good to meet our needs 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.480
 we can then add the cancoillotte 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.780
 after comco and others by incorporating the county 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.780
 previously grated 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.310
 we know we can talk about basic 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.480
 after disarming live 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.480
 we crush 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.019
 once they were translated into Polish as well as 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.879
 and we bring into play neither 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.199
 to recover our projectors 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.199
 who made the roux of vegetation 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.069
 and incorporate them at this time another device 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.139
 that's my part seems perfectly homogeneous 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.199
 that we will be able to invert in a cake mold 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.779
 that we canceled beforehand with the spring story 2010 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:49.979
 to form another texan for 40 minutes in an oven preheated to 170 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:52.349
 degrees 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.729
 you read the text well 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:56.409
 the text 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.409
 came out of the oven he bred for a few hours in the fridge 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:01.259
 we have molds 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:02.459
 and we can go to tasting
