 this for fantino 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.449
 it works like a great pyramid 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.449
 enke in whose region to pass 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.929
 but they are also more tropical magical fini 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.989
 of the region beyond a haystack contains the climatic zone they are called 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:28.769
 tropical 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.250
 because all the rest of films traffic 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.310
 but this tropical flame 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.260
 in the region 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.570
 affirms that they persist 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.570
 1 to 0 type this climate 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.260
 efe bread you had the desert 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.340
 in the Colombian for example, the guajira 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.300
 then to the tropical dry forest for example all eternity 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.890
 of the coast 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.550
 much the santanderes 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.960
 the valley etcetera are areas 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.690
 dry tropical dessert 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.410
 of government forest areas was a tropical bledo 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.799
 what are the groups that are that exist did not exist 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.780
 whole so inter-veterans the veteran b 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.670
 the g20 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.930
 and finally 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.650
 There are the forests 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.030
 Very wet populum tropical vials 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.020
 where the relative humidity is very high 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.020
 the street the amount of rain that another factor 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.230
 very important 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.590
 in this Beijing training more 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.460
 maybe very abundant 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.490
 at this point that the focus is considered to be perhaps one of the most 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.760
 hard of the world 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.940
 if not the most numerous thermal floors in colon 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.870
 what allows us 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.220
 suppress the temperature an area 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.220
 with respect to the height above sea level in three encounters 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.540
 this system 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.350
 you can only apply the military tropic due to its characteristics

 eurocontrol 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.359
 the previous Friday 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:11.289
 inside the thermal floors have been defined 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:13.929
 five levels of the miners

 the cold floor 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.430
 corresponds to the rocky areas

 covering 23 thousand square kilometers 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.559
 equivalent to 2% of the national territory 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.419
 it was located in the upper part of the atmosphere 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:27.879
 the glacial floor 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:32.590
 corresponds to areas with heights greater than 400 meters in height 

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:34.169
 above sea level 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.890
 presenting lower temperatures 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.659
 at 6 degrees 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:39.800
 this building 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.900
 a smaller area of ​​our country with less than 0 a spell percent 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.900
 these areas is characterized by low temperatures

 these two wealthy factors 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.339
 I believe that the lack of 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:12.339
 the lack of hygiene 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.650

 walden meet 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.970
 the data very important and for me the example decanting magnificent example 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.620
 the secretary of state 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.720
 I was interested in where he was 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.639
 from some talk that I once said 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:33.950
 Colombians are 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.939

 if we're at the box office we think it's yahoo was in paris 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:47.370
 and we copy for example

 in fact the tedh a lot of slope 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.039
 for comparing terror of the hammer the strokes 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.159
 the general director of the conade

 what heat each of the psoe 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.909
 the problem is that 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:16.909
 we are facing a motorcycle what we do not have 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.610
 but we do not look at what we have 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:23.539
 unfair to be said 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.129
 that is one of the 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:27.659
 magnificent wells of caldas 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:30.359
 I looked at what I had
