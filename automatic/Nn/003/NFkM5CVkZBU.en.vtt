playing quite smoothly although not at
the<00:00:33.840> speed<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.380> I've<00:00:34.530> seen<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.219> other<00:00:35.880> devices

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.040 

may<00:00:39.809> be<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> similar<00:00:40.530> price<00:00:41.690> but<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.840> still

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
may be of a similar price but it's still

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.639 
may be of a similar price but it's still
it's<00:00:43.320> smooth<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.360> much<00:00:45.360> less<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.989> almost

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
it's smooth and much less is a almost

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.709 
it's smooth and much less is a almost
real<00:00:46.980> time<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.910> know<00:00:48.000> maybe<00:00:48.120> there's<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.629> a

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
real time you know maybe there's just a

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.610 
real time you know maybe there's just a
fraction<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.559> second<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.700> delay<00:00:51.260> but<00:00:52.260> overall

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
fraction of second of delay but overall

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.360 
fraction of second of delay but overall
it's<00:00:52.949> fine<00:00:53.520> we'll<00:00:53.820> move<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.390> next<00:00:54.629> game

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
it's fine we'll move to the next game

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.540 
it's fine we'll move to the next game
which<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.489> called<00:00:56.699> beach<00:00:57.030> buggy<00:00:57.360> blitz<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:58.550> lot

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
which is called beach buggy blitz a lot

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.939 
which is called beach buggy blitz a lot
of<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.789> have<00:00:59.969> requested<00:01:00.149> me<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.989> review<00:01:01.739> with

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
of you have requested me to review with

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.860 
of you have requested me to review with
the<00:01:02.219> subway<00:01:02.820> surfer<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.329> some<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> other

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the subway surfer and some of the other

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.490 
the subway surfer and some of the other
games<00:01:04.229> maybe<00:01:04.559> I'll<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.850> future<00:01:09.500> so

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
games maybe I'll do that in future so

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.660 
games maybe I'll do that in future so
the<00:01:10.619> movie<00:01:10.950> does<00:01:11.159> not<00:01:11.189> lag<00:01:11.729> any<00:01:11.939> frame<00:01:12.420> as<00:01:12.780> such

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
the movie does not lag any frame as such

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.210 
the movie does not lag any frame as such
for<00:01:14.670> now

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.060 

so<00:01:18.760> let's<00:01:19.030> get<00:01:19.210> started<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:19.840> text<00:01:20.560> way<00:01:20.650> to<00:01:20.770> find

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
so let's get started a text way to find

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.680 
so let's get started a text way to find
their<00:01:21.280> dark<00:01:21.550> you<00:01:21.670> know<00:01:21.790> they're<00:01:22.060> solid<00:01:22.450> enough

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
their dark you know they're solid enough

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.660 
their dark you know they're solid enough
i<00:01:24.210> am<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.330> water<00:01:25.510> droplets<00:01:26.020> here<00:01:26.520> see<00:01:27.520> they

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
i am the water droplets here see they

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.980 
i am the water droplets here see they
look<00:01:27.700> real<00:01:28.660> enough

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.300 

again<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.080> can<00:01:35.140> see<00:01:35.380> that<00:01:35.410> it's<00:01:35.650> not<00:01:35.890> moving

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
again you can see that it's not moving

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.300 
again you can see that it's not moving
at<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:36.730> space<00:01:37.180> that<00:01:37.210> it<00:01:37.660> generally<00:01:38.200> does<00:01:38.920> in

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
at a space that it generally does in

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.790 
at a space that it generally does in
some<00:01:39.550> of<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.730> other<00:01:39.940> phones<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:41.350> it's<00:01:41.590> moving

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
some of the other phones but it's moving

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.310 
some of the other phones but it's moving
smoothly<00:01:42.580> there<00:01:43.030> is<00:01:43.090> no<00:01:43.210> lag<00:01:43.510> sj's<00:01:44.140> no

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
smoothly there is no lag sj's no

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.310 
smoothly there is no lag sj's no
skipping<00:01:44.620> of<00:01:44.830> frame<00:01:45.160> as<00:01:45.430> such<00:01:45.640> but<00:01:46.480> overall<00:01:46.900> I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
skipping of frame as such but overall I

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.300 
skipping of frame as such but overall I
think<00:01:47.980> that<00:01:48.220> you<00:01:48.340> frame<00:01:49.300> rate<00:01:49.660> is<00:01:50.010> just<00:01:51.010> a<00:01:51.100> tad

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
think that you frame rate is just a tad

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.950 
think that you frame rate is just a tad
slower<00:01:51.670> uniformly<00:01:54.150> across<00:01:55.150> both<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:55.720> games

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
slower uniformly across both the games

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.530 
slower uniformly across both the games
that<00:01:56.110> are<00:01:56.350> played<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:57.490> overall<00:01:57.820> yeah<00:01:58.090> smooth

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
that are played but overall yeah smooth

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.460 
that are played but overall yeah smooth
gameplay<00:01:59.310> thank<00:02:00.310> you
