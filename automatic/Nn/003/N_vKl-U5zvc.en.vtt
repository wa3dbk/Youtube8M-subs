in a solid form and the coconut oil in

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.090 
in a solid form and the coconut oil in
its<00:00:33.390> solid<00:00:33.600> form<00:00:33.780> that's<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.710> reason<00:00:34.980> they're

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
its solid form that's the reason they're

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.709 
its solid form that's the reason they're
used<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.460> chocolate<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:35.940> because<00:00:36.270> at<00:00:36.540> room

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
used in chocolate is because at room

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.600 
used in chocolate is because at room
temperature<00:00:37.230> they're<00:00:37.559> solid<00:00:38.070> or<00:00:38.250> mostly

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
temperature they're solid or mostly

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.090 
temperature they're solid or mostly
solid<00:00:39.030> I'm<00:00:39.450> using<00:00:39.840> both<00:00:40.110> cacao<00:00:40.530> butter<00:00:40.770> and

solid I'm using both cacao butter and

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.670 
solid I'm using both cacao butter and
coconut<00:00:41.430> oil<00:00:41.820> because<00:00:42.750> cacao<00:00:43.110> butter<00:00:43.320> has<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
coconut oil because cacao butter has a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.799 
coconut oil because cacao butter has a
higher<00:00:44.250> melting<00:00:44.550> point<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.270> melting<00:00:45.600> point

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
higher melting point the melting point

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.260 
higher melting point the melting point
of<00:00:45.930> cacao<00:00:46.200> butter<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.649> about<00:00:47.070> 93<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.879> 100

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
degrees Fahrenheit and that will keep

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.930 
degrees Fahrenheit and that will keep
the<00:00:50.910> chocolate<00:00:51.120> solid<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.590> more<00:00:52.860> stable<00:00:53.219> at<00:00:53.610> a
