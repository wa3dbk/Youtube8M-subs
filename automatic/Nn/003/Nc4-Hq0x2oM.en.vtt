 it's nine o'clock we choose in the cellar 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.040
 because the door has just opened 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.729
 action would give you a sign you want 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.729
 communicate with us 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:23.910
 let's eat short then you what you are there 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.220
 they called the monologues but we 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.790
 we simply prefer and it is lorrain 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.790
 warren 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.170
 but that there is someone who would like to talk 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:54.220
 with you at my house is happening 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:56.780
 something horrible is November 1st 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.550
 1971 I sit together with Caroline 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.589
 peron that he had with his family 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.540
 of supernatural experiences succeeds 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:06.790
 to feel something to render here is 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.790
 something horrible happened there 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.970
 what makes him feel touches helps 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.550
 people, but something takes away a piece 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.980
 at a time 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.050
 in here it is full of spirits and that 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.160
 what worries me most is that I feel 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.160
 so much hate 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.580
 we have to go there but not from here 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.240
 the dark entity would be enough to be bound 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.240
 to your family 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.590
 we have never seen anything like it 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.900
 I come with you I can't lose you 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.060
 there is a woman in a nightgown 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.170
 dirty I see my dreams is 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.170
 in front of my mother 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.890
 yes you can see it when the music is 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.890
 the mirror stops looking at it, the mirror
